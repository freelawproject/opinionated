Boise Mode, LLC leased space in its building to Donahoe Pace &amp; Partners, Ltd. (DPP). Timothy Pace executed a personal guarantee for the lease. During the term of the lease, Boise Mode remodeled part of the building for another tenant. After raising concerns to Boise Mode about the adverse effects of the construction to its business, DPP eventually stopped paying rent and vacated the premises prior to the end of the lease. Boise Mode then brought an action against DPP, alleging breach of contract, and against Pace for breaching the guarantee. DPP counterclaimed, alleging that the disruption caused by the construction constituted breach of contract and constructive eviction. After Boise Mode moved for summary judgment on all claims and counterclaims, DPP requested a continuance to complete discovery. The district court denied DPP\u2019s motion and ultimately granted Boise Mode\u2019s motion for summary judgment. DPP appealed from the summary judgment as well as from the district court\u2019s denial of its request for a continuance. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b152-15\">Boise Mode and DPP entered into a lease agreement (Agreement) in November 2006, under which DPP agreed to lease Suite 350 in Boise Mode\u2019s building at 800 W. Idaho Street in Boise (the Premises) from December 1, 2006 to May 31, 2010. Among its provisions, the Agreement contains the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-16\">[\u00b6 2.1] Landlord reserves the right to affect such other tenancies in the Facility as Landlord, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate and Tenant does not rely on Landlord\u2019s leasing to any specific tenant, or to any number of tenants, any space in the Facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-17\">[\u00b64.1] Tenant shall pay to Landlord as monthly Base Rent for the Premises the amount specified____ Except as specifically provided herein, there shall be no deduction, offset or abatement for any reason of the rent or any money payable by Tenant to Landlord.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-19\">[\u00b6 19.3] Landlord agrees that Tenant, upon paying the rent and other monetary sums due under this Lease and performing the covenants and conditions of this Lease and upon recognizing purchaser as Landlord, may quietly have, hold and enjoy the Premises during the term [of the Agreement] ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-20\">In addition to the lease, Timothy Pace executed an instrument titled \u201cPersonal Guarantee of Lease,\u201d in which he guaranteed immediate payment of all money DPP owed to Boise Mode under the Agreement upon written notice from Boise Mode.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>At some point around August 2008, DPP began to express its concerns regarding the construction taking place in the building and asked Boise Mode to address those issues. Then, in December 2008, DPP stopped paying rent. DPP remained in the Premises and the parties continued to negotiate regarding DPP\u2019s concerns about the construction, which ended early in 2009. Finally, in October 2009, Boise Mode notified DPP that it had three days to either become current on rent or vacate the Premises. DPP vacated the Premises in November 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Boise Mode filed its complaint in January 2010. DPP answered and filed counterclaims for constructive eviction, breach of contract, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. On April 8, 2010, DPP served its initial discovery requests on Boise Mode. Boise Mode served its answers to DPP\u2019s interrogatories, requests for admission, and requests for production of documents on May 10, 2010. The trial was rescheduled from December 8, 2010 to February 23, 2011. In accordance with the district court\u2019s scheduling order, Boise Mode filed its summary judgment motions on November 24, 2010 and noticed the hearing for December 22, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">On December 8, 2010, instead of opposing summary judgment directly, DPP moved for a continuance of the summary judgment proceedings, arguing that some of Boise Mode\u2019s discovery responses were insufficient. The district court denied the Rule 56(f) motion. The district court granted Boise Mode\u2019s motions for summary judgment and entered a final judgment on January 5, 2011. On March 2, 2011, the district court granted DPP\u2019s motion to amend the judgment, thus vacating its grant of summary judgment for Boise Mode. In its ruling, the district court found that DPP\u2019s motion was both a motion for reconsideration under I.R.C.P. 11(a)(2)(B) and a motion to amend under Rule 59(e). Boise Mode then filed its own motion pursuant to I.R.C.P. 11(a)(2)(B), requesting the court to reconsider this reversal of its earlier decision. On June 21, 2011, the district court granted Boise Mode\u2019s motion, effectively reinstating the grant of summary judgment for Boise Mode. A second final judgment was entered on August 26, 2011, awarding damages and attorney fees to Boise Mode and dismissing DPP\u2019s counterclaims \"with prejudice. DPP timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">This Court exercises free review over questions regarding the interpretation of the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Eby v. State, </em>148 Idaho 731, 734, 228 P.3d 998, 1001 (2010) (citing <em>Canyon Cnty. Bd. of Equalization v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., </em>143 Idaho 58, 60, 137 P.3d 445, 447 (2006)). \u201cThe decision to grant or deny a Rule 56(f) continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Taylor v. AIA Services Corp., </em>151 Idaho 552, 572, 261 P.3d 829, 849 (2011) (citing <em>Carnell v. Barker Mgmt., </em>137 Idaho 322, 329, 48 P.3d 651, 658 (2002)). When reviewing a discretionary decision of the district court, this Court \u201cdetermine^] whether the court (1) correctly perceived the issue as one of discretion; (2) acted within the boundaries of such discretion and consistently with applicable legal standards; and (3) reached its decision by an exercise of reason.\u201d <em>Blackmore v. Re/Max Tri-Cities, LLC, </em>149 Idaho 558, 563, 237 P.3d 655, 660 (2010) (citing <em>Lee v. Nickerson, </em>146 Idaho 5, 9, 189 P.3d 467, 471 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">This Court exercises free review over appeals from a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same standard the district court used in ruling on the motion. <em>Taylor v. McNichols, </em>149 Idaho 826, 832, 243 P.3d 642, 648 (2010) (quoting <em>Curlee v. Kootenai Cnty. Fire &amp; Rescue, </em>148 Idaho 391, 394, 224 P.3d 458, 461 (2008)). Under that standard, summary judgment is proper if \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d I.R.C.P. 56(c). \u201cIf there is no genuine issue of material fact, only a question of law remains, over which this Court exercises free review.\u201d <em>Cristo Viene Pentecostal Church v. Paz, </em>144 Idaho 304, 307, 160 P.3d 743, 746 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">The party initially bringing the motion has the burden to prove that no genuine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>issues of material fact exist and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Indian Springs LLC v. Indian Springs Land Inn, LLC, </em>147 Idaho 737, 746, 215 P.3d 457, 466 (2009) (citing <em>Cajferty n Dep\u2019t of Transp., Din of Motor Vehicle Sens., </em>144 Idaho 324, 327, 160 P.3d 763, 766 (2007)). After the moving party meets this burden, \u201cthe burden shifts to the nonmoving party to show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Asbury Park, LLC v. Greenbriar Estate Homeowners\u2019 Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>152 Idaho 338, 343-44, 271 P.3d 1194, 1199-1200 (2012) (quoting <em>Chandler v. Hayden, </em>147 Idaho 765, 769, 215 P.3d 485, 489 (2009)). This Court will \u201cconstrue the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, drawing all reasonable inferences in that party\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Jenkins n Boise Cascade Corp., </em>141 Idaho 233, 238, 108 P.3d 380, 385 (2005) (citing <em>Thompson n Pike, </em>125 Idaho 897, 899, 876 P.2d 595, 597 (1994)). However, \u201cthe adverse party may not rest upon mere allegations in the pleadings, but must set forth by affidavit specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Curlee, </em>148 Idaho at 394-95, 224 P.3d at 461-62 (quoting <em>Rhodehouse v. Stutts, </em>125 Idaho 208, 211, 868 P.2d 1224, 1227 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">A. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying DPP\u2019s continuance motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">DPP argues that the district court\u2019s denial of its Rule 56(f) motion for a continuance was an abuse of discretion because motions for continuance under this rule are generally favored and the court\u2019s reason for its denial was inconsistent with the legal standard for considering a request for a continuance. Boise Mode contends that the court acted within its discretion because DPP did not properly justify its motion by demonstrating the relevance and necessity of the additional discovery it sought. We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">A motion for summary judgment is decided based upon the \u201cpleadings, depositions, and admissions on file,\u201d along with any supporting affidavits. I.R.C.P. 56(c). Thus, the standard contemplates the existence of an adequate record and it follows that a party opposing summary judgment must be afforded an adequate opportunity to conduct discovery to make that record. <em>See Doe v. Abington Friends Sch., </em>480 F.3d 252, 257 (3d Cir.2007) (citing <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, </em>477 U.S. 242, 257, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2514-15, 91 L.Ed.2d 202, 217 (1986)). Under the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure, the district court may grant a continuance to allow additional time for a party resisting summary judgment to obtain affidavits in opposition to the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party\u2019s opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">I.R.C.P. <em>56(f). </em>However, this Court has explained that when seeking a continuance under Rule 56(f), the moving party \u201cmust \u2018do so <em>in good faith </em>by affirmatively demonstrating why he cannot respond to a movant\u2019s affidavits ... and how postponement of a ruling on the motion will enable him, by discovery or other means, to rebut the movant\u2019s showing of the absence of a genuine issue of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jenkins v. Boise Cascade Corp., </em>141 Idaho 233, 239, 108 P.3d 380, 386 (2005) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Allen v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., </em>81 F.3d 793, 797 (8th Cir.1996)). The Court also explained that the movant \u201chas the burden of setting out \u2018what further discovery would reveal that is essential to justify their opposition,\u2019 making clear \u2018what information is sought and how it would preclude summary judgment.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Nicholas v. Wallenstein, 266 F.3d 1083, </em>1088-89 (9th Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">In <em>Jenkins, </em>the plaintiff requested additional time to respond to a motion for summary judgment because the case was complex and there were outstanding requests for written discovery and depositions. <em>Id. </em>at 238, 108 P.3d at 385. In the supporting affidavit, the plaintiffs attorney stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>\u201che believed the discovery would produce additional documents and testimony supporting the Jenkins\u2019 theories, and that he required the opportunity to use the responses and testimony in additional discovery in order to thoroughly respond to summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion because \u201cthe affidavit ... did not specify what discovery was needed\u201d to properly respond to the summary judgment motion, \u201cand did not set forth how the evidence he expected to gather through further discovery would be relevant to preclude summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239,108 P.3d at 386. Similarly, in <em>Taylor v. AIA Services Corporation, </em>the district court denied a plaintiffs Rule 56(f) motion for additional time to conduct discovery. 151 Idaho 552, 572, 261 P.3d 829, 849 (2011). The court ruled that the plaintiff had more than a year to conduct discovery and that the motion did not set forth what relevant information the plaintiff needed or provide a \u201creasonable basis to believe additional discovery will produce new or relevant information not previously disclosed____\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court affirmed the district court\u2019s decision, noting that the plaintiff had failed to rebut \u201cthe district court\u2019s finding that he failed to point to any information or document that may be relevant to\u201d his opposition to the motion for summary judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The purpose of Rule 56(f) is to ensure that the non-moving party has adequate time to conduct necessary discovery. This case presents an issue not previously addressed by our earlier decisions regarding Rule 56(f), specifically, whether the trial court may consider a party\u2019s lack of diligence in pursuing discovery prior to the motion. The Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure are to be \u201cliberally construed to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding.\u201d I.R.C.P. 1. Parties have a significant interest in the timely and economical resolution of legal disputes. Indeed, art. I, \u00a7 18 of the Idaho Constitution requires the courts of this state to provide \u201ca speedy remedy\u201d to aggrieved parties and to administer justice without delay. We hold that the legal standard governing the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion when deciding a Rule 56(f) motion permits consideration of the moving party\u2019s previous lack of diligence in pursuing discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">In this case, DPP served its initial discovery requests on Boise Mode on April 8, 2010. Boise Mode served its answers to DPP\u2019s interrogatories, requests for admission, and requests for production of documents on May 10, 2010. The trial was scheduled for February 23, 2011, and the district court\u2019s order setting the trial proceedings provided that the last day to initiate discovery would be 60 days prior to trial and that all motions, specifically including those for summary judgment, were to be heard no later than 60 days before trial. In accordance with the district court\u2019s scheduling order, Boise Mode filed its summary judgment motions on November 24, 2010 and noticed the hearing for December 22, 2010, which was 63 days before the scheduled trial. On December 8, 2010, more than six months after receiving Boise Mode\u2019s discovery responses, and just 17 days prior to the discovery cut-off, DPP moved for a continuance, arguing that some of Boise Mode\u2019s discovery responses were insufficient.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court, noting its discretion, denied the Rule 56(f) motion on the ground that \u201cDPP and Pace did not provide sufficient reasoning as to why six months intervened between the receipt of initial discovery answers[,] which they allege were unsatisfactory[,] and any attempt to discover additional relevant information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">The record does not contain any indication that DPP objected to the sufficiency of Boise Mode\u2019s discovery responses prior to the summary judgment motions. Counsel for Boise Mode avers that between May 10, 2010 and December 8, 2010, he received no communication from DPP expressing any dissatisfaction with Boise Mode\u2019s responses. As evidenced by these facts, DPP had Boise Mode\u2019s discovery responses for more than six months before Boise Mode moved for sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>mary judgment. In the affidavit supporting DPP\u2019s continuance motion, counsel sets forth the information it seeks and supports its request with an explanation of how the information is essential to justify its opposition to Boise Mode\u2019s summary judgment motions. While the justification is more detailed than in <em>Jenkins, </em>DPP gives no explanation for the six-month delay in attempting to obtain the desired discovery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As this Court held in <em>Jenkins, </em>a district court does not abuse its discretion in denying a Rule 56(f) motion if it \u201crecognized it had the discretion to deny the motion, articulated the reasons for so doing and exercised reason in making the decision.\u201d 141 Idaho at 239, 108 P.3d at 386. Here, the district court recognized its discretion and announced its rationale for the denial by an exercise of reason. The articulated reasons are consistent with the policies underlying the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure, including Rule 56(f). Consequently, we hold that the district court\u2019s denial of DPP\u2019s motion was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">B. The district court did not err in hearing Boise Mode\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">DPP asserts that the district court erred in \u201cconsidering and ruling on\u201d the motion for reconsideration because the order was entered pursuant to DPP\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion and, under the plain language of Rule 11(a)(2)(B), the court cannot reconsider orders entered pursuant to Rule 59(e). Boise Mode replies that DPP\u2019s interpretation of Rule 11(a)(2)(B) is incorrect and that the rule does not preclude its motion in this case. In the alternative, Boise Mode contends that even if DPP\u2019s interpretation is correct, the district court ruled that DPP\u2019s motion was both a Rule 59(e) motion to amend the judgment and a Rule 11(a)(2)(B) motion to reconsider the original order granting summary judgment and therefore, its motion is not precluded as to DPP\u2019s Rule 11(a)(2)(B) motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We hold that the district court did not err in reconsidering Boise Mode\u2019s motion for summary judgment because the district court\u2019s original judgment was vacated upon its order granting DPP\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">The issue on appeal is whether the district court was permitted to hear Boise Mode\u2019s motion under Rule 11(a)(2)(B). Thus, the question turns upon the interpretation of the Rules of Civil Procedure, which is \u201ca matter of law over which this Court has free review.\u201d <em>Eby v. State, </em>148 Idaho 731, 734, 228 P.3d 998, 1001 (2010) (citing <em>Canyon Cnty. Bd. of Equalization v. Amalgamated Sugar Co., </em>143 Idaho 58, 60, 137 P.3d 445, 447 (2006)). In full, Rule 11(a)(2)(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-10\">A motion for reconsideration of any interlocutory orders of the trial court may be made at any time before the entry of final judgment but not later than fourteen (14) days after the entry of the final judgment. A motion for reconsideration of any order of the trial court made after entry of final judgment may be filed within fourteen (14) days from the entry of such order; provided, there shall be no motion for reconsideration of an order of the trial court entered on any motion filed under Rules 50(a), 52(b), 55(e), 59(a), 59(e), 59.1, 60(a), or 60(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">Considering the plain language of the rule and its structure, there are two different kinds of orders that may be reviewed. The first sentence permits a court to reconsider interlocutory orders any time prior to entry of final judgment and the second sentence bars the court\u2019s reconsideration of orders that are made 1) after entry of final judgment, and 2) pursuant to a party\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion. \u201cThis Court has repeatedly held that I.R.C.P. 11(a)(2)(B) provides a district court with authority to reconsider and vacate interlocutory orders so long as final judgment has not been entered.\u201d <em>Elliott v. Darwin Neibaur Farms, </em>138 Idaho 774, 785, 69 P.3d 1035, 1046 (2003) (citing <em>Telford v. Neib</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number><em>aur, </em>130 Idaho 932, 950 P.2d 1271 (1998); <em>Sammis v. Magnetek, Inc., </em>130 Idaho 342, 346, 941 P.2d 314, 318 (1997); <em>Farmers Natl. Bank v. Shirey, </em>126 Idaho 63, 878 P.2d 762 (1994)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">An interlocutory order is one that \u201crelates to some intermediate matter in the case; any order other than a final order.\u201d <em>Williams v. State, Bd. of Real Estate Appraisers, </em>149 Idaho 675, 678, 239 P.3d 780, 783 (2010) (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1123 (7th ed.1999)); <em>see also Newell v. Newell, </em>77 Idaho 355, 362, 293 P.2d 663, 667 (1956) (\u201cInterlocutory means provisional, only temporary, not final; not a final decision of the whole controversy; made or done during the progress of an action: intermediate order.\u201d); <em>Evans State Bank v. Skeen, </em>30 Idaho 703, 167 P. 1165, 1166 (1917) (\u201cA judgment, order, or decree which is intermediate or incomplete and, while it settles some of the rights of the parties, leaves something remaining to be done in the adjudication of their substantial rights in the case by the court entertaining jurisdiction of the same, is interlocutory.\u201d). Thus, an interlocutory order is an order that is temporary in nature or does not completely adjudicate the parties\u2019 dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In this case, the order that Boise Mode moved the district court to reconsider was the order of March 2, 2011. The effect of the court\u2019s March 2 order was to reverse the original grant of summary judgment in favor of Boise Mode and vacate the judgment in its favor, thus recommencing the litigation. Because the March 2 order was not a final order and its entry did not complete the adjudication of the parties\u2019 rights, it was an interlocutory order. In the absence of a final judgment, it was proper for the district court to revisit the merits of Boise Mode\u2019s prior summary judgment motion. We therefore hold that Boise Mode\u2019s motion for reconsideration was permissible under Rule 11(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">C. The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Boise Mode was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">DPP argues that material questions of fact exist as to whether Boise Mode breached the contract prior to DPP withholding rent. DPP contends that if Boise Mode breached, any breach on its part is excused and therefore summary judgment was improper both as to Boise Mode\u2019s claims and its own counterclaim. Boise Mode responds that the Agreement\u2019s language does not permit DPP to withhold rent for any reason. Thus, Boise Mode argues, summary judgment was proper on its claims because DPP\u2019s nonperformance was not excused. Boise Mode also contends that summary judgment was proper as to the counterclaims because it is undisputed that DPP stopped paying rent before vacating and a tenant cannot maintain an action for constructive eviction unless it is current on rent payments. Further, Boise Mode contends that the other counterclaims depend on the constructive eviction counterclaim and thus fail as well. We hold that summary judgment was proper as to both Boise Mode\u2019s claims and DPP\u2019s counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">\u201cFreedom of contract is a fundamental concept underlying the law of contracts.\u201d <em>Jesse v. Lindsley, </em>149 Idaho 70, 75, 233 P.3d 1, 6 (2008) (citing <em>Rawlings v. Layne &amp; Bowler Pump Co., </em>93 Idaho 496, 499, 465 P.2d 107,110 (1970)). Thus, parties may draft a contract to avoid some duties and liabilities that would normally be part of the contractual relationship. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Anderson &amp; Nafziger v. G.T. Newcomb, Inc., </em>100 Idaho 175, 178, 595 P.2d 709, 712 (1979)). However, these exculpatory provisions are generally disfavored and courts therefore strictly construe them \u201cagainst the person relying on them, especially when that person is the preparer of the document.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court has held that provisions purporting to excuse liability \u201cmust speak clearly and directly to the conduct to be immunized from liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, a party may eliminate or restrict its liability under a contract if the language is unambiguous as to the nature of the excused liability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>When interpreting a written contract, this Court \u201cbegins with the language of the contract itself.\u201d <em>Cristo Viene Pentecostal Church v. Paz, </em>144 Idaho 304, 308, 160 P.3d 743, 747 (2007) (quoting <em>Independence Lead Mines Co. v. Hecla Mining Co., </em>143 Idaho 22, 26, 137 P.3d 409, 413 (2006)). If a contract\u2019s language is unambiguous, \u201cthen its meaning and legal effect must be determined from its words.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Shawver v. Huckleberry Estates, LLC, </em>140 Idaho 354, 361, 93 P.3d 685, 692 (2004)). An ambiguous contract is one that is \u201creasonably subject to conflicting interpretations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lamprecht v. Jordan, LLC, </em>139 Idaho 182, 185, 75 P.3d 743, 746 (2003)). \u201cDetermining whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law over which this Court exercises free review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Lamprecht, </em>139 Idaho at 185, 75 P.3d at 746). Unless the facts are undisputed, the existence of a breach is generally a question of fact. <em>Borah v. McCandless, </em>147 Idaho 73, 79, 205 P.3d 1209, 1215 (2009) (citing 23 Richard A. Lord, <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 63:15 (4th ed.2002); 17A Am.Jur.2d <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 591).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">In this case, the material facts are undisputed. The factual basis is the same for both Boise Mode\u2019s claims and DPP\u2019s counterclaims. The parties entered into a lease agreement in 2006 that was to run from December 1, 2006 to May 31, 2010. Boise Mode was performing some construction on the building during the first part of that term, but the construction was complete sometime before June 2009. In December 2008, DPP stopped paying rent. After the parties failed to resolve their differences, DPP vacated the premises in November 2009 and made no further rent payments. Therefore, we turn to the language of the contract to determine whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to DPP\u2019s claims of breach and constructive eviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The relevant contract language is unambiguous. The Agreement provides in section 4.1: \u201cExcept as specifically provided herein, there shall be <em>no deduction, offset or abatement for any reason of the rent </em>or any money payable by Tenant to Landlord.\u201d Additionally, the Agreement places conditions upon DPP\u2019s right to quiet enjoyment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">Landlord agrees that Tenant, <em>upon paying the rent and other monetary sums due under this Lease and performing the covenants and conditions of this Lease and upon recognizing purchaser as Landlord, </em>may quietly have, hold and enjoy the Premises during the term hereof; subject, however, to loss by casualty and all restrictions and covenants contained or referred to in this Lease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">(emphasis added). Thus, DPP validly contracted away its right to withhold rent and conditioned its right to quiet enjoyment upon keeping rent payments current.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Under the unambiguous language of the contract, DPP breached the contract by withholding rent in violation of \u00b6 4.1 of the Agreement and thereby violated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by denying Boise Mode the benefit of receiving rent. Likewise, the personal guarantee provides that Pace guarantees \u201cpayment when due, or upon demand after the due date, all obligations and the full amount of money that Tenant now or in the future owes Landlord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>arising under or relating to the Lease ...\u201d and that \u201c[i]f Tenant shall fail to pay all or any part of the Liabilities when due, ... [Pace] will pay to the Landlord the full amount of the Liabilities____\u201d Therefore, because DPP owes Boise Mode for its breach, and Pace has not paid in its place, he has breached the guarantee. Therefore we hold that summary judgment is proper as to Boise Mode\u2019s affirmative claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">DPP\u2019s counterclaims are also premised upon Boise Mode\u2019s alleged breach and the resulting denial of the contractual benefits. However, as explained above, the contract language conditioned DPP\u2019s right of quiet enjoyment upon its payment of rent. Therefore, because it is undisputed that DPP failed to pay rent as required by the contract, summary judgment is also appropriate regarding DPP\u2019s counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">D. Boise Mode is entitled to attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Boise Mode seeks attorney fees on appeal pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 12-120(3) and \u00a7 12-121 and pursuant to the terms of the lease and personal guarantee. The Agreement provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">22.7 COST OF SUIT. If Tenant or Landlord shall bring any action for any relief against the other, declaratory or otherwise, arising out of this Lease, including any suit by Landlord for the recovery of rent or possession of the Premises, the losing party shall pay the successful party a reasonable sum for attorneys\u2019 fees which shall be deemed to have accrued on the commencement of such action and shall be paid whether or not such action is prosecuted to judgment____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">The personal guarantee similarly provides that in a proceeding against a guarantor, \u201cthe prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and costs.... \u201d Thus, because Boise Mode is the prevailing party, it is entitled to attorney fees on appeal under the terms of both the Agreement and the guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">We affirm the district court\u2019s order denying DPP\u2019s request for a continuance and its order granting Boise Mode\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Additionally, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment granting summary judgment in favor of Boise Mode with respect to both its claims and DPP\u2019s counterclaims.

We note that DPP did not ask that the Order Setting Proceedings and Trial be amended or that the trial be continued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b156-6\">. The district court reversed its grant of summaty judgment on March 2, 2011. After this order was entered, it appears that DPP waited another six weeks before attempting to obtain this information from Boise Mode.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b156-12\">. Although not necessary to the resolution of this issue, we note that the district court did not err in considering DPP\u2019s motion as both a Rule 59(e) motion to amend and as a Rule 11(a)(2)(B) motion to reconsider.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b157-6\">.
