JONES, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">This case involves Philip L. Hart\u2019s appeal of an Idaho Board of Tax Appeals (BTA) decision. Hart appealed two State Tax Commission Notice of Deficiency determinations to the BTA. The BTA found Hart\u2019s appeal untimely and therefore dismissed it. Hart appealed to the district court, which likewise found his BTA appeal untimely and dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">The State Tax Commission (Commission) issued Hart two Notice of Deficiency (NOD) .determinations on September 4, 2008. One NOD covered tax years 1996 through 1998 and the other was for 1999 through 2004. The Commission issued separate NODs because Hart paid no income taxes for the years 1996 through 1998. He apparently paid some taxes, but less than he owed, for 1999 through 2004. Hart protested the NODs and requested that the Commission make a redetermination, contending he had no outstanding tax liability. Hart also requested an informal hearing before the Commission, which he delayed until July 2009. After the hearing, and after Hart\u2019s further delay and failure to provide additional relevant information in support of his protest, the Commission issued a decision on September 30, 2009, affirming and finalizing the NODs. Hart acknowledged receiving the Commission\u2019s final decision on October -2, 2009. The Commission\u2019s final decision indicated that Hart owed $53,523 for unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest for tax years 1996 through 2004. On December 31, 2009, Hart wrote the Commission, stating that he intended to appeal the NODs after the Idaho Legislature\u2019s 2010 session. Hart is a member of the Idaho State Legislature and he asserted that he therefore had a right to defer his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">On March 30, 2010, Hart sent a letter to the BTA entitled \u201cNotice of Appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals.\u201d Included with that letter were two checks, totaling $9,462.04, which Hart tendered as a portion of the cash bond necessary for his BTA appeal. Hart recognized, however, that his outstanding tax liability, as specified in the NODs, required a bond greater than he submitted. Hart thus asked the BTA to \u201cconsider [his] letter [a] promise to pay the remaining [amount].\u201d Hart\u2019s March 30 letter did not include any specific objections to the Commission\u2019s findings, but it did state that he would submit arguments in a subsequent filing. On March 31, 2010, Hart sent another letter to the BTA entitled \u201cNotice of Appeal to the Idaho Board of Tax Appeals.\u201d That letter included Hart\u2019s objections to the NODs. The BTA, upon motion from the Commission, determined it lacked jurisdiction because it found Hart\u2019s appeal untimely. The BTA denied Hart\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the dismissal on September 24, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-14\">On October 22, 2010, Hart filed an appeal of the BTA decision. The district court, upon motion by the Commission, likewise determined it lacked jurisdiction, finding Hart\u2019s BTA appeal untimely. Hart filed a motion for reconsideration, which the court denied. Hart then filed this appeal and asks this Court to determine whether the district court erred in dismissing his petition for lack of jurisdiction. He also contends the district court erred when it denied his motion to reschedule a hearing on his motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">A. The district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Hart\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">On appeal, Hart contends that the district court employed an improper analysis to determine it lacked jurisdiction. The Commission and BTA respond that, regardless of how the court articulated the standard it used, the court had broad authority to determine whether it had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">In every appeal, this Court must satisfy itself that the district court had jurisdiction. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>152 Idaho 41, 47, 266 P.3d 1146, 1152 (2011). The Court is free to consider the question of subject matter jurisdiction even if the district court employed an improper analysis, or no analysis, on the issue. <em>See id. </em>Before a district court may exercise judicial review of an agency decision, there must be a statute granting a right of review. <em>See In re City of Shelley, </em>151 Idaho 289, 292, 255 P.3d 1175, 1178 (2011). Idaho Code \u00a7 63-3812(a) provides taxpayers aggrieved by a BTA decision the right to petition the district court for review, in accordance with I.R.C.P. 84. However, \u201c[p]ursuit of statutory administrative remedies is a condition precedent to judicial review.\u201d <em>Park v. Banbury, </em>143 Idaho 576, 578, 149 P.3d 851, 853 (2006). A party seeking judicial review must \u201crun the full gamut of administrative proceedings before an application for judicial relief may be considered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). To fully avail oneself of administrative proceedings, one must necessarily timely file and perfect his or her appeal. A taxpayer may appeal decisions of the Commission by filing an appeal from an NOD with the BTA within ninety-one days after receiving the NOD.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I.C. \u00a7 63-3049(a). If the BTA had no opportunity to review the taxpayer\u2019s appeal, there is no administrative decision for the district court to review and that court lacks jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">Here, Hart acknowledged receipt of the Commission\u2019s decision affirming and finalizing the NODs on October 2, 2009. Hart had until January 1, 2010 \u2014 ninety-one days after receiving the Commission\u2019s final decision \u2014 to file his appeal with the BTA. Because January 1 was a holiday, and the next two days were weekend days, the BTA determined the appeal deadline to be Monday, January 4, 2010. It is undisputed that Hart sent his first \u201cNotice of Appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals\u201d on March 30, 2010, nearly three months late. In the BTA, Hart asserted that his untimely filing was excused because Article III, \u00a7 7 of the Idaho Constitution tolled the statutory ninety-one day time limit as to him. According to Hart, legislative immunity saved him from having to file an appeal during the legislative session and the ten days just before the session. The 2010 Session began on January 11. So, Hart argued that January 4 \u2014 the apparent deadline for his appeal \u2014 fell within the timeframe contemplated by Article III, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">As the district court recognized, the BTA accepted Hart\u2019s argument <em>arguendo </em>but nonetheless found his filing untimely because his March 2010 \u201cNotices of Appeal\u201d failed to comply with the BTA\u2019s rules for appeals. The district court likewise assumed that, even if Hart\u2019s time for filing was tolled during the legislative session, he still filed his \u201cNotices of Appeal\u201d late. That approach is understandable, since this Court has yet to address the merits of a legislative immunity argument like Hart\u2019s. But administrative agencies are tribunals of limited jurisdiction, which depends entirely upon compliance with their statutory grant of power. <em>Washington Water Power Co. v. Kootenai Envtl. Alliance, </em>99 Idaho 875, 879, 591 P.2d 122, 126 (1979). The BTA was not authorized to assume jurisdiction if not statutorily provided for. In other words, if Hart\u2019s appeal should have been filed on January 4, 2010, the BTA was without jurisdiction to consider any of Hart\u2019s filings after that. It is therefore necessary to determine whether Hart\u2019s legislative immunity argument has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Article III, \u00a7 7 of the Idaho Constitution privileges Idaho\u2019s legislators from arrest and from liability to civil process during the legislative session. Specifically, Section 7 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-4\">Senators and representatives in all cases, except for treason, felony, or breach of the peace, shall be privileged from arrest during the session of the legislature, and in going to and returning from the same, and shall not be liable to any civil process during the session of the legislature, nor during the ten days next before the commencement thereof____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Idaho Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Hart contends, the word \u201cprocess,\u201d as used in Section 7, means \u201cproceeding.\u201d At oral argument, Hart\u2019s counsel characterized appeals from adverse rulings as legal proceedings subject to Section 7\u2019s privilege. According to Hart, a legislator is privileged from conforming to the typical time limits for appeals while the Legislature is in session, and the ten days before the legislative session. Hart conceded that Section 7 cannot toll statutes of limitation for a legislator to file a new lawsuit, which he characterized as affirmative legal proceedings. He was, however, unable to articulate a meaningful distinction between affirmative legal proceedings, like a new law suit, and permissive appeals, \u2022 like this case involves.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Hart\u2019s untenable argument flows from his misunderstanding of the word \u201cprocess.\u201d In the legal context, \u201cprocess\u201d does not mean \u201cproceeding.\u201d \u201cStrictly speaking, [\u2018jprocess,\u2019 as its etymology shows, is something issuing out of, or from a court or judge.... \u201d <em>People v. Nash, </em>1 Idaho 206, 210, 1868 WL 1944 (Idaho Terr.1868). <em>See also </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1325 (9th ed.2009) (defining \u201cprocess\u201d as \u201c[a] summons or writ, esp. to appear or respond in court\u201d); Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary 881-82 (1999) (defining \u201cprocess,\u201d when used in the legal context, as \u201c[a] summons or writ ordering a defendant to appear in court\u201d). Idaho courts have broad authority to compel appearance before them, and to compel obedience to their orders and \u201cprocess.\u201d <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 1-1603 (articulating the powers of every court in the state to enforce their authority); <em>Marks v. Vehlow, </em>105 Idaho 560, 566, 671 P.2d 473, 479 (1983) (discussing the authority of courts to compel compliance with their orders); <em>Camp v. E. Fork Ditch Co., Ltd., </em>137 Idaho 850, 865, 55 P.3d 304, 319 (2002) (same). <em>See also </em>I.C. \u00a7 8-201 <em>et seq. </em>(describing procedures for \u201cDischarge of Persons Imprisoned on <em>Civil Process </em>\u201d (emphasis added)). Court powers include, for example, the authority to jail people for \u201ccivil contempt.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 7-611; <em>Camp, </em>137 Idaho at 865, 55 P.3d at 319. \u201cProcess\u201d also connotes the State\u2019s authority to compel compliance with the law. In <em>Nash, </em>the Territorial Supreme Court explained that \u201cprocess,\u201d as used in a criminal statute at issue there, referred to the sheriffs official authority to carry out the law. 1 Idaho at 209, 1868 WL 1944.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">At the time Article III, \u00a7 7 was being considered and adopted at the constitutional convention, there were a number of territorial statutes providing for arrest in civil actions, as well as the discharge of those arrestees from jail. CCP 1881, \u00a7\u00a7 270296, 783794. Those provisions are currently codified in Chapters 1 and 2, Title 8, Idaho Code. While the Court certainly does not vouch for the continuing viability of any of the statutes, they are instructive as to the meaning of \u201ccivil process\u201d at the time of the constitutional convention. Idaho Code \u00a7 8-102 provides for the arrest of defendants in specified civil action settings. Chapter 2 is entitled \u201cDischarge of Persons Imprisoned on Civil Process.\u201d The code sections in Chapter 2 specify how a \u201cperson confined in jail on an execution issued on a judgment rendered in a civil action\u201d may be discharged. I.C. \u00a7 8-201. Thus, it is clear that \u201ccivil process,\u201d as used in Section 7, involves an element of compulsion, similar to arrest in a criminal proceeding. There is no indication whatsoever that civil process contemplates a person taking an action to avail himself of benefits available through the judicial process, such as filing a lawsuit, filing an appeal of an adverse decision, and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">Section 7 speaks of privilege from liability to civil process, not privilege from conformance with the rules governing permissive actions. Idaho Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 7 (\u201cSenators and representatives ... shall not be <em>liable </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>any civil process.\u201d (emphasis added)). \u201cLiable\u201d means being responsible or answerable in law; legally obligated. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 998 (9th ed.2009); Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary 631 (1999). Thus, Section 7 only privileges legislators from the legal obligation to answer to the government\u2019s broad authority to compel compliance with its civil laws. This interpretation makes sense because Section 7 also speaks of privilege from arrest for all but egregious criminal offenses \u2014 treason, felony, and breach of peace. In sum, Article III, \u00a7 7 privileges legislators from unnecessary compulsion by the other branches of government, which may interfere with official legislative duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">In this ease, Hart was not obligated to do anything but pay his taxes. Neither the BTA, nor any other government official, tried to compel Hart\u2019s appearance before a tribunal. No court sought to hold Hart responsible for a new legal obligation. No sheriff or other agent of the State sought to arrest Hart or compel him to appear anywhere or take any other action. In other words, no one tried to hold Hart liable to civil process. Rather, Hart sought to avail himself of BTA appeals procedures, which he had until January 4, 2010 to do. He missed that deadline by almost three months. In this instance, Hart is just a taxpayer, with no greater privilege than his constituents. Because Hart failed to timely file his BTA appeal, he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Consequently, neither the BTA nor the district court had jurisdiction to consider any of his arguments about the legality or appropriateness of Idaho\u2019s tax system. The district court assumed away a necessary threshold issue, but that court reached the right result. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hart\u2019s petition for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">B. The district court did not err by denying Hart\u2019s motion to reschedule an oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Hart argues that the district court erred by failing to reschedule an oral argument on a motion to reconsider. Hart contends that due process somehow entitles him to be physically present at any hearing and to assist his lawyer give oral argument; and he asserts a right to unilaterally reschedule hearings to accommodate his calendar. Because the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Hart\u2019s petition, we need not reach this issue. Furthermore, we will not entertain an issue that is \u201cnot supported by any cogent argument or authority.\u201d <em>Bach v. Bagley, </em>148 Idaho 784, 790, 229 P.3d 1146, 1152 (2010). Hart\u2019s argument on this issue is devoid of reasoned analysis or relevant authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">C. The Commission and the BTA are entitled to fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">All parties request fees on appeal. Hart, as the losing party, is not entitled to fees. The Commission and the BTA seek fees under I.C. \u00a7 63-3049(d). Section 63-3049(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-10\">Whenever it appears to the court that ... [a] party\u2019s position in [a] proceeding [for judicial review of the Commission] is frivolous or groundless[,] the court, in its discretion, may require the party which did not prevail to pay the prevailing party costs, expenses and attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">I.C. \u00a7 63-3049(d). <em>See also Parker v. Idaho State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>148 Idaho 842, 850, 230 P.3d 734, 742 (2010) (awarding attorney fees on appeal under I.C. \u00a7 63\u20143049(d)). Hart\u2019s position here is groundless. Hart\u2019s theory of legislative immunity was based on an untenable reading of Article III, \u00a7 7 of the Idaho Constitution. None of this Court\u2019s decisions support his assertion that he had more than ninety-one days to file a BTA appeal, nor did Hart offer any reasoned basis for us to blaze a new trail in the law. Accordingly, we award costs and fees to the Commission and the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b661-14\">The decision of the district court dismissing Hart\u2019s petition is affirmed. We award costs and fees on appeal to the respondents.</p>\n<judges id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Chief Justice BURDICK, and Justices EISMANN, W.

Alternatively, a taxpayer may seek judicial review of the Commission\u2019s redetermination decisions directly and thus bypass the BTA entirely. I.C. \u00a7 63-3049(a). But the same ninety-one day time limitation applies to petitions for review in district court as for appeals to the BTA. I.C. \u00a7 63-3049(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
