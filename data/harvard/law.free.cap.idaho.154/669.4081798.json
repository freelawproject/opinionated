JONES, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">This is an appeal from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the State of Idaho, former Governor James E. Risch, and former Fish and Game Department Director Steven Huffaker (collectively \u201cDefendants\u201d). Appellants, Rex and Lynda Rammell, the owners of a domestic elk ranch, initiated this action against Defendants to recover for the loss and destruction of elk that escaped from their ranch in 2006. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">In early August of 2006, approximately 135 domestic elk kept on the Rammells\u2019 property escaped. On August 14, 2006, a neighbor of the Rammells contacted Dr. Debra Lawrence, an employee of the Idaho Department of Agriculture, to inform her of the animals\u2019 escape. Dr. Lawrence immediately informed the Rammells that their elk had escaped from their property. After receiving notice of the escape, the Rammells took various measures to capture the escaped animals and maintained their efforts until mid-October of 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-15\">On September 7, 2006, Governor Risch issued Executive Order 2006-32, observing that the elk had escaped their owner\u2019s control for more than seven days and proclaiming that the escape of the elk presented \u201can imminent threat to public health and safety of the citizens of Idaho as well as neighboring states.\u201d The Executive Order called for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game and the Idaho Department of Agriculture to \u201cshoot on site any domestic elk\u201d that had escaped from the Rammells\u2019 property. Governor Risch also called upon the Idaho Fish and Game Commission (Commission) to promulgate an emergency rule or proclamation to allow licensed hunters to \u201cidentify and shoot on site\u201d domestic elk that had escaped from the Rammells\u2019 property. The Rammells were informed of Executive Order 2006-32 on September 8, 2006. Director Huffaker responded on behalf of the Commission by issuing Order 06^43, which declared an emergency and provided for a depredation hunt for the elk from September 19, 2006 through December 15, 2006. Order 06-43 specifically provided that \u201cescaped domestic elk may be taken by eligible licensed hunters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-16\">No exact number has ever been calculated as to how many of the Rammells\u2019 domestic elk escaped in early August of 2006. However, the Rammells estimate that approximately 135 head escaped. It is well documented that the Rammells were able to capture six<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>ty-one of the elk. The sixty-one captured elk were placed in the custody of the Idaho Department of Agriculture and quarantined. Of the sixty-one animals placed in the custody of the Department of Agriculture, thirteen were reported missing by the Rammells and one was found dead after the quarantine was lifted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Forty-three of the escaped domestic elk were taken pursuant to Order 06-43, and approximately thirty-one of the domestic elk apparently remained at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The Rammells initiated this action on February 26, 2007. In their initial Complaint they alleged eight separate counts for relief including: one count for deprivation of property without due process of law in violation of both the United States Constitution and Idaho\u2019s Constitution; one count based on the \u201ctaking\u201d of property without a reasonable public purpose and without just compensation in violation of the United States Constitution and Idaho\u2019s Constitution; four counts of civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; and two tort claims under the Idaho Tort Claims Act for destruction of property and interference with contractual and business relationships. In response, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied as to the Rammells\u2019 due process and takings claims, but granted as to the remaining six counts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The Rammells then moved to amend their Complaint,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and received leave of court to do so. The Rammells\u2019 First Amended Complaint alleged seven counts nearly identical to those in the initial Complaint: first, that Defendants violated their constitutional rights by depriving them of their property without due process; second, that Defendants violated the Rammells\u2019 right to equal protection by arbitrarily taking their property without a public purpose or just compensation; the five remaining counts were all predicated on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and alleged (1) violations of substantive due process; (2) the taking of property without just compensation; (3) an equal protection claim; (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (5) negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">Defendants then moved for summary judgment. After a hearing on the Defendants\u2019 motion, the district court dismissed all of the Rammells\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims on the basis of qualified immunity. After further argument at the same hearing, the court dismissed the Rammells\u2019 takings claim because the district court found that, \u201cthe State did not violate the takings clause ... of either the state or federal constitution.\u201d Lastly, the equal protection claim was dismissed due to factual insufficiency. Subsequent to dismissal, the court awarded Defendants their costs and attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117 and I.R.C.P. 11. The Rammells filed a timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">I.

Are the Defendants entitled to an award of attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-117 for the Rammells\u2019 pursuit of this appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A5m\">A. Standard of Review.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">In an appeal from summary judgment, this Court employs the same standard as the district court. <em>Cnty. of Boise v. Idaho Cntys. Risk Mgmt. Program, Underwriters, </em>151 Idaho 901, 904, 265 P.3d 514, 517 (2011). Summary judgment is proper when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d I.R.C.P. 56(e). This Court exercises free review over questions of law. <em>Cnty. of Boise, </em>151 Idaho at 904, 265 P.3d at 517. We review the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees predicated on I.C. \u00a7 12-117 for an abuse of discretion. <em>City of Osburn v. Randel, </em>152 Idaho 906, 908, 277 P.3d 353, 355 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">B. Idaho Code \u00a7 25-3705A(3) provides the State authority to legally take escaped domestic cervidae.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">All of the Rammells\u2019 claims are premised on the contention that the State actors had no legal authority to take or permit the taking of their elk and, even if such authority existed, they are entitled to recover compensation for the taking. We first consider this foundational argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-16\">The district court found that I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3) was constitutional and provided adequate legal authority for the State to take the Rammells\u2019 elk without incurring an obligation to pay compensation. On appeal, the Rammells contend that I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3) simply does not grant the State or its agents the authority to issue a take order for escaped domestic elk. In response, Defendants argue that the State and its agents did have the authority to issue the take order and carry out the depredation hunt, either under the terms of I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3) or under the State\u2019s power to abate a public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-17\">Defendants are correct in their assertion that Order 06-43, issued by Director Huffaker on behalf of the Commission, properly authorized the taking of the elk. That is, Order 06-43 satisfied the conditions set out in I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3), was issued within the authority of the Commission and its director under Title 36 of the Idaho Code, and provided proper authorization for a legal taking of the escaped domestic elk.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-18\">Idaho Code \u00a7 25-3705A(3) provides that: Any domestic cervidae,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that have escaped the control of the owner or operator of a domestic cervidae farm or ranch for more than seven (7) days, taken by a licensed hunter in a manner which complies with title 36, Idaho Code, and the rules and proclamations of the Idaho fish and game commission shall be considered a legal taking and neither the licensed hunter, the state, nor any state agency shall be liable to the owner for killing the escaped domestic cervidae.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-19\">On appeal, the Rammells have not challenged the constitutionality of I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3). Nor has either party argued that the statute is ambiguous. Rather, each party adheres to different interpretations of what the statute means.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-20\">The Rammells believe that the statute\u2019s meaning is unmistakable \u2014 if an elk rancher does not recapture his escaped elk within seven days, and a licensed hunter happens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>thereafter to kill one during the regular hunting season, the rancher cannot complain. Conversely, Defendants assert that the statute creates a clearly delineated process by which the State can legally \u201ctake\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> any domestic cervidae beginning on the eighth day after they have made good on their escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The plain language of I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3) supports Defendants\u2019 argument that the statute provides authorization for the State to legally take escaped domestic cervidae. Idaho Code \u00a7 25-3705A(3) expressly provides that the take of domestic cervidae, seven days after escape, is legal and that no liability for the hunter, the State or any State agency will attach if the conditions of the statute are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In addition to the plain language, three additional considerations of the terms chosen by the Legislature in I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3) negate the Rammells\u2019 reading of the statute. First, is the seven-day time period provided in the statute. If the Legislature had intended to only immunize hunters based on the accidental killing of domestic elk, it would have done so expressly and without a time limitation. An escaped domestic elk is practically indistinguishable from a wild elk, both on the first day of its escape from captivity and on its eighth day. Second, the fact that the Legislature included immunity for both the State and any State agency with respect to the taking of any domestic cervidae indicates that the Legislature was not concerned just with the accidental killing of domestic elk by licensed hunters when it drafted I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3). Third, all hunting performed by hunters during the regular hunting season is presumed to be done in compliance with Title 36. Thus, the language \u201ctaken by a licensed hunter in a manner which complies with title 36, Idaho Code,\u201d would be superfluous if the Rammells\u2019 accidental killing interpretation was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Before escaped domestic cervidae may be legally taken, I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3) requires that (1) they must have been escaped for more than seven days, (2) they must be taken by a licensed hunter, and (3) the taking must be in a manner that complies with Title 36 of the Idaho Code, as well as the rules and proclamations of the Idaho Fish and Game Commission. Because I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3) is constitutional and was enacted to address the escape of domestic cervidae when the statute\u2019s conditions are satisfied, the State may legally take the escaped animals without liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">In this case, the Rammells\u2019 domestic elk had escaped at least thirty-four days before Director Huffaker issued Order 06-43. The Rammells have presented no facts indicating that their domestic elk were taken by any non-lieensed hunters. The hunt of the Rammells\u2019 domestic elk was effectuated in a manner that complied with Title 36. Idaho Code \u00a7 36-106 grants the Director of Fish and Game the power, acting pursuant to authority delegated by the Commission, to declare an open season upon a species of wildlife to reduce its population in order to protect property from damage. I.C. \u00a7 36-106(e)(6)(B). To achieve this, the Director must issue an \u201corder embodying his findings in respect to when, under what circumstances, in which localities, by what means ... wildlife subject to the hunt may be taken.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 36-106(e)(6)(B). Order 06-43, issued by Director Huffaker specifically relies on I.C. \u00a7 36-106 and meets all the requirements set out in I.C. \u00a7 36 \u2014 106(e)(6)(B), including a provision allowing for the declaration of an emergency to give immediate effect to the order. Accordingly, the taking of the Rammells\u2019 escaped domestic elk was conducted in a manner that complied with Title 36. And, there is absolutely nothing in the record to indicate that the taking did not occur in a manner which complies with the rules and proclamations of the Idaho Fish and Game Commission. Thus, all the requirements of I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3) were satisfied in this case, authorizing the State to legally take the Rammells\u2019 escaped domestic elk without liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">C. IDAPA 02.04.19.204.05 is irrelevant to the determination of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">The Rammells argue that the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment was im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>proper because a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether a reasonable period of time passed before the State initiated efforts to recapture or take their elk. The Rammells\u2019 argument relies on IDAPA 02.04.19.204.05, entitled \u201ccapture,\u201d which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-4\">In the event that the owner or operator of a domestic cervidae ranch is unable to retrieve escaped domestic cervidae in a timely manner, as determined by the Administrator, the Administrator may effectuate the capture of the escaped domestic cervidae to ensure the health of Idaho\u2019s livestock and wild cervidae populations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The Rammells insist that whether their efforts to capture were occurring in a \u201ctimely manner\u201d is a question of fact that must be decided by a jury. Defendants rely on I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3) to refute the Rammells\u2019 contention, and assqrt that the statute\u2019s seven-day period is the period allowed for the recapture of escaped domestic cervidae before the State may act to remedy the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The Rammells\u2019 argument is irrelevant to the determination of this case because, IDAPA 02.04.19.204.05 governs the conduct of the Administrator of the Idaho Department of Agriculture, not the Governor or the Director of the Department of Fish and Game. In this case, it was Governor Risch and Director Huffaker who acted pursuant I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3), making the \u201ctimely manner\u201d requirement of IDAPA 02.04.19.204.05 irrelevant. Given that IDAPA 02.04.19.204.05\u2019s \u201ctimely manner\u201d requirement only governs the conduct of the Administrator of the Idaho Department of Agriculture, who is not a party to this case, the provision cannot affect the outcome of this case. Furthermore, the immunity provided under I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3) is in no way affected by this or any other administrative rule.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, whether the Rammells were retrieving their escaped domestic elk in a \u201ctimely manner\u201d is not a material issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">D. The State may deny compensation to the owners of escaped domestic elk taken under the terms allowed for in I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">The district court dismissed the Rammells\u2019 Fifth Amendment takings claim on two independent bases \u2014 abatement of a public nuisance and I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3), which it determined was a legislative carve-out from just compensation requirements, allowing the State to take escaped domestic cervidae without liability. On appeal, the Rammells merely cite the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and claim that the Defendants unlawfully deprived them of their property without just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">Although not cited or asserted in their just compensation argument, elsewhere in their briefing the Rammells cite I.C. \u00a7 25-3707, which establishes property rights in domestic cervidae. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-11\">Domestic cervidae shall be, together with their offspring and increases the subject of ownership, lien and absolute property rights, (the same as purely domestic animals) in whatever situation, location, or condition such animals may thereafter become, or be, and regardless of their remaining in, or escaping from such restraint or captivity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">This provision certainly grants property rights in domestic cervidae. However, the Rammells overlook the fact that such property rights are subject to and conditioned upon I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A and that when owners of the animals allow them to remain at large for more than seven days after an escape, the property rights must give way to the State\u2019s ability, acting pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3), to take the animals without liability-</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">Under the terms of I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3), licensed hunters, the State, and all state agencies are immune for the killing of escaped domestic cervidae, so long as the killing complies with I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3). In this case, all of the requisite conditions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>statute were satisfied, immunizing Defendants from liability to the Rammells.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">E. The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to the Rammells\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims against Risch and Huffaker was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The district court twice dismissed all of the Rammells\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims \u2014 once prior to granting them leave to amend their complaint, and then again after they submitted their First Amended Complaint. In both instances, the district court found that the Rammells\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims against Risch and Huffaker<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> were barred by qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The Rammells argue that genuine issues of material fact exist regarding their \u00a7 1983 claims against Risch and Huffaker that preclude the entry of summary judgment. Specifically, they argue that before qualified immunity can be invoked there must be a determination of reasonableness under the circumstances, which is a jury question. The Rammells\u2019 argument that the individual defendants\u2019 conduct was unreasonable relies on their accidental-killing interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3), which we reject.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The Rammells\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims against Risch and Huffaker are barred by qualified immunity. In Idaho, state officials can avail themselves of qualified immunity from \u00a7 1983 claims if they followed a reasonable interpretation of the law at issue. <em>Miller v. Idaho State Patrol, </em>150 Idaho 856, 864, 252 P.3d 1274, 1282 (2011). \u201cThe qualified immunity standard gives ample room for mistaken judgments by protecting all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 869, 252 P.3d at 1287. \u201cIf a government official violates the claimant\u2019s constitutional rights, qualified immunity generally turns on the objective reasonableness of the action assessed in light of the legal rules that were clearly established at the time it was taken.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 864, 252 P.3d at 1282. Thus, courts addressing qualified immunity defenses must address two issues: \u201c(1) whether, accepting the plaintiffs assertions as true, the defendant invaded the plaintiffs constitutional rights; and (2) whether the defendant acted reasonably given the state of American law at the time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cLegal uncertainty\u201d at the time of the official\u2019s conduct provides adequate grounds for a finding of qualified immunity. <em>Id. </em>It is in each individual court\u2019s discretion which of these issues to approach first. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">In this case, the Defendants did exactly what the statute on its face said they could do. When Risch and Huffaker acted pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 25-3705A(3), no appellate court in this State had ruled that the statute did not mean exactly what it says. Likewise, no appellate court in this State or other controlling authority had ruled that the statute was unconstitutional, and the Rammells do not challenge its constitutionality. Given the state of the law when Risch and Huffaker acted, the district court\u2019s, dismissal of the Rammells\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims on the basis of qualified immunity was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">F. The district court did not abuse its discretion by awarding attorney fees to Defendants under I.C. \u00a7 12-117.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-12\">The district court, pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117 and I.R.C.P. 11, awarded Defendants $49,202.50 in attorney fees, and costs as a matter of right in the amount of $1,559.26. The district court found that: the Defendants were the prevailing party, the Rammells pursued their case without a reasonable basis in law or fact, and the Rammells violated I.R.C.P. 11(a)(1). The Rammells insist that the only explanation for the award is that the district court harbored ill will toward them or their business. Furthermore, the Rammells contend that the award of attorney\u2019s fees by the district court was \u201cplain error.\u201d Defendants argue that all of the Rammells\u2019 claims were dismissed because they lacked any factual or legal basis, and therefore attorney\u2019s fees were proper under I.C. \u00a7 12-117.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Idaho follows the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d regarding attorney fees, which requires parties to pay their own attorney fees unless a specific statutory or contractual authority supports shifting fees to the opposing party. <em>Mortensen v. Stewart Title Guar. Co., </em>149 Idaho 437, 447-48, 235 P.3d 387, 397-98 (2010). Idaho Code \u00a7 12-117 is such a provision. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-4\">[I]n any proceeding involving as adverse parties a state agency or a political subdivision and a person, the state agency, political subdivision or the court hearing the proceeding, including on appeal, shall award the prevailing party reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, witness fees and other reasonable expenses, if it finds that the nonprevailing party acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">I.C. \u00a7 12-117. A district court\u2019s imposition of attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117 is reviewed by this Court for an abuse of discretion. <em>City of Osburn v. Randel, </em>152 Idaho 906, 908, 277 P.3d 353, 355 (2012). Where the district court \u201caet[s] within the bounds of its discretion and reache[s] its decision through an exercise of reason\u201d an abuse of discretion will not be found. <em>Id. </em>at 910, 277 P.3d at 357. Essentially, I.C. \u00a7 12-117 requires and award of fees and costs to a prevailing party where the nonprevailing party acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law. <em>Id. </em>at 909, 277 P.3d at 356. Therefore, two issues must be resolved: (1) who is the prevailing party and (2) did the nonprevailing party act without a reasonable basis in fact or law. <em>See id. </em>at 908, 277 P.3d at 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Idaho\u2019s Rules of Civil Procedure address how to determine a prevailing party. \u201cIn any civil action the court may award reasonable attorney fees ... to the prevailing party or parties as defined in Rule 54(d)(1)(B).\u201d I.R.C.P. 54(e)(1). Rule 54(d)(1)(B) provides that \u201c[i]n determining which party to an action is a prevailing party and entitled to costs, the trial court shall in its sound discretion consider the final judgment or result of the action in relation to the relief sought by the respective parties.\u201d I.R.C.P. 54(d)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by finding that Defendants were the prevailing party in this matter because it properly considered the final judgment in relation to the relief sought by the parties before holding that Defendants prevailed. In its Order Granting Costs and Fees in Part, the district court noted that the Rammells prevailed on absolutely no issue and that, based on the record as a whole, Defendants were the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Furthermore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding that the Rammells, the nonprevailing party, pursued their claims without a reasonable basis in law or fact. The court found that based on the record, \u201cthe Rammells both brought these claims and pursued them without a reasonable basis in law or fact.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, the district court relied on the following: (1) the Rammells were warned by the district judge at a hearing prior to granting their motion to amend, that if the amended complaint did not assert any new factual bases for their claims, an award of attorney fees for Defendants was likely; (2) the Rammells\u2019 First Amended Complaint re-alleged five civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 that were nearly identical to the claims that had already been dismissed on the basis of qualified immunity; and (3) the Rammells\u2019 claim in their First Amended Complaint \u2014 that Defendants\u2019 conduct, in taking their domestic elk, was motivated by ill will towards the Rammells themselves and the domestic elk ranching industry as a whole \u2014 was supported by absolutely no evidence. Based on these facts, the district court\u2019s grant of fees and costs was within the bounds of its discretion. Furthermore, the court reached its decision through clear and well-articulated reasoning. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by awarding attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-117.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">G. The State is entitled to an award of attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-117 for the Rammells\u2019 pursuit of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">Defendants, the prevailing party, assert that they are entitled to costs and attorney fees under I.A.R. 41 and I.C. \u00a7 12-117. In reply, the Rammells contend that attorney fees are not warranted and that they were only requested to dissuade the Rammells from appealing the district court\u2019s ruling. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>The Rammells insist that finding that their claims had no basis in law or fact is \u201cspecious,\u201d but provide no legal authority or argument for their conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">This Court has held that I.C. \u00a7 12-117 \u201cauthorizes the awarding of attorney fees on appeal.\u201d <em>Daw ex rel. Daw v. Sch. Dist. 91 Bd. of </em>Trs., 136 Idaho 806, 808, 41 P.3d 234, 236 (2001). The Court employs a two-part test to determine if I.C. \u00a7 12-117 is invoked on appeal: (1) the party seeking fees must be the prevailing party and (2) the nonprevailing party must have acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law. <em>City of Osburn, </em>152 Idaho at 910, 277 P.3d at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Here, because the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is affirmed, Defendants are the prevailing party. Additionally, we find that the Rammells have pursued this appeal without a reasonable basis in law or fact. On appeal, the Rammells have raised six separate issues. One of these issues, reassignment on remand, was not addressed because this case will not be remanded. Both the issues of their right to just compensation and the improper award of attorney fees below were made without any analysis or factual support. Additionally, the Rammells\u2019 two claims that summary judgment was improper due to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact both mischaracterized and misapplied the law to the extent that no reasonable basis in law existed. Because Defendants are the prevailing party on appeal and the Rammells pursued this appeal without a reasonable basis in fact or law, Defendants are entitled to attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed. Defendants are awarded their costs and attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b714-9\">Chief Justice BURDICK, and Justices EISMANN, W. JONES and HORTON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-6\">. The Rammells have not asserted a claim against any of the Defendants based on the law of bailments with regard to the thirteen missing elk.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b708-7\">. In its order dismissing the \u00a7 1983 claims, the district court footnoted that the Rammells had failed to allege they had exhausted all available procedures for obtaining compensation before bringing their \u00a7 1983 claims against Risch and Huffaker and had also failed to allege that Idaho law did not provide an adequate process for obtaining compensation. In their briefing to this Court, neither party has addressed the procedure provided in I.C. \u00a7 67-1023, for presentation of claims against the State. Under I.C. \u00a7 67-1023, \"[a]ll persons having claims against the state must exhibit the same, with the evidence in support thereof, to the state controller, to be examined, settled and allowed by the board of examiners, within two (2) years after such claims shall accrue, and not afterward.\u201d Justice Eismann noted this procedure for presentation of claims against the State in his special concurrence in <em>Baird Oil Co. v.
