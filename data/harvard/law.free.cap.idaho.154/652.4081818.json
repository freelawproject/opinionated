The appellant had filed a petition for reconsideration of an administrative order issued by the Idaho Department of Water Resources, and, when the Department failed to decide the merits of the petition within twenty-one days, the appellant filed a petition for judicial review of the Department\u2019s order, contending that the petition for reconsideration was deemed denied pursuant to Idaho Code section 67-5246(4). The Department later decided the petition for reconsideration and issued an amended order. The district court held that section 67-5246(4) did not require the Department decide the merits of the petition for reconsideration within twenty-one days; it only had to agree to consider the petition within that time frame. The court therefore dismissed appellant\u2019s petition for judicial review on the ground that the order it sought to have reviewed had been superseded by the amended order. We vacate the dismissal because the petition for reconsideration was deemed denied by section 67-5246(4) when the Department failed to decide it within twenty-one days, and the amended order was therefore a nullity because the Department did not have jurisdiction to issue it.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>i.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Factual Background.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">On April 27, 2011, the Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR) issued a final order in an administrative proceeding entitled \u201cIn the Matter of the Petition for Delivery Call of A &amp; B Irrigation District for the Delivery of Ground Water and for the Creation of a Ground Water Management Area.\u201d On May 11, 2011, A &amp; B Irrigation District (A &amp; B) timely filed a petition for reconsideration pursuant to Idaho Code section 67-5246(4). That statute provides, \u201cThe petition is deemed denied if the agency head does not dispose of it within twenty-one (21) days after the filing of the petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">On June 1, 2011, IDWR issued an order granting the petition for reconsideration, but the order did not address the merits of the petition. It merely ordered \u201cthat the Petition is GRANTED for the sole purpose of allowing additional time for the Department to respond to the Petition. An order responding to the merits of the Petition shall issue no later than June 9, 2011.\u201d On June 9, 2011, IDWR issued an amended order granting the petition for reconsideration in which it ordered \u201cthat the Petition is GRANTED for the sole purpose of allowing additional time for the Department to respond to the Petition. An order responding to the merits of the Petition shall issue no later than June 30, 2011.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">On June 27, 2011, A &amp; B filed a petition for judicial review pursuant to Idaho Code section 67-5273(2), which provides that \u201cif reconsideration is sought, [the petition must be filed] within twenty-eight (28) days after the service date of the decision thereon.\u201d Because the director had failed to dispose of the petition for reconsideration by ruling on its merits within twenty-one days, A &amp; B considered the petition to have been deemed denied pursuant to Idaho Code section 67-5246(5)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">On June 30, 2011, IDWR issued a decision on the merits of the petition for review, granting it in part and denying it in part. On the same date, it issued an amended final order based upon its decision on the petition for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">On July 7, 2011, IDWR moved to dismiss the petition for judicial review on the ground that the petition sought review of the April 27th order, that the order had been superseded by the June 30th order, and that the only final agency action was now the latter order. The district court agreed and dismissed the petition for judicial review. A &amp; B timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">Analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-13\">The issue in this appeal is the meaning of the term \u201cdispose of\u2019 as it is used in subsections (4) and (5) of Idaho Code section 67-5246, which state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-14\">(4) Unless otherwise provided by statute or rule, any party may file a motion for reconsideration of any final order issued by the agency head within fourteen (14) days of the service date of that order. The agency head shall issue a written order <em>disposing </em>o/the petition. The petition is deemed denied if the agency head does not <em>dispose of </em>it within twenty-one (21) days after the filing of the petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-15\">(5) Unless a different date is stated in a final order, the order is effective fourteen (14) days after its service date if a party has not filed a petition for reconsideration. If a party has filed a petition for reconsideration with the agency head, the final order becomes effective when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-16\">(a) The petition for reconsideration is <em>disposed of; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-17\">(b) The petition is deemed denied because the agency head did not <em>dispose of </em>the petition within twenty-one (21) days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-18\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-19\">IDWR argued to the district court that an agency could \u201cdispose of\u2019 a petition for reconsideration without deciding that petition on the merits. Thus, it contended that it disposed of the petition for reconsideration when it granted the petition for the sole purpose of gaining additional time to consider the petition\u2019s merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-20\">The district court found that the verb phrase \u201cdispose of\u2019 was ambiguous and held that IDWR\u2019s interpretation of the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>was entitled to deference under <em>J.R. Simplot Co. v. Idaho State Tax Commission, </em>120 Idaho 849, 820 P.2d 1206 (1991). In that case, we held that \u201c[i]n determining the appropriate level of deference to be given to an agency construction of a statute, we are of the opinion that a court must follow a four-prong test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 862, 820 P.2d at 1219. The first prong of the test is whether \u201cthe agency has been entrusted with the responsibility to administer the statute at issue. Only if the agency has received this authority will it be \u2018impliedly clothed with power to construe\u2019 the law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Idaho Code section 67-5246 is part of the Idaho Administrative Procedure Act, I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 67-5201 to 67-5292 (IAPA). IDWR contends that it was entrusted with the responsibility to administer the IAPA by Idaho Code section 42-1701A(l) which states, \u201cAll hearings required by law to be held before the director of the department of water resources shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code [IAPA], and rules of procedure promulgated by the director.\u201d A legislative directive that IDWR comply with the IAPA cannot reasonably be construed as delegating to IDWR the responsibility for administering the IAPA. IDWR has not been entrusted with the responsibility of administering the IAPA. That Act applies to \u201ceach state board, commission, department or officer authorized by law ... to determine contested cases.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-5201(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, any interpretation by IDWR of the provisions of the section 67-5246 is not entitled to deference. <em>Westway Constr., Inc. v. Idaho Transp. Dept., </em>139 Idaho 107, 115, 73 P.3d 721, 729 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The interpretation of a statute is a question of law over which we exercise free review. <em>Gooding County v. Wybenga, </em>137 Idaho 201, 204, 46 P.3d 18, 21 (2002). It must begin with the literal words of the statute, <em>Thomson v. City of Lewiston, </em>137 Idaho 473, 478, 50 P.3d 488, 493 (2002); those words must be given their plain, usual, and ordinary meaning; and the statute must be construed as a whole, <em>State v. Hart, </em>135 Idaho 827, 829, 25 P.3d 850, 852 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">When a party in a contested case files a petition for reconsideration, Idaho Code section 67-5246(4) requires that \u201c[t]he agency head shall issue a written order <em>disposing of </em>the petition.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statute further provides that the petition is deemed denied \u201cif the agency head does not <em>dispose of </em>it within twenty-one (21) days after the filing of the petition.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The words \u201cdispose of\u2019 mean \u201cto deal with conclusively <em>&lt; disposed of </em>the matter efficiently&gt;.\u201d Merriam-Webster, Inc., Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 335 (10th ed., 1993); <em>accord </em>Barnes &amp; Noble Books, Webster\u2019s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary 414 (1992) (dispose of means \u201cto deal with conclusively, settle\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">IDWR\u2019s orders issued on June 1 and June 9 did not dispose of the petition for reconsideration because those orders did not address the merits of the petition. They merely stated that the petition for reconsideration was granted \u201cfor the sole purpose of allowing additional time for the Department to respond to the Petition\u201d and that \u201c[a]n order responding to the merits of the Petition shall issue\u201d at a later date. Giving the words \u201cdispose of\u2019 their normal meaning, these orders clearly did not dispose of the petition nor did they purport to. It was not until June 30, 2011, that IDWR issued an order addressing the petition\u2019s merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">IDWR contends that its construction of the statute \u201cis in accord with the leading commentary on Idaho\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act, <em>The Idaho Administrative Procedure Act: A Primer for the Practitioner, </em>30 Idaho L.Rev. 273 (1993), written by Michael S. Gilmore &amp; Dale D. Goble\u201d and \u201cis also consistent with the written explanatory comments that accompany the Idaho Attorney General\u2019s Model Rules of Administrative Procedure.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>We must base our decision on the actual wording of the statute. The statute does not state that the petition is deemed denied if, within twenty-one days, the agency head does not \u201caccept\u201d the petition or \u201cagree to reconsider the final order.\u201d Rather, the agency head must \u201cdispose of\u2019 the petition within that time period. The only reasonable construction is that to dispose of the petition for reconsideration, the agency must decide it on the merits. Only a decision on the merits would deal with the petition conclusively. This interpretation is confirmed by subsection (5) of the statute, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad_\">(5) Unless a different date is stated in a final order, the order is effective fourteen (14) days after its service date if a party has not filed a petition for reconsideration. If a party has filed a petition for reconsideration with the agency head, the final order becomes effective when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-4\">(a) The petition for reconsideration is <em>disposed of; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\">(b) The petition is deemed denied because the agency head did not <em>dispose of </em>the petition within twenty-one (21) days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">I.C. \u00a7 67-5246(5) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Subsection (5) of the statute specifies when a final order becomes effective. If there is no petition for reconsideration, the final order becomes effective fourteen days after the order\u2019s service date or on such other date that is specified in the final order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If there is a timely petition for reconsideration filed, \u201cthe final order becomes effective when: (a) The petition for reconsideration is disposed of; or (b) The petition is deemed denied because the agency head did not dispose of the petition within twenty-one (21) days.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-5246(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-14\">A petition for reconsideration can only be made with respect to a final order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The final order is effective <em>\u201cwhen: </em>(a) The petition for reconsideration is disposed of.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In this context, the word \u201cwhen\u201d is a conjunction meaning \u201cat what time.\u201d Barnes &amp; Noble Books, Webster\u2019s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary 1626 (1992). If, as IDWR contends, a petition for reconsideration is disposed of when it is accepted for consideration, then the final order would become effective when the agency agreed to reconsider it, even though it had not yet made a decision on the merits of the petition for reconsideration. Because no other final order would yet exist, the final order that would become effective at that point would be the one the agency had agreed to reconsider. Under IDWR\u2019s view of the statute, there would then be no specific time limit for deciding the merits of the petition for reconsideration. Thus, the order being reconsidered could be effective for months before there was any decision on the merits of the petition for reconsideration. There is no reason to believe that the legislature would have wanted a final order to become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>effective before there was a final decision on a petition seeking reconsideration of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">IDWR contends that a twenty-one day time limit for deciding a petition for reconsideration would, in some instances, be unworkable and would not allow it sufficient time to evaluate the issues raised by the petition and to make a thoroughly considered opinion. We must apply the statute as written. \u201cIf the statute is unwise, the power to correct it resides with the legislature, not the judiciary.\u201d <em>State Through Idaho State Bd. of Accountancy v. League Services, Inc., </em>108 Idaho 157, 159, 697 P.2d 1171, 1173 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">A petition for reconsideration is not disposed of until there is a decision on the merits of the petition. A &amp; B filed its petition for reconsideration on May 11, 2011. IDWR had twenty-one days from that date (until June 1, 2011) within which to decide the petition on the merits. Because IDWR\u2019s Director did not issue a written decision disposing of the petition for reconsideration by June 1, 2011, the petition was deemed denied. I.C. \u00a7 67-5246(4). At that point, IDWR no longer had jurisdiction in the matter, and the order issued on June 30, 2011, is a nullity. Because A &amp; B\u2019s petition for reconsideration was deemed denied, the final order was the order issued on April 27, 2011. A &amp; B was entitled to seek judicial review of that order, and the district court erred in dismissing its petition on the ground that the April 27 order was not final.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">The order dismissing A &amp; B\u2019s petition for judicial review is reversed. We award costs on appeal to appellant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b692-9\">Chief Justice BURDICK, Justices J. JONES, HORTON and J. Pro Tern.

But granting reconsideration is not the same as issuing the final decision following reconsideration. Reconsideration can be granted by issuing an order that says, \"The petition for reconsideration is granted,\u201d then proceeding to schedule the further hearings, briefing, etc., on reconsideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-16\"><em>Idaho Administrative Procedure Act with Comments and Idaho Attorney General\u2019s Model Rules of Practice and Procedure, </em>Written Comments to Rules 710 through 789 (1993)____</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b691-17\">. \"Unless a different date is stated in a final order, the order is effective fourteen (14) days after its service date if a party has not filed a petition for reconsideration.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-5246(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b691-18\">. \"Unless otherwise provided by statute or rule, any party may file a motion for reconsideration of any final order issued by the agency head within fourteen (14) days of the service date of that order.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-5246(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b692-10\">J. JONES, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AZ_\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">I reluctantly concur in the Court\u2019s Opinion because, in light of the language contained in I.C. \u00a7 67-5246(5), I simply can\u2019t read I.C. \u00a7 67-5246(4) to allow more than 21 days for an agency head to decide a motion for reconsideration on the merits. Were it not for subsection (5), I could accept IDWR\u2019s argument that an agency head can dispose of a reconsideration petition by entering an order, within the 21-day period, agreeing to reconsider, but not actually deciding it on the merits within that period, as per IDWR\u2019s argument referenced in footnote 2 of the Opinion. However, due to the wording of I.C. \u00a7 67-5246(5), that argument simply will not wash. It may be that the intent of the drafters was as argued by IDWR but the legislative language was simply inadequate to carry out that intent. Since IDWR\u2019s argument is based solely on the legislative language, the Court\u2019s Opinion is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">That being said, the conclusion dictated by the statute does not appear to be advisable policy. In an important and complicated case, such as most water cases are, it makes little sense to allow the agency head to have only 21 days in which to make a decision on a motion for reconsideration. Granted, the garden variety reconsideration motion that presents itself in the garden variety case may be amenable to such a limited time frame. However, in a complicated case such a limitation does not particularly lend itself to thoughtful, informed decision-making. The statutory limitation lends itself to speed, rather than quality. In cases where the movant presents valid concerns, the agency head is faced with three alternatives \u2014 drop everything else and devote full attention to the movant\u2019s concerns, respond with a less-than-informed effort, or simply deny the motion outright. But, as the Opinion suggests, any policy correction with respect to the statute is in the legislative arena.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">One further observation is appropriate with regard to the objective of this appeal. If the objective was to speed along appellate consideration of the final order issued by IDWR on April 27, 2011, it is not clear that such objective has been well served. Indeed, the consideration of that order on appeal has been delayed about a year and a half, while the parties have contested the 21-day issue. A&amp;B filed its motion for reconsideration on May 11, 2011. Apparently, it did so because it was unhappy with the final order and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>sought changes. The decision on the merits was not forthcoming until June 30, 2011, clearly beyond the 21-day period. However, the decision on the merits was made shortly after the deadline, and the appeal from that decision would likely have come before this Court well before the time frame in which the appeal of the initial final order will be considered. When asked at oral argument why A &amp; B chose to appeal on the timeliness issue, counsel responded that it was for the purpose of expediting action by IDWR. It is questionable whether that objective has been attained. Consideration of the initial order on the merits has been substantially delayed and the appeal will involve a final order that A &amp; B was apparently not happy with in the first place.</p>\n<judges id=\"b693-4\">Chief Justice BURDICK concurs.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
