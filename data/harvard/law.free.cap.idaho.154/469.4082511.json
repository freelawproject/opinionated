Hansen was involved in an automobile accident with the respondent Matthew Roberts (Roberts). At trial, Hansen sought to recover damages for his injuries and Roberts sought to recover property damage for his vehicle. The jury found Hansen to be 90% at fault and awarded Roberts damages for his vehicle. Hansen now appeals the Bonneville County district court\u2019s decision to allow Roberts\u2019s experts, an accident reconstructionist and a biomechanical engineer, to testify. Hansen also appeals the district court\u2019s ruling that he waived his objections to Roberts\u2019s deposition testimony. Finally, Hansen appeals the district court\u2019s decision to grant Roberts\u2019s motion in limine so far as it limited him from asking whether prospective jurors or one of their family members were or had ever been employed by an insurance carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">Hansen and Roberts were in a car crash that caused injuries to Hansen and property damage to Roberts\u2019s vehicle. Hansen was making a right hand turn into a business parking stall when Roberts hit the passenger side of his vehicle while attempting to pass Hansen on the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-15\">On May 26, 2009, Hansen filed a complaint against Roberts to recover damages for the injuries he sustained in the car accident. Three months later Roberts filed a small claims complaint for the damage to his car. Pursuant to a stipulation between the parties, these two matters were consolidated into one case.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-16\">A jury trial was held on October 19, 2010. Hansen was able to present his entire case on this first day of trial. After the conclusion of the first day of trial, Roberts received news that a matching liver had been found for him. The court continued the trial and the second day of trial was held on December 15, 2010. Because of Roberts\u2019s condition following the transplant, he was not able to appear in court and the parties arranged to have his trial testimony videotaped. Both parties made objections during Roberts\u2019s testimony, which were included on the video with the understanding that the court would rule on these objections before trial. On the second day of trial, Hansen moved to raise the objections he made in Roberts\u2019s deposition testimony before the video was played for the jury. The court concluded that Hansen had waived these objections by not presenting them at the pretrial conference when the court addressed Roberts\u2019s objections. Hansen also sought to exclude Roberts\u2019s expert testimony from Scott Kimbrough, an accident reconstructionist, and John Droge, a biomechanical engineer, as untimely and insufficient. The court heard argument from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>both parties and ruled that the experts would be allowed to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Following trial, the jury returned a verdict finding both parties at fault and attributing 90% of the negligence to Hansen and 10% of the negligence to Roberts. The trial court then entered a judgment awarding Roberts $3,399.14 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">II.Issues on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">1. Whether the trial court abused its discretion by allowing Roberts to introduce expert testimony from an accident reconstructionist and a biomechanical engineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">2. Whether the trial court abused its discretion by ruling that Hansen waived the right to object at trial to the introduction of portions of Roberts\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">3. Whether the trial court abused its discretion by partially granting Hansen\u2019s motion in limine to limit references to insurance during voir dire and trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">III.Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">\u201cWhen reviewing the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, this Court applies an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Edmunds v. Kraner, 142 </em>Idaho 867, 871, 136 P.3d 338, 342 (2006). \u201cThese include trial court decisions admitting or excluding expert witness testimony, and excluding evidence on the basis that it is more prejudicial than probative.\u201d <em>Perry v. Magic Valley Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>134 Idaho 46, 50-51, 995 P.2d 816, 820-21 (2000) (internal citation omitted). The scope of voir dire examinations is also within the discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Bitz, </em>93 Idaho 239, 244, 460 P.2d 374, 379 (1969). To determine whether a trial court has abused its discretion, this Court considers whether the district court: (1) perceived the issue as one of discretion; (2) acted within the outer boundaries of that discretion consistent with applicable legal standards; and (3) reached its decision through the exercise of reason. <em>Chapman v. Chapman, </em>147 Idaho 756, 760, 215 P.3d 476, 480 (2009). Even where a trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling is an abuse of its discretion, the ruling will not be disturbed on appeal unless the admission or exclusion of evidence affected a substantial right of the party. I.R.C.P. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">IV.Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">A. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing Roberts to introduce expert testimony from an accident reconstructionist and a biomechanical engineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">Hansen challenges the trial court\u2019s admission of Roberts\u2019s expert testimony in three ways: (1) Roberts\u2019s pretrial expert disclosures were untimely and insufficient; (2) the testimony invaded the province of the jury; and (3) there was a lack of foundation to support the opinions because they were not scientifically reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-15\">\n<em>1. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting expert testimony disclosed after the court\u2019s scheduling deadline.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b508-16\">Hansen claims that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing Roberts to introduce testimony from expert witnesses when Roberts violated the trial court\u2019s scheduling order and failed to make timely and sufficient pretrial disclosures pursuant to discovery requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-17\">In this case, the district court issued an order requiring disclosure of expert witnesses at least 90 days before trial (or by July 21, 2010) and that discovery should be completed 70 days before trial (or by August 9, 2010). However, the court included the following footnote with respect to these deadlines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-18\">The disclosure cut-off date, discovery completion date and motion dates are for the benefit of the Court in managing this case. They will be enforced at the Court\u2019s discretion. The disclosure date should not be relied on for discovery purposes. The disclosure, discovery and motion dates will not be modified by the Court without a hearing and assurance from parties that the modification will not necessitate continuance of the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-19\">Therefore, the court recognized and established from the outset that enforcement of these deadlines was within its discretion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>that these deadlines were put in place for the benefit of the court, not the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Both parties present substantial argument in their briefs as to why their disclosures were timely and the other party\u2019s disclosures were untimely. Looking at the record, both parties produced somewhat untimely disclosures and discovery. Hansen argues that Roberts\u2019s disclosures were untimely and insufficient as to Scott Kimbrough, an accident reconstructionist, and John Droge, a biomechanical engineer. He points out that Roberts\u2019s responses to his Rule 26(b)(4) disclosure requests were submitted past the deadline the court set in its scheduling hearing and that Roberts did not disclose Droge until a few weeks before trial. Hansen is correct that some of Roberts\u2019s disclosures were made just weeks before trial began on October 19, 2010, but he ignores the fact that some of his own disclosures came just weeks before trial began. Roberts presented his entire ease on October 19, 2010, and then the trial was delayed until December 15, 2010. Thus, Hansen had significantly more time to prepare for Roberts\u2019s experts than Roberts had to prepare for Hansen\u2019s experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Moreover, Hansen did not raise the issue of untimely disclosures until the second day of trial, which was almost two months after the trial began. When Hansen sought exclusion of the expert testimony based on untimely disclosures, he had actually been in possession of the disclosures for well over two months. Consequently, Hansen had significant time to prepare for Roberts\u2019s experts during the recess of trial. Because the trial court explicitly stated in its scheduling order that disclosure and discovery deadlines would be enforced at its discretion, both parties produced disclosures past this deadline, and Hansen had significant time to prepare for Roberts\u2019s experts, the trial court was within the bounds of its discretion when it ruled that Roberts\u2019s experts could testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u00a18. <em>Hansen did not preserve his objections to Kimbrough\u2019s testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Hansen next argues that the court erred in allowing Kimbrough to testify because his testimony invaded the province of the jury. Hansen argues that Kimbrough invaded the province of the jury because he \u201cdid nothing beyond review the evidence that was presented to the jurors to reach his conclusions.\u201d Hansen also argues that Kimbrough invaded the province of the jury in the specific instance when he stated \u201cthat this accident was precipitated by a careless right-hand turn by [Hansen].\u201d Roberts responds that Kimbrough did not invade the province of the jury because he provided information not known to the jury and not within the jury\u2019s common knowledge. Roberts further contends that Hansen waived his objections to Kimbrough\u2019s testimony because he failed to object to the questions asked during the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">At the start of Kimbrough\u2019s testimony, Hansen asked the court if he could \u201cmake an objection to all of his testimony as to invading the province of the jury,\u201d but did not explain how Kimbrough\u2019s testimony invaded the province of the jury. The court noted Hansen\u2019s continuing objection and allowed Kimbrough to testify. Hansen did not object to individual questions asked on direct examination nor did he object to Kimbrough\u2019s opinion that Hansen\u2019s right hand turn had been careless.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">For an objection to be preserved for appellate review, \u201ceither the specific ground for the objection must be clearly stated, or the basis of the objection must be apparent from the context.\u201d <em>Slack v. Kelleher, </em>140 Idaho 916, 921, 104 P.3d 958, 963 (2004); I.R.E. 103(a)(1). For example, this Court has held that an objection that \u201cno proper foundation has been laid,\u201d was not sufficiently specific because it failed to state \u201cwherein the foundation for the opinion was insufficient.\u201d <em>Hobbs v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., </em>62 Idaho 58, 74, 108 P.2d 841, 849 (1940). In <em>Hobbs, </em>the grounds for the objection were not stated with specificity, nor were the grounds apparent from the context of the testimony. It follows that a continuing objection made at the start of testimony would need to specifically state the grounds for the objection because there would be no context from which to determine the basis for the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Hansen\u2019s broad, general objection that Kimbrough\u2019s testimony invaded the province of the jury is not a proper objection to preserve either of his challenges to Kimbrough\u2019s testimony under Idaho Rule of Evidence 702. Under I.R.E. 702, an expert witness may provide an opinion \u201c[i]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d Therefore, after the court qualifies a witness as an expert, it \u201cmust determine whether such expert opinion testimony will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Pearce, </em>146 Idaho 241, 246, 192 P.3d 1065, 1070 (2008). Pursuant to I.R.E. 704, an expert\u2019s testimony is not inadmissible merely because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided in the case; however, \u201c[e]xpert testimony that concerns conclusions or opinions that the average juror is qualified to draw from the facts utilizing the juror\u2019s common sense and normal experience is inadmissible.\u201d <em>State v. Ellington, </em>151 Idaho 53, 66, 253 P.3d 727, 740 (2011). Additionally, evidence is generally inadmissible under I.R.E. 702 if it vouches for the credibility of another witness. <em>State v. Perry, </em>139 Idaho 520, 525, 81 P.3d 1230, 1235 (2003). Thus, there are a number of different reasons an attorney may object to evidence on I.R.E. 702 grounds and an objection that expert testimony invades the province of the jury, without more, is not sufficiently specific to preserve an objection to any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Moreover, a broad continuing objection not based upon the proper standard or ground and made at the start of Kimbrough\u2019s testimony did not preserve an objection to Kimbrough\u2019s opinion that the accident was precipitated by Hansen\u2019s careless right-hand turn. Continuing objections are difficult for trial courts to properly police unless there has been a meaningful argument and specific ruling on the subject matter of the objection. Proper practice is to frame an objection as to the specific area that preserves it for appellate review and then request a continuing objection on that ground. If it is not clear to the trial court as to the specific area, the court should inquire further.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">In this case, Hansen objected to all of Kimbrough\u2019s testimony as invading the province of the jury at the start of his testimony when Kimbrough had only explained his qualifications and what accident reconstruction generally entails. Hansen gave no explanation as to why Kimbrough\u2019s testimony was inadmissible nor was there any context from which to determine the basis for the objection. Therefore, we hold that Hansen\u2019s objections to Kimbrough\u2019s testimony were not preserved for consideration on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">\n<em>S. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by overruling Hansen\u2019s objection to the admission of Droge\u2019s expert testimony as a biomechanical engineer.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Hansen argues that the trial court erred by allowing Droge to testify because Roberts failed to provide adequate foundation that Droge\u2019s testimony concerning biomechanical engineering was scientifically reliable. Roberts responds that Hansen failed to preserve his objections and even if he did preserve them, Droge\u2019s area of expertise is valid and scientifically reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">On appeal, Hansen provides substantial argument questioning the scientific reliability of biomechanical engineering. However, none of this argument was presented to the trial court. Rather, Hansen merely objected that insufficient foundation has been laid and stated that, \u201cbiomechanical engineering isn\u2019t considered a legitimate science.\u201d Following this objection, Roberts proceeded to lay more foundation for Droge\u2019s testimony including an explanation of what biomechanical engineering is and where Droge received his masters in biomechanical engineering. Hansen then asserted the same objection and declined to cross-examine Droge in aid of his objection.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">While Hansen may have preserved his objection to the foundation of Droge\u2019s testimony, he cannot now argue more grounds than were before the trial court. See <em>Slack, </em>140 Idaho at 922, 104 P.3d at 964. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Hansen merely stated that biomechanical engineering was not a legitimate science, but provided no factual or legal explanation to support this objection. After Hansen\u2019s first objection, Droge expounded upon the science of biomechanical engineering and his qualifications as an expert. \u201cWhether or not a proper foundation has been laid for the admission of the evidence is a discretionary decision to be made by the trial court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 921, 104 P.3d at 963. Hansen provided nothing to contradict Droge\u2019s testimony and declined to cross-examine Droge in aid of his objection. If Hansen had presented any of the evidence or argument he now raises on appeal, we might have more of a question as to whether the trial court abused its discretion in admitting Droge\u2019s testimony. Indeed, the trial court may have made a different ruling. However, under the circumstances in this case we cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting Droge\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">B. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by ruling that Hansen waived the right to object at trial to the introduction of portions of Roberts\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Hansen argues that he did not waive his objections to Roberts\u2019s deposition testimony and he has the right to object to this testimony at trial under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 32(b). He also asserts that Roberts introduced a substantial amount of inadmissible evidence that was harmful to his case. Roberts responds that Hansen waived his objections by not addressing them at the scheduled hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">After the first day of trial on October 20, 2010, Roberts received news that a matching liver had been found and he had to leave immediately for a transplant. The trial was continued until December 15, 2010. Because of his weakened immune system and inability to travel, his trial testimony was videotaped. Both parties made objections which were included on the video with the understanding that the court would rule on these objections before trial. Roberts filed a motion with his objections before trial and the court decided this motion would be addressed at the jury instruction conference that had already been set for December 8, 2010. Hansen did not file a motion with his objections and claims that Roberts told him he would be provided with a transcript of the deposition, but it was never provided. Hansen claims that Roberts only brought a partial transcript to the December 8 hearing and so he was unable to address his objections. Roberts responds that Hansen never requested a transcript and it was not Roberts\u2019s duty to raise Hansen\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">At trial on December 15, 2010, Hansen moved to raise his objections contained in Roberts\u2019s deposition testimony for the first time. The trial court concluded that Roberts had waived these objections by not presenting them at the December 8 hearing. The court stated that it had a hearing the week before trial to address the objections so that the video could be edited before trial. Hansen did not raise any objections at this hearing, nor did he state that he needed a transcript of the video.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 32(b) states, \u201cSubject to the provisions of subdivision (d) of this rule, objection may be made at the trial or hearing to receiving in evidence any deposition or part thereof for any reason which would require the exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and testifying.\u201d The language of the rule provides that objections may be made \u201cat the trial or hearing to receiving in evidence any deposition.\u201d In this case the court received the evidence of the video deposition at a hearing specifically set for objections, not trial. Hansen was free to raise any of his objections at this hearing, but failed to do so. Therefore, he waived his objections to portions of Roberts\u2019s video testimony. The trial court was \"within its discretion when it ruled that Hansen had waived any objections to the deposition testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">C. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by partially granting Roberts\u2019s motion in limine to limit references to insurance during voir dire and trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">Hansen argues that the trial court abused its discretion by prohibiting Hansen from asking during voir dire whether a pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>spective juror or a prospective juror\u2019s family member was or had ever been employed by an insurance carrier. Roberts responds that Hansen did not preserve this argument for appeal because the only objection Hansen made to his motion in limine was that he wanted to be able to ask jurors about both their current occupations and that of their spouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">A review of the trial transcript indicates that Hansen never mentions wanting to ask if prospective jurors or their family members were or had ever been employed by an insurance carrier. His only objections related to the question of whether the jurors or their spouses worked for insurance companies. In response to this objection the court made sure that these questions were on the juror questionnaire and indicated that if jurors failed to fill out their employment or that of their spouses it would be remedied. Hansen failed to object to this decision and responded that he had nothing further on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Generally Idaho\u2019s appellate courts will not consider an alleged error on appeal unless a timely objection to the alleged error was made at trial. <em>State v. Perry, </em>150 Idaho 209, 224, 245 P.3d 961, 976 (2010); I.R.E. 103(a)(1). For an objection to be preserved for appellate review, \u201ceither the specific ground for the objection must be clearly stated, or the basis of the objection must be apparent from the context.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>140 Idaho at 921, 104 P.3d at 963; I.R.E. 103(a)(1). The only exception to this rule is when plain error occurs as I.R.E. 103 does not \u201cpreclude[ ] taking notice of plain errors affecting substantial rights although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\u201d I.R.E. 103(d). The court\u2019s decision to grant Roberts\u2019s motion in limine excluding questioning on insurance except with regard to the occupation of a juror or the juror\u2019s spouse was not plain error. Therefore, this Court will not consider this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">D. Roberts is not entitled to attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Roberts claims that he is entitled to attorney fees pursuant to <em>LG. </em>\u00a7 12-121 and I.R.C.P. 54(e)(1) because Hansen\u2019s position is not supported by Idaho law and he does not argue or include any support for a change in Idaho law.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Idaho Code section 12-121 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-10\">In any civil action, the judge may award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party or parties, provided that this section shall not alter, repeal or amend any statute which otherwise provides for the award of attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">This Court only awards attorney fees under this statute when \u201can appeal was brought, pursued, or defended in a manner that was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201d <em>Clair v. Clair, </em>153 Idaho 278, 291, 281 P.3d 115, 128 (2012). Because Hansen did not pursue this appeal frivolously, unreasonably, or without foundation, Roberts is not entitled to attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting expert testimony over Hansen\u2019s objections. Nor did the trial court abuse its discretion by determining that Hansen waived his objections to Roberts\u2019s video testimony. Costs, but not attorney fees, are awarded to Roberts as the prevailing party.</p>\n<judges id=\"b512-14\">Justices EISMANN, J. JONES, W.
