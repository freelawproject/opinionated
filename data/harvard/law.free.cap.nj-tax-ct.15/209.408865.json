The judgments, consonant with the judge\u2019s extensive opinion, set the true land value of the property at $9,670,000 for tax year 1990; $45,065,700 for tax year 1991; and $39,290,400 for tax year 1992. Defendant, Township of Weehawken, appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Our scope of review is narrowly circumscribed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">The judges presiding in the Tax Court have special expertise; for that reason their findings will not be disturbed unless they are plainly arbitrary or there is a lack of substantial evidence to support them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-13\"><em>[Glenpointe Assoc. v. Township of Teaneck, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>37, 46, 574 A.2d 459 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>391, 585 A.2d 392 (1990).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">After review of the record, we are satisfied there is substantial credible evidence to sustain the judge\u2019s valuations of the subject property. Consequently, we affirm for essentially the reasons expressed by Judge Crabtree in his extensive opinion decided April 4, 1994, but add several comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-15\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, rejection of expert valuation on the ground that the magnitude of adjustments to a sales price destroys its probative value is a well-recognized practice. <em>M.I. Holdings, Inc. v. Jersey City, </em>12 <em>N.J.Tax </em>129 (Tax 1991); <em>Owens-Illinois Glass Co. v. Bridgeton, </em>8 <em>N.J. Tax </em>495 (Tax 1986). Defendant\u2019s adjustments ranging from 90% to 140% essentially admit on their face the sales offered were neither comparable to nor probative of the subject property\u2019s value. <em>See Badische Corp. v. Kearny, </em>11 <em>N.J.Tax </em>385 (Tax 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-16\">Furthermore, defendant\u2019s argument that the judge accepted plaintiffs expert\u2019s valuation and rejected that of defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>expert even though the latter was equally probative of value is without merit. In fact, the judge rejected plaintiffs sales 3, 7, and 8 because of the magnitude of gross adjustments to the sales prices. Because the non-time related gross adjustments to plaintiffs comparable sales ranged from 35% to 55% compared to defendant\u2019s 90% to 140%, the judge was justified in accepting plaintiffs comparables and rejecting those of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The judge was , also justified in rejecting defendant\u2019s per acre method of valuation in favor of a buildable density approach to determining value in light of the property\u2019s highest and best use as a mixed use planned community. <em>See Frieman v. Randolph Tp., </em>8 <em>N.J.Tax </em>264, 273 (Tax 1986), <em>aff'd, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>507, 524 A32d 453 (App.Div.1987) (explaining that it is practicable to value land sold for multi-family residential development by the number of units that can be built on the property); <em>Badische v. Kearny, supra, </em>11 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 394 (explaining that the valuation approach most suitable depends on the facts of the case). Zoning approvals for Port Imperial South demonstrated that the open space requirements and height limitations of the subject property restricted the acreage actually available for development.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In sum, defendant\u2019s challenges to the judge\u2019s findings and conclusions fail to establish any basis for disturbing the judgments at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
