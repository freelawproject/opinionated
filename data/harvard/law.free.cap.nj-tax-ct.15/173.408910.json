In making such written request for information pursuant to this section the assessor shall enclose therewith a copy of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-10\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">On April 2, 1992, the Manalapan Tax Assessor forwarded to Summerton the statutory request for income and expense data by certified mail. It was received the following day, evidenced by a return receipt. It is undisputed that no response to the request was made within forty-five days. In fact, no formal response to that request was ever made.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">At the time of the statutory request, Summerton and the Township were engaged in discussions relative to Summerton\u2019s 1992 tax appeal. By letter dated August 11, 1992, counsel for Summerton forwarded to the Township\u2019s counsel information relevant to evaluation of the income producing capability of the shopping eenter, in answer to interrogatories concerning the 1992 appeal. The 1992 appeal was later withdrawn by Summerton, and a judgment of dismissal was entered in the Tax Court on March 24, 1993. Summerton then appealed the 1993 assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">The Township moved for summary judgment based upon Summerton\u2019s failure to comply with the statutory request. The Tax Court granted the motion for summary judgment, subject to a \u201creasonableness\u201d hearing. <em>See Ocean Pines Ltd. v. Borough of PL Pleasant, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>1, 11, 547 A.2d 691 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Although a reasonableness hearing was requested by Summer-ton, its request was withdrawn. Judgment dismissing the tax appeal was then entered by the Tax Court on December 10, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Summerton argues on appeal that the Tax Court erred in dismissing the appeal because the documents relating to the income of its property had been provided in the course of discovery for the 1992 appeal on or about August 11, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Although conceding that it failed to respond to the assessor\u2019s N.J.S.A. 54:4-34 request, Summerton argues that it \u201csubstantially complied\u201d because the tax assessor had access to information which would have enabled the assessor to fulfil the statutory assessment duties in timely fashion. Summerton urges that it is unfair for it to suffer the sanction of dismissal of its appeal because the \u201cstatute\u2019s spirit is designed to insure that the assessor receives the evaluation data\u201d, and it essentially contends that the assessor must be charged with awareness of the materials received by the Township\u2019s counsel during discovery on the 1992 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Summerton\u2019s arguments are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11\u2014 3(e)(1)(E); <em>Ocean Pines, supra, 112 N.J. </em>at 7-8, 547 A.2d 691. <em>See also Carriage Four Associates v. Teaneck Twp., </em>13 <em>N.J.Tax </em>172 (Tax 1993); <em>Terrace View Gardens v. Dover Twp., </em>5 <em>N.J.Tax </em>469 (Tax 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">We are not at liberty to tamper with the plain language of the statute which mandates dismissal of an appeal not preceded by timely compliance with the assessor\u2019s demand, subject to the reasonableness exception recognized in <em>Ocean Pines. </em>Summer-ton\u2019s withdrawal of the reasonableness hearing request removed the basis for appeal. We note that no \u201cgood cause\u201d argument was here proffered to explain non-compliance, nor is any reasonable basis therefor apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">It was not \u201cunfair\u201d to require timely compliance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34 in order to assist the assessor in meeting the assessment deadline for all properties in the taxing district. Special treatment for one requires special treatment for all, thwarting efficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>operation of the assessment process. As to the argument that the material given to a municipal attorney in connection with one appeal should be deemed to have \u201csubstantially complied\u201d with the assessor\u2019s <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-34 demand respecting the 1993 assessment, we think that the Legislature meant the assessor\u2019s request notice to the taxpayer must be clear cut and certified, and similarly that the response should be directed to the assessor, rather than charging the assessor with knowledge of information in the hands of other municipal entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">To the extent the taxpayer relies on the information said to have been known to the assessor, this could easily have been explored in the reasonableness hearing, had the request not been withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
