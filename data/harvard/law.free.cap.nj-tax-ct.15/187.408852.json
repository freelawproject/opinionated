Maxwell Company. This judgment is based on a written decision by Judge Lario reported at 13 <em>N.J.Tax </em>519 (Tax 1993) which concludes that the billboards are taxable as real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">We affirm substantially for the reasons set forth in Judge Lario\u2019s opinion. However, some limited supplemental discussion is appropriate with respect to his conclusion that billboards are \u201cordinarily intended to be affixed permanently to real property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">The definition of taxable real property contained in <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:4-1 was added by chapter 117 of the Laws of 1986. As observed by the Tax Court, sitting <em>en banc </em>in <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. City of Perth Amboy, </em>9 <em>N.J.Tax </em>205, 227 (Tax 1987), \u201c[u]ndisputedly the purpose and object of c. 117 is to tax as real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>property certain property which under prior law may have been taxable as personal property.\u201d To achieve this objective, the Legislature provided, among other things, that personal property affixed to real property would be exempt from taxation as real property pursuant <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:4 \u2014 1(a) only if it is \u201cnot ordinarily intended to be affixed permanently to real property.\u201d \u201cThe use of the word \u2018ordinarily\u2019 before the word \u2018intended\u2019 shifts the focus of the inquiry from what is actually intended ... to what is \u2018ordinarily intended\u2019 with respect to property.\u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A, Inc. v. City of Perth Amboy, supra, </em>9 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 242. \u201c[T]he fact that property is removable without physical injury to it or the real property to which it is affixed does not stand in the way of the conclusion ... that the same property is ordinarily intended to be affixed permanently to the real property.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, \u201coutward appearances are a relevant consideration\u201d in determining \u201cordinary intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Applying these principles, Judge Lario correctly concluded that wooden billboards, as described in the certification of David C. Maxwell, the President of plaintiff R.C. Maxwell Company, and depicted in the diagrams attached to his certification, are ordinarily intended to be affixed permanently to real property. The billboards are constructed on site and the fourteen vertical anchors and beams of the structure are sunk six feet into the ground, conveying an appearance of permanency on the site. Moreover, although a billboard may be taken down in a way which preserves most of its component parts for salvage, plaintiffs do not allege that a billboard can be moved intact or that the salvageable component parts are ever reassembled as the same billboard at a new site.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Although the trial court\u2019s findings also might justify a conclusion that wooden billboards are \u201cimprovements\u201d to real property, see <em>Koester v. Hunterdon County Bd. of Taxation, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>381, 392-93, 399 A.2d 656 (1979), we agree with Judge Lario that even if these billboards are viewed as \u201cpersonal property affixed to ... real property,\u201d plaintiffs failed to present evidence which could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>justify a conclusion that they are \u201cnot ordinarily intended to be affixed permanently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
