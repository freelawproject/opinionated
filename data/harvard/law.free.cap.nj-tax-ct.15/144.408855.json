It argues that payment of such charges should not be held to be a condition for maintaining a real estate tax appeal. Judge Andrew, in a well-reasoned opinion, concluded that the statute required plaintiff to pay all such municipal charges in addition to real estate taxes before it could maintain a tax appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">We affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Andrew in his August 25,1992 opinion, reported at 12 <em>N.J.Tax </em>581 (Tax 1992).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
