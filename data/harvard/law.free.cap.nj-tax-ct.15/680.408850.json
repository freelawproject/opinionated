Appellant alleged that he had timely mailed the application, but he had no proof of mailing and could not produce a copy of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Appellant appealed the denial to the County Tax Board and his appeal was rejected. Appellant then appealed the County Tax Board\u2019s determination to the Tax Court by filing a complaint. Appellant mailed the complaint to the Tax Court a few days before expiration of the statutory limitation period contained in <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:51A-9(a). The Tax Court received the complaint for filing eight days after the limitation period had expired. Judge Hamill dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint deeming the statutory limitation period to be jurisdictional and also denied appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Appellant appeals the Tax Court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint, and we affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Hamill in her oral opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
