Neff appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration of a prior order dismissing his hybrid complaint seeking relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000). To the extent Neff appeals the denial of relief under \u00a7 2241, he may not do so unless a circuit judge or justice issues a certificate of appealability. A certificate of appealability will not issue ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>sent a \u201csubstantial showing of hte denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A habeas petitioner meets this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Neff has not made the requisite showing. Therefore, we deny a certificate of appealability as to Neffs \u00a7 2241 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">To the extent that Neff appeals the denial of his motion to reconsider the denial of relief on his \u00a7 1983 claim, we find no error in the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court as to Neffs \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>See Neff v. Warden, Maryland House of Corr., </em>No. CA-04-2327-RDB (D. Md. filed Sept. 17, 2004 &amp; entered Sept. 20, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
