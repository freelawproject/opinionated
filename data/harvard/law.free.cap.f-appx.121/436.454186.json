We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case. On this appeal, Jen principally challenges the BIA\u2019s determination that he failed to establish eligibility for relief under the CAT on the basis of his detention and his wife\u2019s alleged forcible sterilization. Jen\u2019s single, wholly conclusory statement that if he is returned to China he would be arrested and persecuted is not sufficient objective evidence to satisfy the CAT\u2019s standard that he will more likely than not be tortured upon his return to China. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 144 (2d Cir.2003).</p><p id=\"b461-5\">To the extent that Jen challenges the BIA\u2019s finding that he failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal independent of the CAT claim,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we reject the challenge. The BIA did not err in affirming the IJ\u2019s finding that Jen\u2019s failure to submit corroborating evidence undermined his claim. <em>See Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 153 (2d Cir.2003) (holding that \u201can immigration judge has the authority to deny eligibility for asylum in some cases where the applicant has failed to provide certain corroborative documents, even though the applicant testified credibly to facts that, if true, would qualify h[im] for refugee status,\u201d so long as the IJ identifies the missing documents and establishes their availability); <em>see also Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 285 (2d Cir.2000); <em>In re S-M-J-, 21 </em>I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 722, 724 (BIA 1997). In particular, the BIA did not err in affirming the IJ\u2019s determination that a corroborative affidavit from Jen\u2019s wife, with whom he remained in contact after leaving China and who supplied documentary exhibits, was both highly material to Jen\u2019s claim and readily available. <em>See Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 78 (2d Cir.2004) (noting that an IJ could reasonably require an affidavit from an applicant\u2019s spouse where she sent other documentary evidence).</p><p id=\"b461-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p><p id=\"b461-6\">. Jen does not challenge the IJ\u2019s finding that his asylum claim was untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2).</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
