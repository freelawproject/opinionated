This transfer required Buddy to ride a special school bus used to transport disabled children instead of a regular school bus, and required him to share a transliterator with another hearing impaired student instead of having a private transliterator.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2018When an action is brought under the IDEA, our inquiry is two-fold: (1) whether \u2018the [IEP] developed through the Act\u2019s procedures [is] reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits\u2019; and (2) whether the school district has \u2018complied with the procedures set forth in the [IDEA].\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIf these requirements are met, the State has complied with the obligations imposed by Congress and the courts can require no more.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">The gravamen of the Veazeys\u2019 complaint is that the School Board\u2019s decision to transfer Buddy to the \u201ccluster\u201d school constituted a change in his \u201ceducational placement,\u201d requiring the Board to provide them with prior written notice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because notice was provided only after the decision to transfer Buddy was made, the Veazeys contend that their rights under the IDEA were violated. The Veazeys have not shown that the School Board\u2019s actions were improper. First, a change in the particular school site at which a disabled student\u2019s \u201cindividualized education program\u201d (IEP) is implemented does not constitute a change in \u201ceducational placement.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, Buddy\u2019s IEP did not require the provision of a personal transliterator. Third, requiring Buddy to ride the special bus for disabled children instead of the regular bus did not effect a fundamental change in his IEP.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Lastly, we can find no evidence that these changes in any way alter the fact that Buddy\u2019s IEP is reasonably calculated to enable him to receive educational benefits by providing him with the \u201crequisite basic floor of opportunity.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">Accordingly, the Veazeys have not shown that the district court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>granting the School Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b576-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
