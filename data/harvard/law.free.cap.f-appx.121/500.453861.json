Harrower pled guilty to four counts of making false statements on a loan application, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1014 (West Supp.2004), and was sentenced to five months imprisonment, to be followed by five years supervised release, with five months of home confinement as a special condition of supervised release. Harrower appeals, contending that <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), applies to the sentencing guidelines and that the district court thus erred in finding as a fact that his offense involved a scheme to defraud more than one victim and making a two-level enhancement pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(2) (1998). Harrower preserved this issue for appeal by raising it in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-27\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (Nos.04-104/05), the Supreme Court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>that <em>Blakely </em>applies to the federal sentencing guidelines and that the guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory. In light of the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker, </em>we vacate Harrower\u2019s sentence and remand the case for resentencing. We grant Harrow-er\u2019s motion to submit on the briefs; the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
