Jones filed a civil action against Defendants, Scotland County<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and Scotland County Sheriff, Wayne Bryant, under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Jones alleged that he was wrongfully discharged in retaliation for his opposition to discriminatory conduct, in violation of Title VII and the First Amendment. The jury found Bryant individually liable for violating Jones\u2019 rights under Title VII, and found in favor of Bryant on Jones\u2019 First Amendment claim. The jury awarded Jones $25,000 in damages. Following the trial, Jones\u2019 counsel moved for attorney\u2019s fees and costs in excess of $150,000, as well as equitable relief. The district court ultimately granted approximately $16,000 in fees and denied Jones\u2019 request for equitable relief. Jones now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">On appeal, Jones asserts that the district court erroneously calculated reasonable attorney\u2019s fees by failing to assess the twelve factors set forth in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir.1974), and adopted by this Court in <em>Barber v. Kimbrell\u2019s Inc., </em>577 F.2d 216, 226 (4th Cir.1978). On cross appeal, Bryant asserts that Jones is not entitled to any fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s decision awarding or denying attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. <em>See Johnson v. City of Aiken, </em>278 F.3d 333, 336 (4th Cir. 2002). When attorney\u2019s fees and costs are permissible, a federal court determines the award by first determining the lodestar amount (reasonable hourly rate multiplied by hours reasonably expended), applying the <em>Johnson/Barber </em>factors when making the lodestar determination. <em>See Trimper v. City of Norfolk, </em>58 F.3d 68, 73-74 (4th Cir.1995); <em>Daly v. Hill, </em>790 F.2d 1071, 1078 (4th Cir.1986). However, \u201ca request for attorneys\u2019 fees, which is so exorbitant as to shock the conscience of the court, may be denied without an analysis of the [,Johnson/Barber] factors.\u201d <em>Sun Pub. Co., Inc. v. Mecklenburg News, Inc., </em>823 F.2d 818, 819 (4th Cir.1987). We conclude that, given the facts of this case, counsel\u2019s request for more than $150,000 in fees so shocks the conscience that the district court was not required to analyze the request for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the factors enunciated in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Barber. </em>Nonetheless, despite counsel\u2019s exorbitant request, we conclude that the district court\u2019s award of $16,000 in fees was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See City of Aiken, </em>278 F.3d at 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Jones also contends that the district court abused its discretion by denying his request for equitable relief in the form of the removal of \u201call negative inferences\u201d from his personnel file and a permanent injunction prohibiting Bryant from disclosing any purged information. The district court has \u201cbroad equitable discretion to fashion remedies to make the plaintiff whole for injuries resulting from a violation\u201d of Title VII. <em>Brinkley-Obu v. Hughes Training, Inc., </em>36 F.3d 336, 356 (4th Cir. 1994). A decision to grant or deny an injunction likewise rests within the discretion of the district court. <em>See Resorts of Pinehurst, Inc. v. Pinehurst Nat\u2019l Corp., </em>148 F.3d 417, 423 (4th Cir.1998). After careful review of the relevant law and the facts before us, we find no abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of equitable relief. We dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>pense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\"> On October 25, 2004, this court granted Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss Scotland County as a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
