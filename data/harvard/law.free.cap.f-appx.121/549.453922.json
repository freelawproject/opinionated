Gibson appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights action filed pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), alleging that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and BOP officers denied his right to participate in a BOP drug treatment program. The district court dismissed Gibson\u2019s claims against the BOP and BOP officers in their official capacities as barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity; the district court dismissed Gibson\u2019s claims against BOP officers in their individual capacities as frivolous and for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-24\">Gibson first argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint without giving him notice and an opportunity to amend it. A district court need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>give a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 plaintiff notice or opportunity to amend her complaint before it is dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. <em>Graves v. Hampton, </em>1 F.3d 315, 318 n. 12 (5th Cir.1993), <em>abrogated, on other grounds, Arvie v. Broussard, </em>42 F.3d 249, 250 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also Christiansen v. Clarke, </em>147 F.3d 655, 658 (8th Cir.1998) (upholding the <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of an <em>in forma pauperis </em>prisoner\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim). Therefore, Gibson was not entitled to notice and an opportunity to amend his complaint before the dismissal of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Gibson argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claims against the BOP and its officials in their official capacity as barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Gibson may bring a <em>Bivens </em>action against individual officers for a alleged constitutional violation, but he may not bring an action against the United States, the BOP, or BOP officers in their official capacities as such claims are barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. <em>See Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, </em>534 U.S. 61, 71-72, 122 S.Ct. 515, 151 L.Ed.2d 456 (2001); see <em>also Hafer v. Melo, </em>502 U.S. 21, 25, 112 S.Ct. 358, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991) (claims against employees in official capacities are considered a suit against the government entity).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Gibson also argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claims against BOP officers in their individual capacities as barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The record reflects that the district court dismissed his claims against BOP officers in their individual capacities as frivolous and for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae and (ii). Therefore, this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Gibson argues that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his claims against the BOP officers in their individual capacities. He argues the BOP violated his constitutional rights, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621, and federal regulations in refusing to accept him into the BOP residential drug treatment program. Gibson does not have a protected liberty interest in his eligibility for the drug treatment program. <em>See Moody v. Doggett, </em>429 U.S. 78, 88 n. 9, 97 S.Ct. 274, 50 L.Ed.2d 236 (1976)(Prison-er classification and eligibility for rehabilitation programs are not subject to \u201cdue process\u201d protections); <em>Bulger v. United States Bureau of Prisons, </em>65 F.3d 48, 49 (5th Cir.l995)(same). Because BOP officials have full discretion to determine prisoners\u2019 eligibility for the drug treatment program under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B), Gibson has not shown that BOP officials violated the statute in denying his request to participate in the program. A violation of a prison regulation without more does not state a constitutional violation. <em>See Edwards v. Johnson, </em>209 F.3d 772, 779 (5th Cir.2000). Further, the sentencing judge\u2019s recommendation that Gibson be allowed to participate in the program was not binding on BOP officers. <em>See, e.g., United States v. De La Pena-Juarez, </em>214 F.3d 594, 601 (5th Cir.2000). Gibson has not shown that BOP officials violated the Privacy Act. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Gibson\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The district court\u2019s dismissal of Gibson\u2019s complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), (ii), and (iii), and the dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous both count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Gibson is cautioned that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be allowed to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Gibson\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b574-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
