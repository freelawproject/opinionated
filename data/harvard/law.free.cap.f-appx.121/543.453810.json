We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of relief on the ground that Pruess\u2019 claim previously was considered by the district court in evaluating Pruess\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition, as well as by this court on appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of the petition. <em>See United States v. Pruess, </em>Nos. 01-6346, 02-6803 (4th Cir. Oct. 8, 2002) (unpublished). Rule 60(b) may not be used to relitigate claims already decided by the court, <em>CNF Constructors, Inc. v. Donohoe Constr. Co., </em>57 F.3d 395, 400 (4th Cir.1995), and Pruess has raised no new ground to call into question the propriety of that decision.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We further affirm the district court\u2019s denial of relief based on the timeliness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Pruess\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b567-17\"> Although the district court denied relief, in part, in reliance on this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 995, 124 S.Ct. 496, 157 L.Ed.2d 395 (2003), that case does not apply because this matter arises from Pruess\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition, rather than from a \u00a7 2255 motion. Accordingly, neither the certificate of appealability requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 (2000), nor <em>Winestock, </em>applies to this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
