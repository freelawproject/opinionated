However, Martinez did not file a petition for review relative to the BIA\u2019s July 18, 2003, affirmance. Therefore, this court has no jurisdiction to review that decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1) (2000); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 390-406, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Zhang v. INS, </em>348 F.3d 289, 291-92 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-20\">Martinez\u2019s brief is devoted to challenging aspects of pre-October 8, 2003, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>decisions, including the IJ\u2019s decision that Martinez was served with an order to show cause and that he is not eligible to seek cancellation of removal. However, the brief fails to present any arguments with regard to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider. Thus Martinez has in effect abandoned his appeal of the BIA\u2019s October 8, 2003, decision denying his motion to reconsider, by failing to brief it. <em>See Al-Ra\u2018id v. Ingle, </em>69 F.3d 28, 33 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Accordingly, we have no jurisdiction over an appeal from the BIA\u2019s July 18, 2003, decision, and we AFFIRM the October 8, 2003, denial of his motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b580-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
