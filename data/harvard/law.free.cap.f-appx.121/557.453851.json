New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He also contends that <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), applies in determining his sentence. Flores-Guzman acknowledges that his arguments are foreclosed, but he seeks to preserve the issues for possible Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">As Flores-Guzman concedes, his arguments are foreclosed. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Aso for the first time on appeal, Flores-Guzman contends that the district court plainly erred in prohibiting him from \u201cdrinking or using any addictive substances\u201d as a special condition of his supervised release. Because the special condition is not reasonably related to the nature of the offense or Flores-Guzman\u2019s characteristics and involves a greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary to deter criminal conduct, protect the public, and provide Flores-Guzman with necessary treatment, we agree that the district court plainly erred in prohibiting Flores-Guzman from \u201cdrinking or using any addictive substances\u201d during his supervised release. <em>See United States v. Ferguson, </em>369 F.3d 847, 853-54 (5th Cir.2004). Accordingly, we VACATE the sentence in part and REMAND for the district court to modify the special conditions of Flores-Guzman\u2019s supervised release in a manner consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART. VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b581-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
