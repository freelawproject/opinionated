Ford\u2019s lawsuit stems from adverse employment actions taken against him by GE Lighting following a workplace altercation between Ford, an African-American, and a white co-worker. As explained below, Ford has failed to establish either his racial discrimination claim or his retaliation claim. Because we also reject Ford\u2019s contention that the court\u2019s handling of discovery proceedings entitles him to relief, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-13\">Prior to his workplace fight with William Heller, which occurred on May 16, 2002, Ford had been employed by GE Lighting at its Winchester, Virginia, Lamp Plant (the \u201cPlant\u201d) for more than twenty-six years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the lunch period the day before the altercation, Ford, accompanied by co-worker Steve Johnson, entered the employees\u2019 break room of the Plant, where Heller and other white employees were eating food provided by a visiting vendor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ford and Johnson each then made statements that only certain employees of the Plant (including Heller) received free food. This discussion lasted five to ten minutes, and Johnson and Ford then departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-14\">At approximately seven o\u2019clock the following morning, as Ford walked to his workstation at the Plant, Heller angrily called to Ford, shouting Ford\u2019s name over machinery noise that required workers to wear ear plugs. When Ford did not respond, Heller crossed an aisle and confronted Ford about the statements he had made in the break room the previous day. After Heller cursed Ford and shook his finger in Ford\u2019s face, Ford turned and walked away. Heller pursued, continued to curse and point, and punched Ford in the face and body. Ford then sought to restrain Heller and punched him, causing Heller to bleed. Co-workers Johnson and Gene Orndorff then separated Ford and Heller.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-15\">Within minutes, Ford sought out the shift supervisor, Ron Kirby, and recounted the details of the fight. Ford returned to work, and later that day he spoke with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Plant Manager Richard Calvaruso. Ford complained to Calvaruso that Heller had attacked him and that the attack was racially motivated.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">On May 24, 2002, six days after the altercation, Calvaruso terminated Ford and Heller for violating GE Lighting\u2019s policy against workplace violence. In his termination letter, Calvaruso observed that the Plant \u201cpaid very close attention to [Ford\u2019s] allegation that [Heller\u2019s] action was racially motivated\u201d but had been unable to find support for it. Prior to the terminations, GE Lighting interviewed and obtained statements from seven witnesses to the break room discussion and the fight. The witnesses provided widely differing accounts of the two events, and disputed whether Heller or Ford threw the first punch.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">On May 28, 2002, Ford appealed his termination to the Plant\u2019s Peer Review Panel, as had Heller.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After a hearing conducted on June 11, 2002, the Panel recommended that Ford and Heller be reinstated, subject to certain disciplinary measures. These measures included modification of their Plant seniority dates to July 22, 2002, a prohibition against posting for new positions in the Plant for a period of twenty-four months, the imposition of periods of unpaid suspension, and letters of reprimand being placed in their personnel files. Although GE Lighting\u2019s policy required the discharge of Plant employees who received two letters of reprimand (Ford had received a reprimand thirteen years earlier), the Panel recommended excepting Ford from that rule. On June 12, 2002, Calvaruso adopted all the Panel\u2019s recommendations on Ford and Heller save one \u2014 he reduced the ineligibility period for posting for new Plant positions to twelve months.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">On November 1, 2003, GE Lighting laid off approximately thirty employees on the basis of Plant seniority as part of a reduction in force (the \u201cRIF\u201d). Because they had lost their Plant seniority as a result of the fight, Ford and Heller were laid off as part of the RIF. On January 9, 2004, both Ford and Heller were recalled to the Plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-12\">According to Ford, GE Lighting discriminated against its African-American employees throughout his employment. He asserts, <em>inter alia, </em>that employees of the Plant regularly referred to African-American employees with racially offensive epithets and that African-American employees were not promoted fairly. He also maintains that, in 1999, the Plant\u2019s former Human Resources Manager permitted Caucasian employees to have Sundays off for religious purposes but denied Ford the same accommodation. Ford complained to GE Lighting supervisors and managers, including Calvaruso, on approximately ten occasions about racial comments and jokes in the Plant and about the Plant\u2019s failure to fairly promote its African-American employees. For example, in 2001, Ford accused Calvaruso of being a racist and avoiding him. Calvaruso testified that he immediately apologized and requested that Ford give him a chance to prove this was not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-13\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-14\">On April 16, 2003, Ford filed this civil action against GE Lighting in the Western District of Virginia. His complaint alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>that GE Lighting had discriminated against him on account of his race and retaliated against him in response to his complaints of racial discrimination, in contravention of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The discriminatory and retaliatory acts included his termination, the removal of his Plant seniority, the prohibition against posting for new positions within the Plant for twelve months, an unpaid suspension, and a letter of reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">In conducting discovery, Ford sought to secure documents relating to the investigation of his altercation with Heller from both GE Lighting and its parent, General Electric Company (\u201cGE\u201d). GE Lighting opposed Ford\u2019s discovery efforts concerning the fight investigation, contending that the documents contained attorney-client and attorney work product privileged information. On December 2, 2003, a magistrate judge ordered GE Lighting to produce the requested documents to Ford but authorized the redaction of those portions that were \u201cwithin the privilege and protection of\u2019 the attorney work product privilege (the \u201cDecember Order\u201d). In addition, in early November 2003, Ford secured the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum to GE, requesting similar documents held by GE. In response, GE contended that the documents were privileged. Shortly thereafter, on December 15 and 19, 2003, Ford filed motions to compel GE Lighting and GE to produce documents on their Ford-Heller fight investigations, relying on the December Order and the subpoena issued toGE.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">On December 29, 2003, after extensive discovery (including at least seventeen depositions, three requests by Ford for documents, and various interrogatories), GE Lighting filed a motion for summary judgment on Ford\u2019s claims. A hearing on the summary judgment request was then scheduled for January 16, 2004. A day earlier, on January 15, 2004, the magistrate judge heard argument on Ford\u2019s motions to compel, and he ordered GE Lighting and GE to produce the requested documents to the district court for in camera review (the \u201cJanuary 15 Order\u201d). In compliance with that directive, GE Lighting and GE submitted the documents to the district court the following morning. Later that day, January 16, the district court heard argument on GE Lighting\u2019s motion for summary judgment. During that proceeding, Ford did not raise any issue concerning the January 15 Order or the documents produced for in camera review. On January 24, 2004, the court orally notified counsel that it intended to grant GE Lighting\u2019s summary judgment motion, and it removed the matter from its trial calendar.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On February 5, 2004, Ford filed objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s January 15 Order, asserting that GE was not entitled to assert the work product privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">On February 6, 2004, the district court filed its opinion granting summary judgment to GE Lighting on both of Ford\u2019s claims. <em>Ford v. Gen. Elec. Lighting, LLC, </em>No. 5:03CV00024, 2004 WL 1280679 (W.D.Va. Feb. 6, 2004). The court entered a separate order that day denying all outstanding discovery motions as moot. Ford has appealed, maintaining that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>erred in its summary judgment assessment of his claims, and that its ruling, in view of the January 15 Order, was rendered prematurely. We possess jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s award of summary judgment, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to, and drawing all inferences in favor of, the appellant. <em>Love-Lane v. Martin, </em>355 F.3d 766, 755 (4th Cir.2004). An award of summary judgment is only appropriate where the pleadings, affidavits, and responses to discovery \u201cshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). We review a district court\u2019s rulings on discovery matters for abuse of discretion. <em>Carefirst of Md., Inc. v. Carefirst Pregnancy Ctrs., Inc., </em>334 F.3d 390, 396 (4th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">Ford\u2019s claims are asserted pursuant to \u00a7 1981 of Title 42, which accords \u201c[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States ... the same right ... to make and enforce contracts ... as is enjoyed by white citizens.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981(a). Ford alleges that GE Lighting contravened \u00a7 1981 in two respects: racial discrimination and retaliation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because Ford has presented no direct evidence of racial discrimination, his claims are subject to the judicially created burden-shifting scheme set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and its progeny. <em>Hawkins v. PepsiCo, Inc., </em>203 F.3d 274, 278 (4th Cir.2000). Under this proof scheme, if Ford could successfully establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination or retaliation, \u201cthe production burden shifts to [GE Lighting] to articulate some legitimate, nondiseriminatory reason\u201d for its actions. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). In turn, if GE Lighting could successfully meet its burden, Ford must then show that GE Lighting\u2019s proffered reason for its decisions was pretextual and that race or retaliation was the actual reason for its adverse employment actions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-12\">In order for Ford to properly forecast a racial discrimination claim under \u00a7 1981, he must show, viewed in the light most favorable to him, that (1) he is a member of a protected class, (2) an adverse employment action was taken against him, (3) other Plant employees of a different race had engaged in conduct of comparable seriousness, and (4) the disciplinary measures imposed on those other employees were less severe than those imposed on him. <em>See Moore v. City of Charlotte, </em>754 F.2d 1100, 1105-06 (4th Cir.1985) (recognizing ways of establishing prima facie claim of racial discrimination in Title VII context); see <em>also Gairola v. Va. Dep\u2019t of Gen. Servs., </em>753 F.2d 1281, 1285 (4th Cir.1985) (holding that elements of prima facie Title VII claim and prima facie \u00a7 1981 claim are identical). It is undisputed that Ford sat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>isfies the first two prongs of his racial discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Assessing the latter two prongs of his claim in the proper light, Ford proffered sufficient evidence to show that the prohibited conduct in which he engaged \u2014 a physical workplace altercation with another Plant employee \u2014 was comparable in seriousness to several instances of misconduct by non-African-American employees. <em>See Cook v. CSX Transp., Corp., </em>988 F.2d 507, 511 (4th Cir.1993) (\u201c[T]he comparison will never involve precisely the same set of work-related offenses occurring over the same period of time and under the same set of circumstances.\u201d). In support of his claim, Ford relies on several incidents in which white employees at the Plant violated GE Lighting\u2019s policy against workplace violence and were neither terminated nor received discipline as severe as that imposed on Ford. First, in April 1997, Tom DeMayo intentionally pushed Guy Sager (both white employees), causing Sager to fall into a pipe, cutting and bruising his head. Approximately ten years ago, Ellen Miller, a white employee, slapped a temporary employee. Finally, approximately twenty years ago, William Webster and Charlie Colliflower, both white employees, shoved each other after a lunch table disagreement; Colliflower then put Webster in a \u201cbear hug.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ford has not provided an example of any altercation where a white employee involved in a workplace fight alleged self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Even more than the analogous workplace incidents to which our attention has been directed, Ford and Heller were, in this situation, identically situated because they were involved in the same workplace incident. Importantly, GE Lighting saw fit to discipline Heller, the white employee, in the same manner as it disciplined Ford. Ford\u2019s attempt to differentiate himself from Heller on the ground that he acted in self-defense while Heller was the aggressor in the altercation is unavailing. And the fact that Ford may have acted in self-defense is immaterial, because it is undisputed that both Ford and Heller violated the Plant\u2019s policy against violence. Ford has proffered no evidence that GE Lighting has heretofore disciplined a white employee claiming self-defense in a manner less severely than it disciplined him. In such circumstances, we must agree with the district court that Ford has failed to make a prima facie showing of racial discrimination. As a result, the court properly awarded summary judgment to GE Lighting on Ford\u2019s discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">As explained below, the district court\u2019s award of summary judgment to GE Lighting on Ford\u2019s retaliation claim must also be sustained. In order to make a prima facie claim of retaliation, Ford was obliged to show that (1) he engaged in protected activity, (2) he suffered an adverse employment action at the hands of GE Lighting, and (3) GE Lighting took the adverse action against him because of his protected activity. <em>Spriggs II, </em>242 F.3d at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-11\">Ford readily satisfies the first two prongs of his retaliation claim. First, it is undisputed that Ford was engaged in a protected activity when he filed his internal racial discrimination complaints; namely, he alleged that Heller\u2019s attack was racially motivated, that GE Lighting had failed to promote African-Americans, and that certain Plant employees routinely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>made racial jokes and slurs. <em>See Peters v. Jenney, </em>327 F.3d 307, 320 (4th Cir.2003). Second, Ford\u2019s termination by GE Lighting, and the conditions of his reinstatement, such as his loss of seniority, constituted adverse employment actions. <em>See James v. Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, </em>368 F.3d 371, 375-76 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Under the third prong of his retaliation claim, however, Ford must show that GE Lighting\u2019s decisionmaker in the adverse action \u2014 Calvaruso\u2014had knowledge of Ford\u2019s protected activities. <em>See Price v. Thompson, </em>380 F.3d 209, 213 (4th Cir. 2004). In making this assessment, we are obliged to consider the time period between the employee\u2019s protected activity and the employer\u2019s adverse employment actions, for \u201cthe passage of time tends to negate the inference of discrimination.\u201d <em>Price, </em>380 F.3d at 213. Viewing the summary judgment record in the light most favorable to Ford, a reasonable trier of fact could find that Calvaruso knew Ford had engaged in protected activity, and the brief period of time between this activity and Ford\u2019s discharge \u2014 six days \u2014 permits an inference of retaliation. First of all, before Ford\u2019s termination in May 2002, Ford had complained to Calvaruso directly that Heller\u2019s conduct in the altercation was racially motivated, as Calvaruso acknowledged. Second, in 2001, during Calvaruso\u2019s first week at the Plant, Ford accused Calvaruso of being a racist and avoiding him.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In these circumstances, Ford has established a prima facie case of retaliation, in that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that GE Lighting, specifically Calvaruso, knew of Ford\u2019s protected activity and soon thereafter discharged Ford. <em>See Karpel v. Inova Health Sys. Servs., </em>134 F.3d 1222, 1229 (4th Cir.1998) (holding that little or no direct evidence of causal connection between plaintiffs protected activity and adverse employment action is required for plaintiff to survive summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">In assessing the final prong of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test, however, Ford\u2019s proof comes up short, in that GE Lighting has proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for disciplining Ford, that is, fighting in the workplace. <em>Hawkins, </em>203 F.3d at 278. In response to this proffer, Ford bore the burden of establishing that GE Lighting\u2019s reason for his discipline was a pretext, and that Ford\u2019s race was the actual reason for GE Lighting\u2019s discipline of him. <em>Id.; see also DeJarnette v. Corning, Inc., </em>133 F.3d 293, 299 (4th Cir.1998) (\u201c[I]t is not our province to decide whether the reason was wise, fair, or even correct, ultimately, so long as it truly was the reason for the plaintiffs termination ....\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">In <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., </em>the Supreme Court identified several factors appropriate to a consideration of pretext: the strength of the plaintiffs prima facie case, probative evidence that the employer\u2019s explanation is false, and any other evidence from which \u201cno rational factfinder could conclude\u201d there was racial discrimination. 530 U.S. 133, 148-49, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>(2000); <em>see also Price, </em>380 F.3d at 213-14 (holding plaintiff did not make adequate showing of pretext on retaliation claim). Here, Ford has not forecast a particularly strong prima facie ease of retaliation, pointing to only two instances where Calvaruso may have known of Ford\u2019s protected activities. Fatal to Ford\u2019s retaliation claim, though, is his equivocal evidence that GE Lighting acted on a pretext. Ford maintains that GE Lighting\u2019s failure to properly investigate his racial discrimination complaint that the fight was racially motivated demonstrates that its proffered reason for terminating him is not credible. However, GE Lighting investigated Ford\u2019s allegation that the fight was racially motivated: Ford\u2019s termination letter recounted that GE Lighting \u201cpaid very close attention to\u201d his allegation. Moreover, Calvaruso testified that he found no evidence that the fight was racially motivated and, importantly, none of the seven eyewitnesses suggested that racial remarks had been made, either during the fight or in the earlier break room discussion. Although Rachel Franklin, the Plant\u2019s Human Resources Director, testified that she had not personally investigated any issue of racial discrimination alleged by Ford prior to his termination, she brought the issue of discrimination to the attention of the Peer Review Panel in order that they consider it in Ford\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Finally, the fact that Ford and Heller received identical punishments is compelling support for the proposition that \u201cno rational factfinder could conclude\u201d that Ford\u2019s discipline was premised on retaliation. <em>Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 148. As a result, Ford has failed in his burden to show that the nondiscriminatory reason proffered by GE Lighting for his discipline was false. The district court therefore was justified in awarding summary judgment to GE Lighting on Ford\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">Lastly, we turn to Ford\u2019s contention that the district court erred in prematurely granting summary judgment to GE Lighting, prior to its review of the documents the magistrate judge had ordered produced in camera.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Ford is precluded, however, from contending that inadequate discovery rendered summary judgment inappropriate, in that the court was never advised that Ford deemed additional discovery necessary in order to permit him to respond to GE Lighting\u2019s summary judgment motion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) (providing that party opposing summary judgment on grounds that more discovery is necessary must support that point with appropriate affidavits); <em>see also Shafer v. Preston Mem\u2019l Hosp. Corp., </em>107 F.3d 274, 282 (4th Cir.1997) (\u201cShafer is precluded from arguing that inadequate discovery made summary judgment inappropriate because she did not submit an affidavit informing the district court that additional discovery was necessary for her to respond to the Hospital\u2019s summary judgment motion.\u201d). We have advised litigants that we \u201cplace great weight on the Rule 56(f) affidavit\u201d and that \u201cthe failure to file an affidavit ... is sufficient grounds to reject a claim that the opportunity for discovery was inadequate.\u201d <em>Evans v. Techs. Applications &amp; Serv. Co., </em>80 F.3d 954, 961 (4th Cir. 1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">More importantly, Ford failed to advise the court at the summary judgment hearing that the discovery documents had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>submitted for in camera review or that it deemed additional discovery to be necessary. <em>Cf Harrods Ltd. v. Sixty Internet Domain Names, </em>302 F.3d 214, 244-45 (4th Cir.2002) (concluding that nonmoving party\u2019s objections that summary judgment was premature served as functional equivalent of affidavit). In this proceeding, because Ford neither filed an affidavit supporting further discovery nor contended at the summary judgment hearing that a ruling was premature, we are unable to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in its handling of these discovery issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s award of summary judgment to GE Lighting.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b26-9\">. We relate the details of this event and the subsequent actions of GE Lighting in the light most favorable to Ford. <em>See Spriggs v.

Ford\u2019s other evidence that Calvaruso had knowledge of Ford\u2019s protected activity is inapposite. First, approximately two to three months prior to the altercation, Ford complained to Russell Gallimore, the Employee Practices Manager in Cleveland, Ohio, about GE Lighting\u2019s failure to promote African-Americans. Calvaruso claimed that he had no knowledge of this complaint; Ford offers no evidence to the contrary. Second, in 1997, Ford, along with six other employees, met with the Plant\u2019s Human Resources Manager, four years prior to Calvaruso\u2019s employment at the Plant, to discuss a racial slur at the Plant. This 1997 incident as too attenuated for a reasonable juror to infer causation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b32-5\">. The record does not reflect whether or not the district court conducted an in camera review of the documents produced by GE and GE Lighting on January 16, 2004, before it issued its written summary judgment opinion on February 2, 2004, Nevertheless, the court possessed the documents for eight days prior to notifying the parties, on January 24, 2004, of its decision to award summary judgment to GE Lighting.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
