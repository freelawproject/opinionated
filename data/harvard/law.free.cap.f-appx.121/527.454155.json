Ashcroft, 811 </em>F.3d 678, 680-81 (7th Cir.2004) (collecting cases). Given this jurisdictional bar, we cannot review the underlying merits of Kongadembou\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-22\">While we lack jurisdiction to consider the denial of Kongadembou\u2019s asylum claim, we retain jurisdiction to consider the denial of his request for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a) (2004). \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) <em>(citing INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). A trier of fact who rejects an applicant\u2019s testimony on credibility grounds must offer specific, cogent reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>for doing so. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). This Court accords broad, though not unlimited, deference to credibility findings supported by substantial evidence. <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). We find the Board\u2019s conclusion that Kongadembou was not credible to be supported by the evidence. Accordingly, Kongadembou\u2019s challenge to the denial of his application for withholding from removal must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Accordingly, we deny Kongadembou\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b552-15\"> Kongadembou does not challenge the denial of withholding under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
