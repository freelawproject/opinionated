His direct appeal was dismissed on his own motion. Over three months later, he filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, which the district court denied. Vasquez filed a notice of appeal before, but not after, the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-30\">\u201cA timely notice of appeal is necessary to the exercise of appellate jurisdiction.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number><em>United States v. Cooper, </em>135 F.3d 960, 961 (5th Cir.1998). We lack jurisdiction for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">The notice of appeal states clearly an intent to appeal \u201cfrom the judgment of conviction and sentence herein rendered against\u201d Vasquez, not to appeal a ruling on the motion to withdraw the guilty plea. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B) (requiring that a notice of appeal designate the judgment or order being appealed). Although a notice of appeal filed before the entry of an order may be treated as filed on the date of and after the entry of the order, this treatment can be given only when the court has announced its decision and the notice of appeal is filed thereafter. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(2); <em>see FirsTier Mortgage Co. v. Investors Mortgage Ins. Co., </em>498 U.S. 269, 276-77, 111 S.Ct. 648, 112 L.Ed.2d 743 (1991). The district court did not announce its decision or in any way intimate what its ruling on the motion would be until its May 4th order, and Vasquez did not thereafter file a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Even if we were able to construe the premature notice of appeal as effective, there is still no basis for jurisdiction. Vasquez\u2019s post-sentencing motion to withdraw his guilty plea was unauthorized and without jurisdictional basis. <em>See United States v. Cook, </em>670 F.2d 46, 48 (5th Cir.1982); Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e) (after sentencing, a guilty plea may be set aside only on direct appeal or by a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion). Accordingly, this court lacks jurisdiction over any appeal arising from Vasquez\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>See Cook, </em>670 F.2d at 48-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Vasquez\u2019s direct appeal was dismissed upon his own motion, and neither Vasquez, the Government, nor the district court cited 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in connection with the motion to withdraw the guilty plea. Even if Vasquez\u2019s motion were construed as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, this court lacks jurisdiction because there has been no certif\u00edcate of appealability (COA) ruling by the district court. <em>See United States v. Youngblood, </em>116 F.3d 1113, 1114-15 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">This appeal is without arguable merit and thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). It is therefore DISMISSED. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. We caution counsel. He has a duty not to bring frivolous appeals. In the future, he will be subject to sanctions for doing so. <em>See United States v. Burleson, </em>22 F.3d 93, 95 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b41-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
