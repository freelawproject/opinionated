An appellant has the burden of including in the record on appeal a transcript of all parts of the proceedings material to the issues raised on appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(b); 4th Cir. R. 10(c). An appellant proceeding on appeal in forma pauperis is entitled to transcripts at government expense only in certain circumstances. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753\u00a9 (2000). By failing to produce a transcript or to qualify for the production of a transcript at government expense, Johnson has waived review of the issues on appeal that depend upon the transcript to show error. <em>See Powell v. Estelle, </em>959 F.2d 22, 26 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Keller v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>827 F.2d 952, 954 n. 1 (4th Cir.1987). As no error appears on the record before us, we deny Johnson\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss the appeal. We also deny Johnson\u2019s pending motions to seal document, for subpoena of records, and to expedite, and we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-20\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
