Grothe argues that the administrative law judge (ALJ) erred by crediting the opinion of a physician who was not a specialist. Grothe also contends that the ALJ erred by concluding that he could return to his past work as a vocational instructor. He contends that he has seen a specialist who is willing to testify that he is disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-25\">The record supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to afford considerable weight to the disputed medical opinion. <em>See </em>20 CFR \u00a7 404.1527. An examination of the record as a whole shows that there is substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s determination that Grothe retained the capacity to perform his past relevant work. <em>See Ripley v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 552, 555 (5th Cir. 1995); <em>see also Griego v. Sullivan, </em>940 F.2d 942, 945 (5th Cir.1991). Grothe\u2019s allegations concerning a specialist do not change this analysis. Grothe has shown no error in the district court\u2019s judgment or in the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny his application for benefits. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b80-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
