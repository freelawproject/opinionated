Wilson\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious issues for appeal, but addressing the length of the sentence. Wilson was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he has not done so. Because our review of the record discloses no reversible error, we affirm the revocation of Wilson\u2019s supervised release and the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">Based on Wilson\u2019s admissions, the district court found that Wilson violated the conditions of his supervision and properly revoked his supervision. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West Supp.2004). Wilson challenges the length of the sentence, which exceeded the six-to-twelve month range suggested by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a) (1994). However, this range is not binding on the sentencing court. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 640-41 (4th Cir.1995). Indeed, a greater sentence may be warranted where, as here, the original sentence was the result of a downward departure. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 7B1.4, comment, (n.4). Because Wilson received a significant downward departure from his original sentence and he previously violated the terms of his supervision, the district court\u2019s decision to impose a sentence above the range suggested in \u00a7 7B1.4(a) was reasonable. Additionally, we note that the imprisonment and supervised release terms did not exceed the maximum sentence that could be imposed on revocation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 702, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000); <em>United States v. Maxwell, </em>285 F.3d 336, 341 (4th Cir.2002). Accordingly, we affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-13\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order revoking Wilson\u2019s supervised release and imposing a twenty-month sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
