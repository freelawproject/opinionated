We have reviewed the record and the district court order and affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Cason v. Nance, </em>No. CA-04-2780-AMD (D.Md. Oct. 20, 2004). We deny Cason\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. We also deny his request, made in his supplement, for permission to file in this court a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
