INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). We have reviewed the administrative record, the immigration judge\u2019s decision, and the Board\u2019s order and find substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Bien-Aim\u00e9 failed to establish the past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2004) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483, 112 S.Ct. 812 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-16\">Next, we uphold the Board\u2019s denial of Bien-Aim\u00e9\u2019s application for withholding of removal. The standard for withholding or removal is \u201cmore stringent than that for asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). An applicant for withholding must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). As Bien-Aim\u00e9 failed to establish refugee status, he cannot satisfy the higher standard necessary for withholding.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-17\">Accordingly, we deny Bien-Aim\u00e9\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-18\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
