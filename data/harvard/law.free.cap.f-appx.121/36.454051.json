We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b61-22\">Diaz, a federal prisoner, filed a <em>pro se </em>wrongful death action in Texas state court against various political officials and police officers from Corpus Christi, Texas, alleging that they were responsible for the death of his son, Jacob Diaz (\u201cJacob\u201d). He alleged that the defendants had been willfully negligent and deliberately indifferent and had violated his son\u2019s constitutional right to be free from \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d when they failed to respond appropriately to a \u201c911\u201d call reporting that Jacob was being attacked by several men, leaving him to bleed to death. Diaz sought $2 million in damages. The defendants removed the wrongful death action to federal court because Diaz had alleged a violation of Jacob\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-23\">Diaz also filed in federal court a <em>pro se </em>civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, naming most of the same defendants and alleging essentially the same facts set forth in the wrongful death action. He attached a copy of his wrongful death complaint to the civil rights complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-24\">The defendants filed identical motions to dismiss the civil rights and wrongful death complaints for failure to state a claim. The two actions were consolidated, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>district court dismissed Diaz\u2019s claims on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction because Diaz lacked standing to bring a \u00a7 1988 action on behalf of his deceased son. The court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Diaz\u2019s state law claims. Judgment was entered on March 23, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">On April 8, Diaz filed a \u201cMemorandum in Opposition\u201d to the order of dismissal or, in the alternative, a notice of appeal. The attached envelope was postmarked April 5, 2004, and the back of the envelope contains a date stamp of April 3, 2004, indicating that the envelope was given to prison officials for mailing on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">On May 24, 2004, the district court issued an order denying Diaz\u2019s \u201cMotion for Reconsideration.\u201d The court concluded that Diaz\u2019s motion was a motion for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b) rather than a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment because it was filed sixteen days after the entry of judgment. The court observed that Diaz had not challenged its finding that it lacked jurisdiction, and it concluded that even if it were to construe Diaz\u2019s action as one for injuries he personally suffered as a result of the deprivation of his son\u2019s constitutional rights, Diaz had failed to state a constitutional claim under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Diaz\u2019s \u201cMemorandum in Opposition\u201d, construed by the district court as a motion for reconsideration, qualified as a Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment because it was submitted to prison officials for mailing to the clerk within ten days after the court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a); <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 269-76, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). Accordingly, the underlying judgment is before this court for review. <em>See Simmons v. Reliance Std. Life Ins. Co. of Texas, </em>310 F.3d 865, 867 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">Citing this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Baker v. Putnal, </em>75 F.3d 190, 195 (5th Cir.1996), the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction over Diaz\u2019s claims regarding his son, because the \u201cparents of the deceased may only \u2018sue under \u00a7 1983 for their <em>o%m </em>injuries resulting from the deprivation of decedent\u2019s constitutional rights.\u2019\u201d Although Diaz does not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction over his complaint, we nevertheless have the duty to consider this issue <em>sua sponte. Bridgmon v. Array Systems Corp., </em>325 F.3d 572, 575 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">\u201c[Bjefore a federal court can consider the merits of a legal claim, the person seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of the court must establish the requisite standing to sue.\u201d <em>Whitmore v. Arkansas, </em>495 U.S. 149, 154, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 109 L.Ed.2d 135 (1990). \u201cStanding under the Civil Rights Statutes is guided by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, which provides that state common law is used to fill the gaps in administration of civil rights suits.\u201d <em>Pluet v. Frasier, </em>355 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2004). \u201cTherefore, a party must have standing under the state wrongful death <em>or </em>survival statutes to bring a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, and 1988.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">In Texas, \u201c[a] survival cause of action is brought by the deceased\u2019s estate to redress the deceased\u2019s <em>oum </em>injuries.\u201d <em>See Gandara v. Slade, </em>832 S.W.2d 164, 167 (Tex.Ct.App.1992) (emphasis added) (citing Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 71.021 (1986)). On the other hand, \u201c[a] wrongful death cause of action is brought by survivors of the deceased to compensate themselves for their loss of future pecuniary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>benefits, loss of inheritance, mental anguish, and loss of society and companionship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Tex. Civ. Prac. <em>&amp; </em>Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7 71.004 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Contrary to the district court\u2019s conclusion, <em>Baker </em>did <em>not </em>hold that surviving family members may sue <em>only </em>for their \u201cown injuries\u201d in order to recover for the violation of a decedent\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Baker, </em>75 F.3d at 195. In <em>Baker, </em>this court held that it is not the case \u201cthat only the person whose constitutional rights have been violated may bring an action under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>75 F.3d at 195. \u201cOn the contrary, it is the law of this circuit that individuals who are within the class of people entitled to recover under Texas\u2019s wrongful death statute have standing to sue under \u00a7 1983 for their own injuries from the deprivation of decedent\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court emphasized that the Texas wrongful death statute, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 71.004 (West 1986), \u201cclearly recognizes the right of the surviving children and parents of the deceased to bring an action for the benefit of all.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">In his <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 1983 and wrongful-death complaints, Diaz did not explicitly allege injuries that he had suffered personally as a result of the violation of his son\u2019s constitutional rights. There is no allegation by Diaz, a federal prisoner, that he is a legal representative of his son\u2019s estate and thus entitled to bring a survival action. Nonetheless, a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s pleadings must be construed liberally in his favor. <em>Oliver v. Scott, </em>276 F.3d 736, 740 (5th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The minutes of a pretrial conference and evidentiary hearing conducted by the magistrate judge on December 31, 2003, reflect that the magistrate judge instructed Diaz to look in the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, sections 71.004A and 71.021B, so that he could advise the magistrate judge whether he wished to proceed under the Texas Surviv- or Act or the Texas Wrongful Death Act. The magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation states that, at the <em>Spears </em>hearing conducted on March 10, 2004, Diaz informed the magistrate judge that he was intending to sue for his son\u2019s wrongful death. Thus, although Diaz did not explicitly enumerate injuries that he had suffered personally, we conclude that the district court should have liberally construed his \u201cwrongful death\u201d action such that it inherently alleged such losses. We therefore hold that Diaz has standing to assert claims for the wrongful death of his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">Having concluded that the district court had jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits, we now turn to consider the district court\u2019s ruling, in its order denying Diaz\u2019s motion for reconsideration, that Diaz had failed to state a claim for the violation of his son\u2019s constitutional rights. Diaz has not alleged that the 911 caller informed the dispatcher as to Jacob\u2019s identity, location, or condition, nor has he asserted that any of the police officers who responded to the 911 call were aware of these matters. Mere negligence, of course, does not give rise to a cognizable constitutional claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 332-36, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986). To the extent that Diaz asserts a claim that Jacob was subjected to \u201ccruel and unusual punishment,\u201d the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause protects only convicted prisoners. <em>See Morin v. Caire, </em>77 F.3d 116, 120 (5th Cir.1996). To the extent that Diaz is arguing that the defendants\u2019 acts and omissions violated his son\u2019s substantive due process rights, he has not shown either that Jacob was constitutional<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>ly entitled to competent protective or rescue services, <em>see Beltran v. City of El Paso, </em>367 F.3d 299, 303-04 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Brown v. Commonwealth of Pa., Dep\u2019t of Health Emerg. Med. Servs. Training Inst., </em>318 F.3d 473, 478 (3d Cir.2003), or that the defendants\u2019 acts and omissions \u201c \u2018can properly be characterized as arbitrary, or conscience shocking, in a constitutional sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>County of Sacramento v. Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 847, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998) (citation omitted). We therefore conclude that the district court did not err by dismissing Diaz\u2019s claims. <em>See Vulcan Materials Co. v. City of Tehuacana, </em>238 F.3d 382, 387 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-16\">.
