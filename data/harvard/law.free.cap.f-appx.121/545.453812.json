Henderson was sentenced to a term of 210 months in prison to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-28\">Henderson argues that there was no evidence that he possessed or con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>trolled the firearms found in his girlfriend\u2019s residence. He asserts that the mere possibility of possession does not equate to actual possession warranting a two-level upward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(1)(A) to a total offence level of 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">However, Henderson\u2019s possession of firearms had no impact on his sentencing range. His ultimate offence level of 81 was based on a mandatory Chapter Four enhancement for armed career criminals and a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Henderson has neither contested the fact that he is an armed career criminal nor shown how the two level adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A) had an effect on his sentencing guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Assuming the district court considered Henderson\u2019s possession of the three firearms in imposing a sentence at the top of the guideline range, such consideration was appropriate. There was reliable evidence in the presentence report and presented at the sentencing hearing that Henderson was aware that the weapons were in the house and that they were accessible to him. The evidence gave rise to a plausible inference that Henderson was in constructive possession of the three firearms found in the house. <em>See United States v. Houston, </em>364 F.3d 243, 248 (5th Cir.2004). The district court did not clearly err in making the two-level adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A) or in considering Henderson\u2019s possession of the firearms at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b569-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
