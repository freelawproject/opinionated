Van Riswick, </em>92 U. S. 202; Chaffraix <em>v. Shiff, </em>92 U. S. 214; <em>Semmes </em>v. <em>United States, </em>91 U. S. 21; <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Wassell, </em>94 U.

S. 351.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIX\">There is a labored attempt made to establish a discrepancy between the doctrine of <em>Avegno </em>v. <em>Schmidt </em>and <em>Shields </em>v. <em>Shiff, </em>and the doctrine of <em>Wallach </em>v. <em>Van Riswick, Pike </em>v. <em>Wassell, </em>and <em>French </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>and to draw a distinction between these latter cases and the case at bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-5\">It is insisted that this court in. <em>Avegno </em>v. <em>Schmidt </em>has held that the confiscation proceedings left the fee of the property in the confiscatee, or retained it in the United States; consequently, that the pardon of the offender restored him the fee if it remained in him after the confiscation proceeding, or restored it to him if it remained in the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-6\">A mere inspection of these two opinions shows that this claim is .unfounded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-7\">If this court has decided anything without variance, it has decided that the confiscation proceedings absolutely divested every right, title and interest which the confiscatee had in the property; that it entirely separated his estate from. that of his heirs, and that it entirely paralyzed his power over the property during his life, either to affect it by deed or to devise it by will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-8\">In all of those cases the court has refused, and found it unnecessary, to decide where the fee was after the confiscation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-9\">The common law doctrine that the fee cannot be in abeyance, it has positively declared not applicable to the case and not material to determine, and that whatever may have been the common law doctrine, that doctrine must yield to the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-10\">In answer to the suggested difficulty that if the ancestor was not seized of the property at his death the heir could not take it, the court has declared that it was not necessary either at common law, or under this statute, that the ancestor should' be seized in order that the heir might take by inheritance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-11\">In answer to the plea that the pardon and the amnesty proclamation had restored to the confiscatee the .power to dispose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>of the property and to bind his heirs by warranty deeds, the court has declared, from the above principles, that the pardon could not give back the property Which had been sold, nor any interest .in it, either in possession or expectancy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-4\">\u25a0 The whole argument on the other side may be summed upi in the statement that the pardon for treason restored the fee, or the right to control the . fee, in property seized, condemned and sold as enemy\u2019s property under the laws of war. This is the very proposition which the court, for the reasons above given, has denied both in the Wallaeh and in the Semmes cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-5\">There is' no argument or suggestion in the plaintiffs\u2019 brief as to how the pardon of the claimants\u2019 ancestor for his offences' against the government could deprive his heirs of the benefit secured solely'to them by the joint resolution of Congress.The confiscation was an accomplished fact, and whatever rights grew out of that fact were already vested when the pardon was granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-6\">There would be as much reason'to hold that the pardon divested the title of the purchaser of the estate for the life of the public enemy, who was also a .public offender, as to hold that it annulled the effect of the joint resolution and divested the rights thereby secured ultimately to the heirs on the death of their ancestor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-7\">He was entirely disseized by the confiscation of the whole estate, and they were authorized to take this whole estate, at his death, as his heirs, by descent, although there was no seizin in him at the time of his death. \u25a0 The pardon may have made him a \u201cnew man,\u201d but'it did not make new facts or destroy vested rights. <em>Knote </em>v. <em>United States, </em>95 U. S. 149, 153; <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>United States, </em>91 U. S. 474.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b123-8\">Mb. Justice Bradley,</author>\n<p id=\"ASg\">\u25a0 after stating the case as above, delivered .the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">The principal question raised in the present case is, whether, by the effect of the pardon and amnesty granted to A. W. Bosworth by the special pardon of October,' 1865, and the general proclamation of amnesty and pardon of December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>25th, 1868, he was restored to the control and power of dis position over the fee simple or naked property in reversion expectant upon the determination of the confiscated estate in the property in dispute. The question of the effect of pardon and amnesty on the destination ' of the remaining estate of the offender, still outstanding after a confiscation of the property during his natural life, has never been settled .by this.court. That the guilty party had no control over it in the absence of such pardon or amnesty, has been frequently decided. <em>Wallach </em>v. <em>Van Riswick, </em>92 U. S. 202; <em>Chaffraix </em>v. <em>Shiff, </em>92 U. S. 214; Pike v. Wassell, 94 U. S. 711; <em>French </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>102 U. S. 132; and see <em>Avegno </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>113 U. S. 293; <em>Shields </em>v. <em>Schiff, </em>124 U. S. 351.- But it has been'regarded as a doubtful question, what 'became of the fee, or ultimate estate, after the confiscation for life. \u201cWe are not called upon,\u201d said Justice Strong, in <em>Wallach </em>v. <em>Van Riswick, \u201c </em>to determine where the fee dwells during the continuance of the. interest of a purchaser at a confiscation sale, whether in the United States, or in the purchaser, subject t\u00f3 be defeated by the death of the offender.\u201d 92 U. S. 212. It has also been suggested that the fee remained in the person -whose estate was confiscated; but ivithout any power in him to dispose of or control it.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Perhaps it is not of much consequence which of these theories, if either of them, is the .true one; the important point, being, that the remnant of the estate, whatever its nature, and wherever. it went, was never beneficially disposed of, but remained (so to speak) in a state of suspended animation. Both' the common and t'h.e civil laws furnish analogies of suspended ownership of estates which may help us to a proper. conception of that, now under consideration. Blackstone says : \u201c Sometimes the. fee may be in <em>abeyance, </em>that is (as the word signifies) in expectation, remembrance and contemplation of law; there being no person in <em>esse </em>in whom it can vest and abide; though the law considers it as always potentially existing, and ready to vest when a proper owner appears. Thus in a grant to John for life, and afterwards to the heirs of Bichard, the inheritance is plainly neither granted to John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>nor Richard, nor. can it vest in the heirs of Richard till his death, <em>nam nemo est haeres viventi's\u2022 </em>it remains, therefore, in waiting or abeyance during the life of Richard.\u201d 2 Bl. Com. 107. In the civil law, the legal conception is a little different. Pothier says<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>: <em>\u201c </em>The dominion of property (or ownership), the same as all other rights, as well <em>in re </em>as <em>ad </em>rem, necessarily supposes a person in whom the right subsists and' to whom it belongs. It need not be a natural person; it may belong to corporations or communities, which have only a civil and intellectual existence or personality. \"When an owner dies, and no one will accept the succession, this dormant succession <em>(succession jacente) </em>is considered as being a civil person and as the continuation of that of the deceased; and in this fictitious person subsists the dominion or ownership of whatever belonged to the deceased, the same as all other active and passive rights of the deceased; <em>haereditas jacens personae defuncti locum </em>obtinet.\u201d Droit de Domaine de Propri\u00e9t\u00e9, Partie I, c. 1, \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">But, as already intimated, it is not necessary to be over .curious about the intermediate state in which the disembodied shade of naked ownership may have wandered during the period of its ambiguous existence. It is enough to know that it was neith\u00e9r annihilated, nor confiscated, nor appropriated to any third party. The owner, as a punishment .for his offences, was disabled from exercising any act's of ownership over it, and no power to exercise such \u25a0 acts was given to any other person. At his death, if not before, the period of suspension comes to an end, and the estate revives and devolves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>to his heirs at law. In <em>Avegno </em>v. Schmidt, 113 U. S. 293, and in <em>Shields </em>v. <em>Schiff, </em>124 U. S. 351, this court held that the heirs of the offender, at his death, take by descent from him and not by gift or grant from the government. They are not named in the confiscation act, it is true, nor in the joint resolution limiting its operation. The latter merely says, \u201cnor shall any punishment or proceedings under said act be so. construed as to work a forfeiture of the real estate of the offender, beyond his natural life.\u201d The court has construed the effect of this language to be, to \u2019 leave the property free to descend to the heirs of the guilty party. <em>Bigelow </em>v. Forrest, 9 Wall. 339; <em>Wallach </em>v. <em>Van Riswick, </em>92 U. S. 202, 210. Mr. Justice Strong, in the latter case, speaking of the constitutional provision, that no attainder of treason should work corruption of blood or forfeiture, except during the life of the person attainted, (which provision was the ground'and cause for passing the joint resolution referred to,) said \u201cNo one ever doubted \u2022that it was a provision introduced for the benefit of the children and heirs alone; a declaration that the children-should not bear the iniquity of the fathers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">But, although'the effect of the law was to hold the estate, or naked ownership, in a state of suspension for the benefit of the heirs, yet they acquired no vested interest in it; for, until</p>\n<p id=\"Ayd\">the death of the ancestor, there is no heir. During his. life it does not appear who the heirs will be. Heirs apparent have,in a special case, been received to intervene for the protection of the property from spoliation. <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Wassell, </em>94 U. S. 711. This was allowed from the necessity of the case, arising from the fact that the' ancestor\u2019s disability prevented him from exercising any power over the property ..fpr its protection or otherwise, and no other persons but the\" heirs apparent had even a contingent interest to be protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">It would seem to follow as a logical consequence from the decision in <em>Avegno </em>v. <em>Schmidt </em>and <em>Shields </em>v. <em>Schiff, </em>that after the confiscation of the property the naked fee (or the naked ownership, as denominated in the civil law),' subject, for the lifetime of the offender, to the' interest or usufruct of the purchaser at the confiscation sale, remained in the offender him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>self; otherwise, how could his heirs take it from him by inheritance ? But, by reason of his disability to dispose of, or\u2019 touch it, or affect it in any manner whatsoever, it remained, as before stated, a mere dead estate, or in \u25a0 a condition of suspended animation. We think that this is, on the whole, the. most reasonable view. There is no corruption of blood; the offender \u25a0can transmit by descent; his heirs take from him by descent; why, then, is it not most rational' to conclude that the dormant and suspended fee has continued in him ?</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Now, if the disabilities which prevented such person .from exercising any power over this suspended fee, or naked property, be removed by a pardon or amnesty,.\u2014 so removed as to restore him to all his rights, privileges and immunities, as if' he had never offended, except as to those things which have become vested in other persons, \u2014 why does it not restore him. to the control of his property so far as' the same has never been forfeited, or has never become vested in another person ? In our judgment it does restore him to such control. In the opinion- of the court in the case of <em>Ex parte Garland, </em>4 Wall. 333, 380, the effect of a pardon is stated as follows, to wit: \u201cA pardon reaches both the punishment prescribed for the offence and the guilt of the offender; and, when the pardon is full, it releases the punishment and blots out of existence the guilt, so that in the eye of the law the offender is as innocent as if he had. never committed the offence.. If granted before conviction, it prevents any of the penalties and disabilities consequent upon conviction from attaching; if-granted after conviction, it removes the penalties and disabilities, and restores him to all his civil rights; it makes him as-it were a new man, and gives him a new credit and capacity. There is only this limitation to its operation: it does not restore offices forfeited, or property or interests vested in others in consequence of the conviction and-judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The qualification in the last sentence of this extract, that a pardon does not affect vested interests, was exemplified in the case of <em>Semmes </em>v. <em>United States, </em>91 U. S. 21, where a pardon was held not to interfere with the right of a purchaser of the forfeited estate. The same doctrine had been laid down in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>The Confiscation Cases, </em>20 Wall. 92, 112, 113. It was distinctly repeated and explained in <em>Knote </em>v. <em>United States, </em>95 U. S. 149. In that case property of the claimant had been seized by the authorities of the United States on the ground of treason and rebellion; a decree of condemnation and forfeiture had been passed, the property sold, and the proceeds .paid' into the treasury. The court decided that subsequent pardon and amnesty did not have the effect of restoring to the offender the right to these proceeds. The/ had become absolutely vested' in the United States, and could not be devested by the pardon. The effect of a pardon was so fully discussed in that case that an extract from the opinion of the court will not be out of place here. The court says: \u201c A pardon is an act of grace by which an offender is released from the consequences of his offence, so far as such release is practicable and within control of the pardoning power, or of officers under its direction. It releases the offender from all disabilities imposed by the offence, and restores to him all his civil rights. In contemplation of law, it so far blots but the offence that afterwards it cannot be imputed to him to prevent the assertion'of his legal rights. It gives to him a new ' credit and capacity, and rehabilitates him. to that extent in his former position. But it does not make amends for the past. It affords no relief for what has. been suffered by the \"offender in his person by imprisonment, forced labor or otherwise ; it does not give compensation for what has been done or suffered, nor does it impose upon the government any obligation to. give it. The offence being established by judicial proceedings,'that which has been done or suffered while they were in force is presumed to have been rightfully done and justly suffered, -and no satisfaction for it. can be required. Neither does the pardon affect any rights which have vested in others directly by the execution- of the judgment for the offence, or which have been acquired by others whilst that judgment was in .force. If, for example, by the judgment, a sale of the offender\u2019s .property has been had, the purehas\u00e9r will hold the property notwithstanding the subsequent pardon. And if the proceeds of- the -sale have been paid to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>party to whom the law has assigned them, they cannot be subsequently reached and recovered by the offender. . . . So also if the proceeds have been paid .into the treasury, the right to them has so far become vested in the United States that they can only be secured to the former owner of the property through an act of Congress. . . . Where, however, property condemned, or its proceeds, have not thus vested, but remain under conti\u2019ol of the Executive, or of officers subject to his orders, or are in .the custody of the judicial tribunals, the property will be restored or its proceeds delivered to the original owner, upon his full pardon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The last portion of the above extract was justified by the decision in the case of <em>Armstrong\u2019s </em>Foundry, 6 Wall. 766, where a pardon was received by Armstrong after his foundry had been seized, and whilst proceedings were' pending for its confiscation. He was even allowed to plead the full pardon as new matter in this court whilst the case was pending on appeal; and the court held, and decided, that this pardon relieved him of so much of the penalty as accrued to the United States, without any expression of opinion as to the rights of the informer.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The citations now made are sufficient to show the true bearing and effect of the pardon granted to Bosworth, and of the general proclamation of amnesty as applied to him. The property. in question had never vested in any person when these acts of grace were performed. It had not even been forfeited. Nothing but the life interest had been forfeited. His power to enjoy or dispose of it was simply suspended by his disability as an offender against the government of the United States. This disability was a part of his punishment. It seems to be perfectly clear, therefore, in the light of the authorities referred to, that when his guilt and the punishment therefor were expunged by his pardon this disability was removed; in being restored to all his rights, privileges and immunities, he was restored to the control of so much of his property and estate as had not become vested either in the government or in any other person;. \u2014 -especially that part or quality of his estate which had never been for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>feited, namely, the naked residuary ownership of the property, subject to the usufruct of the purchaser under the confiscation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">This result, however, does not depend upon the hypothesis that the dead fee remained in Eosworth after th\u00e9 confiscation proceedings took place; it is equally attained if we suppose that the fee was <em>in n&lt;vlbibus, </em>or that it devolved to the government for'the benefit of whom it might concern. We ar\u00e9 not trammelled by any technical rule of the common or the civil law on the subject. The statute and the inferences derivable therefrom make the lay?- that controls it. Regarding the substance 6f things and not their form, the truth is simply this: a portion of the estate, limited in time, was forfeited; the residue, expectant upon the expiration of that time, remained untouched, undisposed of; out of the owner\u2019s power and control, it is true, but not subject to any other person\u2019s power or control. . It was somewhere, or possibly nowhere. But if it had not an actual, it had a potential, existence, ready to devolve to the heirs of the owner upon his death, or to be revived by any other cause that should call it into renewed vitality or enjoyment. The removal of the guilty party\u2019s disabilities, the restoration of all his rights, powers and privileges, not absolutely lost or vested in another, was such a cause. Those disabilities were all that stood in the way of his control and disposition of the naked ownership of the property. Being removed, it necessarily follows that he was restored to that control and power of disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">. It follows from these views, that the act of sale executed by A. W. Bosworth and his wife'in September, 1871, was effectual to transfer and convey the property in dispute, and that the judgment of the Circuit Court in favor of the plaintiffs below (the defendants in error) was erroneous. That judgment is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\"><em>Reversed and the cause </em>remanded., <em>v\u00f1th instructions to enter </em>.\u25a0 <em>judgfhent for the defendants </em>below, <em>the now flaAntiffs in-error.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b130-8\">Mr. Justice Blatcheord did not sit in this case, or take any part in its decision.
