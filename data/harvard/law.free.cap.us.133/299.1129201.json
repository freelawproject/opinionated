This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims.' 24 C. Cl- 230. Appellant brought his action in that court to: recover, not for services actually rendered, but for sixteen years\u2019 salary as first lieutenant, claiming that this was due by reason of an alleged illegality in the order of January 2,187\u00cd, discharging him from the service. That order is, therefore,the matter of inquiry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>In 1869 and 1870 acts of Congress webe passed looking to a reduction in the army, and the order in question was made in pursuance of the last of these acts. The intent of Congress is .obvious, and all proceedings bad to carry such intent into effect should be liberally construed, and not subjected to any such technical limitations as will thwart such obvious purpose. The act of July 13, 1866, 14 Stat. 92, has no bearing on the case at bar, for, as held by this court in <em>Blake </em>v. <em>United States, </em>103 IT. S. 227, it simply placed a limitation on the personal power of the President, as commander-in-chief in time of peace, to dismiss from the service. It was not intended to have \u2014 as it could not have \u2014 .any effect on the power of a subsequent Congress to reduce the army by appropriate legislation in, respect to either its officers or enlisted' men.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-4\">The act of March 3, 1869, 15 Stat. 315, c. 124, \u00a7\u00a7 2-7 inclusive, is significant only as indicating the intent of Congress . that the army should be reduced, for the method of reduction there provided is simply the cessation of enlistments and appointments. Evidently the reduction by this method was not as-rapid as was desired, for on July 15, 1870, an act was passed making provision for a direct reduction. 16 Stat. 315, c. 294. Section 2 authorizes and directs the President to reduce on or before the first day of July, 1871, the number of enlisted men to thirty thousand. With respect to the officers there were several sections aimed at. reduction; some abolishing certain offices; others providing that no appointments to particular ' offices should be made until the number of incumbents was reduced below a prescribed limit. In addition, there were four provisions having general application. Section 3 authorized the President to grant an honorable discharge to all officers applying on or before the first of January, 1871, and giving the- officers so discharged an additional year\u2019s pay and allowances. Sections 4 and 5 increased the retired list to 300, and authorized the President to place on such list, on their own application, officers with thirty years? service. The other provisions are found in sections 11 and. 12, which, as being the sections specially bearing on the questions in this case, are quoted as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ACH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>\u201c Sec?. 11. <em>And he it further </em>enacted, That the'general of the army and commanding officers of the several military departments of the army shall, as soon as practicable after the passage of this act, forward to the Secretary of War a list of officers serving in their respective commands deemed by them unfit for the proper discharge of their duties from any cause except injuries incurred or disease contracted in the line of their duty, setting forth specifically in each case the cause of such unfitness. The Secretary of War is hereby authorized and directed to constitute a board to consist of one major general, one brigadier general and three colonels, three of the said officers to be selected from among those appointed to the regular army on account of distinguished services in the volunteer force during the late war, and on recommendation of such board, the President shall muster out of the service any of the said officers so reported, with one year\u2019s pay; but such muster-out shall not be ordered without allowing such officer a hearing before such board to show cause against it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-5\">. <em>\u201c </em>Seo. 12. <em>And he it further </em>enacted, That the President is hereby authorized to transfer officers from the regiments of cavalry, artillery and infantry, to the list of supernumeraries; and all vacancies now existing, or which may occur prior to the first day of January next, in the cavalry, artillery, or infantry, by reason of transfer, or from other causes, shall be filled in due proportion by the supernumerary officers, having reference to rank, seniority and fitness, as provided in existing law regulating promotions in the army. And if any supernumerary officers shall remain after the first day of January next they shall be honorably mustered out of the service with one year\u2019s pay and allowances: Provided, That vacancies now existing in the grade of second lieutenants, or which may occur prior to said date, may be filled by the assignment of supernumerary first lieutenants, or officers of higher grades, who, when so. assigned'shall rank as second lieutenants,<em>providing </em>[provided] such officer shall prefer to be assigned, instead of being mustered out under the provisions of this section; and officers so assigned shall take rank from the date of their original entry into the service: <em>And provided further, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>That no chaplain be \u2022 appointed to posts or regiments until those on waiting-.orders are assigned.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ayu\">It appears from the findings that on October 27, 1870, the claimant, whp was on active duty at Fort Bidwell. California, was reported. hy. the' Department Commander, Lieutenant Colonel George Cr\u00f3.ok, as unfit for. the proper discharge of his duties from other causes than injuries incurred or disease contracted in the. line of his duties. His name was submitted to the board organized in pursuance of the 11th section quoted supra. On the 17th of November the board requested that he, with others named, be given a hearing, as required by that section. On Noy ember 19th the -Adjutant General informed the board that the stations of these officers were so remote that it was impossible for it to consider their cases, and that the Secretary of \"War had directed that they be not ordered to .appear. In compliance with this order, on November 22, the papers in thes\u00e9 cases were returned to the Secretary of War. In other\" words, .the proceedings initiated in section 11 were abandoned. No inquiry was ever made, as to the alleged unfitness for the proper discharge of his. duties from causes other than injuries incurred or disease contracted in the line of duty. It. appears further, that on January 2, 1871, January 1st being Sunday, an order was issued by the Secretary of War, which, so far as it. affects this claimant, reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-6\"><em>(General </em>Orders, <em>No. </em>1.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-7\">War Department, Adjutant General\u2019s- Office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-8\">\u25a0 Washinoton, <em>January </em>.2, 1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-9\">By direction of the President, the following officers of the army are transferred, assigned, or mustered oufc of the service, to take effect from the 1st instant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-10\">\u25a0 I; \u2014 <em>Transfers to the IAst of Supernumeraries, wnd\u00e9r Section </em>12 <em>of the Act Approved July </em>15, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-11\">* * * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-12\">First Lieutenant Harlow L.

Justice Beewee,</author>\n<p id=\"AQa\">after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">The principal contention of the appellant is that, proceedings- having been- commenced under section 11, they should have been carried to a close, and that he could be mustered out of the. service only upon an adjudication by that board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>unfitness. But this view cannot be sustained. It arises, from a misconception of. the scope of the two sections. The first; aims to eliminate from the army those officers who are unfit for the discharge of their duties, and whose unfitness springs' from no cause of meritorious claim upon the consideration of the government; while the other is a grant of general power to the President to reduce the number of officers by selecting the best and mustering out the residue. It is comprehensive in its scope, and not at all dependent upon the failure to accomplish the requisite reduction through proceedings under section 11. It is in no manner subordinated to or dependent upon that section,, and grants a power which can be exercised irrespective of 'all other proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">The appellant had no vested right. to an adjudication upon the matter reported against him. In the absence of express .limitation, the government -\"may always withdraw charges which it has made. There is nothing in the words of either section, nothing in the scope and purpose of their provisions, or in any general rule of law, which prevented the government from abandoning the proceedings initiated under section 11, and proceeding to muster out the appellant under section' 12. .</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The other proposition of the appellant is that the authority given by section 12 was not strictly pursued. While it is conceded that the President might add to or .take from, the list of supernumerary officers, it is urged that he could muster out' only those who were supernumerary Officers at the close of the first day of January, 1879, the language beings \u201cAnd if any supernumerary officers shall remain after the first day of Jan-nary next they shall be honorably . mustered out,\u201d etc., whereas, \u25a0by the order actually made, he was transferred to the supernumerary list only on the second day of- January.' Concedes /the. irregularity, and it is'not .such as vitiates the . order. The purpose of the act is obvious. ' The direction of Congress was clear and distinct, and it would be strange if any executive officer could, by irregularity in executing the mandate of Congress, thwart this purpose. The matter of tim\u00e9 was not vital.The purpose was reduction, and \u00e1 reduction to be accomplished by selecting the best and mustering out the poorer element <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>,and while Congress prescribed the time within which this mandate was to be executed, there is neither in terms nor by implication any subordination of the power to the matter of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Again, it must be noticed that-the first day of January was Sunday, that is, a <em>dies non, </em>and a power that may be exercised up to and including a given day of the month may generally, when that day happens to be Sunday, be exercised on the succeeding day. So that it is a matter worthy at least of consideration whether the power was not exercised within the very limits of time prescribed by 'the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">It is well in this respect to compare this section with section 3. By that the President was- authorized to honorably discharge, with paj and allowances, officers who should apply on or before January 1,1871. By that section a reduction through the voluntary act of army officers was contemplated, and such voluntary action was authorized and invited to be had on the first day of January. While section 12 was not dependent upon section 3, yet it is obvious that action so voluntarily taken by any army officer would limit the amount of enforced reduction, and to that extent relieve the President from embarrassment in the selection authorized by- section 12; and there was a propriety, if rpthing \u2022 else, in waiting until the close of the first \u25a0day of January before exercising the power of selection and mustering d\u00fct.'</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\u2022 It will also be noticed that section ,12 places no limitation on the,time within which the President is authorized .to transfer officers to the list\"of supernumeraries.- If voluntary resignation by the close of the first day of January made sufficient reduction, there would be no ^necessity of transferring any to the list of supernumeraries,' and it was only the supernumerary officers remaining after tire 1st of January \u2014 -that\u2018is, the officers then found not to be-needed for the service \u2014 who were to be mustered out under that section. There was, therefore, no requirement -that the President should transf\u00e9r to the supernumerary list before the close of the first of' January; the mufiber which-it was.necessary to transfer- Tiould not be absolutely determined .until the -.close of that day, and it .was only those, who, at the close of that day, were not needed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>in the service, that the President could muster out. All these matters justified the action of the President taken on the 2d of January, and if they do not establish that it was in full and literal compliance with the exact provisions of section 12, they certainly leave so slight-a departure as scarcely to be worthy of mention. It is certainly, no such deviation from the prescribed course as to vitiate the order and thus nullify the express direction of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">But we are not limited to this. Full power of legislation.in the matter of increase and reduction of the. army is with Congress. It prescribed in this act the proceedings by which that reduction was to be accomplished. In pursuance of that act certain proceedings were had. The power 'which can direct what proceedings shall be had can approve and make valid any proceedings which are actually taken. The power which can give authority to act can ratify any act that is taken, and generally legislative recognition of an act or a corporation validates the act or the corporation, although neither one nor the other may have had full prior legal authority.- <em>Comanche County </em>v. <em>Lewis, ante, </em>198.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">There was but one order issued under section 12 for the mustering out of supernumerary officers. In that order were many names besides that of the appellant, and the act of March 3j 1875, 18 Stat. 197, c. 159, \u00a7 2, refers to \u201cany person who was mustered out as a supernumerary officer of the army with one year\u2019s pay and allowances,\u201d under the act of 1870,-that we have been considering. Further, on April 8, 1878, 20 Stat. 35, c. 50; 25th of February, 1879, 20 Stat. 321, c. 100; March 3, 1879, 20 Stat. 351, c. 175 ; and March 3, 1881, 21 Stat. 510, c. 151, acts were severally passed authorizing the restoration to the army of John A. Darling, Michael O\u2019Brien, Philip <em>~W. </em>Stanhope and Redmond Tully, who had been'mustered out by this order of January 2, 187\u00cd, and those acts all assume the validity of that order! There has been thus, full legislative recognition of its validity. It is too late, therefore, now to enquire as to whether it was -in technical compliance with the procedure prescribed by the act of. 1870.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">\u25a0 \"We see no errors in the ruling of-the Court of Claims, and its judgment is <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
