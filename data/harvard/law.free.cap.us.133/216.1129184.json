Hall </em>and <em>Mr. John A. Marshall </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-6\">The appellants and the appellee claim under a common source-.of title, viz.: one John Coulam, who died testate in 1877. His will is set out in the complaint, and purports to give his entire estate to his wife, the appellee, entirely ignoring'the appellants, his children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-7\">(694) Section 10, Compiled Laws of Utah of 1876, p. <em>'%%% </em>is as follows: \u201c When any testator shall omit to provide in his or her will for any of his or her children, or for the issue of any deceased child, unless it shall appear, that such omission was intentional, such child, or the issue of such child, shall have the same share in the estate of the testator as if he or she had died intestate, to be assigned as provided in the preceding section.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-8\">(703) Sec. 19, Compiled Laws of' 1876, p. 273, provides that if the decedent leave a husband or a wife and more than one child, the estate of the decedent goes one-fourth to the surviving husband or wife for life, and the remainder with the other three-fourths to the children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-9\">Two issues are raised by the pleadings: but the second, having been abandoned below, there remains in this court for discussion only the' question: Was the omission of the testator to provide in his will for his children intentional? The question of law raised by the assignmeit- of errors relates to the admission of parol testimony, tending to prove that the testator intentionally omitted to provide, for his children: a part of such testimony being the contents of two drafts of former \u25a0 wills, not published \u00f3r witnessed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-10\">On the part of the appellants it is contended that the omission of the testator to provide in his will for his children, by virtue of the statute, annexes to the will the condition that the will shall be void, <em>quoad </em>the children, unless a contrary intention appears by intrinsic evidence, and that the operation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>of this rule of law is altogether independent of the intention of the testator except as that intention may be expressed in the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-5\">It is a general rule that the intent of a testator must be found on the face of the will, and that extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to.show it, the exception being Avhere such evidence is needed to remove a latent ambiguity. <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>1 Johns. Ch. 231; <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Seaman\u2019s Aid Society, </em>7 Met. 188; <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>22 Connecticut, 526; <em>Kurtz </em>v. <em>Hibner, </em>55 Illinois, 514.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACj\">To this general rule and its limitations as stated we find no opposing authority, but it is contended in. behalf of the appellee that this rule is hot applicable to the-case at bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-8\">Our statute on the subject of pretermitted children is but an outgrowth of the common law doctrine of the implied revocation of a will by a subsequent marriage and birth of issue, and the authorities defining that doctrine of the common law will assist in arriving at the proper construction of the statute in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-9\">Under the doctrine above referred to, it was well settled that no revocation would be implied by law if the testator in his will made any provision, however small, for the future Avife and children; such provision furnishing intrinsic evidence that he did not intend the future alteration in his circumstances to work a revocation of his will. <em>Kenebel </em>v. <em>Scrafton, 2 </em>East, 530, 541.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-10\">It was then contended, as it is claimed by appellee in this case, that the entire doctrine was one of presumption raised by the parol proof of extrinsic circumstances, viz.: the subsequent marriage and birth of issue, and that a presumption so raised could be rebutted by like parol evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ag4\">This contention received serious consideration in <em>Marston </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>8 Ad. <em>&amp; </em>El. 14, decided in 1838; the case having been argued in the presence of all the judges of England, with the exception of Lord Denman, as stated in the opinion; and it was in that case decided that no extrinsic evidence Ayould be admissible to prove an intention against revocation, but that the revocation took place by virtue of a condition tacitly an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>'nexed to the will by the law, independent of the intention of the testator, except as such intention was expressed in the will. A portion of the evidence so excluded was, as in the case at bar, the drafts of two former wills.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-5\">And the reason for the exclusion of such evidence is stated to be, that the statute required wills of real estate to be in writing, and that the object of the statute was to prevent the title to real property from being dependent on \u201c the perplexity and uncertainty of such conflicting evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-6\">The same reason exists in this Territory. See sec. (654), p. .265, and sec. (686), p. 271, Compiled Laws of Utah, 1876.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-7\">The case of <em>Marston </em>v. <em>Roe </em>has been always, followed in this country. 2 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7\u00a7 684, 685; <em>C. B. &amp; Q. Railroad </em>v. <em>Wasserman, </em>22 Fed. Rep. 872.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abj\">In Massachusetts in 1783, a statute was passed containing the following provision, viz.: \u201c That any child or children, . . . not having a legacy given them in the will of their father or mother, shall have a proportion of the estate of their parent assigned to him, her or them, as though such parent had died intestate. . . .\u201d Stat. of 1783, c. 24, \u00a7 8. It was the well settled construction of this statute by the Supremo Court of said State, that although the child had no legacy left him in the will of the parent, yet if an intention to omit him appeared, he would not be entitled to any portion of the estate. <em>Tucker </em>v. Boston, 18 Pick. 162, 167; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Fosket, </em>6 Met. 400; <em>S. C. </em>39 Am. Dec. 736. But it Avas equally well settled that such intention could only be made to appear by intrinsic evidence, and that all extrinsic evidence of such intent was inadmissible. See cases above cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-11\">After this statute was thus judicially construed the laws \u2019.of Massachusetts were-revised. Sec. 21 of c. 62, Rev. Stats., provided that an heir for Avhom an ancestor omits to provide in his will, is entitled to a distributive share of the ancestor\u2019s^ estate, unless he shall have \u201c been provided for by the testator in his lifetime, or unless it shall appear'that such omission was intentional, <em>and not occasioned by any mistalce or accident^ </em>It is stated by the Commissioners for revising the statutes, in their note to the section last quoted, that it was taken from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Stat. 1783, c. 24, <em>\u201c </em>adopting the construction which has been gjven to it by the Supreme Court.\u201d See brief of counsel for appellee in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Fosket, </em>cited <em>ante.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-4\">Under this last statute <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Foslcet </em>was decided in 1843. That case, without overruling the prior cases in Massachusetts under the statute of 1783, or intimating a doubt of their correctness, decided that the commissioners \u201c had builded better than they knew,\u201d and that under the new statute parol evidence, including evidence of the parol declarations of the testator, was admissible to show that the testator intended to omit to provide for his child. That case has ever since been followed in Massachusetts under the same statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-5\">'\u2022 .Iowa adopted the Massachusetts statute, last' cited, and adopted with it the judicial construction placed thereon by the Massachusetts courts. <em>Lorieux </em>v. <em>Keller, </em>5 Iowa, 196; <em>S. C. </em>68 Am. Dec. 696.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-6\">We submit that unless the Massachusetts cases under the new statute find their warrant for the admission of extrinsic evidence in the words, \u201c and not occasioned by any mistake or' accident,\u201d they are opposed to both principle and the weight of authority. It is difficult to conceive how a mistake or accident can be shown except by extrinsic evidence, and such mistake or accident as will permit the- child to inherit has been held in Massachusetts to be perfectly consistent with an intentional omission of the child\u2019s name from the will. <em>Ramsdill </em>v. <em>Wentworth, </em>101 Mass. 125.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-7\">In Missouri the statute is substantially the same as the Massachusetts statute of 1783, and has uniformly received the same construction, viz.: that to disinherit a child it is not necessary that he should be..named or-provided for in the will of the parent, if the omission to do so appears to be intentional; but that such intention can only be proved by intrinsic evidence. <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>24 Missouri, 311; <em>Burch </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>46 Missouri, 441; <em>Pounds </em>v. <em>Dale, </em>48 Missouri, 270; <em>Wetherall </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>51 Missouri, 65. See, also, <em>Chace </em>v. <em>Chace, </em>6 R. I. 407; <em>S. C. </em>78 Am. Dec. 446.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-8\">\u25a0 The Utah statute in question is precisely similar, it seems to us, to the Massachusetts statute of 1783- and to the Missouri statute as they were judicially construed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>'In California in 1868, in the case of <em>Estate of Garraud, </em>35 California, 336, section 17 of the Stat. of Wills of that State, of which (694) sec. 10, Comp. Laws of Utah, 1876, is an exact copy, first received a judicial construction by the Supreme Court. In that case it was held that the intention of the testator to omit to provide for his children can only be gathered from the face of the will; that it can only be proved by evidence competent to prove any other testamentary intention, and that evidence of the acts and declarations of the testator is inadmissible to prove such intention.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-5\">Suppose at the time of the actual execution of the will, the testator unintentionally omits to provide for his children, but that afterwards he changes his mind and declares his intention not to provide for them, is the will ambulatory in the meantime ? and where are such changes to stop ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-6\">If there be any doubt as to the true construction of the statute in question, it would be settled by the consideration, that' in adopting the California statute, we adopted its received construction in California, which must be considered as accompanying the statute to this Territory, and forming an integral part of it. Cathcart v. <em>Robinson, </em>5 Pet. 264; <em>Bemis </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>1 Kansas, 226.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-8\">The leading case of <em>Estate of Garraud, </em>35 California, 336, was decided in 1868. In the case of <em>Estate of Utz, </em>43 California, 200, decided in 1872, and in <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>46 California, 609, decided in 1873, the leading case was admitted by counsel to be controlling in California, and its authority has never been' questioned in that State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-9\">In 1876, the legislature of Utah Territory enacted a statute of wills, seven sections of which! were literally, copied from the California act, as it was Avhen the <em>Estate of Garraud </em>was decided. See sections, 6-12 inclusive, Compiled Laws of Utah, p. 271. One of these sections, section 10, is the one invoked by appellants in this case. It is to be presumed, then, that, the legislature of Utah' Territory was familiar with the judicial construction of the California statute placed thereon by the highest, court of that State, and that they intended to adopt that construction when they adopted the statute. \u25a0 \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Although evidence of all the circumstances which surrounded the author of a written instrument will be received for the purpose of ascertaining his intentions, yet those intentions \u2022must ultimately be determined by the <em>language </em>of the instrument. No proof, however conclusive in its nature, can be admitted with the view of setting up an intention inconsistent with the known meaning of the- writing itself. For the duty of the court in all these cases is to ascertain',- not what the 'parties may have really intended, as distinguished from what their words express, but simply what is the meaning of the words they have used. It is merely a duty of interpretation, and evidence of surrounding circumstances cannot change the legal effect of clear and unambiguous words. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Fire Ins. Co., </em>47 N. Y. 597, 606; <em>Partridge </em>v. <em>Ins.

There is no pretence made in this case that the language pf the will- is not clear and unambiguous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-5\">The uniform language of the authorities is to the effect' that no intention to omit to provide for the children appears by reason of the absolute devise to the appellee. <em>C.

But'-it' is insisted, on behalf of appellants that such intention is required in the latter case also to appear from the will, and cannot be shown by evidence <em>aliunde.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The source of the statute under consideration was undoubtedly that of Massachusetts upon the same subject, though - it is said that this particular statute was taken from a similar one in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The first and second sections of an act of the Province of Massachusetts, passed in the year 1700, (12 Vm. 8,) with their preambles, read as follows: \u201cForasmuch as it often happens that children are not borne till after the death of their fathers, and also have no provision made for them in their, wills,</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\u201c <em>Be it therefore </em>enacted, <em>etc., </em>That as often as any child shall happen to be borne after the death of the father, without having any provision made in his will, every such posthumous child shall have right and interest in the estate of his or her father, in like manner as if he had died intestate, and the same shall accordingly be assigned and set out as the law directs for the distribution of the estates of intestates.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">\u201c <em>And whereas, </em>through the anguish of the diseased [deceased] testator, or through his solicitous intention though in health, or through.the overnight of the scribe, some of the testator\u2019s children are omitted and not mentioned in the will, many' children also being borne after the makeing of the will, th6 in the lifetime of their parents,</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">\u201c <em>Be it therefore enacted, etc., </em>That any child or children not-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>having a legacy given them in the will of their father or. mother, every such child shall have a proportion of' the estate of their parents given and set out unto them as the law directs for the distribution of the estates of intestates ; <em>provided </em>such child or children have not had an equal proportion of his-estate bestowed on them by the father in his lifetime.\u201d 1 Mass. Province Laws, 429, 430. \u2022'</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">This provincial act was in effect repealed by an act of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, passed February 6th, 1784-, by which it was revised, the phraseology somewhat changed, and the preambles omitted. Mass. Stat. 1783, c. 24, \u00a7\u00a7. 1, 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">By the first section of this latter act any person seized in fee simple of any estate is authorized to devise the same to and among his children or others, as he shall think fit, without any limitation of persons whatsoever. By the eighth section \u2019 it is provided \u201c that any child or .children, or their legal representatives in case of their death, not. having a legacy given him, her or them in the will of their father or mother, shall have a proportion of the estate of their parents assigned unto him, her or them\u2019, as though such parent had died intestate; provided such child, .children or grandchildren have not had an equal proportion of the deceased\u2019s estate bestowed on him, her or them in the deceased\u2019s lifetime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The Supreme Judicial Court held that the- object of the statute was to furnish, a remedy solely for those cases, where, from accident or other causes, the children or grandchildren might, be supposed to have been forgotten by the testator in making his\u2019 will; and' that, whenever from the tenor of the will or any part of it, sufficient evidence appeared to indicate that the testator had not forgotten his children or grandchil-dren, as the case might -be, when he made his will, they should not be entitled to a distributive share of his estate, although no legacy was given them by the will. <em>Terry </em>v. Foster, 1 Mass. 146; <em>Wild v. </em>Brewer, 2 Mass. 570; <em>Church </em>v. Crocker, 3 Mass. 17; <em>Wilder </em>v. <em>Goss, </em>14 Mass. 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Thus, although the statute provided that a child should take, notwithstanding its name was omitted, the court ruled that if on the face of the will it appeared that such omission was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>tentional, the child could not take ; hence, whenever the will' was silent the child took, and to prevent that result, where such silence was by design, the statute was amended, so as to read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u201c When any testator shall omit to provide in his will for any of his children, or for the issue of any deceased child; they shall take the same share of his estate, both real and personal, -that they would have been entitled ,to if he had died intestate; unless they shall have been provided for by the testator in his lifetime; or unless it shall appear that such omission was im tentional, and not occasioned by any mistake or accident.\u201d Rev. Stat. Mass. 1836, c. 62, \u00a7-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">How appear? Evidently <em>aliunde </em>the will. If if must appear upon the face- of the will that the omission was intentional, the words inserted in the statute were superfluous, for if- it did so appear the child could not take, notwithstanding the provision that in case of omission it should take, inasmuch as the latter provision was only inserted to give the omitted child a share, not against the intention of the testator, but because of the presumption of an oversight. Hence in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Fosket, </em>6 Met. 400, the court held that-under the statute as amended, evidence <em>dehors </em>the will was admissible to establish that the omission was intentional; and such is the settled law of Massachusetts. . <em>Converse </em>v. <em>Wales, </em>4 Allen, 512; <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Gerard, </em>123 Mass. 8; <em>Ramsdill </em>v. <em>Wentworth, </em>101 Mass. 125. In the latter case the court said: \u201c The operation of the statute is peculiar, but there is no violation under it of the rules of evidence... The only issue is, whether provision, was omitted in the will by design, and without mistake or accident. Parol evidence is admitted, although the result, may change or modify the disposition of the testator\u2019s estate. The -will is used to show that there is no legacy under it; and. however the issue may be established,-there is no conflict with' its terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">In Bancroft v. <em>Ives, </em>3. Gray, 367, the statute of Massachusetts was held to apply to children .born after the making of the will and before the death of their father. The. argument was pressed that the language \u201c omit to.provide in his will\u201d neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>sarily meant and should be confined to children living at the time of making the will. This argument was regarded by Chief Justice Shaw as plausible but not sound, because as a man\u2019s will is ambulatory until his decease, the time to which the omission applied was the time of the testator\u2019s death. If, therefore, he had then made no provision by his will, the case of the statute arose, for he had made a will, but left a child without having made any provision for such child.</p>\n<p id=\"AYE\">' By the Utah statute, however, specific provision is made for children born after the making of the will, and also for children in being but omitted when the will is made. Children born after the making of the will but before.the decease,'inherit, unless it appears from the will that the testator intended that they should not. And this applies to posthumous children. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u25a0 Mr. Jarman Jays it' down that marriage and the birth of \u00e1 child, conjointly, revoked a man\u2019s will, whether of personal or real estate, these circumstances producing such a total change in the testator\u2019s situation as to lead to a presumption that he could not have intended a disposition of property previously made to continue'unchanged. .But this effect is not produced where there is a provision made for both wife and children by the will itself, <em>Kenebel </em>v. <em>Scrafton, </em>2 East, 530; or by a previous settlement providing for both. 1 Jarman on Wills, 4th Eng. ed.; 5th Am. ed.*123, *125.</p>\n<p id=\"AOL\">\u25a0 Revocation, treated as matter of presumption merely, was thought, in <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Cubitt, </em>1 Doug. 31, open, to be rebutted by parol evidence, 'and this is guardedly conceded by Chancellor Kent in <em>Brush </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>4 Johns. Ch. 506, and by Mr. Greenleaf, vol. 2, \u00a7 684. But, as is stated in a note to .that section, .the doctrine that the presumption is not conclusive has been overruled,, upon greatConsideration, in the cases of <em>Marston </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>8 Ad. &amp; El. 14, and <em>Israell </em>v. <em>Rodon, </em>2 Moore P. C, 51, in the former of which it was, among other thingsj resolved, that, where an unmarried man', without children by a former marriage, devises all the estate he has at the time of making .his will, and leaves no provision for any child of a future marriage, <em>the law annexes to such 'will the tacit condition </em>that if he afterwards marries, and has a child born of such' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>marriage, the will shall be revoked; \u201d and that \u201c evidence not amounting to proof of publication, cannot be received in a court of law, to show that the testator intended that his will should stand good, notwithstanding his subsequent marriage and th\u00f3 birth of issue; because these events operate as a revocation by force of a <em>rule of law, </em>and independent of the testator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The subject is regulated in this country by the statutes of the several States and Territories, marriage albne working revocation under some, and both marriage and birth of issue being required under others, while subsequently born children, unprovided for,- are allowed to take unless a contrary intention appears. -</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">' But the provision we are considering^ concerns children in being when the will is made. As to children born after death or the making of the will, the -reason why the intention to omit them should appear On the face of the will is obvious. It is the same as that upon which the doctrine of revocation rest's \u2014 the change in the testator\u2019s situation. But this reason loses its force so far as children living when the will, is made are concerned; and this explains the marked difference between the. sections of the statute' before us applicable to the two classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The statute raises a presumption that the omission to provide for children or grandchildren living when a will is made is the result of forgetfulness, infirmity or misapprehension, and not of design; but this is a rebuttable presumption, in view of the language employed, which negatives a taking contrary to an intentional omission, and at the same'time leaves undefined the mode by which the affirmative purpose is to be established.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Legal presumptions drawn by the courts independently of or against the words of an instrument may be, in some instances, repelled by extrinsic evidence, and this statutory presumption of an unexpressed intention to provide may be rebutted in the' same way.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Under section 12, a pretermitted child is entitled to no share if it has had an equal proportion by way of advancement, but it is not contended that this fact must necessarily appear from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>the will when that is not required by statute, yet proof of advancements and of intentional omission alike defeat the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The rule as to patent and latent ambiguities, so far as analogous, sustains the same conclusion. Where a devise is, on the face of it, clear and intelligible, yet from external circumstances an ambiguity arises as to which of two or'inore things, or of two or more persons, the testator referred to, it .being legally certain that he intended one or the other, evidence of his declarations, of the instructions given for his will, and of other circumstances of the like- nature, is admissible to determine his intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The will in this case is entirely unambiguous. The testator\u2019s intention was that his wife should have the property. There being children at the time of the execution of the will, an ambiguity may be said to have been created by operation of the statute, as to their having been intentionally omitted, which ambiguity evidence of the' character named \u00e1t once removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Children so situated do not set up title under the will but under the statute. The will is used to establish that they have no legacy or devise under it. Then the inquiry arises whether the testator intended to omit them. Evidence that he did does not conflict with the tenor of the will. It simply proves that he meant what he said. Instead of tending to show the testator\u2019s real purpose to have been other than is apparent upon the face of the will, it confirms the purpose there indicated. The fact of the existence of children when \u00e1 will is made is proven <em>dehors </em>the instrument, and since under the statute that evidence opens up a question as to the testator\u2019s intention, which but for the statute could not have arisen, and which by the statute is not required to be determined by the will, we cannot perceive why the disposal of it should be so limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">It is contended that the statutory provision in question was copied from that of California, and that we are bound by the construction previously put upon it by the courts of the latter State. The California act declared that in case of the omission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>of the testator to provide in his will for his children, they should be entitled to the'same.share as in case of intestacy, \u201c unless it shall appear that such omission was intentional.\u201d Laws of California, 1850, c.- 52, \u00bf <em>IT.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A4x\">In <em>Payne </em>v. Payne, 18 California, 291, 302, the Supreme Court of California, speaking through its then Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Field, said : <em>\u201c </em>The only object of the statute is to protect the children against omission or oversight, which not unfrequently arises from sickness, old' age, or other infirmity, or the peculiar circumstances under which the .will is executed. When, however, the children are present to the mind of the testator, and. the fact that theyare mentioned by him' is conclusive evidence of this, the statute; affords no protection, if \u25a0provision is not made for them. The'inference follows that no pro vision'was intendedand <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Foster, Wild </em>v. <em>Brewer, Church </em>v. Crocker, and <em>Wilder </em>v. <em>Goss, supra, </em>were cited.</p>\n<p id=\"AMG\">But in \u2022 the <em>Matter of the Estate of Garraud, </em>35 California, 336, it was held that evidence <em>aliunde </em>the will was not admissible to show that the omission to make provision for children was intentional, and, in respect to the Massachusetts decisions, the court was of \u00a1opinion that the words <em>\u201c </em>and not occasioned by any mistake or accident,\u201d found in the statute of Massachusetts but not in that of California, were very material, and furnished the real ground for the admission of extrinsic evidence. We do not think so. While those words may strengthen the argument in favor of the admissibility of the evidence, it by no means follows that the construction of the statute should be otherwise in their absence. The evidence which shows that \u2022the omission was intentional establishes that it was not through accident or mistake. Action purposely taken by one in the sufficient possession of bis faculties, and not induced, by fraud or undue influence; excludes in itself the idea of casualty or error.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">We are satisfied, that this particular phraseology was used-out of. abundant caution, as. serving to render the proper .construction somewhat plainer, and that the construction must be the same, although thosehvords are not used.''</p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>The rule ordinarily followed in construing statutes is to adopt the construction of the courts of the country by whose legislature the statute was originally adopted, but we are .not constrained to apply that rule in this instance. The original source of the statute is to be found in the legislation of Massachusetts. The Supreme Court of California declined to treat the received construction in Massachusetts, as accompanying the statute and forming an integral part of it, upon a distinction which we do not regard as well drawn. That construction commends itself to our judgment, and we hold that the Supreme Court of the Territory properly applied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">The evidence was competent, and the judgment must be</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b257-6\">Mu.
