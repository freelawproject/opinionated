The complaint then proceeded as follows: [That at the time that said cotton came to the 'possession of the plaintiff it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>was .engaged in the business of compressing cotton at its compress in the town of Argenta, opposite Little Rock, and on the north side of the Arkansas River, and that said cotton was deposited with the plaintiff for compression by various owners thereof, who delivered the same at the sheds and yards and adjacent grounds iff the said city of Little Rock, as described in said policy, with directions that the same should be transported to said compress by the plaintiff or some carrier employed for that purpose by it, and that on the receipt of any bales of said cotton by said plaintiff it gave a receipt for the same to the-owner thereof, and that, according ,to a custom known to said depositors, to the plaintiff, and to the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway Co. and the Missouri Par cific Railway Co., of which it was a part, and the Little Rock and Memphis Railroad Company, which were common carriers having and operating railroads of which both Argenta' and Little Rock were stations, said owners transferred said receipts to either one or the other of said carriers and received from said carriers bills of lading for the transportation by said carriers of said cotton to various places to which said cotton was then and there shipped by said owners, with an agreement with said railway companies that said cotton should not be shipped until it had been compressed by the plaintiff. There was a standing and continuing agreement between said plaintiff and said railway companies that the plaintiff should proceed to compress said cotton and all cotton thus received and should insure the 'same, after notice of the execution of' said bills of lading by said railway companies, against loss by fire during the time that said cotton should be in the hands of the plaintiff, for the purpose aforesaid, for a price averaging from sixty to sixty-five cents per bale, to be paid by said railway companies, respectively, when said cotton should be compressed and delivered to said railway companies on their cars at Arg\u00e9nta for transportation under said bills of lading, at which time said carriers should surrender to plaintiff the said receipts issued as aforesaid at the time that -said cotton was. deposited with the plaintiff for compression by the owners, as above stated; that all of said cotton was in the custody of plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>at the time of said loss, under and by virtue of said custom and agreement, and that it was lost by the negligence of the servants, agents, and employ\u00e9s of said railway companies, and that since said loss said St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway Company has been sued in this court by two of said consignees for the value of part of said cotton above named, to .wit, the Tork Manufacturing Company and Hazard <em>&amp; </em>Chapin, and said railway company defended said actions on .the ground that said loss was not occasioned by the negligence of said railway company or its servants and employ\u00e9s, and on a trial of said first-named cause it was adjudged by this court that said York Manufacturing Company and said Hazard &amp; Chapin recover from said railway company the value of said cotton sued for as aforesaid, and that since said adjudication said railway company has paid said judgment and the value of a large part of the cotton for which it. had issued bills of lading as aforesaid, and that several suits are now pending in this court .against said Little Rock and Memphis Railroad Company, brought by the consignee of portions of said cotton, .for the recovery of damages for .the loss of said cotton by reason of the negligence of said railroad company, which said suits are now pending and undetermined. On said Mth day of Novem- \u25a0 her, 1887, the plaintiff had in its possession at its sheds and premises above mentioned, for purposes of compression, a large amount of cotton,- to wit, over 3000 bales; that of this number 2700 bales of cotton were held by this plaintiff for the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway Company and the Little Rock <em>&amp; </em>Memphis Railroad Company. By said contract and agreement between plaintiff and said railroads this plaintiff took out the policies of .insurance above set out for the purpose of indemnifying this plaintiff against loss and liability, and the said railroad companies against loss and liability, by reason of the destruction of said cotton while it was being-held by plaintiffs for purposes of compression. The St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway has been adjudged as aforesaid to pay a large sum of money, to wit, $ \u2014, and in addition has paid a still larger amount because of its liability for such loss, amounting in all up to this date to $72,209.58, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>and has made demand therefor against the plaintiff for reimbursement of said losses.] \u201d It also averred that the loss by fire on the cotton equalled the insurance on it, and that the plaintiff had performed all the conditions of the policy; and prayed judgment for $10,000, with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-3\">The defendant moved to strike from the complaint the words \u201c together with a large quantity of other cotton in pos\u2022session of plaintiff, at said place, which was not insured by plaintiff,\u201d and also the foregoing part included in brackets. It also demurred to the complaint.on the ground that- it- did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; and also demurred separately to that part of it which is so included in brackets, on the ground that the facts therein stated did not tend to constitute a cause of action. The court overruled the said motion, and also the demurrer, and the defendant excepted to both of those rulings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-4\">The defendant then filed its answer, admitting the issuing of the policy, and that at the fire one hundred and twelve bales of cotton belonging to one Hanger and held by the plaintiff in trust for Hanger, -were burned, for the loss-of which the insurance companies named in the complaint had paid the plaintiff $4820.59, in full satisfaction thereof, and of which sum the defendant paid its full portion of the loss. The answer denied the material allegations of the complaint, and averred that the greater portion of the cotton alleged to have been lost at the fire was received by the plaintiff from the owners thereof after the issuing of the policy; that the cotton burned was first delivered by its owners to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff gave to the owners receipts for it, which provided that the plaintiff should not be liable for the loss of it by fire; that afterwards, and after the policy was issued, the cotton was sold to various persons who became its owners, and the Missouri Pacific Railway \u201cCompany, the Little Rock and Memphis Railroad Company, and the Little Rock, Mississippi River and Texas Railway Company, common carriers of cotton for hire, issued their bills of lading for the same to the purchasers, which provided that the carriers should not be liable for the loss thereof by fire, and at the same time such rail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>road companies took up the-receipts issued by the plaintiff to the original owners and surrendered them to the plaintiff, whereby-the possession of the cotton was changed, contrary to the provisions' of the policy, without any consent of, notice to, or knowledge by the \u25a0 defendant; (7). that it was provided in- the policy that it should not apply to or cover cotton which was at the time of loss covered in whole or in part by marine policies, and at that time 2172 \u2022 bales of the cotton alleged to have been burned, and of the value of $101,973,73, were covered by marine policies theretofore issued to the respective owners of the cotton; (8) that after the railroads had issued their bills of lading for the cotton, and before and at the time of the fire, it was kept in a grossly negligent manner, in a dangerous public place, without being covered or- sprinkled, and but a few feet from' a railroad track, where locomotives of the Missouri Pacific and the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern railroads, emitting sparks, were constantly'passing, by which sparks the fire was kindled,, and the cotton was destroyed by a fire whiclr occurred in broad daylight, at about four 9\u2019clock p.m., and which fire those two railroad companies, by the use of ordinary care, could have extinguished by removing the bales first ignited, or by putting out the fire by water from the hydrants which were close by; and that none of the cotton was destroyed by the negligence of the Little Rock and Memphis Railroad Company or its employ\u00e9s.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-4\">The plaintiff demurred to certain paragraphs of the answer, and among them paragraphs 7 and 8, as not stating facts sufficient to constitute a defence.- The^ court overruled such demurrer as to two of the paragraphs and sustained it as to paragraphs 7' and 8; to which latter ruling the defendant excepted. Thereupon the case was tried by a jury, which, found a verdict'for the plaintiff Tor $9491.96, on which a judgment was accordingly \u25a0 entered, to review which the defendant brought a. writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A69\">The first four assignments of error on the part of the defendant related to the overruling of its motion to strike out part of the complaint, the overruling of its demurrer to the complaint and to part thereof, and the sustaining of the demurrer qf the plaintiff to paragraphs 7 and 8 of the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>At the trial, the plaintiff offered evidence tending to prove that it was engaged in the business of compressing cotton at the town of Argenta, which was on the nerth bank of the Arkansas River directly opposite the city of Little Eock; that it received cotton for compression at Argenta and also at the premises described in the policy at Little Eock; that for cotton received at either place it issued receipts to the depositors, red receipts at Argenta and green receipts at Little Eock, a blank form of which, as it appears in the bill of exceptions, if filled out, would read thus : \u201cLittle Eock, Arkansas, Nov. 1, 1887.

Eich-. ard Eoe, Superintendent; \u201d that the holders of such receipts took them to the freight offices of one or the other of the two railway companies, the Missouri Pacific Eailway Company, and the Little Eock and Memphis Eailroad Company, and those companies issued bills of lading for cotton, which specified the number of bales and the marks, agreeing to deliver the cotton at an address specified in the bill of lading; that the same bills of lading covered cotton which was received by the plaintiff at Argenta and which actually was at Argenta, and cotton received at Little Eock and which actually was at Little Eock; that one form of bill of lading was issued by the Missouri Pacific Eailway Company and two forms by the Little Rock and Memphis Eailroad Company ; that it was \u2022 claimed that each form covered a portion of the cotton burned ; that each form, by its terms, exempted the carrier from liability for loss or damage by fire; and that, as the cotton might pass through the custody of several carriers before reaching its destination, each of them provided that the legal remedy for loss or damage occurring in transit should be only against the particular carrier in whose custody the cotton actually might be at the time of .the happening thereof. The Missouri Pacific Eailway Company in its bills of lading reserved to itself the privilege of compressing all cotton signed for on the bill of lading. The Memphis and Little Eock Eailroad Company did not re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>serve that privilege, but in one of its two forms, which was a through bill of lading to England, it stipulated for the benefit of any insurance that might have been effected on the- goods. There were five of such foreign bills of lading, covering 158 bales of lost cotton. Bills of lading covering 1460 bales alleged to have been burned were, issued by the Missouri Pacific Railway Company. The loss claimed on behalf of the latter company was for 1463 bales. The bills of lading issued by the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad Company were for 992 bales, but the loss claimed was for 1211 bales. By the bills of lading issued by the Missouri Pacific Railway Company on .the. lost cotton, 884 bales were covered after the date of the policy; and by those issued by the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad Company 255 bales were covered after that date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-4\">It also appeared by the bill of exceptions that, on the issuing of the bills of lading, the respective railroad companies notified the plaintiff of their 'issue, and ordered the cotton designated therein to be compressed at Argenta; that all of the cotton transported -from Little Rock to Argenta was carried on the track and by the cars of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company ; that the Little Rock and Memphis Railroad Company had no track and ran no cars near the premises described in the policy; that the plaintiff paid the Missouri Pacific Railway Company an agreed price for the transportation of the cotton from Little Rock to Argenta; and that the cotton was to be compressed after it arrived at Argenta, and was there to be loaded on the cars of such of the two railroad companies as,ite marks and the bills of lading called 'for, to be transported by them to its destination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-5\">The bill of exceptions further stated that the plaintiff offered evidence tending to prove that 2670 bales of cotton, covered by said bills of lading, were burned at the fire in question, while in the hands of the plaintiff for compression, after the bills of lading jvere issued and at the place'described in the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-6\">.The plaintiff also proved'that in October and November, 1887, there was an accumulation of cotton at the premises described in the-policy, owing to the fact that the Missouri Pacific Rail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>way Company had not sufficient cars to transport the cotton to Argenta as fast as it was received; that the cotton-sheds were open sheds and were at the time of the fire full of cotton, which had no tarpaulin or other cover over it, and stood within three or four feet of the track of the Missouri Pacific Eailway Company, over which locomotives and trains passed several times daily; that, after the sheds were full, the cotton was stored in the street, leaving a passage-way some four feet wide for foot passengers; that the two railroad companies had no control over the cotton while so stored, and could not obtain actual possession of it until the Missouri Pacific Pailway Company transported it to Argenta; for compression; but that that company could take it at any time across the river for compression. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-4\">The defendant offered in evidence the proof of loss furnished by the plaintiff to it, made oulj after the bringing of the suit, alleging the total destruction by fire of 2687 bales of cotton, in addition to what was known as the Hanger cotton, and that the 2687 bales were held by the plaintiff in trust or on commission, that is to sa,y, to be compressed, and 'were the property of various persons, the plaintiff being interested in the same to the extent of its charges, and stating the names of the consignees and the number of bales and their value pertaining to each consignee, no allusion being made to any interest of the railroad companies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-5\">(1) The plaintiff offered evidence tending to prove that the policy in suitwas taken out by it for the benefit of the railroad companies named in the complaint, and in pursuance of agreements between the plaintiff and those companies by which the plaintiff agreed to take out such insurance.

In Massachusetts, and perhaps one or two other States, it has been to a limited extent engrafted on policies of fire insurance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-5\">Marin\u00e9 rasurance comes from the civil law, the rules of which to the present day enter into the construction of its policies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-6\">Originally in England marine policies were frequently, if not. 'commonly, issued in blank, leaving it to the person procuring the insurance to insert the name of such beneficiary as he pleased. When not in blank they were almost equally indefinite as to the identity of the assured. The issue of policies in blank is now prohibited there. The term <em>\u201c </em>for account of whom it may concern \u201d is yet, a stranger to English policies. It is the brief American substitute for the lines of the Queen Anne policy above quoted, which lines were in themselves a declaration of the existing doctrine, that the person obtaining the insurance could fill. in the name of the beneficiary at his leisure, and that it was a matter which in no way concerned the insurer. When this term was first inserted in a policy of marine insurance in this country it is not easy exactly to determine, nor is it very material. See <em>Davis v: </em>Boardman, 12 Mass. 80; <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Boston Marine Ins. Co., </em>2 Cranch, 419; <em>Lawrence </em>v. Leber, 2 Caines, 203; <em>Hodgson </em>v. <em>Marine Ins. Co., </em>5 Cranch, 100; <em>Seamans </em>v. <em>Loring, </em>1 Mason, 127.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-7\">The business of fire insurance had its origin under the common law, in 1667, after the great fire in London, and from its inception was strictly a contract of indemnity. During the first seventy-nine years of .its existence the courts of England upheld the validity of wager policies of marine insurance. While the statute prohibiting wager policies of marine insurance was passed in 1736, no such statute applicable to fire insurance was passed until 1774. Tet before that time Lord Chancellor King and Lord Chancellor Hardwicke had recorded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>their opinions, that on a policy of fire insurance there could be no recovery without proof of interest. <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Dalzell, </em>4 Bro. P. C. 431. ed. Toml.; <em>Sadlers Co. </em>v. <em>Badcock, </em>2 Atk. 554.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-4\">With this wide difference in the history and customs of marine and. fire insurance it is not surprising to find in the adjudications concerning the latter, that the question \u201c who was the assured\u201d assumes a prominence that it does not attain under policies of marine insurance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-5\">An insurance on \u201c goods, their own or held by them in trust or-on commission\u201d is of American origin, and was an innovation on the accustomed manner of doing a fire insurance business. The form probably made its appearance in policies some years before it appears in the reports. See <em>Parks </em>v. <em>General Interest Assurance Co., </em>5 Pick. 34; <em>DeForest </em>v. <em>Fulton Fire Ins. Co., </em>1 Hall (N. Y.) 84.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-6\">Insurance in this form has invariably been held, to insure; first, the bailee to the extent of his liens or advances, and second, the <em>owner </em>of the goods. The varied interests in goods which may exist without property therein, have never been held covered by the form of insurance under consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-7\">In this particular policy the words \u201ctheir own\u201d and the words \u201cor on commission\u201d may be eliminated, as it is an established fact that the Union Compress Company neither owned any of \u00a3he-cotton burned or held any of it on commission. Por all purposes of this case the insurance was upon cotton in bales held in trust by the Union Compress Co., at the place designated in the policy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-8\">That the words \u201cin trust\u201d have not a technical meaning is admitted. The trust referred to is not of the kind usually treated of in works on Trusts and Trustees. The words, \u201c held in trust by them \u201d are defined as goods of which they had the care and custody, intrusted to them as representatives of others, and for which they are responsible <em>to the owner: Stillwell </em>v. <em>Staples, </em>19 N.

The policy is without ambiguity, and no evidence was admissible to prove that railroad companies, and not the owners of the cotton were intended as beneficiaries.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-6\">The subject matter of the insurance is definitely described. It was all the cotton held by the Union Compress Company in trust, at- the place designated in the policy. \"We have shown by ail unbroken series of decisions that the term \u201c in trust \u201d has acquired an established definition, in view of which contracts of insurance are entered into. It is held by the courts, and is known to factors, carriers and- other bailees, that the beneficiary of such insurance is the <em>owner </em>of the goods. There is nothing then ambiguous about the policies, which calls for any explanation whatever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-7\">True, the amount of cotton that was on the premises, its .value and the <em>names </em>of the owners are not specified, and they can be established only by evidence.

This cotton policy which was put in evidence contains an unusual and prominent feature, which is irreconcilable with any intent to insure a carrier-against a loss caused by its own negligence. - Ordinarily a fire insurance policy runs \u201c against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>all loss or damage by fire.\u201d But the policy in question is against all <em>direct </em>loss or damage by fire.\u201d . The evidence discloses the fact that all of the bills of lading issued by the. railroad companies provided that the carriers should be exempt from loss or damage by fire. The only interest, then, which the common carrier had in this cotton, was a contingent interest, arising from its liability for damages for loss by a fire, occurring through its own negligence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-4\">, Now, in the case at bar, the possible loss to the carrier by the destruction of the goods was by no means \u201c direct \u201d in any \u2022 sense of the term. It was remote, contingent and conditional. The fire alone could not inflict any loss.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-5\">\u2019 2. Another very serious objection to the claim that this\u2019 insurance was for the benefit of carriers as to the goods, destroyed arises on the record. ' The evidence. is not only strong) but irresistible that the insurance was for the owners, and that the court below, if it ass.um\u00e9d to decide the facts for the jury, should have come to a conclusion exactly contrary to that which it announced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-6\">3. By the complaint and evidence it appears that all this \u2019 cotton originally came into the hands of the Union Compress-Company. Afterwards the railroads issued bills of lading, on the cotton, some of which were issued before the policy, but more after it. If it be material to decide whether - or not the possession was changed by those bills \u00f3f lading, we. submit :' that it was changed, and that at the time of the fire the cotton was in the possession of the railroad companies, and so not covered by our policy. The delivery of the bills of lading was\" conclusive on the question of the delivery of the cotton. <em>Kentucky Marine </em>&amp; <em>Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>West. &amp; Atl. Railroad, </em>8 Baxter, 268. This precise point under very similar circumstances was decided by the Supreme Court of Maryland. That court held that the issuing of a bill of lading by a transportation company of goods in warehouse of another company \u2022daces the goods in the care and custody of the transportation sompany for purposes of insurance. <em>Fire Ins. Asso. </em>v. <em>Merchants' and Miners' Trans. Co., </em>66 Maryland, 339.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-8\">4. Upon one other point in this connection, we ask leave of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>tbe court, to call in question an expression of opinion of this honorable court,sand to respectfully request that that opinion may be reviewed by this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-4\">In <em>Ph\u0153nix Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Erie Transportation </em>Company, <em>117 </em>U. S. 312, Mr. Justice Gray, speaking for the court,, said: \u201cNo rule of law or of public policy is violated by allowing a \u2022common carrier, like any other person having either the general property or a peculiar interest in goods, to have them insured against the usual perils, and to recover for any loss from such perils, though occasioned by the negligence of his own sei\u2019vants.\u201d p. 324.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-5\"><em>We </em>have already shown in this case that the insurance, if for the benefit of the railroads, was purely and wholly an insurance against negligence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-6\">We wish, if we may, to argue to the court that insurance of that nature is contrary to public policy and void. We do so more hopefully because while, in the ease cited, the question of public policy may have been involved, it did not, if we may judge by the reported briefs of counsel, assume as much prominence as other considerations of more immediate interest to their clients.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-7\">We most respectfully submit that the tendency of this class 'of insurance would be to foster a gross and often criminal negligence with respect to property and property rights of others, and to jeopardize the safety not only of the goods insured, but of the property of others in proximity thereto.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYt\">, IV. In regard to the instruction of the court as to the liability for negligence of the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad Company we have to say that when a court instructs the jury at; to facts, its narration or allusion to facts should be fair. It should not select and dwell on, isolated facts which might be construed favorably to one side and make no allusion to other facts which might militate against that side. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>George, </em>80 Illinois, 51; <em>Newman </em>v. <em>McComas, </em>43 Maryland, 70<em>; West Chester Fire Ins. Co. v. Earle, </em>33 Michigan, 143; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Jones, 57 </em>Missouri, 138; <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Buhl Iron Works, </em>55 Michigan, 139.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-10\">The instruction of the court below was not a fair one as to \u25a0the facts. Whether or not the place named in the policy was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>a proper place to store cotton under the circumstances was an Immaterial question so far as the liability of the railroad company was concerned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-4\"><em>It was the place selected by the owners of the </em>cotton, <em>and not by the railroad company. The cotton was stored there by the owners and not by the company. </em>The accumulation of cotton at this improper place, if it was improper, existed in the month of October, before our policy was issued, and in November. Less than 300 bales of the burned cotton were covered by bills of lading of that company, issued in October. Seventy-two bales of it were covered by a bill of lading issued November 10, only four days before the fire. No negligence can therefore be imputed to the railroad company on account of the unfitness of the place where the cotton was stored.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-5\">Y. Assignment 3d is that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer of plaintiff to 7th paragraph of defendant\u2019s answer. That paragraph is as follows: \u201cThe defendant says that it is a provision of said policy, that it shall not' apply to. or cover cotton, which, at the time of the loss, was'covered in whole, or in part, by marine policies, and it says that at the time of said loss, 2172 bales of said cotton, alleged by plaintiff to have been burned at said fire, and of the value of \u00a7101,973.73, were covered by marine policies theretofore issued to the respective owners of said cotton.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-7\">The policy, which is part of the complaint, contains the following provision. \u201cIt is agreed and understood to be a condition of this insurance that this policy shall not apply to or cover any cotton which may at the time of loss be covered in whole or in part by a marine policy.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-8\">By its policy, the plaintiff in.error absolutely declined to insure any cotton which, at time of loss, was covered by marine policies. As to the- validity of this condition, there can be no . question. The right of the insurer to decline .insurance absolutely upon certain classes of goods, or under circumstances distasteful to the insurer, cannot be denied. He can provide that goods held in trust are not insured, unless so declared in the policy, and the provision is valid. <em>Baltimore Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Loney, </em>20 Maryland, 20.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>In this case, the plaintiff in error in positive terms declined to insure cotton covered by marine policies. A reason for this provision may easily be found, but it is not necessary to search for One. .It is sufficient to say, thus is the contract written. \"We allege that at the time of loss, nearly all this cotton was covered by marine policies. \u2022 If that be so no liability attached to this company for loss of cotton so covered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-4\">YI. Assignment 10th is the rejection of competent evidence proffered by us that at the time of the fire 2172 bales of cotton covered by bills of lading of the railroad companies and alleged to have been burned, and of the value-of $101,973, were covered by marine policies of insurance, theretofore issued to the respective owners of said cotton, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9\">- By our answer we alleged that at the time of the fire there was a total insurance on the cotton burned to the amount of about $250,000 and claimed the benefit of the contribution clause in our policy. The complaint alleged total insurance to amount of $142,500.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUnv\">Our policy contained the following contribution clause : \u201c In ca'se of any other insurance upon the property hereby insured, <em>whether to the same.party or upon the same interest therein or </em>.otherwise, whether valid or not, and whether prior or subsequent to the date of this policy, the insured shall be entitled to recover from this company no greater proportion of the loss sustained than the sum hereby insured bears to the whole amount insured thereon, whether such other insurance be by specific or by general or floating policies, or by policies covering only an excess of specified loss. And it is hereby declared and agreed that in case of the assured holding any other policy in this or any other company on the property insured, or any part thereof, subject to the conditions of average, this policy shall be subject to average in like manner.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-7\">, It will be seen by the very terms of the policy that it is immaterial on the question of contribution, whether the fire policies were- taken out for the benefit of the owners or of the railroad companies. In either case the marine policies are contributory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-8\">The clause is very like, but- a little stronger, than that sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>tained by the Court of App\u00e9\u00e1ls of Maryland, in <em>Fire Ins. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Merchants' &amp; Miners\u2019 Trans. Co. </em>already cited. Under it these marine policies were contributory to our fire policy. The validity of the clause can hardly be called in question. It is \u2022 perfectly competent for an insurance company to provide in its policy that any other policy taken.out on the insured prop-, erty shall be considered contributory, even though that policy _ be invalid, or that its policy shall be absolutely void under like conditions. <em>Liverpool, London &amp;c. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Verdier, </em>35 Michigan, 395; <em>Continental Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hulman, </em>92 Illinois, 145.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-4\">\u00a5e then respectfully submit that we should, have been permitted to prove the existence of these Contributory policies. That proof being ruled out, we were held to''pay the proportion of this loss which 10,000 bears to 142,500, while, if liable at all, - we should have been held to pay only in proportion of 10,000 to 244,473.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-5\">VII. Assignment 11th is that the court erred' in striking out testimony of the bookkeeper of Balli Brothers, who were claiming pay from the Memphis &amp; Little Bock Bailroad Co. for 158 bales of cotton, to the effect that said cotton was covered by marine policies taken out by Balli Brothers. It was stricken out on the ground that we could prove the insurance only-by the policies. It was shown that we could not get the policies, The ruling was erroneous. ' <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>61 Alabama, 363.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-6\">It was especially erroneous in this case, because the Coinpany was- making a claim on us for th\u00e9 value of those 158 bales solely because Balli &amp; Brothers had made a claim on them. Any evidence which the railroad could have used against Balli Brothers we were entitled to use against the railroad, and certainly when Balli Brothers refused to produce the policies, the railroad company could have proved their existence by their clerk. The bills of lading under which that cotton was shipped stipulated that the carriers should have the benefit of all insurance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-7\">VIII. Our 17th assignment is that the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that no cause of action arose on this policy, on behalf of the railroad companies, until actual payment of damages to the owners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>The statement of the facts in this case is a strong argument on behalf of that instruction.

The court refused to strike out the matter in the complaint which is before recited in brackets, and also overruled the demurrer of the defendant to that portion of the complaint ; and on the trial the plaintiff was permitted to introduce evidence tending to prove some of the allegations contained in-that part of the complaint. The three instructions before quoted as asked by the defendant, and not given, relate to the same matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">The defendant contends that there was error in the action of the court covered by those exceptions, and complains that the court treated the words in tips policy, \u201c their own or held by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>them in trust, or on commission,\u201d as if they read, \u201c on account of whom it may concern; \u201d that, as the plaintiff did not own the cotton, the beneficiaries under the policy were its owners ; that no interest of any common carrier was covered by the policy; that it was not ambiguous; and that no parol testimony was admissible to aid in its interpretation or to show that the railroad companies were intended to be beneficiaries under it. The view urged is, that the plaintiff did not own any of the cotton or hold any of it on commission; that the insurance on goods held in trust -was an insurance only for the benefit of the owners of the cotton; and that evidence of an intention to effect the insurance for the benefit of One who was not the owner of the goods was inadmissible, because it would contradict the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\">But we think the positions taken on behalf of the defendant are not sound. The title to cotton in the temporary custody of a bailee for compression, for which receipts or bills of lading have been given, is manifestly changing hands constantly. The language of the present policy, insuring cotton <em>\u201c </em>their own or held by them in trust or on commission,\u201d accommodates such a state of things. \u25a0 In the present case, the insurance was really taken out by the railroad companies, and that fact was well known to the agents of the defendant at the time the policy was issued. The railroad companies had an insurable interest in the cotton, and to that extent were the owners of the cotton, which was held in trust for them by the plaintiff. Evidence of their ownership of the cotton was admissible. <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Balt. Warehouse Co., </em>93 U. S. 527, 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">The policy covered all the cotton which was placed in the hands of the plaintiff by those companies. It was lawful for the plaintiff to insure in its own name goods held in trust by it, and it can recover for their entire value, holding the excess over its own interest in them for the benefit of those who have entrusted the goods to it. <em>DeForest </em>v. <em>Fulton Fire Ins.

The reasoning of the cases where the bailor was the owner of the goods insured by the bailee applies equally to any person, who, having an insurable interest in property, entrusts it to another; and such bailor can, to the extent of his insurable' interest, claim the benefit of insurance effected in his favor by his bailee. .The original .depositors of the cotton surrendered to the railroad companies the repeipts which they had taken from the plaintiff, and those companies' were thus substituted in. the relation to the plaintiff which before had been held by such depositors. The railroad companies thus became the beneficiaries of the trust, so far as the plaintiff was concerned, because they- thus became the persons to whom the plaintiff owed the duty of bailment, and the persons entitled to demand the possession of the property from the plaintiff. . There was privity in the plaintiff with the person-who held its receipt, and privity with no one else. This is a necessary and obvious result of the \u00e9ourse of business; and the business in question could not be carried on under any other circumstances so as to give protection by insurance to the' parties really interested.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The case is not varied \u00f3r affected by the clause in the receipts given by the plaintiff, \u201cnot responsible for any loss by fire,\u201d because, the relation of the plaintiff to the property entrusted to it, arid its duty to the bailor, determine the legal propriety of the insurance for the benefit of the latter. In the present case, the arrangement was that the railroad companies should pay to the plaintiff, in connection with the charge for compressing, an additional sum which would provide for the insurance of all cotton in the possession of the plaintiff, for which the railroad companies Should issue' bills of lading. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>defendant had notice that the insurance was effected in the interest of the railroad companies; and it issued the policy in-the terms it did, to include the protection of the railroad companies. The fact that the same policy might protect the interest of other persons in respect to cotton held for them by. the plaintiff cannot affect the question whether it protects the interest of the railroad companies in respect to cotton held-by, the.plaintiff for them, during the life of the policy. Nor is it material whether the cotton was originally deposited by the railroad companies, or whether their interest accrued through the subsequent transfer to the railroad companies of receipts given by the plaintiff on a deposit of cotton made by other parties.</p>\n<p id=\"At\">(2) We come now to another group of errors assigned. The defendant requested the court to instruct the jury as follows: \u201c The policy in question provides that it' shall be void if there be any change in the possession of the insured prop-' erty, except under circumstances which have no bearing on this case. If the jury believe from the evidence that after the' policy in question was issued, any common carrier, with the knowledge and consent of plaintiff and under agreement with plaintiff, issued its bills of lading for any of the cotton which at the date of the policy was or thereafter carne into possession of the plaintiff, the issuance of such bills of lading, under the conditions of the policy, avoided the policy as to all cotton covered by such bills of lading.\u201d The court refused to- give such instruction, and the defendant excepted to the refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">.The court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cBy an agreement made between the plaintiff and\" the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Bailway Company and the Memphis and /Little Bock Bailway Company, the plaintiff engaged to insur\u00e9 for said railway companies, respectively, all cottons stored in the compress sheds and yards of the plaintiff, at the foot qf Main Street, Little Bock, when the railway companies or either of them should notify the plaintiff of the issuance by them of bills of lading therefor. This agreement was carried' out, and on the day of the fire the plaintiff held .insurance in \u2022 various companies, aggregating the sum of $142,500.00, in &gt; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>trust and to indemnify the railway companies against loss or damage by fire of the cotton for which they had issued their, bills of lading and which was stored in the plaintiff\u2019s sheds and yards described in the policy, at the foot of Main Street.\u201d The defendant excepted to this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The court also charged the, jury as'follows: \u201cAs the plaintiff is a trustee, and insured the cotton for the benefit of the railway companies, and has no separate claim of its own' on. the property, it is only entitled to recover an amount equal to its liability to the railroad companies; or, in other words, a sum that will make the railway companies whole for the cotton on which they 'had issued bills of lading; so that, if the market price of cotton produces a larger sum than the aggregate loss of the railway companies (and 2670 bales at $50 per bale, if you should find that was the number of bales and their value, produces an amount slightly in excess of the claims of the railroad companies), then the plaintiff\u2019s recovery must be on the basis of the latter sum \u2014 that is, one that makes the railway companies whole. In no event is the market value of the cotton to be increased, but it may be reduced by the difference between the value and the amount that will satisfy the just claims of the railway companies. What amount of cotton was burned for which the railway companies had issued bills of lading and which was covered by policies taken out by the plaintiffs, the value of the same, and the amount of the just demands of the railway companies against the plaintiff for the cotton so burned, are questions of fact to be determined by you.\u201d The defendant excepted 'to this charge. \\</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The court also charged the jury as follows: \u201cThis suit .brought on a policy of insurance issued by the defendant\u2019s company, to the Union Compress Company to indemnify the railroad company for the loss of cotton or for cotton that might be burned after the railroad company issued its bills of lading for it, and while it yet remained in the custody of the Compress Company. Now, the Compress Company, under its contract with the railroad company, is bound to make good; by insurance, to the railroad company, any damages resulting: to it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>from the loss of cotton whieh the Compress Company held for the railroad company after the railroad company had issued its bills of lading therefor and notified it thereof.\u201d . The defendant excepted to this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The defendant contends that, although, under a proper construction of the policy, the railroad companies may be regarded as properly beneficiaries under it, the matters involved in the instructions so given by the court were questions of mingled fact and law, and were erroneous, in the light of the facts proved by the plaintiff. The ground urged is, that the policy cannot be reconciled with any intent to insure a railroad company against a loss caused by its own negligence, because the policy .insures against \u201call direct loss or damage by fire; \u201d that, therefore, the only interest which the railroad companies had in the cotton was'-a contingent interest, arising from their liability for damages for loss by a fire occurring through their own negligence; that the interest alleged to have been insured as that of the railroad companies was not such as could have sustained a claim \u00f3n a direct loss by fire, because it was a contingent or doubtful interest, and not a certain or direct interest; that the fire alone could not inflict any loss, and that whether the railroad companies would suffer loss would depend on the contingencies, (1) whether or not their negligence caused the loss; (2) whether the owner would be able to prove negligence in the railroad companies; (3) whether the owner was innocent of contributory negligence; and, (4) whether the owner should make a claim for loss against the railroad companies within the statute of limitations. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Under this head, it is also urged, that, on the face of the policy, the insurance was on cotton held in trust by the plaintiff, in a designated place, for thirty days after November 2, that it was claimed by the plaintiff, in the face of the policy and contradictory of its terms, that' cotton cov\u00f3red by a bill of lading issued November 8th, by the Missouri Pacific Kailway Company, which was held'\"in trust by the plaintiff, and was in the place described, was not covered by the policy until the bill of lading was issued; that if, as the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>alleges the fact to be; that cotton was covered by the policy from the 3d to the 8th of November, for the benefit of its owners, there was no process known to the law by which'the benefit of such insurance could be transferred to the railroad companies, without action by either the owner or the insurer; that the fact that the plaintiff understood that the insurance was for the benefit of the owners of the cotton was shown by the practical construction put upon the insurance by the plaintiff after the fire, in putting in a claim on behalf of Hanger for 112 bales of cotton burned not covered by the bills of lading, and being paid for it, on behalf of Hanger, as owner of the cotton; and that thus the plaintiff claims that the insurance was for the owners of the cotton, or for the railroad companies, according to circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">It is further urged that, if the bills of lading changed the possession of the cotton, it was at the time of the fire in the possession of the railroad companies and not in that of the plaintiff, and the plaintiff had ceased to hold it in trust; that in \u25a0 such case it was not insured, because of the provision in the policy that any change in the possession should avoid the policy; that if the bills of lading did not change the possession, there could have been no insurance on behalf of the railroad companies, because, in the absence of possession by them, they had no right to insure and no contingent liability to loss; and that it was error in the court to charge that at the \u2022' ime of the fire the plaintiff held insurance on cotton cover d by bills of lading.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">This court is also asked to review its announcement of the principle of law laid down in <em>Ph\u0153nix Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Erie Transportation Co., </em>117 U. S. 312, 324, that \u201cno rul\u00e9 of law or of public policy is violated by. allowing a common carrier, like any other person having either the general property or a pecu-. liar interest in goods, to have them insured against the usual perils, and to recover for any loss from such perils, though occasioned by the negligence of his own servants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">It is also contended that the jury had \u00e1 right to decide whether or not the policy' was issued on goods held in trust' for the railroad companies by the plaintiff, and wh\u00e9ther or not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>\u2022the plaintiff or the railroad companies held the cotton at the time of the fire; and that these were not questions for the court.to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"A8\">In reply to these suggestions, it is to be said, that the exception of loss by fire, contained in the receipts given by the plaintiff, and in the bills of lading given by the railroad companies, did not free them from responsibility for .damages occasioned by their own negligence or that of their employ\u00e9s. Nor are we disposed to review our decision that common carriers can insure themselves against loss proceeding from the negligence of their own servants; ' The doctrine announced in the case cited has been referred to with approval in the subsequent cases of <em>Orient Ins. Co. </em>v. Adams, 123 U. S. 67, 72, and <em>Liverpool Steam Co. </em>v. <em>Ph\u0153nix Ins. Co., </em>129 U. S. 397, 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">As to the suggestion that by the bills of lading the possession of the cotton was transferred to the railroad companies, and that the policy was avoided thereby, the answer is, that the cotton was still in the hands of the plaintiff, in its actual possession and upon its premises. At most, the railroad companies, by acquiring the receipts of the plaintiff and issuing bills of lading for the cotton, took only constructive possession of it; and the plaintiff, retaining actual and physical possession of it, did not lose any element of possession necessary to give it the right to effect insurance for.its own benefit, and, as bailee or agent, for the protection of the railroad companies. All that the railroad companies acquired was the right to ultimate possession,, which passed to them by the transfer to them, by the original depositors, of the cotton receipts given by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"AYG\">As to the argument that no recovery can be had in the interest of the railroad companies, because the injury to them depended upon their liability for the negligence of their employ\u00e9s in causing the, fire, and the point taken in regard to the words of the -policy, \u201c direct loss or damage by fire,\u201d the reply' is, that those words mean loss or damage occurring-directly from fire ks the destroying 'agency, in contradistinction.to the remoteness, of fire as such agency. The books ar\u00e9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>full of cases on that subject, and the meaning of the policy is not doubtful. Remoteness of agency is the explosion of gunpowder, g'ases or chemicals, caused by fire; the explosion of steam-boilers; the destruction of buildings to prevent the spread of fire, or their destruction through the falling of burning walls; and so forth. In the present case, the bales of cotton were physically burned by the direct action of fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">(3) The court also charged the jury as follows: \u201c Now, you have heard the testimony, gentlemen, with reference to the situation under which this cotton was placed and the length of time it remained there. If you think there is no negligence on the part of the railroad company, then you will find that the railroad company is not liable for this cotton. If you can say that that was a proper place to store cotton, and that leaving a passage-way there of not exceeding four feet up and down, through which persons passed at all hours of .the day and night to the boat-house and skiff ferry, and it being a dry season, with three or four thousand bales of cotton stored there \u2014 <em>thpn, if you say this is not negligence, you excuse this railroad pompcmy, and to that extent will disallow the claim of the plaiftiff; hut if you should so find I would he very much surprised at your verdict, and would not he surprised if I should set it aside </em>/ <em>hut I will lerne it for you to say.\u201d </em>The defendant excepted to this instruction, and especially to the italicized portion thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">It is urged that in this part of the charge the court did not allude to facts proyed which the defendant claimed disproved negligence, and that thus the instruction was not a fair one as to the facts; that the place of storage was selected and the cotton was stored there by the owners of it, and not by the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad Company; that no negligence can be imputed to the latter on .account of the unfitness of the place; that it had no control over the cotton stored in that place, and had no track at that place, the Missouri Pacific Railway Company having the track there; that 'the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad Company had no opportunity to obtain possession of the cotton until after it had been compressed at Argenta; that the bills of lading of the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>company exempted it from liability for loss occurring ou the lines of other carriers, and the cotton was burned, not on its line, but on the line of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company ; that the court made no allusion to any of these matters as going to establish the absence of negligence and liability on the- part of the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad Company: that the court threaten\u00e9d the jury with its displeasure and the setting aside of the verdict if the jury should bring in a verdict for the defendant on .that issue; and that this action of the court was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">But the mere fact of the dwelling by the court with emphasis upon facts which seemed to it of controlling importance, and expressing its opinion as to the bearing of those facts on the question of negligence, is immaterial, if the court left the issue to the jury. -In the charge, just before the passage complained of, the court, in referring to the question of the liability of the'Memphis and Little Rock Railroad Company for the destruction of the cotton, had said to the' jury: \u201cIt is for you to determine whether this railroad company was not guilty of negligence, and was not at fault in leaving this cotton in an exposed condition after, it issued bills of lading therefor;\u201d and in the clause of the charge objected to, the court expressly states that it leaves the question of negligence to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">On this subject, this court said, in <em>Vicksburg &amp;c. Railroad </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>118 U. S. 545, 553: \u201c In the courts of the United States, as in those of England, from which our practice was derived, the judge, in submitting a case to a jury, may, at his discretion,, whenever he thinks it necessary to assist them in arriving at a just conclusion, comment upon the evidence, call their attention to parts of it \"which he thinks important and express his opinion upon the facts ; and the expression, of such an opinion when no rule of law is incorrectly stated, and all matters of fact are ultimately submitted to the determination of the jury, cannot be reviewed on writ of error.\u201d See, also, <em>Nudd </em>v. <em>Burrows, </em>91 U. S. 426; <em>Indianapolis &amp;c. Railroad </em>v. <em>Horst, </em>93 U. S. 291; <em>St. Louis &amp;c. Railway </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>122 U. S. 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>(4) In the course of the trial the plaintiff. offered evidence tending to prove that the contracts and cu'stom of business stated in the bill of exceptions were well known to shippers and to the defendant when the policy sued on was issued, it having been stated to the agents of the.defendant by an officer of the plaintiff, when the policy was applied for, that it was intended to cover the interests of the plaintiff and of the railroad companies. The defendant objected to the admission of the evidence, but the objection was overruled, and'\"the defendant excepted; and this is alleged as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">In this connection it is urged that the complaint does not allege any such knowledge on the part of the defendant,, or any intention on its part to issue its policy for the benefit of the railroad companies. The case of <em>Hough </em>v. <em>People's Fire Ins. Co., </em>36 Maryland, 398, is cited in support of this assignment\u2019of error. But we think the- evidence was admissible! In: the Hough case the policy covered the merchandise insured,. \u201c their own, or held by them in trust, or in which they have an interest or liability.\u201d Parol evidence was held to be incompetent which w.as offered to show that -the policy did not cover merchandise which was their own. The evidence .would have contradicted the plain terms of the policy. In the present case, the evidence offered was admissible under the ruling in <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Balt. Warehouse Co., </em>93 U. S. 527, 542. In that case the court says.: \u201c It is no exception to the rule \u201d (governing the admission of parol evidence) \u201c that, when a policy is taken out expressly for or on account of the owner \u2019 of the subject insured, or on account of whomsoever it may concern,\u2019 . evidence beyond the policy is received to show who are the owners or who were intended to be insured thereby. In such \u25a0 cases, the words of the policy-fail .to designate the real party to the contract, and, therefore, unless resort is had to extrinsic evidence, there is no contract at all.\u201d. See, also, <em>Finney </em>v. <em>Bedford Ins. Co., </em>8 Met. 348; <em>Fire Ins. Asso. </em>v. <em>Merchants &amp; Miners' Trans. Co., </em>66 Maryland, 339; <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>61 Alabama, 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Having issued the policy with notice that it was intended to .cover the interest of the railroad .companies, the defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>estopped from asserting that the policy was intended to protect only the legal owners of the cottQn.</p>\n<p id=\"Ays\">(5) It is alleged, also, that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer of the plaintiff to paragraph 7 of the defendant\u2019s answer, which alleged that at the time of the loss 2172 bales of the cotton alleged to have been burned Avere covered by marine policies theretofore issued to the'.respective owners of the cotton, and therefore, under the terms of the policy in this suit, such cotton was not coyered by it. It is alleged, also, as error, that the court, at the trial, rejected, on the objection of the plaintiff and under the exception of. the defendant, evidence offered by the latter tending to prove that that number of bales of the cotton covered by the bills of lading, and alleged to ha\\e been burned,- were, at the time of the fire, covered by marine policies of insurance theretofore issued to the respective owners of such cotton, residing in various portions of the United States and in England.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">It is to be said, in reply, that paragraph 7 of the answer does not show that the marine policies were on the same interest as that covered by the fire policy. This element is necessary, because otherwise the policy sued on would be of no practical force. As soon as the consignees of the cotton were advised by telegraph of its shipment, they would take out marine policies to cover their own risk; and thus the fire insurance companies wou] obtain the premiums of insurance from the railroad companies, and immediately avoid all risk, because of the taking out of the marine policies. <em>North British Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>London, Liverpool &amp; Globe Lns. Co., </em>5 Ch. D. 569. The question of the legal effect of the contribution clause of the policy, before recited, is not presented by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The objection alleged at the trial to the introduction of evidence as to the marine policies was made on the ground' that, it was immaterial and irrelevant, and that the insured knew \u25a0nothing of those policies and had\"- no interest in them. This was the objection which was sustained; and the allegation of paragraph 7 of the answer was, that the marine policies- had been issued to the respective owners of the cotton. It did not 'appear that either the insurer or the insured had any previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>knowledge of the existence of the marine policies, nor did it appear whether they were issued before or after the date of the fire policy. The issuing of the marine policies, in order to have any effect in this case, must amount to double insurance. In no other view can the defendant have any interest in the question of marine insurance. Double insurance exists only in the case of risks upon the same interest in property and in favor of the same person. <em>North British Ins. Co. </em>v. London, <em>Liverpool &amp; Globe Ins. Co., </em>5 Ch. D. 569; <em>Lowell Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Safeguard Fire Lns. Co., </em>88 N. <em>Y. </em>591; Phillips on Insurance, \u00a7 359; Wood on Pire Ins. 1st ed. \u00a7 352. No reason Can exist for a distinction between the construction of a provision avoiding \u00e1 policy in case of marine insurance and in case of further or additional fire insurance. In the latter case the'provision is \u00e1.ways construed as relating only to additional insurance upon the same interest and effected by the same person or in his interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">' The contention of the defendant is, that its policy is avoided by the taking out of a marine policy by the owner of the cotton, without the knowledge or participation of the plaintiff <em>oy </em>of the railroad companies, whether the marine insurance was effected before or after the fire insurance in favor of the railway companies, and although the fire insurance policy was taken to protect the independent interests of the railroad companies. We cannot admit the soundness of this view. The cases cited where a policy is avoided by the carrying on of a prohibited business, or the storing of a prohibited article, without the knowledge or consent of the insured owner of a building, are placed upon the ground that the possession of the tenant or occupant of a' building is the possession of its owner, and that the. contracts which, he makes as to the use of the insured premises are in the nature of warranties, and relate to matters over which he has legitimate control. It cannot be contended successfully that the condition in question here was intended by the plaintiff to subject the policy to forfeiture if any person who had a remote 'and independent insurable interest should take out a policy of marine insurance to protect that interest, the plaintiff having no privity with such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>person. As was said in <em>Grandin </em>v. <em>Rochester German Ins. Co., </em>107 Penn. St. 26, 37: \u201cWe are not to suppose that conditions involving forfeitures are introduced into policies by insurance companies, which are purely arbitrary and without reason, merely as a trap to the assured or as a means of escape for the company in case of loss. When, therefore, a general condition has no application to a particular policy ; where the reason which alone gives it force is out of the case, the condition itself drops out with it.\u201d See, also, <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>\u00c6tna Ins. Co., </em>32 N. Y. 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">The offer of evidence by the defendant at the trial, in regard to the marine insurance, was by its terms an offer to prove the mere fact of marine insurance, in support of the defence set up in paragraph 7 of the answer; and the claim on the part of the defendant that the evidence was proper to support the further defence set up in the answer, as to the amount of the proportionate liability of the defendant, is not tenable. The offer was to prove merely the fact of marine insurance-, and not to prove its amount. It was an offer in bar of liability, and not an offer applicable to a reduction of the verdict. No suggestion of the latter object was made in the offer, and the evidence, if admitted as offered, could have no bearing upon the question as to how much the proportionate liability of the defendant would be reduced by virtue of the marine policies. The only specific offer to prove the terms of any marine policy, and the extent of the insurance under it, was made in the form of an offer of the deposition of one Phillips and the testimony of one Bowen, both of which were excluded on proper grounds, and complaint is made only of the exclusion of the deposition of Phillips.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">(6) It is assigned for error that the court erred in striking out the testimony in the deposition of Phillips, the clerk of Ralli Bros., who were claiming pay from the Memphis and Little Bock Bailroad Company for 158 bales of cotton, to the effect that, that cotton was covered by marine policies taken out by Balli Bros. The policies of insurance mentioned in the testimony .in .the deposition\u2019 were not attached to it. The testimony was objected to by the plaintiff as incompetent because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>it was an attempt to prove by parol the contents of written instruments'; it was stricken out by tbe court, and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The. ruling of the court was manifestly correct. There was no proof that the policies referred to were in Liverpool, for all that the witness Bowen said was that he was informed they were there; and as to the copy which Phillips refused to attach to his deposition, all the evidence in regard to its identity is that Phillips said to the witness Bowen that such copy was. a copy of the marine policy which had been issued on the cotton. This was, all of it, only hearsay evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">(7) The court was requested by the defendant to instruct, the- jury as follows : \u201cAs this action is brought solely on behalf' of the railroad companies on account of liability incurred through carelessness of the agents and servants of the companies, no cause of action accrued against the defendant until the actual payment by said companies of damages on account of the alleged fire, and the recovery cannot be greater than the value, on November 14,1887, at Little Bock, of the cotton so burned and paid for \u2014 mor greater than the sum paid by the railroad companies \u2014 that is, if they have paid more than the value- of the cotton they cannot recover the excess from the.defendant; if they have paid less than the value, they can recover only to. the extent of the payment.\u201d The court refused to give that, instruction, and defendant excepted. This is alleged as error. It is urged that the Memphis and Little Bock Bailroad Company has never paid any damages, and that the Missouri Pacific Bail way Company had not paid any when this suit was commenced; and it is contended that no 'cause of action accrues, in a case of that kind, until payment-of the damages by the railroad companies is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">But, as a bailee, under a policy taken out to cover property,' his own or held by him in trust or on commission, may enforce the contract of insurance to the full value of the property destroyed, holding the proceeds primarily for his own benefit and the balance for that of his- bailor, the right of action of the plaintiff accrued on the occurring of the loss. The case cited by the defendant, Cin., <em>Hamilton &amp; Dayton Railroad </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>v. <em>Spratt, </em>2 Duvall, 4, does- not apply to the. present case. That was a- suit brought by a consignee of goods against a carrier, where the carrier was entitled, under a bill of lading given by it to the consignee, to insurance obtained by the consignee; and it was held that the consignee could not be compelled to proceed upon the policy of insurance before enforcing his claim against the carrier, even where it appeared that the insurer had agreed to pay its loss under the policy, and although it was alleged that the suit was prosecuted for the benefit of the insurer. But. here the plaintiff is the assured-. The insurance included the. protection of the railroad companies. The premium was paid. The insured property was destroyed by fire. The condition of the liability of the insurer was complete, and its liability had fully accrued. The only question for litigation was whether the railroad companies were protected by the insurance. The defendant is called upon to perform only its agreement to pay the insurance money in case of the destruction off the cotton by fire. Its liability is not dependent upon the question whether the liability of the railroad companies has been discharged; nor is the plaintiff\u2019s right of action contingent upon the payment by the railroad companies of the value of the cotton burned, but it is contingent only upon the destruction of the cotton by fire under circumstances which impose a liability upon the railroad companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">We see no error in' the record, and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
