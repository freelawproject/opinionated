Bank, which paid\u2019all balances against them, and these at.some times, amounted, to very large sums. The commercial and business\u2019 paper which they took at their banking-house in Portsmouth was \u25a0 largely rediscounted for-them at the bank; and on the 31st of March, 1885, their indebtedness to the bank has been stated approximately as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>\u201c Bain <em>&amp; </em>Bro.\u2019s notes &amp;c., unendorsed and unse- : \u25a0 cured ... <em>.'.......'\u25a0 </em>. . \u25a0 . . $800,000 '00:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b699-5\">\u201cNotes of others \u00e9ndorsed by them'..... 593,251 -99</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b699-6\">Cash tickets.............. 211 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b699-7\">\u201cBain &amp; Bro.\u2019s notes endorsed by bank and dis- \u25a0' \u25a0 counted in New York . . . \u25a0 . . \u25a0. . 50,000 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b699-9\">\u201cIn all..........$1,443,468 99</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b699-10\">. \u201cIn addition to this George M. Bain, Jr;, and James G. Bain each owed the bank very considerable sums. Such being the condition of affairs, the Comptroller of the Currency required, the bank to reduce at once the unsecured debt of Bain &amp; Bro., and to make good the deficiency in its reserve fund. In consequence of this the firm on the 31st of March sold , to the bank the following stocks and bonds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b699-11\">\u201c Seaboard Compress Company stocks . ... . .\u25a0 $300,000 .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b699-12\">\u201cMeherrin Yalley railroad.bonds . ,. . ... . . ,200,000' ^</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b699-13\">\u201cSouthern telegraph bonds, of the par value of $140,000, at . &lt;\u2022............. .70,000-.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b699-15\">\u201cIn all.........' . . .$570,000</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b699-16\">and guaranteed that the same should yield the amount^ for which they .were taken whenever put on the.market and sold. This guaranty was secured by a transfer of the.interest of the firm in the Richmond Cedar Works, and also in $80,000' of Southern telegraph bonds held as collateral security. This being done, and the firm also agreeing not to assign their either property for the benefit of creditors. with preferences against the bank, notes of the firm and other indebtedness to the amount agreed on as the value of the stocks and' bonds were surrendered and the unsecured debts thereby nominally reduced. While' some of the stocks and bonds .thus transferred had been before that time in the possession of the bawl?, Or some of its officers, the evidence does not establish the' fact that they had been in any way pledged, or that they could be legally held by the bank as. security. They were all, so far as appears, the property of the firm, free of any specific claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>. the bank. The value of the stocks and bonds thus transferred-falls- between two and three hundred thousand dollars short of the amount for which they were taken, and the Richmond .Cedar Works stock and Southern telegraph bonds,-held as-collateral to the guaranty against this deficiency, are of but-little valu\u00e9-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b700-4\">\u201cWhat was thus done did not satisfy the Comptroller, and on the 2d of April, 1885, he took possession of the bank for\u2019 the purpose of winding up its affairs. The banking-house in - Portsmouth closed its doors at the same time. This , produced, great excitement both in Portsmouth and Norfolk, and resulted in the assignment which is now attacked. Mr. Old,' one of the assignees, is an attorney-at-law, and was retained as counsel for the firm. He advised them in all their - matters and' drafted the assignment. He was informed of \u2022 the agreement which had been made' not to assign with preferences against the bank, and knew generally of the' l\u00e1rge indebtedness of the firm and of its members to the bank. He also knew of the transaction between-the-bank and the firm On the 31st of March, and, hearing that it was the intention of the creditors of the bank to enjoin the assignment, he made haste to have it executed and recorded before \u2022 anything of that kind was done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b700-7\">. \u201cThe actual value of the property which passed by the assignment does not exceed five hundred thousand dollars. The property consists very largely of real estate in Portsmouth and. Norfolk County, the title to most of which was in R. T. K. Bain. -The books of the firm are entirely unreliable. In fact, no general ledger was ever kept, and transactions to enormous amounts can only be traced by memoranda on slips of paper with the help of the explanations of R. T. K. Bain, who was the- principal manager. No accounts at all were kept with the bank, and everything, so far as Bain <em>&amp; </em>Bro. were'concerned, was found in the greatest confusion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b700-8\">\u00a1 -\u201cAfter the death of Thomas A.

As to the trust resulting to the bank by reason of the' \u2022wrongful and unlawful use of its funds by its officers in the purchase of property for the firm or the several members thereof, this branch of the case divides itself into two -parts, the first relating to property which was purchased with moneys that.can be identified as belonging to the bank; and, second, 't.o that which was bought and paid for by the firm out of the .'general.mass of moneys in their possession, and which may or may not have been made up in part of what had 'been wrongfully taken from the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b702-3\">\u201c As to the first of these classes of property we entertain no doubt that the trust exists, and that it may be enforced by the receiver unless the assignees of Bain <em>&amp; </em>Bro. occupy the position of <em>bona fide </em>purchasers for a valuable consideration with- ' out notice. The evidence shows beyond doubt that the affairs of the bank were managed almost exclusively by the members . of the firm. The funds of the bank were under the immediate control of its officers and agents, and consequently as its trustees. These funds were converted, by them, regardless of. their duty as trustees into- this particular property, which still exists in specie. \u25a0 No money was used in these purchases other than such as was taken directly from the bank for that purpose. Under these circumstances the property stands in the place 'of the money used, and it might have been reclaimed by the bank at its election any time before the rights of innocent third parties intervened. . This is elementary. The receiver succeeded to the rights of the bank in this particular.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b702-4\">\u201c The property in' the second class, however, occupies a different position. There the purchases were made with moneys that cannot be. identified as belonging to the bank; The payments were all, so far as now appears, from the general fund then in the possession and under the control of the firm. Some of the money of the bank may have gone into this fund, but it was not distinguishable from the rest. The mixture of the money of the bank with the money of the firm did not make the bank the owner of the whole. All the bank could in any event claim would be the right to diaw out of thei general'mass of money, so long as it remained money, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>amount equal to that which had been wrongfully taken from its own possession and put there. Purchases made and paid for out of the general mass cannot be claimed by the bank, unless it is shown that its own moneys then in the fund were appropriated for that purpose. Nothing of the kind has- been attempted here, and it has not even been shown that when the property in this class was purchased, the firm' had in its possession any of the moneys of the bank that could be reclaimed in specie. To give a <em>cestui que trust </em>the benefit of purchases \u25a0 by his trustees, it must be satisfactorily shown that they were actually made with the trust funds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b703-5\">\u201c In Virginia an assignee for the benefit of creditors -is deemed a purchaser for a valuable consideration. This, it is conceded, has been established by a long line of judicial decisions, and is now a rule of property in that State. As such it is binding on us as authority, but, we think, in this case the assignees are chargeable with notice of the equities of .the bank. They may not have had actual knowledge of the wrongful conversion of the moneys of the bank into the property which has now been identified as such, but it is clear, that Mr. Old, who alone of the assignees was present during the nego7' tiations which preceded the assignment, had full notice of the confusion which existed in the affairs of the bank, as well as . those of the firm, and of the intimate relations which for a longtime existed between the two institutions: The assign-, ment was hastened to prevent, further complications, and we have no hesitation in holding that the .assignees took- title-subject to any equities that might be found to exist in favor of the bank. They were' put on inquiry, which -they avoided -to save what they could. Tinder these circumstances we hold'' that the receiver is entitled to a surrender by the assignees\u2019 of -such of the property whiqh it is found had actually been purchased with the moneys of the bank as he elects to take, but of no other. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b703-6\"><em>\u201c </em>2. As to the assignment. By a statute of Virginia, a creditor may file a bill to set aside a conveyance by his debtor on the ground of fraud without having first obtained a judg-, ment. This suit was, therefore, properly brought. <em>We </em>find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>no evidence whatever, of any actual fraudulent intent on the-' . part of the.firm, or either of the partners, to hinder and delay their creditors. They devoted all their property, partnership and individual, of' every kind to the payment of their debts. Nothing whatever was kept back. It is true some creditors were preferred over others, but this is allowable in Virginia. From the case of <em>ShipwitKs Executor </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>8 Leigh, 271, decided in 1837, until now, such has been the recognized law of the State, and this was conceded in the argument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b704-4\">. ' \u201c It is a matter of no importance in this connection- that the debt' to the bank was created by fraud, or that the assignors were shareholders in the.bank and liable, as such, to assessments by the Comptroller of the Currency to meet its debts. Fraud in the creation of an unpreferred debt is not ground for-setting aside an assignment for the benefit of creditors which is otherwise valid, and the shareholder of -an insolvent bank is no more prohibited from preferring creditors as against his liability in that capacity, than he - is as against any one else\" that he owes. The assignment does not in any respect change the liability of the shareholders; that was fixed on the failure of the bank before the transfer was made. As has already, been .shown, so much of the property assigned-as is charged with a trust in favor of the bank can be reached in the hands of the assignees. The promise not to assign with preferences against the bank does not of itself avoid such an assignment for fraud.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b704-5\">\u201cIt is claimed, however, that the deed is fraudulent and. void on its face \u2014 1, because it appropriates partnership assets to the payment of individual debts, in preference,to the debts of the partnership; and, 2, because of'the peculiar provision which is made for bidding by the creditors of the second class at any public sale that may be made of the assigned property.-'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b704-6\">\u201c As to the first of these objections it is sufficient to say that as early as 1837 the Supreme Court of Appeals of Vir.ginia decided, in the case of <em>MoCullough </em>v. <em>Sommerville, </em>8 Leigh, 418, that a provision like that contained in this deed did not vitiate the assignment, but that a court of equity would, if required, so control the administration of the trust, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>as to apply the partnership property to the payment of the partnership debts in preference to those of the individual partners, and the individual property to individual debts. This ruling was followed in <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>18 Gratt. 387, decided in 1868, and its authority was recognized by all the judges, though there was some difference of opinion as to its applicability to the particular facts of the latter case. \"We see no reason to depart from what seems now to be the recognized rule of decision in the State, and we.have no hesitation in saying that if there ever can be a case where such an assignment ought to be sustained it should be in this.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b705-5\">\u201c The evidence discloses such a mingling of partnership and individual assets, and of partnership and individual debts, as to make it difficult in some cases to separate the one from .the other. After a long and-careful investigation' of the whole matter, a separation may now have been made which approximates correctness, but when the assignment was made it is not probable that this could easily have been done. All the property, including that of the firm and that belonging to the several partners individually, has been put into the' trust, and in the administration may, if necessary, be so marshalled as to prevent the creditors of the individual partners from getting-an illegal advantage over -those of the partnership, and <em>vice versa; </em>at any rate, we find nothing which, under the circumstances of this case, viewed-in the light of the decisions of ..the highest court of Tirginia, will render the whole assignment, fraudulent and void as-to the bank, and subject '.the property to the payment of- its debt in preference to all others, as -it' is. claimed should be done.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b705-6\">' \u201c It will be time enough to consider in what way the trust ought to be administered when- a case is made for that purpose..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b705-7\">\u201c This brings us to the consideration of the bidding clause of which\u2019 complaint is made, and as to ttys it may be, said there is no provision .which can in any manner result to the advantage of the assignors in opposition to the creditors, ,for, until the creditors are all paid in full, the assignors can'get nothing. If payment is made, it matters not to the creditors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>how it is done. In no event can any but the first and second-class creditors be affected injuriously, and they are not here complaining. Although the bank is named as a creditor in each of the classes, the object of the'present suit is, not to control the administration' of this branch of the trust, but to set aside the assignment altogether.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ApoG\">\u201c The only question we have now to consider, therefore, is whether-this particular provision is fatal to the whole assignment. There is nothing, whatever, in the instrument to show that if: it had been supposed this direction to the assignees cou-ld not legally be followed, the assignment would' not have been made in its present form with this provision left out. \u00d3n th\u00e9 contrary, everything looks the other way, for the assignees are authorized to sell at either public or private sale, according to their discretion, and it is only when the sale is public that the bidding clause becomes operative. The evident \u25a0purpose- was to stimulate bidding, not to give one creditor an unconscionable preference over* another, nor to secure any special advantage to the assignors.' . It. is not such an essential part of the scheme of the trust as to make it vital.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ArLS\">\u201cAt most it is a mere appendage which may be Topped off without injury to' the main purpose of the instruinent. Its only effect, so far as the deferred creditors are concerned, must be for their 'advantage, because the more the property sells for, the greater will be the chances of paying those preferred in full and leaving something for those who are unpre- * ferred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b706-11\">\u201cNo creditor can have an assignment for the benefit of creditors set aside at his suit, except it be on the ground that he has'been, defrauded. If this particular provision operates as a fraud-upon those who are affected by it, relief can undoubtedly be had in some \"appropriate proceeding for that purpose, but that is not, as has. been seen, the purpose of the present suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b706-12\">\u201c Our .conclusion' is that the assignment' is valid, but that the. receiver is entitled to the surrender to' him - by the assignees of \u25a0such, of the pi\u00f3perty in their hands -bought and paid for with \u25a0the moneys o\u00ed the bank as he elects to take;\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>A decree in \u00e1ccordance with the opinion was thereupon entered, and from it the receiver and the trustees respectively-appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b707-5\">The receiver assigned errors as follows : - That the court erred (1) in refusing to Ret aside the deed of .assignment of Bain &amp; Bro. as fraudulent in fact; (2) in failing to declare the assignment void because executed in fraud of sections 5151 and 5234 of the Bevised Statutes of the United States (3) in holding that the receiver was entitled <em>\u201c </em>to a surrender by the assignees of such of the - property which it is found had actually been purchased with the moneys of the bank, but of no other;\u201d (4) in holding that the assignment \u201c was made and executed without any actual fraudulent intent on the part of the said-grantors or either of them to hinder, and delay their creditors; \u201d (5) in holding \u201c that the said deed of assignment is not fraudulent and void on its face.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b707-8\">The trustees assigned as error that the court erred (1) in finding that the trustees were to be considered as affected by constructive notice, as to certain of the property held by them, that it had been purchased with the money of the bank, and that the receiver was entitled to receive so much thereof as he elected to take, and was not, by making such election and receiving such property, estopped from receiving the benefit of the said deed of trust in favor of the Exchange National.

Jur. \u00a7 353,) and reenacted in terms, or nearly so, or with' some.change of language, by the legislatures of the several States.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">In Yirginia the statute reads as follows: \u201c Every gift, conveyance, assignment, or transfer of, or charge upon any estate, real or personal, every suit commenced, or decree; judgment,, or execution suffered or obtained, and every bond or other writing given with intent to delay, hinder, or defraud creditors', purchasers, or other persons of or from what they are or may be lawfully entitled to, shall, as to such creditors, purchasers, or other persons, their representatives or assigns, be void. This section shall not affect the title of a purchaser for valuable consideration, unless it appear that he had notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>the fraudulent. intent of his immediate grantor or of the fraud - rendering void the title of such grantor.\u201d Yirginia Code, 1873, 896, c. 114, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">In controversies arising under this statute, involving, as they do, the rights of creditors locally, and a rule of property, we accept the conclusions of the highest judicial tribunal of the State as controlling. <em>Jaffray </em>v. <em>McGehee, </em>107 U. S. 361, 364 <em>Lloyd v. </em>Fulton, 91 U. S. 479, 485; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Massey, </em>17 Wall. 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">We understand counsel to contend that the deed contains certain provisions which must so hinder, delay and defcaud creditors that fraud in its execution is to be conclusively presumed without regard to the intention of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"AKqb\">\u2019 The doctrine in Yirginia, settled by a long and uninterrupted 'line of decision, is that, while there may be provisions in a deed of trust of such a character as of themselves to furnish evidence sufficient to justify the inference of a fraudulent intent, yet this cannot be. so except where the inference is so absolutely irresistible as to preclude indulgence in any other. Hence provisions postponing the time of the sale and reserving the use of. the property to the grantor meanwhile, though perishable and consumable -in the use; permitting sales on credit; for the payment of surplus after satisfaction of creditors secured; the omission of a schedule or inventory;' and the like,- have been regarded as insufficient to justify the court in invalidating the deed for fraud in point of law. The fraud- . ulent intent is held not to be presumed even under such circumstances, and in its absence the fact that creditors may be delayed or hindered is not of itself sufficient to \u25a0 vacate the '''\u2022instrument, while the right to prefer one creditor over another is thoroughly established. <em>Dance </em>v. <em>Seaman, </em>11 Grattan, 778; Brockenbrough <em>v. Brockenbrough, </em>31 Grattan, 580; <em>Young </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>82 Virginia, 291, 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">When, then, it is claimed in this case that the deed is fraudulent in law, \u201cbecause it appropriates partnership assets to pay individual debts in preference to the debts of the .partnership,\u201d we should naturally expect to find that the Supreme Court of Appeals had held that where, as here, the conveyance included all the property of the grantors as partners and indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>vidu'ally, for the benefit of partnership and individual creditors, it should be construed distributively, and the partnership assets be applied to the payment of partnership' debts and the individual assets to individual\u2019 liabilities. And .such is the fact. <em>McCullough </em>v. <em>Sommerville, </em>8 Leigh, 415; <em>Gordon </em>v. Cannon, 18 Grattan, 388. And, as pointed out by Mr. Chief Justice Waite,- the difficulty, at the time, the assignment was made, attendant upon any attempt to separate the partnership and individual. assets, and the partnership and individual debts, would be considered under the view of the state courts,- in passing upon the question of intent to defraud in failing to specifically distinguish between them..</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The only other ground of objection on this branch of the case, relates to the following clause in the deed:</p>\n<p id=\"ASB\">\u201cAnd the said trustees, for the purpose of executing this trust, shall at once take charge of all the property and effects hereby conveyed, and make an inventory thereof, and proceed to collect the choses in action and all evidences of indebtedness, and to convert the real and personal property into cash .as soon as possible, and they may make sale- of the real and other personal estate hereby conveyed, at public auction or private sale, at such tim\u00e9 .or times and place or places and after such notice as to them shall seem best, and they may make such sale upon such terms and conditions as to them shall seem best, except-that at any sale of said property, real or personal, at public auction, any creditor secured by this .\"deed . in the second class above\u2019 enumerated shall have the \u2018right to' purchase any part or parcel of said \u25a0 property so sold and pay the said trustees therefor at its full face value the amount found, due such purchaser secured by this deed, or. so much thereof as may be necessary to enable, such creditor to complete the payment' of his purchase money, and to enable as many creditors as possible to become bidders on these terms, the said trustee may have the real estate hereby conveyed, or any -part thereof, laid off into lots or .'parcels, as they -may think best. And upon the conversion of the said property hereby conveyed.into money the said trustees shall distribute the same to the creditors hereby .secured in the order herein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>before named with all diligence, and in the distribution between those creditors who may have purchased property and paid for the same .under the provisions of this deed with a part of the money found due them respectively, and those who made no purchase, the trustees shall observe such rule of equality as will be just and proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">But can it be properly concluded that this provision is irreconcilable' with any other inference than that of fraud ? And even if so much of it as allows the creditors in the second class to bid and use \u25a0 their, claims as purchase money were invalid, oughj; the whole instrument to be therefore declared of \u25a0no effect? We agree with the Circuit Court that, as respects fraud in law as contradistinguished from fraud in fact, where .that which is valid, can be separated from that which is invalid, without defeating the general intent, the maxim, <em>\u201c </em>void \u25a0in part, void <em>in </em>toto,\u201d does not necessarily apply, and that the instrument may be sustained notwithstanding the invalidity of \u00e1 particular provision. <em>Denny </em>v. Bennett, 128 U. S. 489, 496; Cun<em>ningham </em>v. Norton, 125 U. S. 77; <em>Muller </em>v. Norton, 132 U. S. 501; <em>Darling </em>v. Rogers, 22 Wend. 483; <em>Howell </em>v. Edgar, 3 Scammon, 417, 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Nor are . we able, in view of the current of decisions in Virginia and all the terms of the deed taken together, to concur .with the receiver\u2019s counsel that fraudulent intent is a necessary .'deduction from the permission to the creditors in the second class to avail themselves of their claims in bidding in the' manner prescribed, The deed expressly stated that it \u2022was given to secure the costs and expenses, and then the payment' of the indebtedness 'enumerated in the first class; <em>\u201c </em>and <em>after </em>the payment of the hereinbefore mentioned sums and claims, .to secure, secondly, the following creditors to be paid, equally and'ratably if the property hereby conveyed shall be' insufficient to pay them all, but with, the privilege as to bidding on such property as may be sold at auction as hereinafter \u25a0provided.\u201d This contemplates the payment of the creditors iff the first class before the bidding clause could take effect, and precludes the operation of that clause to the prejudice of those creditors. The record discloses that- the total amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>secured in the first class was less than fifty thousand dollars, of which the bank held inore than four-fifths, and that the cash assets were much more than enough to cover the costs- and expenses and this amount, without any sales; so that the facts correspond with the intention deducible from the language of the deed. The first-class creditors are to be paid' before the second-class creditors can exercise the right to. bid if sales by public auction ever take place. The bank is a \u25a0creditor in the first and second classes and the sole creditor in the third class, but it has no ground of complaint as a third-class creditor, as the operation of the clause can only be- for its benefit as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The second-class creditors are all treated alike, and, as the counsel for the trustees says, are placed in exactly the same legal relation to the subject matter. If it could be said that the clause might operate to create a preference as between them, the grantors had a right to- prefer; but inasmuch as each can bid, and the trustees have power to divide the property into parcels to enable -as many creditors as possible to become bidders, and are charged with the duty to observe such rule of equality between those who purchase and those . who do not, as will be just, it is not easy to see how a preference could be obtained. The question is not whether the trustees might prove unfaithful \u2014 a contingency of -which there is ho intimation here \u2014 but whether the provisions of the deed, if carried out. according to their apparent intent, would be fraudulent in their operation. It seems to us, as it did to the Circuit Court, that such is not the reasonable inference, and that the manifest object was to stimulate bidding, prevent a sacrifice of the property, and benefit the creditors, and; this without any advantage to- the assignors other than that involved in having their assets go as far as possible in payment of their debts. It .is not they who reap a pecuniary benefit, but their creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Without further elaboration, we - are of opinion that the deed is not void in law because of the insertion of the provision in question. \u2022 .</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">- It should also be observed that the trustees \u2022 are rendering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>their reports under the direction of the court, and ask in their' cross-bill \u201cthe aid and direction of this honorable court in the ascertainment of all and every the copartnership property and the individual property standing in the names of the individual members of the said copartnerships, or any of said members; and in the application \u25a0 of the trust funds to. the payment of the-debts secured'; and in the administration of \u25a0this their trust; and they are advised that.it is their right and privilege to file this their bill, and to apply to this honorable court as a court of equity for the purpose aforesaid.\u201d. So that the receiver, having invoked the interposition of a court of equity, can find there, either oh his own application or that of his adversary, a remedy for any injurious results he may apprehend in the administration of the trust. The court will see to it that, as far as practicable, .partnership assets are applied . to partnership liabilities and individual assets to individual liabilities, and- that the bidding clause shall not be put into operation unless in consonance with equity and good conscience.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">It is earnestly argued, \u2022 however, that the-deed should be set aside because fraudulent in fact. \"We have patiently, but \u25a0without success, examined this record in the effort to discover what specific acts are made out by the proofs establishing, in ' connection with the deed itself, actual fraud in its execution. The inquiry is not whether the grantors had been previously guilty of fraud or embezzlement, -but whether this particular conveyance was made with a fraudulent intent known to the trustees or beneficiaries. <em>Evans v. </em>Greenhow, 15 Grattan, 153; <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Senter, </em>118 U. S. 1. It appears that the Bains were indebted to the bank and-also to their depositors in several hundred, thousand dollars. It is said that they indulged in wild speculations in real and personal estate, stocks, bonds, mines, railroad's, etc.; but that applies as well to the squandering of the seven hundred thousand dollars and upwards of deposits with them as a banking 'firm, as it does to the money that they absorbed from the bank; and in any view, the violation of their fiduciary relations to the bank, of which'they were officers, or their treatment of the depositors in the banking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>firm of which they were members, does not render the assignment of all their property for the benefit of their creditors, therefore fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The bank and the banking house suspended on the second day of April, 1885, and the assignment was made on the sixth day of April. On the 31st day of March preceding, Bain A Bro. transferred to the bank certain securities of the estimated value of $570,000 in reduction of their indebtedness, and some other assets, as collateral to their guaranty of any deficiency which might result when the securities were realized on. When they transferred all their property, partnership and individual, of every kind, by the deed in controversy, they provided for the payment in the first instance of some $49,881.61, of which the bank held $42,288.49, and then for the payment in' full, or ratably, of their own depositor's, and certain notes aggregating $102,000, held by the bank; and they put the remaining indebtedness to the bank in a third class. They had a right to: make preferences, and it is evident that their effort in the. assignment was to equalize as between what they owed their own depositors and what they owed the bank, taking into consideration what the bank had already obtained. There was no fraud in this, of which the bank could' complain as between it and the other creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">. , Counsel contends that the deed'-was in contravention of sections 5151 and 5234 of the Revised Statutes of the United' States, which pi\u2019ovide that the shareholders of every national banking association shall be held individually responsible for its debts to the extent of the amount of their stock, and, additional thereto, and that the Comptroller may enforce , that individual liability. It is insisted that the capital stock is a trust fund of which the directors are the trustees, and that the creditors have a lien upon it in equity ; that this applies to the liability upon the stock of a national bank; and .that no gbn eral assignment of his property for the payment of his debts-can lawfully be made by a shareholder, certainly not when he is a director. Undoubtedly unpaid subscriptions to stock are assets, and have frequently been treated by courts of equity.as if impressed with a trust <em>sub </em>modo, in the sense that- neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>the stockholders nor the corporation can misappropriate such subscriptions so far as creditors are 'concerned. <em>Richardson\u2019s Executor </em>v. Green, ante, 30, 44. Creditors have the same right to look to them as to anything else, and the same right to insist upon their payment as upon the payment. of any other debt due to the corporation. The shareholder cannot transfer his shares when the corporation is failing, or manipulate a release therefrom, for the purpose of escaping his liability. And the principle is the same where the shares are paid up, but the shareholder is responsible in respect thereof to an equal additional amount. There was, however, no attempt here to avoid this liability, and the fact of its existence did not operate to fetter these assignors in the otherwise. lawful disposition of their property for the benefit of their creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Some other transactions are referred to in the bill as indicating fraud in fact, but they are not insisted upon in argument and require no special consideration. One of them relates to a deed of Wallace <em>&amp; </em>Son to Bain <em>&amp; </em>Bro., executed April 6,1885, and referred to by counsel in another connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We think the Circuit Court was right in finding \u201cno evidence whatever of any actual fraudulent intent on the part of the firm, or either of the partners, to hinder and delay their creditors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The argument is pressed that the trustees were neither <em>bona fide </em>purchasers for value nor purchasers without notice, because they must have had knowledge, for the reasons given, of the previous conduct of Bain &amp; Bro. But, as we have already seen, that previous conduct did not render the assignment in itself fraudulent, although it is quite true that all the circumstances should be taken into consideration in passing on that question. It is urged that the trustees knew that Bain <em>&amp; </em>Bro. had no right to make the deed, because on the 31st of March, when they transferred to the bank certain stocks and bonds of the face value of $640,000 and- an estimated value of $570,000, a member of the concern verbally premised that they would not make an assignment giving preferences against the \u2022bank. The transfer of these securities rendered the bank just so much better off, and counsel-for the receiver concedes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>the advice of the bank\u2019s former counsel in regard to it, \u201c in the condition of the affairs of the bank at that date . .' ,. was wise and proper, and did' secure to the bank whatever can be realized from the sale of the securities delivered under- the agreement of March 31, 1885.\u201d The verbal promise not to make preferences constituted no lien upon Bain &amp; Bro.\u2019s property, and its disregard did not affect the-validity of the deed.. Nor is any issue in regard to it made upon the pleadings. It is noticeable that Bain <em>&amp; </em>Bro. declined to incorporate that pledge in the written agreement transferring the securities, and we are not called upon to examine into the circumstances under which the promise so given failed to be carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The receiver assigns for error that the Circuit Court held that he was entitled to a surrender of such of the property which it was found had \u201c actually been purchased' with the moneys of the bank as he elects to take, but of no other.\u201d In other words, it is insisted that the receiver is entitled to a charge upon the entire mass of the estate, with priority over the other creditors of Bain'&amp; Bro.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">It was said by Mr. Justice Bradley in <em>Frelinghuysen </em>v. <em>Nugent, </em>36 Fed. Rep. 229, 239 : \u201c Formerly the equitable right of following misapplied money or other property into the hands of the parties receiving it depended upon the ability of identifying it; the equity attaching only to. the very property misapplied. This right was first extended to the proceeds of the property, namely, to that which was procured in place of it by exchange, purchase, or sale. But if it became confused with other property of the same .kind, so as not to be distinguishable, without any fault on the part of the possessor, the equity was lost. Finally, however, it has been held as the better'doctrine that confusion does not destroy the equity Entirely, but converts it into a charge upon the entire mass, giving to the party injured by the unlawful diversion a priority ,bf right over the other creditors of the possessor. This is as far as the rule has been carried. The difficulty of sustaining the claim in the present case is, that it does, not appear that the goods claimed -\u2022 - that is to say, the stock on hand, finished and unfinished \u2014were either in whole or in part the proceeds of any money, unlaw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>fully abstracted from the bank.\u201d The same difficulty presents itself here, and-while the rule laid down by Mr. Justice Bradley has been, recognized and applied by this court, <em>National Bank v. Insurance </em>Company, 104 U. S. 54, 67, and cases cited, yet, as stated by the Chief Justice, \u201c purchases made and paid for out of the general mass cannot be claimed by the bank, unless it is shown that its own moneys then in the fund were \u25a0 appropriated for that purpose.\u201d And this the evidence fails to establish as to any other property than that designated in the decree, although it is claimed, on behalf of the receiver, that the sum of $105,000 due to the bank upon certain notes of \"Wallace &amp; Son, which had been discounted by Bain <em>&amp; </em>Bro., and which were rediscounted for the latter by the bank, should have been traced into certain property conveyed by Wallace &amp; Son to Bain <em>&amp; </em>Bro. The circumstances, so far as necessary to elucidate this claim, ^re as follows: Bain <em>&amp; Bro. </em>owed the Richmond Cedar Works $31,885.71. The Exchange National Bank held the interest of Bain &amp; Bro. in these works under the transfer of Bain &amp; Bro. to the bank, of March 31, 1885. The Richmond Cedar Works owed the Exchange National Bank $140,000, upon which Wallace, &amp; Son were endorsers. Wallace <em>&amp; </em>Son owed Bain <em>&amp; Bro. </em>over $300,000. By a deed dated April 3,1885, Wallace <em>&amp; </em>Son conveyed, certain property to the Richmond Cedar Works for $55,000, receiving \u25a0 in-payment the Cedar Work\u2019s check on Bain &amp; Bro. for $31,885.71, due from them to it, and the notes of the Cedar Works for the balance, which were turned over to Bain <em>&amp; </em>Bro. By this transaction the indebtedness of Bain &amp; Bro. to the Cedar Works was extinguished, and Wallace <em>&amp; </em>Son\u2019s indebtedness to Bain <em>&amp; </em>Bro. reduced by the sum of $-55,000. This left Wallace &amp; Son still debtors of Bain <em>&amp; </em>Bro. to the extent of over \u2018$245,000, and on the 6th day of April, 1885, they executed a deed of their remaining property to Bain &amp; Bro., for the, expressed consideration of $151,800, which- property has passed under the assignment in this case. None of this property, so far as appears, was purchased with the money of the \u2022 bank, but counsel for the receiver contends that because Bain <em>&amp; </em>Bro. had rediscounted the notes of Wallace and Son to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>amount of $105,000 at the bank, and because' the deed of . Wallace &amp; Son to Bain &amp; Bro; was in payment of their indebtedness to the latter, in whole or in.part, therefore- it ought to' be held that the bank\u2019s money purchased Wallace <em>&amp; </em>Son\u2019s property for the benefit of Bain <em>&amp; </em>Bro. We do not understand that the bank was entitled to the assets of Bain <em>&amp; </em>Bro.\u2019s debtors, and can perceive no ground for holding that Bain &amp; .Bro., in receiving the deed from Wallace, <em>&amp; </em>Son, were purchasing property with the money of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">This disposes of the errors assigned on behalf of the receiver, and leaves for consideration those assigned on behalf of the trustees upon their cross appeal. The principal contention is that it w\u00e1s error to decree that the receiver could take \u201c such of the property hereinbefore set out and found to have been actually purchased with the moneys of the said bank as he elects to take; and by making said election and receiving such property the said receiver is not to be estopped from' receiving the full benefit of the said deed of trust, or the provisions thereof, in favor of the' Exchange National Bank.\u201d \u2022We do not concur in that view.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The doctrine of election rests upon the principle that he who seeks equity must do it, and means, as the term is ordinarily Used, that where two inconsistent or alternative, rights or claims are presented to the choice of a party, by a person who manifests the clear intention that he should not enjoy both, then he must accept or reject one or the other; and so, in other words, that one cannot take a benefit under an instrument and then repudiate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">It cannot be assumed that there was an intention on the part of Bain &amp; Bro. to dispose of that which was not theirs, or, even if they lawfully could, to cut the bank off from participating in the property assigned, in the order mentioned, by imposing the condition that the bank should purchase its share by parting with its own property; nor does any equitable' implication to that effect arise. The other creditors cannot claim compensation for being deprived of what did not belong . to Bain &amp; Bro., or of anything transferred in lieu thereof. There existed no equity on their part which can be held to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>estop the bank from receiving what may come to it under the' \u2022assignment, and in doing so it will hot occupy inconsistent positions. That it sought to have the deed set aside does not deprive it of its rights under it, upon the failure of its attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">It was entirely competent for the court to adjust this matter upon equitable principles, and this it has done in its decree. Under the assignment the bank gets a preference of something over $42,000, and- then ranks with other creditors to the extent of $102,000, while the balance of a very large indebtedness due to it is relegated to the'third class; and it appears to be entirely just that it should have in addition the benefit of that which belongs to it, and to which the other creditors have no claim. And this, though amounting on its face to $149,372.21, we are informed by counsel for the trustees, has only an actual value \u00f3f $20,177.18, to three items of which, amounting to $6840, the objection is made of failure of proof of their having been' purchased with the bank\u2019s money.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">W,e have, examined the record with care, and are satisfied with the conclusion arrived at by the special master and the court as to these items, and shall not disturb the decree in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">' The trustees also demur to being held affected with notice as to the traced property, principally because the affairs of the debtors were in such a state as to render the task of disentanglement exceedingly onerous. As inquiry would have conducted' the trustees to the same conclusion as that now reached, the fact that the conduct of the Bains rendered it difficult to accurately distinguish\" between one class of property and another, should not absolve them from the operation of the rule as to notice, if Otherwise applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak9\">'.\"While- it is well settled in Virginia that the trustees and beneficiaries in a deed of trust to secure <em>hona jiote </em>debts occupy the position of purchasers for a valuable consideration; <em>Wickham </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>Martin, 13 Gratt. 427; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Greenhow, </em>15 Gratt. 153, 156; Kesner <em>v</em>. Trigg, 98 U. S. 50, 53; yet hey cannot hold, with notice of the fraudulent intent of their grantor, or of the fraud rendering his title void. And it is equally well 'settled id the States of West Virginia and Virginia that notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>to the trustees, is notice to the beneficiaries. , <em>Fidelity Co. </em>v. <em>Shenandoah Valley Railroad,, </em>Supreme Court of Appeals, West Virginia, February 25, 1889, 9 Southeastern Reporter, 181, 185; <em>Beverly v. Brooks, </em>2 Leigh, 446; <em>French </em>v. <em>Loyal Co., </em>5 Leigh, 627, 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The knowledge of the situation possessed by Mr. Old, one of the trustees, who was the Bains\u2019 attorney at the time of the assignment, and by whom it was drawn, was quite comprehensive, and was obtained in such a- manner and under such circumstances that he must be presumed to have communicated it. It was knowledge obtained in the particular transaction. <em>The Distilled Spirits, </em>11 Wall. 356, 366. There can be no doubt, also, respecting the duty of the trustees to inquire .as to the rights of the bank, and that they are chargeable with a knowledge of all the .facts that inquiry would have disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">' The decree-directs that the costs of the suit be paid out of the trust funds in the hands of the defendant trustees, and as we agree with the results arrived at by the Circuit Court, we are of- opinion that this direction was correct.
