The contract of Mills with the Boston and Mystic Talley Railroad Company, to build and equip the road of that company from Somerville to. Wilmington, was made on the 4th of May, 1878. ' On the 6th of May, 1878, the plaintiff, under the name of S. C. Mills &amp; Co., made a sub-contract with H. C. Hall and J. H. Burgess, being the Hall and Burgess named in the instrument of October 23, 1878, to grade the road-bed of the railroad from Wilmington to Somerville. The road had not been completed on the 23d of October, 1878.- Dow and /Pratt were- stockholders and directors in the company. Of the $15,000 mentioned in the instrument of October 23, 1878, they paid to Mills only $10,000. They did not pay any part of $11,048.08, which was due to Hall and Burgess for work done under their contract, partly before and partly after the-instrument of October 23, 1878, was executed. Mills brought this suit against Dow and Pratt, in the Circuit Court of the \u00cdTnited States for the District of Massachusetts, to recover'those sums. Issue was joined by Dow. Pratt did not appear and was defaulted. At the trial before a jury the court directed a verdict for the defendant Dow, and a judgment \u2022 accordingly was entered, to review which the plaintiff brought this 'writ of error. Since the writ was brought, Dow has died, \u2022and his administrator has been substituted as defendant .i\u00f1 ; error in his stead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-9\">Dow was president -of the railroad company, and as such executed the contract' between the company and Mills for the construction and equipment of the road. The sub-contractors named in the instrument of October 23, 1878, continued work op the road under their contracts up to the middle of December, 1878, and furnished the labor and materials set forth in the declaration and in the .accounts'- annexed thereto, so that there was a. balance .exceeding. $6(300 due from Mills to Hall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>and Burgess,' partly for work done prior to October 23, 1878, and partly for work done subsequently to that date. Dow was informed of the amount so due to the sub-contractors, and that the same had never been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQN\">The bill of exceptions, after stating the foregoing facts, set forth that the plaintiff offered to show by Hall, for the purpose of proving an independent oral contract based on an alleged liability of Dow as stockholder, that Dow repeatedly, promised Hall, in 1879 and subsequently, that he would pay the amount claimed to be due to Hall and Burgess, but the court refused to admit the evidence at that stage of the case, on the ground that there was no evidence of a consideration for the promise, and that the liability, and the fact that Dow was a stockholder, must first be shown; that the plaintiff offered to show, by his own evidence, that' the consideration of the instrument- of October 23, 1878, was the payment of $15,000; that the defendants promised to pay him that sum as such consideration and had paid only $10,000 of it, the plaintiff claiming that, by the terms of the instrument, the defendants were bound to pay the whole of such consideration, and that, on proof that the consideration was $15,000, and was partially unpaid, he would be entitled to recover; that the court ruled that the inquiry was- irrelevant, on the pleadings and proofs as they then stood; that the plaintiff offered further to show that, as a part of the. consideration of the instrument, the defendants promised to pay the debts the plaintiff owed to Hall and others named in the instrument; and that the court refused to admit the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-6\">The bill of exceptions stated, also, that there was evidence tending to show that the defendants were stockholders and directors of the company, and Dow was its president,, from May 1, 1878, to June 1, 1879; that Hall had authority from the plaintiff to collect from the defendants the amounts due to the sub-contractors; that Dow, at the request of. the plaintiff, paid to one or more of the sub-contractors, subsequently to October 23, 1878, .the amount due them for work done on the road and had also paid to the plaintiff the amount of a judgment recovered against the latter by Savage and McCabe, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>a suit brought by them subsequently to October 23, 1878, for work done by them under their sub-contract, which amount the plaintiff never paid to Savage and McCabe, and no claim was made for it in this suit; that, before this suit was brought, the sub-contractors demanded their pay from the plaintiff, showing him a statement of their account, and also made a demand on the defendants, and the plaintiff made a like demand on them; that as between the plaintiff and the sub-contractors, there was no dispute as to the amount due; that the company voted to stop the work of construction on the road about the middle of December, 1878, and never resumed the Work of construction after that date; that Hall and Burgess did not complete their contract within the time stipulated in it, for the reason, among others, that the company did not meet its-payments and never secured the right of way for the portion not constructed by it; and that no evidence was introduced by the plaintiff that he had paid any portion of the sums due the sub-contractors named in the instrument. of October 23, 1878. The- plaintiff having closed his case, the defendant Dow contended that the plaintiff could not recover without first showing some actual payment or -injury other than his liability to Hall and Burgess, so due and made known to the defendants; and that the same had not been paid. The court ruled that there was no competent evidence to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s case, and directed a verdict for the defendant Dow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-5\">The bill of exceptions further stated that the' plaintiff duly excepted at the trial to such- rulings, refusals to rule, and direction of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AuT\"><em>Mr. George 8.

Under a general denial in the answer the plaintiff must prove each material allegation in the declaration. <em>Rodman </em>v. <em>Guilford, </em>112 Mass. 405. There is nothing admitted by the answer except the making of said agreement. The questions concerning the admissibility of evidence arise solely upon the allegations contained in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration. What the plaintiff is estopped from proving, the defendant need not plead specially. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-8\">II. \u25a0 By the evidence offered the plaintiff endeavored to extend and enlarge the provisions of a written contract under the guise of proving by parol its consideration^ It is perfectly well settled that a grantor is not absolutely bound by the consideration or the acknowledgment of its payment expressed in his deed, because the consideration is known to be arbitrary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>and a receipt is always open to explanation; and this acknowledgment, although under seal, is nothing more than a receipt, for the seal gives it no additional solemnity. <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>17 Mass. 249; <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>4 Gray, 318.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-4\">' In <em>Flynn </em>v. Bourneuf, 143 Mass. 277, Holmes, J., asserts that the authority of <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Walker, ubi supra, </em>is unshaken, and distinguishes it from <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Dooley, </em>119 Mass. 294, <em>Preble </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>6 Cush. 549, and similar cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aff\">TTT The recital that the $15,000 has been paid is an estoppel upon the plaintiff to deny that fact on the faith of which the assignment was accepted, and so far as concerns the plaintiff this estoppel is- in an instrument under his. seal. <em>Leddy </em>v. <em>Barney, </em>139 Mass. 394; <em>Southeastern Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Wharton, </em>6 H. &amp; N. 520; <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Westminster Improvement Com'rs, </em>7 Exch. 780; <em>Lucy </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>61 N.

And so far as they are bound by their written acceptance, the form of the same limits their. liability to their capacity as trustees, notwithstanding their naked signatures. The following cases are cited to the points that the writing is the only evidence of the intent of the parties, arid that on the whole writing there is no personal liability. <em>Goodenough </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>132 Mass. 152; <em>Tucker Mfg.

It is well settled in Massachusetts^that a recital in a deed, acknowledging payment of the consideration stated, is <em>onlj prima facie </em>proof, and is subject to be controlled or rebutted by other evidence. <em>Paige </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>6 Gray, 511, 513; <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>17 Mass. 249; <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Dooley, </em>119 Mass. 294, 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Independently of this, the expression in the instrument which is claimed to be an acknowledgment of the receipt of the $15,000, namely, \u201c which said sum of fifteen thousand dollars the said Dow and Pratt have this day advanced and paid to said Mills,\u201d\u2019 is ambiguous, and does not show actual prior or simultaneous payment. <em>Goldshede </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>1 Exch. 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">So, too, the evidence of a promise' by the defendants, as a part of the consideration of the instrument, to pay the debts which the plaintiff owed to Hall and! others named in it, was admissible; and the-refusal of the defendants to pay those debts on .demand was a breach of their ccLibact. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Deshon, </em>12 Cush. 589, 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">The issue being whether the consideration had been paid and whether the obligation of the defendants was broken, it wa.s competent for the plaintiff to show by parol that, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Hall a'nd Burgess had finished their work under their subcontract, they stated .their account .to the plaintiff and demanded payment from him; that he notified the defendants and'made.demand on them; and that they neglected to pay. Such demand, and a neglect on their part to pay, tended to support the case of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The balance due by the plaintiff to Hall and Burgess was $11,048.06, with interest from January 1, 1879; and that was the amount of the liability of the plaintiff to them under his contract with them. The agreement of the defendants, in the instrument of-' October 23, 1878, is that they assume the contr-'-'t between the plaintiff and -the company, and that they &gt;. ill well and truly save the plaintiff harmless from any and all liability by reason of .his contracts with Hall and Burgess, Ellis and Savage and McCabe, \u201cthe ten per cent reserved,\u201d and any claim by reason of such contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"ASQ\">-. The agreement to assume the contract, in connection with the further agreement to save the plaintiff - harmless from liability, was broken by a failure to pay the parties to whom the plaintiff was liable,- and it was not necessary to a breach that' the plaintiff should show that he had first paid those parties. <em>Braman </em>v. Dowse, 12 Cush. 227; <em>Locke </em>v. <em>Homer, </em>131 Mass. 93; <em>Drury </em>v. <em>Tremont Improvement Co., </em>13 Allen, 168, 171; <em>Stewart v.
