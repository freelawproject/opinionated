Corbin and Horatio N. May, copartners as Corbin, May &amp; Company, doing business in Chicago, against Walter J. Gould, Edward Telfer, David D. Cady and L. F. Thompson, copartners as W. J. Gould <em>&amp; </em>Company, doing business in 'Detroit, for the alleged infringement of a trade-mark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-8\">The bill filed on the 24th of- September, 1885, alleged substantially as follows: That for over six years complainants had been engaged in manufacturing, preparing and shipping to the' United States, and selling in the United States and elsewhere, a particular qut lity of tea, of which their immediate predecessors in business, Ingraham, Corbin <em>&amp; </em>May, were the first \u00bfnd exclusive manufacturers, importers and wholesale dealers, in this country; that during this period they had imported large quantities of such tea, which, by reason of its superior quality and because of the advertising they gave it, became well and favorably known, and was sold extensively ,in the chief cities and towns of the United States, particularly in Michigan; \"that said particular tea was known as \u201c Tycoon Tea,\u201d the word \u201c Tycoon \u201d being properly attached to the cases and coverings in which the tea was imported; that this' name \u201c Tycoon \u201d was given by th\u00e9m to their tea in \u2022 1879 in order to more clearly identify it,, and had since been used as their adopted trade-mark for it; that having complied with \u2022the act. of Congress in sueh case made and provided, aiid with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>the regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Patents, they procured the registration and recording of said trademark in the Patent Office on the 27th of. December, 1881, and received from the Commissioner of Patents\u2019a certificate, [No. 9952], showing such record; that since the word \u201c Tycoon \u201d was first applied by them as a trade-mark, and since the dat\u00e9 of such registration, the defendants, confederating with di. ers . other persons in different parts of the United States,-with full knowledge of complainants\u2019 rights under and by virtue of their trade-mark, in violation thereof, without complainants\u2019 consent, and with the intent fraudulently to divert to themselves complainants\u2019 trade in such tea, put upon the market in Detroit and elsewhere large quantities of tea in packages or-eases of the same size and general appearance as those used by complainants, with the word \u201c Tycoon \u201d stamped thereon \u25a0 in imitation of complainants\u2019 trade-mark \u2014 all of which was intended to deceive and mislead the public into buying defendants\u2019 tea, which is of an inferior quality, greatly to the injury of the reputation of complainants\u2019 tea; that by reason of such fraudulent acts and practices on the part of defend- - ants, complainants had been deprived of great gains, and profits in the sale of their tea, and had been damaged more than $10,000; and that defendants were still using the aforesaid facings or labels with the word \u201cTycoon\u201d stamped thereon upon tea, and threaten to continue to do so, to the,, great injury and damage of plaintiffs. The bill prayed for an injunction to restrain the defendants and their agents from the further use of complainants\u2019 trade-mark, for an accounting, and for damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-4\">Upon the filing of this bill, supported by a number of affidavits corroborating its allegations; the court issued a temporary restraining order as prayed for, and the defendants thereupon filed their answer denying specifically all the material allegations of the bill.' The answer further alleged that the word- <em>\u201c </em>Tycoon\u201d could not have been lawfully adopted and used.as a trade-mark, because it had been a word in common use in trade as a brand.or name for various kinds of tea imported from Japan, for many years prior to the' time-when complain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>ants claim to have, adopted it as a trade-mark. It further set forth that the defendants had been using the word \u201cTycoon\u201d on the facings or labels' of their tea in connection with the word \u201c chop; \u201d but it denied that these labels bore any more similarity to those of complainants than is usually the cas\u00e9 with tea labels, and alleged that except in the word \u201c Tycoon \u201d there was no resemblance whatever between them. It, therefore, prayed that the bill be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-4\">Considerable testimony was taken in the case, and the court below, on the 14th of June, 1886, rendered a decree dismissing the bill, without delivering any opinion.

The complainants, having acquired a valuable interest in the good will of their trade in a specially prepared, pure, uncolored and unadulterated tea, and having adopted a particular' trade-mark indicating to their customers that the article \u2019ivhich was made by their authority and sold by them possessed those superior qualities, are entitled to protection against any one who attempts to deprive them of their trade or customers by using substantially the same name, or such devices and representations as would deceive the trade. <em>McLean </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>96 U. S. 245.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-7\">II. Where a firm has adopted and used a trade-mark for a number of years to denote a special kind of tea and built up a large trade, the firm should be protected in the use of- its trade-mark as against imitations, even though it be proven 'that said trade-mark had previously been used as a trademark for the same class of goods, provided the first user had abandoned it. <em>Symons </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>28 Fed. Rep. 834. The plaintiff in that case adopted the word \u201c Eureka \u201d to denote a special kind of cement. He was held to be entitled to an injunction even though another firm had used it for several years before to designate a certain kind of cement, but had discontinued its use.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-8\">III. The prior use must be either such continued use as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>cause the word to become' descriptive of kind or quality, \u00f3r \u00e1 continued use of the word as a trade-mark by some one having the prior right to its use.' Liebig\u2019s Extract became descrip^ tive of. a kind of extract put up under a certain formula. In <em>Manufacturing Co. </em>v. Trainer, 101 U. S. 51, it was held that \u201c A. C. A.\u201d designated ticking of a particular quality. Fairbanks\u2019 scales and Singer\u2019s sewing machine had by long use become descriptive of the particular kind of machines; for that reason they could not be held as trade-marks.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-4\">IV. The word \u201c Tycoon \u201d as used on teas prior to its adoption by. the complainants as a trade-mark had no significance whatever. It was not used as a trade-mark by any one,'' neither had it become descriptive of any kind or quality of tea; Its prior use, therefore, was not of such a character as would deprive the complainants of the right to protection in its use as a trade-mark.

The material allegations of the bill are not sustained by the evidence, and the one which presents the entire foundation for the claim .of relief is disproved by the exhibit which the complainants append to their- bill. After alleging that complainants had adopted as their trade-mark the word \u201c Tycoon,\u201d' and stamped it upon packages'of a particular kind of tea, manufactured and imported by themselves alone into the American market in 1879, and that the said word \u201cTycoon,\u201d having never before befen adopted as a trade-mark, had become known to the trade as exclusively designating a particular kind of tea dealt in by the complainants, the bill states that, for the purr' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>pose of obtaining protection for' their exclusive right to the said word \u201c Tycoon \u201d\u2022 as a trade-marlc, they deposited it as above described in the Patent Office at Washington ; and that in 1881, the same was registered and recorded by the Commissioner of Patents of the United States, and a certificate-was issued therefor, securing to the complainants protection for 'the said trade-mark. The exhibits A and P, appended to the bill, and other exhibits attached to Corbin\u2019s deposition, show that the trade-mark adopted b} the complainants, deposited and registered in the Patent Office, is not the word \u201c Tycoon,\u201d as stated, in the bill, but a transverse diamond-shaped symbol inclosing the word \u201c The \u201d at the top, and \u201c Tea \u201d at the bottom, between which, lengthwise the diamond, is the word \u201c Tycoon.\u201d \u2022 \u2022 A fac-simile is as follows:-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"228\"

The claim of the complainants, filed in the Patent Office for the registration of the trade-mark in question, is in these words: \u201c Opr trade-mark consists of the letters and words and, arbitrary symbols \u2018The.Tycoon Tea, I. 0. <em>&amp; </em>PC., 0., Japan Tea,\u2019 ornamental scroll border, transverse diamond shape. . . . The letters or words \u2018 I. 0. <em>&amp; </em>M., C., Japan Tea,\u2019 may be omitted or they may be partly omitted and partly changed as to their position within the square without materially altering the character of our trade-mark, <em>the essential features of which are </em>the symbol.of a diamond and the arbitrarily selected .word \u2018 Tycoon.\u2019 \u201d ' &lt;</p>\n<p id=\"Ahks\">It is not pretended that this combination, claimed'and registered as' the trade-mark of. complainants, has ever been used by the defendants either in the identical form, or in a form having such resemblance thereto as might be calculated to deceive. A comparison\" of the' label of defendants with that of the complainants, \u2022\u25a0asTgiven-in the. exhibit to the bill,'shows many striking .points of. difference,-and but few, if any, points of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>similarity, except that the 'word \u201c Tycoon \u201d is found in both.\u2019 In the complainants\u2019 label, the diamond figure, the words \u201cThe Tycoon Tea,\u201d \u201cChoicest,\u201d and \u201cSpring Leaf\u201d are printed in blue ink; and the other words are printed in black ink, all in different kinds of ornamental letters \u2014the whole surrounded by an ornamental black scroll border. The defendants\u2019 label is water-marked in red and pink colors, surrounded by a heavy blue .border, with black decorations. The words are printed in various styles of letters of different colors- \u2014 -the words \u201cTycoon Chop,\u201d for instance, being in large white letters with red facings, on a solid black ground; and \u201c Japan Tea,\u201d in large black letters, some of which are plain and some ornamental. On the complainants\u2019 label the proprietorship of the tea is indicated by the letters \u201c I., C. <em>&amp; </em>M:,\u201d representing' Ingraham, Corbin <em>&amp; </em>May, the predecessors of the present firm; while on the defendants\u2019 label the name of their firm and their place of business appear prominently near the bottom of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">These labels are so entirely dissimilar that it is difficult to perceive how they could be mistaken the one for, the other. A. mere glance is sufficient to distinguish them. There asee certainly no more points of similarity between them than are to be found ordinarily between tea labels or facings; and were it not for the fact that the word \u201c Tycoon \u201d is found in both of them there would be no semblance of a case of infringement;</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u25a0 \"With respect to the word \u201c Tycoon,\u201d the evidence shows beyond question that it has been used as a name or brand for Japan tea for many years. Invoices of \u201c Tycoon Tea\u201d -were, received at the custom house in San Francisco as early as May 15, 18Y3, as shown by a copy of the official records of that office filed in this case; and the evidence of dealers and merv chants of California is all\u2019to the effect that the word was in\\ common use as a brand for Japan tea for several years prior! to that date. It is unnecessary to go into this evidence in detail; but it is conclusive as to the long use of the word prior to, the alleged adoption of it as a part of the trade-mark of the complainants.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The authorities cited by complainants\u2019 counsel, to show that the prior use of a word as a trade-mark by another party who\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>had abandoned it is- not sufficient to debar the present owner of it from protection, do not apply to this case. At the time complainants claim to have adopted the word \u201c Tycoon \u201d as their trade-mark, for the particular species of tea dealt in by them, it was not an abandoned trade-mark, previously used by some other person or firm to designate a particular quality of tea; but it was, and had been for many years, in general and common use as a term descriptive of a class of teas -introduced into the American market \u2014 a term which all men engaged in the tea business had an equal right to use, and which belonged to no one individual either as a trade-mark or a trade label. It belonged to the public, as the., common property of the trade, and, therefore, was not subject to appropriation by any one person. The following language used in <em>The Amoskeag Manufacturing Company </em>v. Spear, 2 Sandford, Sup. Ct. N. Y. 599, quoted with approval by this court in <em>Canal Company </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>13 Wall. 311, 324, is applicable to the claim of the complainant in this case: \u201cHe has no right to appropriate a sign or a symbol [or a name] which, from the nature of the fact it is used to signify,\u2019others may employ with equal truth and, therefore, have an equal right to employ for the same purpose.\u201d See also <em>Goodyear Co. </em>v. <em>Goodyear Rubber Co., </em>128 U. S. 598; <em>Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Co. </em>v. <em>Finzer, </em>128 U. S. 182; <em>Stachelberg </em>v. <em>Ponce, </em>128 U. S. 686; <em>Menendez </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>128 U. S. 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Even conceding that the complainants may claim a trademark for the combination of the diamond and the words inclosed .in it, as described in their application to the Patent Office, there was, upon the authorities above cited, clearly no trade-mark in the word \u201c Tycoon \u201d considered by itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The decree 'of the court below dismissing the bill should be, and it hereby is,</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\u2022 <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
