On appeal, Jeter argues that the government breached the plea agreement by recommending an above-guideline sentence, which requires us to remand for re-sentencing. Because he knowingly and voluntarily entered his guilty plea, Jeter requests that we order re-sentencing before a different district court judge. After careful review, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether the government breached a plea agreement. <em>United States v. Mahique, </em>150 F.3d 1330, 1332 (11th Cir.1998). When a plea rests in any significant portion on the government\u2019s promise or agreement, so that it becomes part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled. <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">We have held that whether the district court considered or was influenced by the government\u2019s position on the sentencing issue is not relevant. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>132 F.3d 628, 630 (11th Cir.1998). When analyzing an alleged violation of a plea agreement, we do \u201cnot address the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion in imposing a sentence. Rather, we focus on the government\u2019s violation of its plea agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and emphasis omitted). We have held that \u201c[ajdvocacy of a position requiring a greater sentence is flatly inconsistent with recommendation of a lesser sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>77 F.3d 368, 370 (11th Cir.1996). In <em>Taylor, </em>the government conceded that its support of the PSI\u2019s position on related conduct was incompatible with the plea agreement\u2019s terms, but it argued that it cured the breach by recommending the appropriate sentence at the sentencing hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 371. We disagreed and held that the government\u2019s recommendation, \u201cwhich merely paid \u2018lip service\u2019 to the agreement, [was] insufficient to rectify the breach committed when the government advocated a position requiring a longer sentence than it had agreed to recommend.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">When the government\u2019s breach of an agreement has been established, we may either order specific performance of the agreement by means of re-sentencing before a different judge or allow a withdrawal of the plea. <em>Johnson, </em>132 F.3d at 631. We have not favored withdrawal of the guilty plea where, as here, no question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>exists that the plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">In the plea agreement and at Jeter\u2019s Rule 11 hearing, the government agreed that it would recommend a within-guideline sentence. But in a sentencing.memorandum and at sentencing, the government advocated a 51-month above-guideline sentence. By recommending an above-guideline sentence, the government clearly violated the plea agreement. Further, as it concedes, the government\u2019s apology and subsequent within-guideline recommendation failed to cure the breach. <em>See Taylor, </em>77 F.3d at 371. Moreover, the district court did not cure the government\u2019s breach when it stated that it did not rely upon the government\u2019s initial recommendation in imposing Jeter\u2019s sentence. <em>See Santobello, </em>404 U.S. at 262, 92 S.Ct. 495 (remanding case even though the Court had \u201cno reason to doubt\u201d the sentencing judge\u2019s statement that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s recommendation did not influence him\u201d). Finally, as in <em>Johnson, </em>132 F.3d at 631, Jeter does not seek to withdraw his knowing and voluntary guilty plea. Therefore, as the government agrees, our precedent compels us to vacate Jeter\u2019s sentence and order that he be resentenced by a different district court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
