Giron contends the BIA erred by denying her motion to reopen because the notice of her hearing before the IJ was returned as undeliverable and, therefore, she did not receive notice of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-22\">The denial of a motion to reopen is reviewed under a \u201chighly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354, 358 (5th Cir.2009). That denial must be affirmed as long as it is not \u201ccapricious, without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach\u201d. <em>Id. </em>Because the BIA affirmed, without opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions. <em>Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 186 (5th Cir.2004). Those fact-findings are upheld unless \u201cnot supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-23\">The IJ\u2019s findings, that Giron failed to provide authorities with a current mailing address and was admonished concerning the consequences of failing to appear at hearings, are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See, e.g., Gomez-Palacios, </em>560 F.3d at 359-61. Her failure to provide the address supports the BIA\u2019s decision. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii) (\u201can order may be rescinded only ... [where] alien demonstrates ... failure to appear was through no fault of the alien\u201d); <em>Gomez-Palacios, </em>560 F.3d at 360-61 (holding alien\u2019s not receiving actual notice due to his failure to keep court apprised of his mailing address does not mean he did not receive notice). Giron\u2019s assertions are insufficient to show the BIA abused its discretion in denying her motion to reopen. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number><em>See, e.g., Gomez-Palacios, </em>560 F.3d at 360-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Insofar as Giron maintains she was unable to file a change of address form with the immigration court because her notice to appear was not yet filed with that court, we decline to consider this claim because she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b755-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
