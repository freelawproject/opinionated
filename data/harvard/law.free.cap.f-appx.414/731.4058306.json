The instant appeal is from the dismissal of his cause of action based upon res judicata. Smart asserts general conclusions with very little detail and makes no references to the record. It is clear, however, that the nucleus of this suit is the same as the previous case that was dismissed by a district court in our circuit and affirmed by this Court on appeal. The district court correctly determined that res judicata applied and dismissed the claim herein. This appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b753-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
