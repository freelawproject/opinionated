Rhodes consented to proceed before a magistrate judge (MJ). Rhodes argues that the MJ failed to provide written reasons for the certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith but merely referred to the order of dismissal. Rhodes\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to the MJ\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">A district court may deny a motion for leave to appeal IFP by certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith and by providing written reasons for the certification. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed.R.App. P. 24(a). To comply with the written-reasons requirement, the district court may incorporate by reference its prior decision. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 21. Here, the MJ certified that Rhodes\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith for the reasons set forth in its order dismissing his \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The MJ\u2019s reasons were sufficient. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-17\">Rhodes does not challenge the MJ\u2019s reasons for dismissing his \u00a7 1983 complaint. He does not even brief the Eighth Amendment claim he raised in his \u00a7 1983 complaint. When an appellant fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if the appellant had not appealed that issue. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Rhodes has abandoned any challenge to the MJ\u2019s certification decision by failing to raise his Eighth Amendment claim in his IFP motion before this court. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-18\">Rhodes has failed to show that his appeal involves \u201clegal, points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). His IFP motion should therefore be denied, and his appeal should be dismissed. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-19\">The MJ\u2019s dismissal of Rhodes\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim and this court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Rhodes is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger or serious bodily injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b745-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
