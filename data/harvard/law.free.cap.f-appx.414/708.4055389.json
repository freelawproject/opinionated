He entered the United States without being admitted or paroled in March 1994. In May 2004, Lad married Vaishali Babybhai Mistry, a native of India and a lawful permanent resident of the United States. Vaishali petitioned for a relative visa for Lad in 2005, and she became a United States citizen in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-23\">Meanwhile, on August 26, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) charged that Lad was subject to removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) as an inadmissible alien who was present in the United States without having been admitted or paroled. Lad admitted the charge, but sought cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b) and requested voluntary departure. The IJ denied the request for cancellation of removal, granted Lad voluntary departure, and entered an alternate order of removal to India that would become effective if Lad failed to depart vol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>untarily by January 14, 2008. The BIA dismissed Lad\u2019s appeal of the IJ\u2019s order on March 10, 2009, and Lad did not petition this court for review of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">On May 12, 2009, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (US-CIS) denied Vaishali\u2019s visa petition, on the ground that Lad was ineligible for a visa under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(c), which prohibits the approval of a visa petition if \u201cthe Attorney General has determined that the alien has attempted or conspired to enter into a marriage for the purpose of evading the immigration laws.\u201d Lad moved the BIA to reopen his removal proceedings, arguing that because his wife\u2019s visa petition had been denied, his case should be remanded to the IJ in order so that Lad could apply for a waiver of removal 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(H). The BIA denied the motion, and Lad timely filed a petition for review of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Lad contends that the immigration judge (IJ) violated his due process rights by failing to sustain his repeated objections to the translator\u2019s interpretations during a hearing before the IJ, but we lack jurisdiction over this claim, which pertains to the underlying deportation order, because Lad only filed a petition for review of the denial of his motion to reopen. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394-95, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(6) (1988 Supp. V) (recodified as amended at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(6))). Likewise, to the extent that Lad argues that his motion to reopen should have been granted on the same basis, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) bars our review of the claim because Lad made no such argument in his motion to reopen before the BIA. Accordingly, we dismiss Lad\u2019s petition in part for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Lad also argues that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen. Motions to reopen removal proceedings are disfavored, and the moving party bears a heavy burden. <em>Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 549 (5th Cir.2006). In reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider, we apply a \u201chighly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We will affirm the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cso long as it is not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 301 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotations marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">Lad apparently believes that he is eligible under \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(H) for a waiver, and that this waiver would eliminate not only his removability but also his inadmissibility. He seems to believe that the elimination of his inadmissibility through the waiver would in turn allow him to adjust his status, perhaps under \u00a7 1255. Lad also asserts that the pendency of his wife\u2019s relative visa petition somehow prevented him from seeking a \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(H) waiver earlier, and that this is the fault of the USCIS because it did not process the visa petition more quickly.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">Despite Lad\u2019s suggestion that the denial of his wife\u2019s relative visa petition makes a \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(H) waiver newly available to him, DHS regulations specifically state that an alien \u201cmay apply to the immigration judge\u201d for a waiver of a ground of inadmissibility \u201c[i]n conjunction with any application for creation of status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence made to an immigration judge.\u201d 8 G.F.R. \u00a7 1240.11(a)(2). In fact, the record shows that the IJ asked whether Lad would be seeking any relief in addition to cancellation of removal and voluntary departure, and Lad declined to seek additional relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>In addition, Lad is not eligible for a \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(H) waiver of the removal of aliens \u201con the ground that they were inadmissible at the time of admission as aliens described in section 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)\u201d because that provision restricts such waivers to aliens who are \u201cin possession of an immigrant visa or equivalent document and [are] otherwise admissible to the United States at the time of such admission except for those grounds of inadmissibility specified under paragraphs (5)(A) and (7)(A) of section 1182(a).\u201d Lad does not have an immigrant visa as required by \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(H) because his wife\u2019s relative visa petition has been denied, and he is not \u201cotherwise admissible\u201d as required by \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(H) because he has already conceded his inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae as an alien who was present in the United States without having been admitted or paroled. Accordingly, Lad has failed to show that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion reopen, and we deny his petition for review in remaining part. <em>See Altamirano-Lopez, </em>435 F.3d at 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b730-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
