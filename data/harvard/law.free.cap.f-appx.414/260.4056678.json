Bres-tle also alleged that the government prevented him from selling his house and from conducting business transactions with a Florida businessman. Brestle characterized this conduct as tortious interference with his economic expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>The district court dismissed the complaint because (1) it was based on the same operative facts as his previously denied section 2255 motion and, thus, was successive; (2) it attacked the validity of his underlying convictions and, thus, was barred by <em>Heck v. </em>Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); and (3) it was barred by the FTCA\u2019s two-year statute of limitations. On appeal, Brestle argues that the district court impermissibly characterized his tort claims as a successive collateral attack on his criminal convictions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">We disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Brestle\u2019s complaint attacked his underlying convictions. While Brestle\u2019s FTCA complaint is based on the same core facts that gave rise to his section 2255 motion, Brestle\u2019s claims of witness tampering and tortious interference do not challenge the fact of his convictions or duration of his sentences. And Brestle sought money damages, not a speedier release. <em>See Heck, </em>114 S.Ct. at 2369 (habeas corpus is \u201cthe exclusive remedy ... [to] challenge[ ] the fact or duration of ... confinement and seek[ ] immediate or speedier release,\u201d even though the claims may come within the procedural framework of a civil rights complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">But we may affirm the district court on any ground supported in the record. <em>See Greenberg v. National Geographic Soc\u2019y, </em>533 F.3d 1244, 1272-73 n. 28 (11th Cir.2008) <em>(en </em>banc) (explaining that \u201cit is an axiom of appellate review that the judgment of a district court may be affirmed upon any adequate ground, even if it is other than the one on which the court actually relied\u201d). And here, the record shows that the district court lacked jurisdiction over Brestle\u2019s complaint; so, dismissal was appropriate. <em>See United States v. Straub, </em>508 F.3d 1003, 1008 (11th Cir.2007) previewing <em>sua sponte </em>whether a district court had subject-matter jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">The FTCA provides that the government is hable in tort if the eomplained-of conduct is committed under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with state law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1). Brestle\u2019s allegation that FBI agents interfered with a witness is premised solely on principles of federal criminal law. Because this claim would not be cognizable in tort under the laws of Florida, it is not cognizable in an FTCA action.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">The FTCA specifically declines to waive sovereign immunity for claims that are based on \u201cmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h). And the substance of Brestle\u2019s other claims involve governmental misrepresentation of facts and corresponding interference with Brestle\u2019s purported contractual and business relationships. While Brestle characterized these claims as tortious interference with economic expectations, \u201c[i]t is the substance of the claim and not the language used in stating it which controls whether the claim is barred by an FTCA exception.\u201d <em>See JBP Acquisitions, LP v. United States ex rel. F.D.I.C., </em>224 F.3d 1260, 1264 (11th Cir.2000) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">Thus, Brestle\u2019s remaining claims rest on grounds that Congress specifically excluded from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of immunity. Bounds on a waiver of sovereign immunity must be observed strictly; and Brestle\u2019s complaint fails to overcome those limitations. <em>See Lehman v. Nakshian, </em>453 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>156, 101 S.Ct. 2698, 2701-02, 69 L.Ed.2d 548 (1981). A question of sovereign immunity is a jurisdictional issue; without a statutory waiver, a district court has no jurisdiction to entertain a suit against the United States. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>445 U.S. 535, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 1351, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980). So, because the government was immune from suit, the district court\u2019s order of dismissal was appropriate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-12\">. Brestle pleaded guilty to wire fraud and promotion of money laundering. He unsuccessfully challenged his convictions and se\u00f1-tences in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's grant of a motion to dismiss. <em>Dalrymple v. United States, </em>460 F.3d 1318, 1324 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b285-17\">. Because we conclude that the district court lacked jurisdiction over Brestle\u2019s claims, it is unnecessary to discuss his argument the FTCA\u2019s limitations period should be equitably tolled.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
