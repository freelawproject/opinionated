Ochoa argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-22\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by ordering that Ochoa\u2019s sentence run consecutive to the first seven years of a sentence imposed by a Georgia court for trafficking in cocaine and concurrently afterward. When \u201ca term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who is already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment,\u201d the district court decides whether the \u201cterms [should] run concurrently or consecutively.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). Ochoa was deported in December 2002 after completing a sentence of 60 months of imprisonment for possessing at least 500 grams of cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and, shortly after his term of supervised release expired, Ochoa left his family in Mexico and reentered the United States illegally, where federal agents discovered him in possession of 223 grams of cocaine base and a firearm. The district court considered the sentencing factors and reasonably determined that a sentence at the high end of the guideline range that ran partially concurrent with Ochoa\u2019s sentence in state court would best address his \u201cpersistent pattern of re-entry\u201d to engage in drug crimes. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>lines Manual \u00a7 5G1.3(c) (2009); <em>see United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010). Ochoa\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Ochoa\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
