Sinister-ra challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Sinisterra challenges the reasonableness of his sentence. \u201cWe review sentencing decisions only for abuse of discretion, and we use a two-step process.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). First, we \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). If we conclude that no procedural error occurred, \u201cthe second step is to review the sentence\u2019s \u2018substantive reasonableness\u2019 under the totality of the circumstances, including \u2018the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597). \u201cIf the district court\u2019s sentence is within the guidelines range, we expect that the sentence is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alfaro-Moncada, </em>607 F.3d 720, 735 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see also United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cAlthough we do not automatically presume a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, we \u2018ordinarily ... expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">As for procedural error, Sinisterra contends that the district court failed to adequately consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. His argument lacks merit. In imposing its sentence, the district court stated that it had considered \u201cthe advisory sentencing guidelines and all of the factors identified in Title 18 United States Code Section 3353(a)(1) through (7).\u201d The court\u2019s acknowledgment that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u201calone is sufficient in <em>post-Booker </em>sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). No procedural error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">Sinisterra also challenges the substantive reasonableness of his 135-month sentence, which was at the lowest end of his advisory guidelines range of 135 to 168 months imprisonment. He contends that his sentence is unreasonable because his involvement in the drug smuggling scheme was limited. Sinisterra actively participated in the scheme to smuggle drugs into the United States. We cannot say that his sentence, which was at the lowest end of his advisory guidelines range, is unreasonable. <em>See Hunt, </em>526 F.3d at 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
