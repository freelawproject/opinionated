Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331-32 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">The first three arguments Rodrigues presents were presented to the district court and properly considered and rejected in the district court\u2019s opinion. (R. 2-29 at 7-9.) We affirm for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
