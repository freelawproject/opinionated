Warren (\u201cWarren\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s order granting Defendants-Appellees, Texas Disposal Systems, Inc.; Jimmy Gregory; and Texas Landfill Management, LLC\u2019s (collectively \u201cTexas Disposal\u201d) motion for summary judgment on Warren\u2019s claim of retaliation in violation of the Family Medical Leave Act (the \u201cAct\u201d). Reviewing the record <em>de novo, Williams v. Wynne, </em>533 F.3d 360, 365 (5th Cir.2008), we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-23\">Retaliation claims under the Act like Warren\u2019s are analyzed using the familiar <em>McDonnell-Douglas </em>burden shifting framework. <em>Hunt v. Rapides Healthcare Sys., LLC, </em>277 F.3d 757, 768 (5th Cir.2001). Texas Disposal met its burden to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Warren\u2019s employment. It adduced evidence that it fired Warren because (1) Warren misappropriated loads of mulch; (2) Warren misappropriated herbicide and trees; and (3) Warren falsified his time records. The burden therefore shifted to Warren \u201cto show by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>preponderance of the evidence that [Texas Disposal\u2019s] articulated reasonfs are] pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Monitronics Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>434 F.3d 327, 332-33 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Warren contends that a fact issue existed regarding pretext because of: (1) the temporal proximity of his exercise of his rights under the Act and Texas Disposal\u2019s adverse employment action; (2) the lack of documented prior work performance complaints; and (3) his denial of the alleged wrongdoing upon which the termination was based.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree. Although temporal proximity may suffice to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, \u201conce the employer offers a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason that explains both the adverse action and the timing, the plaintiff must offer some evidence from which the jury may infer that retaliation was the real motive.\u201d <em>McCoy v. City of Shreveport, </em>492 F.3d 551, 562 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation omitted). The lack of documented prior complaints does not rebut Texas Disposal\u2019s reasons for firing Warren because the incidents in question were recently discovered. And, Warren\u2019s unsupported belief that he had permission for his acts is not sufficient to create a fact issue precluding summary judgment. <em>See Roberson v. Alltel Info. Servs., </em>373 F.3d 647, 654 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b667-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\">. Warren also argues that another employee participated in the alleged misappropriation of herbicide and trees without being fired, proving that this reason is merely pretext. Since, Warren has not demonstrated that Texas Disposal's other proffered reasons are pre-textual, we need not address this argument. <em>See Machinchick v. PB Power, Inc., </em>398 F.3d 345, 351 (5th Cir.2005) (\"[A] plaintiff relying upon evidence of pretext to create a fact issue on discriminatory intent falters if he fails to produce evidence rebutting all of a defendant's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
