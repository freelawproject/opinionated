Holder, </em>354 Fed.Appx. 133 (5th Cir.2009) (unpub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>lished). This case presents these extraordinary circumstances warranting the recall of mandate to prevent injustice. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 41.2; <em>Calderon v. Thompson, </em>523 U.S. 538, 550, 118 S.Ct. 1489, 140 L.Ed.2d 728 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">In September 1985 Spence, a native and citizen of Jamaica, was admitted to the United States at New York, New York, as a permanent resident. In 2007, the Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings against Spence by issuing a Notice to Appear before an immigration judge (IJ) in Harlingen, Texas, alleging that Spence was subject to removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00a9 (2006) as an alien who after admission had been convicted under any \u201claw or regulation of a State, [or] the United States ... relating to a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21), other than a single offense involving possession for one\u2019s own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana.\u201d The charges were later expanded to allege additional convictions. Thereafter, at a 2008 hearing before the IJ, the IJ found that Spence had been convicted in New York state court of misdemeanor simple possession of marijuana in October 1998, August 2007, and December 2007, and that Spence was hence removable under section 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Spence then sought cancellation of removal under the discretionary authority granted the Attorney General by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a) (2006) providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">\u201cThe Attorney General may cancel removal in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the United States if the alien\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">(1) has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than 5 years,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-9\">(2) has resided in the United States continuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any status, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-10\">(3) has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">The IJ pretermitted consideration of Spence\u2019s application for discretionary cancellation of removal because he found that Spence was in any event ineligible for any such relief under section 1229b(a)(3) as the record established that he <em>had </em>been convicted of an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d The IJ based this holding on his determination that after Spence\u2019s 1998 New York court conviction of possession of marijuana, a misdemeanor, became final, Spence was again convicted in new York court of misdemeanor possession of marijuana, \u201conce on October 10 and once on December 20\u201d 2007, and \u201c[e]ither or both of those convictions could have been punished as a felony under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844\u201d and that Spence \u201chas therefore been convicted of an aggravated felony, and he is statutorily ineligible for Cancellation of Removal pursuant to Section 240(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In so ruling, the IJ relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>on the Board of Immigration Appeals decision in <em>In Re </em>Carachuri-Rosendo, 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 382 (BIA 2007), holding that in cases governed by the law established by this court, a second misdemeanor simple possession state drug conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony simply because it could have been prosecuted as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Spence timely appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). On January 27, 2009, the BIA, acting through a single member, affirmed without opinion the decision of the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Spence, proceeding pro se (as he apparently had below), timely appealed to this court urging that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ determination that he was not eligible for consideration of cancellation of removal because none of his simple possession of marijuana convictions under New York law constituted an aggravated felony because he was not prosecuted as a recidivist under New York law and hence none of his simple possession convictions constituted a drug trafficking crime under the Controlled Substances Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-14\">Shortly after perfecting his appeal to this court, Spence (pro se) moved this court for a stay of deportation pending review. That motion was denied by a motions panel of this court in an order without opinion on March 12, 2009. Spence thereafter, on April 15, 2009, proceeding pro se, filed a petition for certiora-ri with the Supreme Court (No. 089882) to review this court\u2019s March 12, 2009 order, contending, that, for the reasons stated above, it was error to deny him eligibility for cancellation of removal on the ground that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony, as his drug convictions were all simple possession misdemeanors and in none had he been prosecuted as a recidivist. The government on July 22, 2009, filed an opposition to the petition for cer-tiorari, in which it did not address the merits but rather simply contended that the petition was premature since this court had not acted on the merits, and that even if Spence were removed before this court rendered judgment he could still proceed with his appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On October 5, 2009, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>petition for certiorari was denied. <em>Spence v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 60, 175 L.Ed.2d 46 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The records of our Clerk\u2019s Office reflect that in August 2009, shortly before he was deported to Jamaica, Spence (pro se) advised this court in writing, in reference to \u201cSpence v. Holder Jr., No. 09-60102,\u201d of a change of address, which notice was received and recorded in our Clerk\u2019s Office records in August 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">On November 17, 2009, this court issued its unpublished summary calendar opinion affirming the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Spence v. Holder, </em>354 Fed.Appx. 133. No notice of that opinion or action or ruling of this court was sent by this court to Spence\u2019s new address which our Clerk\u2019s Office had on its records since Spence had furnished it in August 2009. No motion for rehearing was filed, and this court\u2019s mandate issued in the usual course on January 11, 2010. No notice of this was sent to Spence\u2019s new address which our Clerk\u2019s Office had on its records since Spence had furnished same in August 2009.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Our November 17, 2009 opinion in Spence\u2019s case, and our rejection of his argument that he had not been convicted of an aggravated felony because none of three New York misdemeanor convictions for simple possession of marijuana was a recidivist prosecution, expressly rested entirely on our opinion in <em>Carachuri-Rosen-do v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">In August 2010 Spence, pro se, filed in this court his motion to recall our mandate, supported by his affidavit. He had been deported to Jamaica in August 2010 (and appears to have been there since that time). He swore that he had no notice whatever of our action in his case, and thought that it was still pending undecided in our court, until in July or August 2010 he was contacted by a named New York Times reporter doing a human interest type article on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>and those who might be or have been affected by it or the rule which it rejected. This affidavit states that until the reporter contacted him \u201cI was of the opinion that my case was still pending before the Court [the 5th Circuit] for a ruling,\u201d and \u201cHad I been provided notice of the Court\u2019s denial of my \u2018Petition for Review,\u2019 I would have filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court prior to the expiration of the 90-day time period specified for filing such petition.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The government has filed an opposition to Spence\u2019s motion to recall the mandate. The response does not challenge any of the facts asserted in the motion, or assert any facts contrary to those hereinabove set out in this order. Nor does it question that under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>the record here does not support a determination that Spence had ever been convicted of an aggravated felony or that our November 17, 2009 decision in Spence\u2019s case is incorrect under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. </em>Holder,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The government\u2019s only contention is that Spence did not do enough to check on the status of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>his case. This is not a frivolous contention, but we ultimately reject it. Spence was at all times pro se\u2014and government has never suggested otherwise\u2014and he was in Jamaica ever since more than two months before our opinion issued, and he had done what he could to provide for that eventuality. Moreover, it is clear that we erred in holding that he was shown to be an aggravated felon. We are duty bound to give parties notice of our decisions. Fed. R.App. P. Rules 36(b), 45(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Accordingly, the motion to recall mandate is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">We sua sponte RECONSIDER and VACATE our prior opinion denying Spence\u2019s petition for review and replace it with the following: Spence has filed in this court a petition for review of an order by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirming an immigration judge\u2019s (IJ) denial of his application for cancellation of removal. Because the legal basis for the BIA\u2019s determination that Spence was ineligible for cancellation of removal was invalidated by the Supreme Court in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>130 S.Ct. 2577 (2010), we GRANT the petition for review, VACATE the order of the BIA, and REMAND this case to the BIA for reconsideration of Spence\u2019s application for cancellation of removal in the light of <em>Carachuri-Rosendo.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b659-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-5\">. The IJ, however, found that none of the convictions shown were for crimes involving moral turpitude and that Spence was <em>not </em>removable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) (\"Any alien who at any time after admission is convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude ... \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b660-6\">.

The case was argued before the Supreme Court on March 31, 2010 and on June 14, 2010, the Court reversed the decision of this court and held that \"when a defendant has been convicted of a simple possession [drug] offense that has not been enhanced based on the fact of a prior conviction, he has not been 'convicted' under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1229b(a)(3) of a 'felony punishable' as such \u2018under the Controlled Substance Act,' 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2).\u201d <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v.
