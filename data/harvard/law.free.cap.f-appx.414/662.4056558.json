He argues that the district court erred by holding that he had failed to meet the fifth criterion set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and therefore did not warrant a two level decrease pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(ll). This court reviews the district court\u2019s decision whether a defendant qualifies for the safety valve for clear error. <em>United States v. McCrim-mon, </em>443 F.3d 454, 457 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The fifth criterion for eligibility for the safety valve reduction requires that, \u201cnot later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(5); <em>see also United States v. Brenes, </em>250 F.3d 290, 293 (5th Cir.2001) (holding that truthful debriefing must take place before commencement of sentencing hearing). The defendant bears the burden of showing eligibility for the safety valve reduction. <em>Brenes </em>at 293 n. 1; <em>United States v. Miller, </em>179 F.3d 961, 964 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Examination of the record shows that the district court\u2019s determination that Figueroa had not truthfully provided the Government with all information he had regarding the offense was plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. Powers, </em>168 F.3d 741, 753 (5th Cir.1999). Figueroa had denied at rear-raignment that he had been present at the Sandstone Street house, a fact which was refuted by the DEA agent\u2019s testimony. Figueroa\u2019s subsequent admissions, through counsel in the latter part of the sentencing hearing, of his presence at the Sandstone Street house were untimely for purposes of the safety valve provision and merely affirm the existence of that discrepancy. <em>See Brenes, </em>250 F.3d at 293. The fingerprint evidence offered by the government, which was included in the unobjected to PSR and was not disputed by Figueroa, further serves to contradict the version of events offered by Figueroa.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b684-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
