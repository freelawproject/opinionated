Orellana does not challenge the denial of her motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order. She has thus abandoned that claim. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The BIA applied the correct standard in reviewing Orellana\u2019s motion to remand. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 451-52 n. 2 (5th Cir.2001) (observing that a motion to remand is, in essence, a motion to reopen). An alien is not bound by the time limitation for filing a motion to reopen if her request for asylum or withholding of removal is \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The evidence submitted by Orellana did not show a change in conditions in El Salvador since the time of her in absentia removal proceeding. Rather, her evidence showed a long history of domestic violence within her own family and the ongoing nature of domestic violence in El Salvador, both predating her 2006 removal hearing. Moreover, any alleged change in the asylum law of the United States does not constitute \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered\u201d for purposes of a motion to reopen under \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). <em>See Azanor v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1013, 1022 (9th Cir.2004). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in determining that Orellana had failed to establish changed country conditions and that her motion was, therefore, untimely. <em>See Panjwani v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 626, 632-33 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">Orellana suggests for the first time in her reply brief that an alleged change in asylum law warranted the reopening of her case under the BIA\u2019s discretionary sua sponte authority. We decline to consider this claim. <em>See United States v. Agurrie-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 n. 2 (5th Cir.2006). In any event, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s refusal to sua sponte exercise its general authority to reopen immigration proceedings. <em>See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 219-20 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">Accordingly, Orellana\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b669-11\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
