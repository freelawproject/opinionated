He argues that his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Specifically, Castaneda Castillo contends that the 16-level enhancement for his prior alien smuggling offense resulted in an excessive sentence in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-17\">Castaneda Castillo\u2019s sentence is at the low end of the properly calculated guideline range and is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). The district court considered Castaneda Castillo\u2019s arguments and gave specific reasons for rejecting them, tied to proper 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and Castaneda Castillo has not rebutted the presumption that the sentence was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1930, 176 L.Ed.2d 397 (2010). Castaneda Castillo has not demonstrated that the district court\u2019s imposition of a 51-month sentence was an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-21\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b675-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
