Woldeyes sought immigration relief based on his alleged persecution or fear of persecution and torture on account of his race, political opinion, and membership in a particular social group. The IJ denied relief after finding that Woldeyes had perjured himself and was thus not a credible witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and held that Wol-deyes had failed to meet his burden of proving eligibility for immigration relief. Woldeyes moved to reopen on the basis of newly acquired evidence, including affidavits which asserted that Woldeyes\u2019s remarks at his credible fear interview had been mistranslated. The BIA concluded that the affidavits attesting to mistranslations had been supplied by people who were neither certified translators nor language experts. The BIA noted further that each affidavit contained text that was nearly identical to the other affidavit, which the BIA believed to be an indication that the affiants had not independently prepared their respective affidavits. The BIA also concluded that the documents submitted with Woldeyes\u2019s motion to reopen were not likely to alter the result in the case. Consequently, the BIA denied the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Woldeyes contends that the BIA abused its discretion when it declined to reopen the proceedings. He maintains that the BIA failed to exercise its discretion properly because it engaged in impermissible factfinding by minimizing the evidentiary value of the affidavits he submitted. In support of his argument, he cites 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv), which provides that the BIA \u201cwill not engage in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">If \u201cthe BIA\u2019s decision itself results in a new issue and the BIA has an available and adequate means for addressing that issue, a party must first bring it to the BIA\u2019s attention through a motion for reconsideration.\u201d Oma<em>ri v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 320 (5th Cir.2009). Consequently, even if his contention could not have been raised prior to the issuance of the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen, Woldeyes was nevertheless required to exhaust this issue by moving for reconsideration in the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Oman, </em>562 F.3d at 320. In this circuit, an alien meets the exhaustion requirement only if he has explicitly raised the issue before the BIA on direct appeal, in a motion to reopen, or in a motion for reconsideration. <em>Oman, </em>562 F.3d at 318. The exhaustion requirement affords \u201cthe agency with the expertise in immigration matters[ ] with the opportunity\u201d to address all arguments, including those of its own alleged legal error. <em>Id. </em>at 322. Therefore, \u201callegations of impermissible factfinding\u201d must be urged in a motion for reconsideration presented to the BIA if they were not previously brought to the BIA\u2019s attention. <em>Dale v. Holder, </em>610 F.3d 294, 299 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Woldeyes recognizes the exhaustion requirement but states that it does not bar his petition for review, intimating that he had already presented the issue to the BIA and thus was not required to do so again in a motion for reconsideration. Woldeyes fails to explain, however, how and when he brought to the BIA\u2019s attention the argument that he now advances, namely, that the BIA engaged in impermissible fact-finding in its denial of his motion to reopen. Woldeyes\u2019s motion to reopen did not put forth any such argument. Thus, at no time was the BIA ever presented with the claim that it was or would be an abuse of discretion not to reopen based on a finding that the affidavits and documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>lacked evidentiary value and reliability. The matter was therefore not properly exhausted by Woldeyes; consequently, we lack jurisdiction to grant him relief. <em>See Oman, </em>562 F.3d at 320-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Woldeyes\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b753-38\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
