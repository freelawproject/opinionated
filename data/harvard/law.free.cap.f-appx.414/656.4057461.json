Affording his pro se brief the benefit of liberal construction, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), Vickers argues that he has standing to sue under RICO because the bodily injury he sustained ultimately caused economic damage to his corporation, Vickers Marine, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-22\">A RICO plaintiff \u201cmust establish that he has standing to sue.\u201d <em>Price v. Pinnacle </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number><em>Brands, </em>138 F.3d 602, 606 (5th Cir.1998). As there is no recovery under RICO for personal injuries, a plaintiff does not have standing to sue under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c) based on such injuries. <em>See id. </em>at 607 n. 20. Here, any economic injury to Vickers\u2019s corporation was the result of Vickers\u2019s bodily injury. Thus, the district court did not err in dismissing his RICO action for lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b678-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
