He was sentenced to serve a 120-month prison term on the drug possession count as well as a 60-month prison term on the firearms conviction, the latter sentence to run consecutively to the former, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>In the sole issue raised in this direct appeal, Peters contends that the district court erred by sentencing him to a mandatory five-year minimum sentence under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u00a9 because his drug offense carried a greater minimum sentence. This argument has been rejected by both this court and the United States Supreme Court. <em>Abbott v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,---, 131 S.Ct. 18, 22-23, 178 L.Ed.2d 348 (2010); <em>United States v.
