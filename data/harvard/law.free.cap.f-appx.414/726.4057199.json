He has also filed numerous other motions in this appeal, including, in part, a motion to disqualify all the judges of this court for what he characterizes as a conspiracy to suppress his civil rights. Through those filings, Ruston challenges his commitment to the custody of the Attorney General under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4243. <em>See United States v. Ruston, </em>565 F.3d 892, 894 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">By moving to proceed IFP, Ruston is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Ruston merely reasserts the arguments he raised in the district court and has not identified any error in the district court\u2019s determination that he is not entitled to coram nobis relief because he was not convicted of a federal offense. Ruston has also failed to identify any error in the district court\u2019s determination that the appeal was not taken in good faith and would be frivolous. When an appellant fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the decision. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Ruston has not shown that his appeal is not frivolous and taken in good faith or that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Therefore, Ruston\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED, <em>id., </em>and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d, 215, 220-21 (5th Cir.1983) (noting that although a pro se litigant is entitled to due consideration of his arguments, that \u201cdoes not mean that the court is obligated to tolerate abuse of its open door\u201d); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. All of Ruston\u2019s remaining motions, which are also frivolous and repetitive of numerous motions he has made in the past, are DENIED. <em>See, e.g., In re Ruston, </em>10-10638 (5th Cir. Oct. 6, 2010) (order barring Ruston from engaging in further repetitive frivolous litigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-12\">We remind Ruston that he may not file in this court any pro se initial pleading, including a petition for mandamus relief, or any pro se appeal from a district court order without first receiving the written permission of an active judge of this court. Thus, before filing any pro se appeal or other pro se action in this court, Ruston must submit to the clerk of this court a request for permission to file, which the clerk shall direct to an active judge of the court. In requesting the required permission, Ruston shall inform the court of the bar stated in <em>In re Ruston, </em>No. 10-10509 (5th Cir. Oct. 5, 2010), and <em>In re Ruston, </em>10-10638 (5th Cir. Oct. 6, 2010). The bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>does not apply to pleadings filed by counsel on Ruston\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b749-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
