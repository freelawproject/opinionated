Lewis, Louisiana prisoner # 395306, moves for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) following the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal from dismissal as frivolous of his civil rights action is taken in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-19\">Lewis makes the conclusional assertion in support of his motion that he stated colorable claims of constitutional deprivation; actual injury; violation of posted policy, rules, regulations of the Department of Corrections; breach and default of management services contract; and violations of state law, federal law and constitutional law. Although we construe liberally his pro se brief, Lewis has failed to brief any issues for his challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is taken in bad faith. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). His IFP motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-20\">This court may sua sponte dismiss an appeal pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 42.2 if \u201cthe merits are so intertwined with the certification decision as to constitute the same issue\u201d and it is apparent that the appeal would lack merit. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 &amp; n. 24 (5th Cir.1997). The district court\u2019s certification was based on the merits of Lewis\u2019s claims that he was denied access to the courts and was entitled to injunctive relief, and therefore is intertwined with the merits of the case. Because Lewis has failed to brief his challenge to the certification, his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-21\">The district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous of Lewis\u2019s civil rights action pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e) and our dismissal of this appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Lewis that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b746-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
