Christian-sen challenges the jurisdiction of the district court, the validity of the order of foreclosure, and the validity of the tax assessments. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">Christiansen argues that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, but we disagree. Congress vested in the district courts \u201cjurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress providing for internal revenue.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1340. Christiansen challenges the authority of the district court to evict her, but district courts have the right to order the sale of property encumbered by a tax lien, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7403(c), and \u201cto render such judgments and decrees as may be necessary or appropriate\u201d to complete that sale, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 7402(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">Christiansen makes two other-challenges to the proceeding, both of which lack merit. First, Christiansen argues that this civil action was not commenced properly, but the record establishes that the action was approved by the Chief Counsel of the Internal Revenue Service and commenced by the Attorney General, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 7401, 7403. <em>See United States v. McCallum, </em>970 F.2d 66, 69 (5th Cir.1992). Second, Christiansen argues that she lacked notice of her tax liabilities, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6203, but the record establishes that the Service sent her Certificates of Assessment and Payments for 1998 through 2000, <em>see United States v. Chila, </em>871 F.2d 1015, 1017-18 (11th Cir.1989), and Christiansen did not have to be notified that she had to pay the amounts owed based on her 2000 and 2001 tax returns, <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6201(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">Christiansen, for the first time on appeal, also argues that the order of foreclosure is invalid for three reasons, but her arguments fail. First, Christiansen argues that the district court was required, under <em>United, States v. Rodgers, </em>461 U.S. 677, 103 S.Ct. 2132, 76 L.Ed.2d 236 (1983), to evaluate different parties\u2019 \u201cpossessory interests in the property\u201d before issuing a foreclosure order, but we disagree. The <em>Rodgers </em>Court ruled that district courts, before deciding <em>not </em>to force a sale of property, must consider factors to protect the \u201cparamount interest\u201d of the government \u201cin prompt and certain collection of delinquent taxes,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 709-11, 103 S.Ct. at 2151-52. Second, Christiansen argues that the district court could not order hel- or other occupants to vacate the property before it was sold, but a district court has the authority to sell property \u201cupon such terms and conditions as [it] directs,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2001(a), and Christiansen lacks standing to complain about any harm to third parties, <em>see CAMP Legal Def. Fund, Inc. v. City of Atlanta, </em>451 F.3d 1257, 1270 (11th Cir.2006). Third, Christiansen argues that the district court violated her right of free speech under the First Amendment by prohibiting her from ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>versely affecting the sale of her property, but this issue is moot because the property has been sold and the proceeds have been distributed. <em>See Soliman v. U.S. ex rel. INS, </em>296 F.3d 1237, 1242 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The district court did not err by entering summary judgment in favor of the United States. The undisputed record established that the Service had assessed Christiansen for taxes she owed for 1998 through 2001. <em>See Chila, </em>871 F.2d at 1017-18. Christiansen argues that the complaint for taxes owed from 1998 and 1999 was barred by the statute of limitation, but the \u201c[ejxpiration of a statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded,\u201d <em>Davenport Recycling Assocs. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>220 F.3d 1255, 1260 (11th Cir.2000). Christiansen waived this defense by failing to plead it.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of the United States.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
