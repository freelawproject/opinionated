The IJ determined that Myssik was not a credible witness and denied all relief. After review, we deny Myssik\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-14\">As an initial matter, we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and CAT relief because Myssik did not exhaust those claims before the BIA. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006). Therefore, we dismiss Myssik\u2019s petition to the extent that it raises claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief. Our review is limited to the denial of Myssik\u2019s application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-16\">\u201cWe review the decision of the [BIA], and we review the decision of the Immigration Judge to the extent that the [BIA] expressly adopted the opinion of the Immigration Judge.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo the extent that the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Mehme-ti v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1199 (11th Cir.2009). Because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review both decisions. We review the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo, </em>but we review findings of fact, including credibility determinations, for substantial evidence to support them. <em>Id.; Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-17\">\u201cOur review for substantial evidence is highly deferential.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1351. \u201c[W]e view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Ade-femi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). We must \u201caffirm the [BIA\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Myssik challenges the IJ and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination. When an adverse credibility determination is made \u201cthe burden shifts to [the applicant] to show the credibility finding is not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1232. Myssik contends that the IJ and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding was not based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In finding Myssik not credible, the IJ and BIA both pointed out inconsistencies between Myssik\u2019s asylum application and hearing testimony. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii) (explaining that the \u201ctrier of fact may base a credibility determination on ... any inaccuracies or falsehoods in [the applicant\u2019s] statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim, or any other relevant factor\u201d). Myssik listed \u201c43 Panfilova Pereulok\u201d as his place of residence from 1997 to 2007 in his asylum application. However, Myssik testified at his hearing that he moved in with his grandmother in 1997 after being forced to sell that property to a corrupt police officer named Mr. Asilvakov. Myssik also stated in his asylum application that he was summoned by a KNB officer the day after he criticized a foundation operated by the daughter of the president of Kazakhstan on a television program. At his hearing, he testified that he was summoned the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The IJ and BIA also based its adverse credibility finding on Myssik\u2019s failure to produce corroborating evidence. <em>See Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231 (explaining that the denial of asylum relief \u201ccan be supported solely by an adverse credibility determination, especially if the alien fails to produce corroborating evidence\u201d). The IJ and BIA noted that Myssik did not submit documents showing that he sold \u201c43 Panfilova Pereulok\u201d to Mr. Asilvakov in 1997. Nor did Myssik produce documents establishing that he appeared on a television program or that he was detained by the KNB.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">After thorough review, we hold that the IJ and the BIA\u2019s specific, cogent reasons for making the adverse credibility determination are supported by the evidence, and nothing in the record would compel a reasonable factfinder to reverse the IJ and BIA\u2019s finding. <em>See id. </em>at 1230-31 (explaining that \u201cthe [BIA\u2019s] decision can be reversed only if the evidence compels a reasonable factfinder to find otherwise\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). Myssik\u2019s argument to the contrary is without merit. For that reason, we deny Myssik\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
