After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">The Defendant Jade Palace is a restaurant serving primarily American-Chinese food to customers in the areas of Shelby and Jefferson Counties, Alabama. From July 2006 to May 2007 and again from July 2008 to January 2009, Martinez worked as a cook at Jade Palace.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">Martinez worked every day the restaurant was open. Yang Zhao Chen, one of the owner/operators of Jade Palace, estimated that Martinez worked between five and seven days a week for seven to ten hours each day. Initially, Jade Palace paid Martinez $1,200 each month, but later Martinez\u2019s pay increased to $1,500 based on his experience. Jade Palace also provided Martinez with meals.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">Mr. Chen and another owner/operator, Wen-Jie Chen, conducted the day-to-day operations of the restaurant, including hiring and firing employees, supervising employees\u2019 duties and schedules, paying bills, ordering supplies, setting payroll and assisting the accountant with the preparation of financial statements and tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-15\">Jade Palace employed between one and two waiters and approximately three kitchen staff, including Martinez. Martinez\u2019s duties included food preparation and kitchen services. Martinez did not purchase goods, products or supplies for the restaurant. Martinez did not pay the restaurant\u2019s bills or take orders for food. Martinez did not use the telephone, mail or Internet to correspond with Jade Palace\u2019s vendors, suppliers or customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-16\">Martinez filed this FLSA action alleging that Jade Palace owed him unpaid minimum wages and overtime compensation. The district court granted Jade Palace\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court concluded that Martinez was not entitled to individual coverage under the FLSA because he was not \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d while working as Jade Palace\u2019s cook. Martinez filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-17\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b266-18\">To establish a claim for unpaid overtime and minimum wages under the FLSA, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>plaintiff employee must prove one of two types of coverage, either: (1) \u201cindividual coverage,\u201d in which the employee was \u201cengaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce,\u201d or (2) \u201centerprise coverage,\u201d in which the employee was \u201cemployed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 206(a), 207(a)(1); <em>see also Thome v. All Restoration Servs., </em>448 F.3d 1264, 1265-66 (11th Cir.2006). Martinez relies on the first form of coverage, \u201cindividual coverage,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, more specifically, on the \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d element.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">To be an employee \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d within the meaning of the FLSA, the employee \u201cmust be directly participating in the actual movement of persons or things in interstate commerce by (i) working for an instrumentality of interstate commerce, <em>e.g., </em>transportation or communication industry employees, or (ii) by regularly using the instrumentalities of interstate commerce in his work, <em>e.g., </em>regular and recurrent use of interstate telephone, telegraph, mails, or travel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1266 (citing <em>McLeod v. Threlkeld, </em>319 U.S. 491, 493-98, 63 S.Ct. 1248, 1249-1252, 87 L.Ed. 1538 (1943)); <em>see also </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 776.9-776.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In <em>McLeod v. Threlkeld, </em>a railroad company employed a cook to prepare and serve meals to workmen repairing the tracks. The cook sought unpaid overtime and minimum wages. 319 U.S. at 492 &amp; n. 1, 63 S.Ct. at 1249 &amp; n. 1. The Supreme Court concluded that the cook was not \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d for purposes of FLSA coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 497-98, 63 S.Ct. at 1252. The Supreme Court explained that only employees who were in the \u201cchannels of interstate commerce,\u201d such as operating or maintaining transportation facilities, and not \u201cthose who merely affected that commerce,\u201d were covered by the \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d provision of the FLSA. <em>Id. </em>at 493-94, 63 S.Ct. at 1249-1250; <em>see also </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 776.11(c) (stating that in <em>McLeod </em>the cook\u2019s work was \u201ctoo remote from interstate commerce or foreign commerce to establish coverage on the ground that the employee performing it is \u2018engaged in commerce\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">In 2006, this Court relied upon <em>McLeod </em>and subsequent agency regulations to conclude that an employee was not \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d for purposes of the FLSA\u2019s individual coverage. <em>Thome, </em>448 F.3d at 1266. The employee in <em>Thome </em>performed mold and water damage restoration for residential and commercial properties. <em>Id. </em>at 1265. Several times a week, the employee purchased materials for his job using his employer\u2019s Home Depot credit card. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that: (1) there was no evidence that the employee worked for an instrumentality of interstate commerce; and (2) even assuming his use of the credit card constituted a use of an instrumentality of interstate commerce, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>had not produced sufficient evidence that these transactions involved interstate activity. <em>Id. </em>at 1266-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Here, Martinez presented no evidence that he was \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d as that phrase has been interpreted by the Supreme Court, this Court and the Department of Labor. Martinez did not work for an instrumentality of interstate commerce, but for a small, locally-owned Chinese restaurant. Given that the cook in <em>McLeod, </em>whose work was tangentially related to an instrumentality of interstate commerce (the railroads), was not \u201cengaged in commerce,\u201d it is difficult to see how Martinez, a cook in a public restaurant, could qualify for this particular type of FLSA coverage. Martinez admitted that he did not use the telephone, Internet or mail as part of his duties. And there is no evidence that Martinez was required to travel across state lines or to transport materials that were moving in interstate commerce. <em>Cf. Brennan v. Wilson Bldg., Inc., </em>478 F.2d 1090, 1095 (5th Cir.1973)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (concluding that the phrase \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d extends to elevator operators who regularly transported interstate mail and freight shipments through an office building).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Martinez points out that, since <em>McLeod, </em>Congress has expanded the FLSA\u2019s coverage by adding enterprise coverage and providing that household domestic service employees are covered by the FLSA\u2019s overtime and minimum wage requirements. <em>See </em>Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1961, Pub.L. No. 87-30, \u00a7 5, 75 Stat. 65, 67 (May 5, 1961) (adding enterprise coverage to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 206 and 207); Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974, Pub.L. No. 93-259, \u00a7 7, 88 Stat. 55, 62 (Apr. 8, 1974) (adding coverage for household domestic service employees, codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 206(f), 207(0). While we agree that these amendments added to the FLSA\u2019s coverage, we reject Martinez\u2019s claim that these amendments altered the FLSA\u2019s existing individual coverage or abrogated <em>McLeod\u2019s </em>interpretation of \u201cengaged in commerce.\u201d In any event, we are bound to follow <em>Thorne, </em>which postdates these amendments and adheres to <em>McLeod\u2019s </em>statutory interpretation. <em>See Robinson v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>595 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir.2010) (explaining that \u201cwe are bound to follow a prior binding precedent unless and until it is overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">We also reject Martinez\u2019s contention that our conclusion \u201cexempts\u201d all restaurant cooks from the FLSA\u2019s overtime and minimum wage provisions. We conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>only that, given Martinez\u2019s particular duties as a cook at Jade Palace and the record in this case, he was not \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d for purposes of individual coverage under the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">For these reasons, the district court properly granted summary judgment to Defendant Jade Palace on Martinez\u2019s FLSA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-12\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment, construing all facts and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Walters v. Am. Coach Lines of Miami, Inc., </em>575 F.3d 1221, 1226 (11th Cir.2009). Summary judgment is proper when \"the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\">. In a separate summary judgment order, the district court concluded that Martinez was not entitled to enterprise coverage under the FLSA. Martinez does not appeal that ruling. On appeal, Martinez concedes that enterprise coverage does not apply because Jade Palace did not have at least $500,000 in gross revenues during the years he worked at the restaurant. <em>See 29 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 203(s)( 1 )(A)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b267-8\">. In the district court, Martinez did not argue that he \u201cengaged ... in the production of goods for commerce\u201d in performing his duties as Jade Palace\u2019s cook. Martinez's appellate brief also does not assert that argument. Accordingly, we do not address the issue. <em>See McGinnis v. Ingram Equip. Co., Inc., </em>918 F.2d 1491, 1495 (11th Cir.1990) (explaining that issues not raised in the trial court generally are not addressed on appeal); <em>Tanner Adver. Group, LLC v. Fayette Cnty., </em>451 F.3d 777, 787 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that issues not plainly and prominently raised in the opening brief are considered abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b268-6\">. This Court adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit prior to October 1, 1981. <em>Bonner </em>v. <em>City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b268-7\">. Although Martinez's summary judgment brief asserted that, as part of Martinez's duties, he handled food products and tools that had traveled in commerce, Martinez provided no evidence to support this assertion. In any event, even assuming this assertion is true, it does not change our individual coverage analysis. <em>See Thorne, </em>448 F.3d at 1267 (explaining that, in an individual coverage case, the fact that a manual laborer bought job supplies, such as tools, that had traveled in interstate commerce \u201cat a previous time\u201d did not \u201cin itself implicate interstate commerce\u201d because once goods \"reach the customer for whom they were intended, the interstate journey ends and employees engaged in any further <em>intra </em>state movement of the goods are not covered under the Act\u201d); <em>cf. Polycarpe v. E &amp; S Landscaping Serv., Inc., </em>616 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2010) (explaining that, in an enterprise coverage case, the \"coming to rest\u201d doctrine does not apply and the \"handling clause\u201d \u201callow[s] the FLSA potentially to reach retail and service businesses that were otherwise locally focused\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
