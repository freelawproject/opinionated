PFA initially brought the foreclosure action in Georgia state court, but Obande filed a notice of removal in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, arguing that removal was proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441 and 1443.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">In contending that the district court erred in granting PFA\u2019s motion to remand, Obande makes two main arguments. First she argues that the district court had removal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1441 based on diversity of citizenship. Second she argues that removal was proper under \u00a7 1443(1) because she alleged that her Seventh Amendment and Due Process Clause rights were violated by Georgia\u2019s dispossessory laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>the question of whether a district court had removal jurisdiction. <em>Henson v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., </em>261 F.3d 1065, 1068 (11th Cir.2001). <em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-16\">As a general rule, we cannot review a district court\u2019s decision remanding a case to state court. <em>Hernandez v. Seminole County, Fla., </em>334 F.3d 1233, 1235 (11th Cir.2003); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). That rule, which is codified in \u00a7 1447(d), applies when the district court concludes that it \u201clack[s] removal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1441 [because] the case is not one over which the court has original jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Cogdell v. Wyeth, </em>366 F.3d 1245, 1248 (11th Cir.2004). Section 1447(d), however, expressly exempts from its coverage certain civil rights cases removed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) (permitting appellate review of \u201can order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1443 of this title\u201d). Where an appellant\u2019s challenge to a district court\u2019s remand order is based on the court\u2019s having removal jurisdiction under both \u00a7\u00a7 1441 and 1443, we have dismissed the appeal to the extent it challenged the remand order based on \u00a7 1441 but allowed it to proceed to the extent it challenged the court\u2019s determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>tion that removal based on \u00a7 1443 was improper. <em>Alabama v. Conley, </em>245 F.3d 1292, 1293 n. 1 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Under \u00a7 1443, a defendant may remove an action if it is brought \u201c[ajgainst any person who is denied or cannot enforce in the courts of such State a right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or of all persons within the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(1). A removal petition filed under \u00a7 1443 must satisfy the two-prong test set out in <em>Georgia v. Rachel, </em>384 U.S. 780, 792, 794, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 1790, 1791, 16 L.Ed.2d 925 (1966). \u201cFirst, the petitioner must show that the right upon which the petitioner relies arises under a federal law \u2018providing for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Conley, </em>245 F.3d at 1295 (quoting <em>Rachel, </em>384 U.S. at 792, 86 S.Ct. at 1790). \u201cSecond, the petitioner must show that he has been denied or cannot enforce that right in the state courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A defendant\u2019s reliance on broad constitutional or statutory provisions does not support removal under \u00a7 1443 when those provisions \u201care phrased in terms of general application available to all persons or citizens, rather than in the specific language of racial equality that section 1443 demands.\u201d <em>Rachel, </em>384 U.S. at 792, 86 S.Ct. at 1790 (holding that \u201cthe defendants\u2019 broad contentions under the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment cannot support a valid claim for removal under \u00a7 1443\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">We dismiss Obande\u2019s appeal to the extent it challenges the district court\u2019s remand order under \u00a7 1441. That determination is not reviewable by this Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). And although we may review Obande\u2019s claim that removal was proper under \u00a7 1443(1), removal of her- case was not authorized under that statute because Obande did not assert that the state court proceedings would violate a federal law providing for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality. Accordingly, we dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">DISMISSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
