McGarrity and Nicholas S. More appeal from a determination of the State Civil Service Commission which affirmed the results of a promotional examination (written and oral) taken by them for the position of Principal Probation Officer I, Essex County. Appellant Robert J. DiGiovanna appeals from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>determination of the Commission which affirmed his failure on an oral promotional examination held for the position of Assistant Chief Probation Officer, Essex County. The two appeals, involving as they do two different factual situations, will be treated separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">\n<em>As to McGarrity and Fiore</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">On March 30, 1973 the State Department of Civil Service issued a promotional announcement (with application form) for the title of Principal Probation Officer I in the Probation Department of Essex County. The announcement set forth a \u201cscoring code\u201d of \u201c01\u201d which was defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">Seniority and record of service: 3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">Written and/or Oral Test: <em>7</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">(If both tests are held the weights will be: Written Test: 4; Oral Test: 3.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">McGarrity and Eiore filed their applications and were duly notified of a written examination, which they took on June 38, 1973. About 11 weeks later, on September 10, 1973, they received notice of an oral examination scheduled for September 31, 1973. On the written examination Eiore finished second with a score of 80.896 and McGarrity finished third with a score of 77.491. On the oral examination each received a score of 75, which was next to the lowest score (70) of those who passed the examination. With an experience or seniority score of 71.603 Eiore\u2019s final average for the overall promotional examination was 76.338. With an experience or seniority score of 75.149 McGarrity\u2019s final average for the overall examination was 76.040. Accordingly, of the ten successful candidates, Eiore placed seventh on the eligibility list and McGarrity placed eighth. After the results were issued and the promotional list promulgated, McGarrity and Eiore appealed within the Department of Civil Service and were notified that the results of the ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>animation would, in accordance with <em>N. J. A. G. </em>4:1-8.15, be subject to an administrative review by the Civil Service Commission, and that the record to be presented to the Commission could be inspected and supplemented \u201cwith factual material or written argument within two weeks.\u201d Within an extended period of time written material was submitted. On February 5, 1974 the Commission considered the appeals. By letter of February 20, 1974 from the Chief Examiner and Secretary of the Department of Civil Service appellants\u2019 attorney was notified of the Commission\u2019s findings and its \u201cfinal administrative determination\u201d upholding the scores obtained and dismissing the appeals. Its findings of fact were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">1. The appointing authority provided standard information as to the duties of the position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">2. The appointing authority was not consulted after the written test was given nor did the appointing authority in any way influence the decision to hold an oral test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">8. The decision to hold an oral test for Principal Probation Officer I, was proper and consistent with Civil Service procedures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">4. The delay between the written and oral portions of the examination was due to administrative pressures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">5. The scoring methods of the Department of Civil Service are correct and equitable; there is no statistical error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">Thereafter appellants sought to reopen the matter \u201cfor additional testimony so that a full record\u201d could be made. Their request for a plenary hearing before the Commission was denied. They were informed by the Department that \u201cCivil Service law and rules, specifically <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>11:9-6 and <em>N. J. A. O. </em>4:1-8.15, provided only for a review of the record by the Commission in appeals such as the instant one,\u201d and that \u201cSince the appellants have been afforded due process in accordance with law there is no basis for reopening this appeal.\u201d On their appeal to this court appellants contend that (1) the Commission was required, in announcing the promotional examination, to specifically set forth at that time, and not at a later time, whether the examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>would be only written or both written and oral; (2) after being notified of the results of the promotional examination they were, at their request, entitled to a plenary hearing before the Commission, and (3) \"the method of grading the examinations was so arbitrary, capricious, or conspicuously unreasonable so as to require the nullification of the examination results.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">The Chief Examiner and Secretary, in his letter of February 20, 1974, commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">It is standard procedure of the Department of Civil Service to hold an oral test in a promotional situation in which more than five candidates are admitted to the written test *\u25a0**\u2666\u2019.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">This being so, the \"standard procedure\u201d should have been implemented by a prompt announcement by the Department of the holding of an oral test. The announcement should have been made at or immediately after the holding of the written test when it was definitely established that \u201cmore than five candidates\u201d had been admitted to the written test. However, the delay in making the announcement does not, in the circumstances, require reversal. Appellants are not shown to have been prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">There remains, however, a <em>tona fide </em>dispute between McGarrity and Fiore and the Department as to the reasonableness of the method of grading used. McGarrity and Fiore claim that the method used resulted in discrimination against them. They were entitled to a plenary hearing on that detailed claim, with specific findings and conclusions to be made by the Commission. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>11:5-1(d); <em>N. J. A. C. </em>4:1\u20143.5(a) (9) (i) and (ii); 4:1-5.1; 4:1-5.11; <em>Flanagan v. Civil Service Dep\u2019t, </em>29 <em>N. J. </em>1, 13-14 (1959); <em>Jersey City v.

Super. </em>98 (App. Div. 1955):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">* * * the judiciary is not disposed to engage in a critical supervisory examination of the composition of the questions to be propounded to candidates in promotional tests conducted by the Department of Civil Service, or to exercise an appellate review of the scoring of the answers and other like administrative functions delegated most liberally to the authorized examiners of the Department by the Legislature. The courts, however, will intervene to nullify such an examination where it is affirmatively shown to have been manifestly corrupt, arbitrary, capricious, or conspicuously unreasonable. * * <em>* </em>[at 105]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">These basic guidelines, however, do not sanction summary dismissal by the Commission of a candidate\u2019s detailed claim of discrimination, in a general finding that \"The scoring methods of the Department of Civil Service are correct and equitable: there is no statistical error.\u201d <em>Cf. Kelly v. Civil Service Comm\u2019n, </em>31 <em>N. J. </em>450, 457 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">\n<em>As to BiCiovanna</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">On January 12, 1913 the Department of Civil Service issued a promotional announcement (with application form) for the title of Assistant Chief Probation Officer in the Probation Department of Essex County. The announcement set forth a \"scoring code\u201d of \u201c03\u201d which was defined as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">Seniority and record of service: 2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-10\">Written and/or Oral Test: 8</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-11\">(If both tests are held the weights will be: Written Test: 5; Oral Test: 3.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">DiGiovanna filed his application. No written examination was given. An oral examination was administered to DiGiovanna and five other candidates on July 11, 1913. DiGiovanna received a final grade of 60. He protested the manner in which the examination had been conducted. In essence he charged discrimination in that (1) he had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>examined by only two examiners while each of the other five candidates had three, and (2) the examiner who was absent from his examination was the only one of the three examiners \u201cwho had any knowledge of the position\u201d for which he was tested. He also raised the possibility (later withdrawn) that \u201cthere had been a mixup in the tapes and that the grade of 60 may have been someone else\u2019s.\u201d He was advised that there appeared to be no sound basis for his protest. He appealed within the Department of Civil Service. He was notified that in accordance with <em>N. J. A. 0. </em>4:1-8.15 the matter would be presented to the Civil Service Commission for a review and that he could submit \u201cwritten argument and factual material\u201d for the Commission\u2019s consideration. He submitted a letter brief, pointing out, among other things, that he and Elias Saltman, the examiner who withdrew from participating in the oral test given to him, had a few months before:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\">* * * had a difference of opinion, in front of other persons at a State Advisory Council Training session held in Princeton, New Jersey. As the representative of Essex County to the Council, I was present for his address to the group and pointed out his lack of knowledge of some New Jersey problems as a result of only recently coming from New York.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The Commission upheld DiGiovanna\u2019s failure on the examination, finding that \u201cMr. Saltman had excused himself [as an examiner] without any comment at all\u201d; that, accordingly, Cihe did not prejudice the examination\u201d; that \u201cthe absence of Mr. Saltman did not deprive the examining board of all technical expertise since Ms. W. Chevers, Assistant Director of Probation, City of New York, was still present,\u201d and that \u201cthe comments of the examiners\u201d on DiGiovanna\u2019s answers to the six questions comprising the oral test \u201cwere sufficiently accurate and did warrant failure.\u201d On this appeal DiGiovanna contends that he was entitled to a plenary hearing before the Commission on his charge of discrimination. We agree. The oral promotional test given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>to the candidates was required to be, \u201cas far as practicable,\u201d <em>competitive. N. J. Const. </em>(1947), <em>Art. </em>VII, \u00a71, par. 2. Thus, <em>on </em>DiGiovanna\u2019s appeal to the Commission, the inquiry should have been (1) whether the appellant was tested under conditions similar to those prevailing at the testing of the other candidates, and (2) whether his performance at the examination was measured by the same standards and criteria as that of the other candidates. See <em>Kelly v. Civil Service </em>Comm\u2019n, supra, 37 <em>N. J. </em>at 461. By contrast, the Commission\u2019s summary disposition, without directing its attention to these issues, was entirely inadequate. A remand to the Department for a plenary hearing in the matter with specific findings and conclusions to be made by the Commission is, accordingly, required. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>11:5-l(d); <em>N. J. A. C. </em>4:1-5.1; 4:1-5.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Each of the matters herein is remanded to the Department of Civil Service for a plenary hearing and specific findings and conclusions, in accordance with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
