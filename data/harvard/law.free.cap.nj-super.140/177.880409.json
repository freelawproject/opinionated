J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ABA\">Plaintiff appeals from an order denying her motion to set aside a dismissal previously entered upon her stipulation. While the trial judge did not expressly say so, it is clear that he refused to restore the matter solely because of his conviction that the statute of limitations had run. An understanding of the delicate policy-questions involved requires reference to the procedural facts, which do not appear to be the subject of any real dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">It is alleged that on January 8, 1972 Louis Kahn maliciously assaulted plaintiff Corinne Miller. On November 30, 1973, 22 months after the alleged assault and well within any two-year statute of limitation, Miller filed her complaint and a summons issued three days later. This summons was never served on defendant because on December 18, 1973 he died. On January 2, 1974, still within the two-year statute of limitation in any event, plaintiff amended her complaint to assert the surviving complaint against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>estate. Service on the executor for the estate was accomplished on January 23, 1974. Letters testamentary issued on February 21, 1974, and on March 13, 1974, following the filing of a stipulation extending time to answer, the executor answered by way of a general denial and the assertion, among other affirmative defenses, of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>3A: 12-5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\">To enable executors or administrators to examine into the condition of the estate and to ascertain the amount and value thereof and the debts to be paid therefrom, no action, except for funeral expenses, shall be brought or maintained against executors or administrators within 6 months after letters testamentary or of administration have been granted, as the case may be, unless by special leave of the court wherein the action is brought; and, if such leave is given, no execution shall issue within the said period of 6 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">It is now of course obvious as a matter of hindsight that plaintiff should have sought \u201cspecial leave of the court\u201d under the circumstances. However, in order not to offend the statute or its policy of providing the executor with time to get organized, plaintiff instead consented to dismiss her complaint \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">On June 7, 1974 plaintiff filed a motion, returnable July 12, 1974 (but, for reasons which do not appear, not heard until September 13, 1974) seeking to have the dismissal vacated. The judge treated the motion as one complicated by \u201ca serious question as to whether or not, in fact, the statute of limitations did run,\u201d and declined to vacate the dismissal. He suggested thereafter that the statute question be tested by the filing of a new complaint and an assertion of the statute of limitations as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">In this determination we believe the judge went wide of the mark in two respects. First, if the motion might have been otherwise decided had the limitations question been resolved in favor of plaintiff, then the limitation questions should have been decided on this motion. There seems little reason to subject plaintiff to the further expense and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>trouble of instituting a new action, especially in the circumstances of this case where her prior conduct, though shortsighted and perhaps somewhat careless, was directed toward compliance with the policy of the law rather than in disregard for the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">But more to the point, we believe the judge was lured into a misconception of that which was before him. He was not really called upon to decide a pure statute of limitation question, with its corollary issue of waiver and with a consciousness of the \u201cequitable nature\u201d of this doctrine of repose. <em>Lopez v. Swyer, 62 N. J. </em>267, 275 (1973). Bather, he had before him the problem as to whether a voluntary dismissal is subject to being set aside under <em>B. </em>4:50-1 for any of the reasons given there, there being no question that the stipulation amounted to \u201ca final * * * proceeding,\u201d as that phrase is used in the rule. In the event he had answered that inquiry in the affirmative, as we do below, then he had the further question as to whether that should b'e done in the circumstances of this case. Plaintiffs failure to make specific reference to the rule \u2014 the source of the court\u2019s prerogative, if any, in such case \u2014 and defendant\u2019s emphasis on the statute of limitations unquestionably led the court astray.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Historically, consideration of <em>B. </em>4:50-1 has resounded with assurances of a purpose of equity and justice, at least with respect to judgments and orders of the court. <em>Greenberg v. Owens, </em>31 N. <em>J. </em>402 (1960). The rule has been said to be one with \u201cboundaries * * * as expansive as the need to achieve equity and justice.\u201d <em>Court Invest. Co. v. Perillo, </em>48 <em>N. J. </em>334, 341 (1966). With regard to the vacation of default judgments, for instance, \u201cour courts have held that great liberality should be allowed,\u201d <em>Foster v. New Albany Machine &amp; Tool Co., </em>63 <em>N. J. Super. </em>262, 269-270 (App. Div. 1960) and \u201cevery reasonable ground for indulgence * * * tolerated to the end that a just result is reached.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number><em>Marder v. Realty Construction Co., </em>84 <em>N. </em>J. Super 313, 319 (App. Div. 1964), aff\u2019d 43 <em>N. J. </em>508 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"> If-the purpose of the:.rule is'to be maintained, we see no' reason-why a voluntary;act,, as .'here, intended to-be compliant (as far as the statute is concerned-), should be less sjunpathetically treated than &amp;\u25a0. judgment by default which, by definition, involves noncompliance;. We hold, therefore, that the fact that a prior dismissal is voluntary does not in and of itself justify a denial of relief - under <em>R; </em>4:50-l. Rather, the court should on each occasion examine the circumstances in order to divine the course most likely to assure justice and equity to and as between all parties, all within guidelines previously set. <em>Bauer v. Griffin, </em>104 <em>N. J. Super. </em>530 (Law Div. 1969), aff\u2019d 108 <em>N. J. Super. </em>414 (App. Div. 1970), certif. den. 56 <em>N. J. </em>245 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">. This is so even though the statute of limitations may have run in the meantime, for if there is good cause within the sound discretion of the trial judge to set aside a prior dismissal, the action will in any event revert to the pleadings in the status prevailing at the time of and just before the dismissal. See <em>State v. Public Service Elec. &amp; Gas Co., </em>119 <em>N. J. Super. </em>264 (Ch. Div. 1972). The passage of time and the running of the statute of limitation may well be among the several factors to be considered in the balancing that is required of a judge on such a motion. But these are not necessarily controlling. The rule has long been said to be one of the exercise of \u201cthe sound discretion of the trial court, guided by equitable principles,\u201d and that exercise of discretion will be sustained absent an abuse thereof. <em>Hodgson v. Applegate, </em>31 <em>N. J. </em>29, 37 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Defendant, claiming in its brief that a voluntary dismissal binds plaintiff irrevocably for all time and in the face of all circumstance, refers to this as \u201cthe law of this State for over 150 years,\u201d citing -for this particular proposition only <em>Murray v. M\u2019Dougall, </em>3 <em>N. J. L. </em>512 (Sup. Ct. 1812). We recognize that we, as an intermediate'appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>court, are bound by precedent from our court of last resort, <em>In re Education Ass\u2019n of Passaic, Inc., </em>117 <em>N. J. Super. </em>255, 261 (App. Div. 1971), certif. den. 60 <em>N. J. </em>198 (1972).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nonetheless, we are satisfied that this technical one-sentence pronouncement, dissented to by one of the three members of the court and never cited in the officially reported cases in New Jersey in the 164 years which have since transpired, has not survived the enlightened advancement of our rules of practice and procedure generated by the philosophy engendered in the 1948 revision. In such case, it is our privilege and our profound obligation \u201cto divine, as best [we] can, what would be the event of an appeal\u201d from us to our Supreme Court in this case. <em>Roadway Express Inc. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, 50 N. J. </em>471, 475 (1967), app. dism. 390 <em>U. S. </em>745, 88 <em>S. Ct. </em>1443, 20 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 276 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">We add for the sake of clarity that our determination that an application for relief under <em>R. </em>4:50-1 should be undertaken in the usual course, despite the fact that the dismissal was voluntary and the statute of limitation may have run, does not imply any view as to whether that relief should or should not be granted. As we observed above, this should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>be left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and we propose to leave it that way here.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">We reverse the order from which this appeal is taken and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing. Should contested issues of relevant fact develop, the matter should not be determined on affidavits, but a plenary hearing should be afforded. <em>Hallberg v. Hallberg, </em>113 <em>N. J. Super. </em>205 (App. Div. 1971). At the conclusion of proceedings below, whether by plenary hearing or otherwise, the determination should be accompanied by adequately detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law. We do not retain jurisdiction. No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Only reported cases from the Supreme Court of Judicature appear among the officially reported cases for 1812. 3 <em>N. J. h. </em>The Constitution of 1776, extant in 1812, provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">IX. Court of appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">That the governor and council (seven whereof shall be a quorum) be the court of appeals in the last resort in all causes of law as heretofore; and that they possess the power of granting pardons to criminals after condemnation, in all cases of treason, felony or other offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">Its jurisdiction extended to matters of equity in 3799, this \u201ccourt of appeals\u201d was not perpetuated in the Constitution of 1844. Instead there was there created the Court of Errors and Appeals. Art. VI, \u00a7 II. While it would appear, then, that the Supreme Court of Judicature was not in fact the court of last resort in 1812, we have accorded it that deference here, in the circumstances of there being no reported decisions from the 1776 \u201ccourt of last resort,\u201d so that we may not bo thought to have under-evaluated this reported case properly brought to our attention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
