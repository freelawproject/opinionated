A. M.,\u201d etc., and the theory of appellant\u2019s claim is that the corpus of the legacy is not the sum named in gross but the income and that the latter must therefore be protected from diminution by taxes during the whole period of the trust. But this is a very strained construction, not within the natural meaning of the words or any apparent intent of the testator. The thing given was tl^e definite sum named. That was the legacy on which the taxes were to be paid out of the estate, and which was to be paid over in full without deduction. What the testator says about income is not by way of gift but by way of direction to the trustee what to do with the' gift. He did not give whatever money might be necessary to produce a definite income, free from deduction for taxes, but a definite sum free from deductions at the time of payment, but necessarily contingent as to income upon the rate of interest obtainable and the taxes that may or may not be imposed on the investment. These the testator could not anticipate with any certainty and his will shows no intention to provide for.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
