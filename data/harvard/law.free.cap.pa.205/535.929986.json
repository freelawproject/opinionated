At the time of his employment he stated to a representative of his client that the cost of the litigation might be as much as $50,000. During the progress of the litigation he was paid certain fees. Before the end of the litigation the client who lived in France sent to the attorney the sum of $20,000. A formal receipt was given for the money which simply stated that the attorney had received the amount of the order. Shortly afterwards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>the attorney wrote to his client a letter in French, in which he used the following language: \u201c Je vous dois mille remerciements pour la fac\u00f3n genereuse dont vous avez daigne regler mes honoraires.\u201d The letter as sent had been corrected by the attorney\u2019s French teacher. The sentence as originally written by the attorney was follows: \u201cJe vous dois mille remerciements poir votre genereux paiement.\u201d The evidence as to the meaning of the word \u201c regler\u201d was not uniform. Some of the witnesses testified that it meant \u201cpay\u201d and others that it meant \u201csettle.\u201d The trial judge construed the word to mean \u201c pay\u201d and refused to permit the French teacher, who had corrected the letter, to testify that it meant \u201c payment on account.\u201d The court charged that the payment of $20,000 was a payment in full to the date of the payment, and that nothing could be recovered, except for services rendered after that date. The testimony of a number of leading members of the bar was that the services rendered during the whole litigation were worth $100,000. The jury returned a verdict for an amount which showed that it covered merely services rendered after the payment of the $20,000, and judgment was entered on the verdict. On appeal the six judges of the Supreme Court who heard the argument were equally divided in opinion whether or not the testimony should have been received and the case left to the jury, and the judgment was affirmed.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b562-4\">Argued Jan. 23, 1903.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ak6\">Appeal, No. 236, Jan.

Carroll Brewster, Esq., was retained by Rosalie Parant Coleman to represent her in a very important and extensive litigation in the estates of her husband and son. The principal involved was about $1,750,000. A number of leading members of the bar testified that a fee of $100,000 for all the services rendered was reasonable. During the progress of the litigation and until April 26, 1898, Mr. Brewster received about $9,000 in fees. On May 16, 1898, he received from his client, who lived in France, an order for $20,000. For this he sent a formal receipt, simply stating that he had received the amount of the order. On May 20, 1898, he sent to his client the following letter:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>No. 214 West Washington Square, Phila.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-3\">May 20, 1898.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-4\">Ma Chere Madame :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-5\">Je vous dois mille remerciements pour la fa\u00a7on g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse dont vous avez daign\u00e9 regler mes honoraires.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-6\">J\u2019ai l\u2019honneur de vous announcer que vous avez gagn\u00e9 une grande victoire (non seulement contre M.

The conversation was begun by myself. 1 said to Judge Brewster: \u2018This is going to be an expensive litigation, and I should like to have some idea \u2014 not a definite idea, still an idea as near as you could possibly give me \u2014 as to what the cost of this litigation to Mrs. Coleman would be, taking into consideration your services and the services of Messrs. Coudert Brothers.\u2019 lie said, \u2018How much would you think ? \u2019 I said, \u2018 Well, I suppose it will be some twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars,\u2019 and he said it would be more than that. I said: \u2018 How much, do you put it at \u2014 how much do you think it would cost ? \u2019 \u2018 Well,\u2019 he said, \u2018 it might be as much as fifty thousand dollars.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-7\">The court charged as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-8\">Under the law, the trial of a common-law issue such as this is, in a court, involves the discharge of certain duties on the part of the judge and certain other and distinct duties on the part of the jury. To the judge is committed the duty of ruling upon questions of law arising during the progress of the case; to the jury is given exclusively the duty of deciding upon questions of fact. I have ruled upon numerous question of law during the presentation of the evidence ; and since the evidence was all in I have ruled upon a question of law, which largely diminishes the duties cast upon you as triers of fact. [I have ruled, as a matter of law, that the receipt or acknowledgment sent by Judge Brewster to his client in May of 1898, was in point of fact a receipt or acknowledgment of the payment of a sum of money satisfactory to him, for his services rendered for his client, up to April 11, 1898, and that his executor has therefore no right to recover from Mrs. Coleman anything for his services rendered back of that date. This leaves then, for you, the simple question \u2014 I won\u2019t say the \u201csimple question \u201d in the sense of its being trivial, but it leaves for you the sole question \u2014 What is the just and reasonable compensation to be awarded to Judge Brewster\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>estate, for Ms services from that time down to the time of his death.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-4\">I have no desire whatever to even hint to you what my views with regard to Judge Brewster\u2019s compensation are; it is for you to settle that question. You have, to guide you, the testimony, which has been most carefully taken throughout this case ; and you have the arguments of counsel that have been made in presenting the views of either side, as to what should be your verdict in this case. I feel convinced that if I attempted to go over in detail the basis of the compensation to be made by the jury, I would rather retard or hinder you than I would aid you. I shall therefore leave the question to you, saying to you that, under my ruling on the law, you are limited to awarding compensation to the executor of Judge Brewster\u2019s estate for his legal services on behalf of Mrs. Coleman, from April 11, 1898, down to the time of his death. Whatever sum you find to be just and reasonable compensation for those services you will award to the executor, in this suit the plaintiff, with interest from the time of suit brought, July 12-, 1900.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-5\">The plaintiff has asked me to charge you, gentlemen, as matters of law, that:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-6\">1. The verdict of the jury should be in favor of the plaintiffs for the value of the services rendered by Judge Brewster during the entire litigation, less the payments made on account of such services and with legal interest on the balance. <em>Answer : </em>I decline that point, that is to say, I say to you that that is not, in my view of the case, the law on the subject. [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-7\">2. Even if the jury believe that at some time in the summer of 1894, 1895 or 1896, Jitdge Brewster said to J. Coleman Drayton that the fees and costs of the litigation \u201c might be as much as 150,000,\u201d such statement will not deprive his estate of the right to recover for the actual value of the services rendered by him to the defendant, less the payments made on account of such services, and with legal interest on the balance. <em>Answer: </em>I have already said to you, gentlemen, that his estate has not the right to recover for the actual value of the services rendered by him to the defendant (less the payment made on account of the actual value of the services rendered by him) after April 11,1898, he having been settled with, by bis client, upon a basis satisfactory to him for services up to the end of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>the will case. I think it just, however, to say (though the point does not require me to say it to you) that you are not compelled to be guided by the statement of Mr. Drayton as to what Judge Brewster told him, in 1894,1895 or 1896, might be the expenses of the litigation. It did not rise to the dignity of a bargain; it was the expression of an opinion, and it may have been some guide to the client, but if the client desired to pin her lawyer down to a fixed and definite sum she should have contracted it. She not having done so, it becomes pertinent evidence simply as aiding you in determining what should be the quantum of the fee for Judge Brewster\u2019s services. [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-3\">3. The letter of May 20, 1898, will not operate to deprive plaintiffs of the right to recover the actual value of the services rendered by Judge Brewster to the defendant, less the payments made on account of such services, and with legal interest on the balance. <em>Answer: </em>That, of course, raises the point, in this case, upon which I have ruled against the plaintiff. I therefore decline that point. [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-4\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $12,164.17.
