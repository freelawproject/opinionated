He had therefore interposed this, in order to have the question settled. The ground taken was, that the Code, under which the complaint was filed, was unconstitutional.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b16-11\">Edmonds, <em>J.:</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0P\">In what respect is the Code alleged to be unconstitutional ?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b16-12\">\n<em>Gould,:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arf\">The commissioners exceeded the authority conferred upon them by the statute appointing them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b16-13\">Edmonds, <em>J.:</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiM\">That can be of no consequence. The only question is, whether the legislature exceeded its authority.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b16-14\">\n<em>Gould:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asn\">It is alleged that it did so in abolishing the distinction between law and equity, while the Constitution expressly recognized that distinction.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b16-15\">Edmonds, <em>J.:</em></author>\n<p id=\"AG8\">The Code abolishes the distinction only as to form; only as to the mere practice. The great principles of law and equity, as they existed in our jurisprudence at the adoption of our Constitution, are untouched. Besides, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>power of altering the common law, in any respect, is expressly conferred upon the legislature by the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-5\">As at present advised I must overrule the demurrer as frivolous.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
