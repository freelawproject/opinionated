On the 23d August, 1848, the defendant\u2019s attorney searched in the office, and found that the record had not been signed by the clerk, and he then gave notice of motion to set aside the judgment on that ground. The record was subsequently -signed by the clerk, and no step in the cause had been taken since filing the judgment record.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-5\"><em>Kvrrney </em>moved to set aside the judgment.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-6\"><em>McMahon, </em>opposing.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjY\">The record need not be signed at the time it is filed; but, even if it must, the indorsement is a sufficient signing. The defendant has waived the irregularity by his delay in making this motion. The omission is of the clerk, and not of the plaintiff, and the plaintiff ought not to suffer.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b38-7\">\n<em>Edmonds, J.,</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ATJ\">read the words of the statute, and said, as this record was not signed until after the 18th of August, although filed on the 5th June, the judgment is irregular, and must be set aside. I do not think the indorsement was a sufficient signature. The defendant\u2019s delay in making the motion cannot cure the defect, which is a violation of the express words of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
