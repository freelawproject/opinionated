I have consulted with my brethren on the bench, and they agree with me, that the allowance may be made in actions prosecuted by attachment against non-residents, as this has been, even although, as in this case, the action is on a money demand, and of the most ordinary character, and no defense is interposed. \u2022 The motion will therefore be granted to allow ten per cent on the amount of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Order accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
