W. Haight <em>&amp; </em>Co., had been doing business in Rochester, consisting of S. W. H., who was the active partner, and F. M. H., who was the cashier of a bank in Rochester, and not taking any active part in the affairs of the company. In 1841, F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>M. H. wrote to a person in New York that he was a partner in the concern. That letter was shown to the plaintiff, on the strength of which he sold to S. W, H. three bills of goods in 1841, \u201942, and \u201943, for the last of which this note was given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-5\">\u201e On the part of the defendants it was proved that in September,\" 1841, F.

M. H. was not a dormant partner, and therefore entitled to withdraw without notice. That if the plaintiff was a dealer with the firm of S. W. H. &amp; Co., knowing that F. M. H. was a partner, he was entitled to actual notice of the dissolution, in default of \u2022which F. M. H. was responsible to the plaintiff for any debt contracted in the name of the firm by the remaining partner, though after an actual dissolution. And if the jury believed that plaintiff had been such actual dealer, and had not received actual notice of the dissolution, their finding must be for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">Verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
