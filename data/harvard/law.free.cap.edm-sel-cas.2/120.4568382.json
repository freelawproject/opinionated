Where there is no dispute as to the facts, the want of probable cause is a question for the court. <em>(Masten </em>v. <em>Deyo, </em>2 Wend. 424; <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Weed, </em>17 Wend. 227; <em>Gorton </em>v. <em>De Angelis, </em>6 Wend. 421.) Want of probable cause defined. (1 Chit. Gen. Prac. 150; also, in <em>Foshay </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>2 Denio, 619.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-8\">\n<em>Edwards, J.:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aij\">The reason assigned by the circuit judge for the nonsuit granted by him, was, that the prosecution was not at an end.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-9\">It appears by the testimony that a recognizance was given, conditioned generally for the appearance of the plaintiff in this suit, at the then next court of the General Sessions of the Peace for the city and county of New York. This recognizance contained no reference to any particular charge which has been made against the plaintiff; and there is nothing except the names of the parties mentioned in it which could authorize the inference that it referred to the offense for which the plaintiff is alleged to have been maliciously prosecuted. It farther appears, by the testimony of a deputy clerk of the Court of General Sessions, that there was an indorsement upon the affidavits taken by the police magistrate before whom the complaint had been made in these words, <em>\u201c </em>Bail discharged, April 20th, 1848.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-10\">It is contended, on the part of the plaintiff, that this was sufficient proof that there was an end to the prosecution before the commencement of this suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-11\">In the case of <em>Morgan, </em>v. <em>Hughes </em>(2 Term R. 225), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>plaintiff alleged, in his declaration, that the defendant had maliciously and without probable cause-made a charge of felony against him before a justice of the peace, who had issued a warrant, under which the plaintiff had been arrested and compelled to undergo a long imprisonment, until a certain period mentioned, <em>when he was released cmd discharged from his sccid im/pi\u2019iscmment. </em>To this declaration there was a special demurrer, and one of the causes assigned was, that it did not appear, by the declaration, that the plaintiff had been tried or acquitted, or, by due course of law, discharged from the supposed felony and charge. Justice Bulles, in giving his opinion, says that \u201c stating that the plaintiff was <em>dischcurged </em>is not sufficient; it is not equal to the word acquitted, which has a definite meaning. When the word \u2018 acquitted \u2019 is used it must be understood in the legal sense, namely, by a jury on the trial. But there are various ways in which a man may be discharged from his imprisonment without putting an end to the suit. If, indeed,\u201d he further says, \u201c it had' been alleged that the plaintiff had been discharged by the grand jury\u2019s not finding the bill, that would have shown a legal end to the prosecution.\u201d So, in this case, the discharge of the secmdty given for the plaintiff\u2019s appearance, which is in all respects analagous to his discharge from imprisonment, did not show that there was- an end of the suit. The bail might have been discharged by a surrender of their principal, and- their discharge, without such surrender, would not have prevented the grand jury from finding a bill at any time before the offense became barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-5\">Nothing appears from which it could be said that the prosecution was at an end, and the circuit judge was right in granting a nonsuit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-6\">The motion for a new trial must be denied, with costs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b120-7\">\n<em>Edmonds, J.:</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ARS\">Independent of the ground on which, at - <em>Nisi .Prims, </em>I rested the nonsuit, there are other grounds sufficient to sustain <em>it; </em>and, even if I was wrong in holding that the discharge of the recognizance did not put an end to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>prosecution, I was right in granting the nonsuit, because there was no want of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">It is well settled that where there is no dispute as to facts, the question of probable cause is one solely for the determination of the court. It would have been erroneous for me to have submitted to the jury to determine whether there was a want of probable cause. That was a question which it was my duty to decide, and it is manifest to me now, on reviewing the testimony as spread out in the bill of exceptions, that there was no want of probable cause. .</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">It is therefore no matter whether the reasons which I gave for the nonsuit, on the trial, were well grounded, or not. The exception was not to my reasoning, but to the judgment of nonsuit which I ordered. The judgment was clearly right on other grounds, if not on that which I thus rested it, and it ought not be disturbed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
