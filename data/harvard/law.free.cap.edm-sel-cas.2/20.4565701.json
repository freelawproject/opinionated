This, I think, is irregular, and the motion must be denied, and with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-7\">The irregularity in this summons cannot be disregarded under section 145 of the Code, as immaterial, because that section relates to pleading, only, and not to process.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-8\">The.court may have power to amend the process, but that can only be done on a motion therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-9\">\u201c Motion denied with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
