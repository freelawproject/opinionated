KEVIN CASTEL, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b309-17\">Plaintiffs allege that, at the peak of the 2008 financial crisis, Bank of America Corporation (\u201cBofA\u201d) hastily agreed to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc. (\u201cMerrill\u201d), just as Merrill was careening toward insolvency. Plaintiffs assert that in the days and months that followed, the defendants concealed and misstated critical aspects of the transaction, specifically matters related to bonuses, staggering losses accrued in the fourth quarter of 2008, and pressure to consummate the acquisition from officials at the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-18\">This Memorandum and Order addresses six motions to dismiss directed to two different complaints. In the shareholders\u2019 direct action (the \u201cSecurities Action\u201d), a consolidated amended class action complaint asserts that defendants violated federal securities laws, and alleges claims on behalf of all persons who purchased or acquired BofA shares between September 15, 2008 and January 21, 2009 (the \u201cSecurities Complaint,\u201d or \u201cSec. Compl.\u201d). Plaintiffs in the derivative action (the \u201cDerivative Plaintiffs\u201d and the \u201cDerivative Action\u201d) assert, on behalf of nominal defendant BofA, claims under both the federal securities laws and state law. In addition to their derivative claims, the Derivative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Plaintiffs also assert a direct claim for breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">All Securities Defendants move to dismiss the Securities Complaint pursuant to Rules 9(b) and 12(b)(6), Fed.R.Civ.P., and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4 (the \u201cPSLRA\u201d). The BofA directors and the BofA officers named in the Derivative Complaint (together, the \u201cBofA Derivative Defendants\u201d) have moved to dismiss most of the claims pursuant to Rules 9(b), 12(b)(6) and 23.1. BofA, as nominal defendant, also has filed a motion to dismiss, and joins in the arguments of the BofA Derivative Defendants. The financial ad-visors retained by BofA in connection with the transaction (the \u201cFinancial Advisors\u201d) separately move to dismiss the four derivative claims asserted against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">While there are distinctions between the Securities Complaint and the Derivative Complaint, they share the same core allegations. They also share certain theories of liability under Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9. In discussing the two complaints\u2019 assertions under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78a, <em>et seq., </em>(the \u201c'34 Act\u201d) and Rule 14a-9, the allegations of each are separately analyzed. Elsewhere, when the complaints set forth different factual assertions and theories of liability, they are specifically denoted. No allegation in either complaint is imputed to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">For the reasons explained below, the motions to dismiss the Securities Complaint are granted in part and denied in part. The BofA Derivative Defendants\u2019 and BofA\u2019s motions to dismiss the Derivative Complaint are granted in part and denied in part. The Financial Advisors\u2019 motion to dismiss is granted in its entirety.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">BACKGROUND................................................................274</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">I.

Cherry St. LLC v. Hennessee Group LLC, </em>573 F.3d 98, 100 (2d Cir.2009); <em>see also Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>-U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949-50, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). As the non-movants, all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the plaintiffs. <em>United States v. City of New York, </em>359 F.3d 83, 91 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">A. <em>Parties to the Securities Action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-14\">BofA is a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in North Carolina. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 33.) It provides banking and non-banking financial services in the United States and internationally. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 33.) Its shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d). (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 33.) As of April 30, 2009, it had more than 6.4 billion shares of common stock outstanding. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 33.) Merrill is a financial services company incorporated in Delaware with its headquarters in New York. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 34.) It provides investment banking, research and wealth management services. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 34.) From the start of the class period through its acquisition by BofA on December 31, 2008, Merrill\u2019s shares traded on the NYSE. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-15\">On January 1, 2009, BofA closed the acquisition of Merrill, which then became a direct subsidiary of BofA. (Sec. Compl. If 34.) The acquisition was structured as a stock-for-stock transaction in which Merrill shareholders swapped each Merrill share in exchange for 0.8595 of a share of BofA\u2019s common stock. (Joint Proxy Cover Letter.) In order to consummate the transaction, BofA issued approximately 1.71 billion shares of common stock and 359,100 shares of preferred stock. (Joint Proxy Cover Letter.) BofA needed shareholder approval in order to issue the shares, which required, among other things, amendment to its certificate of incorporation. (Joint Proxy, Notice of Special Meeting.) BofA and Merrill often describe the transaction as a \u201cmerger,\u201d although it was not a merger in the true sense, and was instead a stock-for-stock acquisition of Merrill by BofA. Because the transactional documents and disclosures characterize the acquisition as a \u201cmerger,\u201d the Court will occasionally employ the parties\u2019 preferred terminology.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-18\">Defendant Kenneth Lewis was BofA\u2019s CEO, president, and chairman of the board of directors during the class period. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 35.) Lewis signed the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) governing the acquisition. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 35.) Lewis also signed the transmittal letter for BofA and Merrill\u2019s definitive joint proxy statement (the \u201cJoint Proxy\u201d), which was dated October 31, 2008 and filed with the SEC on November 3,2008. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 35.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-19\">Defendant Joe L. Price was BofA\u2019s CFO. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 36.) Defendant Neil A. Cotty was BofA\u2019s Chief Accounting Officer prior to the announcement of the acquisition; after the acquisition\u2019s announcement, he was appointed Merrill\u2019s interim CFO and functioned as a liaison between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>BofA and Merrill. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 37.) Defendant John A. Thain was CEO and chairman of the board of Merrill from the beginning of the class period through December 31, 2008. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 38.) From January 1, 2009 through the end of the class period, Thain was president of global banking, securities and wealth management at BofA. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">In addition to their claims against senior management of the two companies, the Securities Plaintiffs also bring claims against fifteen members of BofA\u2019s board of directors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39-53.) They assert claims under the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77a, <em>et seq. </em>(the \u201c'33 Act\u201d) against the underwriters of a secondary offering of BofA shares in October 2008. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 362-395.) Those two underwriter defendants are Banc of America Securities LLC (\u201cBanc of America\u201d), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BofA, and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated (\u201cMLPFS\u201d). (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 56-58.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The lead plaintiffs are public pension funds that owned shares of BofA common stock dining the class period. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-31.) Two of the lead plain-, tiffs, the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio and the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, purchased shares of BofA common stock as part of the company\u2019s secondary offering in October 2008, which forms the basis of the Complaint\u2019s '33 Act claims. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.)</p>\n<p id=\"Aqy\">B. <em>Parties to the Derivative Action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AnBi\">The Derivative Plaintiffs assert claims against all sixteen individuals who were BofA directors at the time of the Merrill acquisition, including Lewis (the \u201cBofA Directors\u201d). (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43-58.) Other than defendant Lewis, who was also BofA\u2019s Chairman and CEO during all relevant times, none of the directors were officers or employees of BofA. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43-58.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">In addition to Lewis, the Derivative Plaintiffs bring claims against a number of BofA officers, including Price, Cotty, BofA Vice Chairman for Corporate Planning and Strategy Gregory Curl, Chief Administrative Officer J. Steele Alphin, Global Risk Executive Amy Woods Brinkley, Brian T. Moynihan, head of Global Banking and Global Wealth and Investment Management and after December 10, 2008, General Counsel, Keith T. Banks, President of BofA\u2019s Global Wealth and Investment Management unit, Timothy Mayopoulos, General Counsel until December 10, 2008, and Associate General Counsel Teresa Brenner (the \u201cBofA Officers\u201d). (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 59-67.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System and Hollywood Police Officers\u2019 Retirement System are the interim lead plaintiffs in the Derivative Action. (MDL Docket #2.) They are citizens of Louisiana and Florida, respectively. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.) None of the BofA Officers or Directors is a citizen of Louisiana or Florida. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43-67.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The Derivative Plaintiffs assert claims against the Financial Advisors, J.C. Flowers &amp; Co. LLC (\u201cJ.C. Flowers\u201d) and Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller (USA) LLC (\u201cFPK\u201d). Each of the Financial Ad-visors provided the BofA board with an opinion that the consideration BofA paid for Merrill was fair, from a financial point of view, to BofA. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 83-84.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>According to the Derivative Complaint, J.C. Flowers and FPK are limited liability companies \u201corganized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware,\u201d with their \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d in New York. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">C. <em>Negotiations Leading wp to BofA\u2019s Acquisition of Merrill.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">On the morning of Saturday, September 13, 2008, Thain reached out to Lewis. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 4.) At that time, Thain was CEO of Merrill, and Lewis was CEO of BofA. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 4; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 9.) Thain believed that Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (\u201cLehman Brothers\u201d) would soon file for bankruptcy, resulting in market turmoil that \u201cwould cause severe liquidity issues\u201d for Merrill, beginning as early as the following Monday. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 4; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 98.) Thain believed that a Lehman Brothers bankruptcy would trigger Merrill\u2019s own \u201ccatastrophic\u201d collapse and \u201clikely render [Merrill] effectively insolvent\u201d on Monday. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 62; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 98.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">According to the Securities Complaint, Lewis \u201chad long coveted\u201d Merrill, and stated as much in press interviews. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 59.) Thain was aware of Lewis\u2019s interest, but previously rebuffed BofA\u2019s offers. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 63.) On Saturday morning, Lewis flew to New York, where he met Thain at 2:30 p.m. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 64; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 100.) Thain proposed selling a 9.9 percent stake of Merrill to BofA. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 64; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 100.) Lewis later recalled, \u201cI responded to John, \u2018That\u2019s not really what I have envisioned here. I want to buy the whole company, not invest 9 to 10 percent.\u2019 \u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 64.) The two eventually agreed that any transaction would entail BofA acquiring Merrill in full, and \u201clater that same day, teams from both firms began conducting due diligence and negotiating the terms of a possible merger.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">D. <em>Negotiations over Merrill\u2019s Bonus Pool.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">As talks unfolded over the weekend, bonuses to Merrill employees became a major topic of negotiation. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 67; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 101.) According to the Securities Complaint, Thain later stated that, alongside the acquisition price and the language of the Material Adverse Change clause (the \u201cMAC\u201d), the employee bonus arrangement was one of the three principal topics of negotiation. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 67.) The Derivative Complaint asserts that certain BofA officers involved in the negotiations later testified that \u201cMerrill\u2019s ability to pay year-end bonuses to its executives and employees pursuant to its\u201d incentive compensation program was a major topic of negotiation. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">The Securities Plaintiffs allege that Thain remained informed of the negotiations\u2019 progress through Greg Fleming, Merrill\u2019s president and chief operating officer. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 67.) Merrill wanted to pay its officers and employees $5.8 billion in bonuses. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 68; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 10.) This included bonuses for executive officers that ranged from $15 million to $40 million. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 68.) The Securities Complaint states that the $5.8 billion bonus pool totaled 12 percent of the transaction\u2019s value and 26 percent more than BofA\u2019s earnings in the first two quarters of 2008. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 72.) \u201cIt also represented 77% of Merrill\u2019s record earnings of $7.5 billion for all of 2006; nearly 30% of Merrill\u2019s total stockholders\u2019 equity as of December 26, 2008; and over 8% of Merrill\u2019s total cash as of December 26, 2008.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 72.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">Merrill wanted to pay bonuses on an accelerated basis and prior to the transaction\u2019s closing, even though its past practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>had been to pay bonuses after the close of the fiscal year. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 69-70, 74; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 215.) The Securities Complaint asserts that the accelerated payment schedule prevented BofA from later reducing bonus payments, permitted Merrill officers \u201cto reap gigantic bonuses\u201d despite dismal financial results in 2008 and ultimately reduced the value of Merrill before BofA finalized the acquisition. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 75-77.) As characterized in the Securities Complaint, negotiations over the bonuses \u201cdragged on for hours,\u201d and \u201cdelay[ed]\u201d execution of the Merger Agreement until 2 a.m. on Monday, September 15, 2008 \u2014 one hour after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 71.) In press interviews, Lewis later indicated that the bonus negotiations were a source of hard feelings, and characterized the issue as \u201cpetty\u201d and \u201cselfish.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 78.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The Derivative Complaint alleges that a term sheet prepared on Sunday, September 14 reflected that as a result of the negotiations, BofA \u201chad agreed in principle that Merrill would be authorized to pay a bonus pool that would, at most, be \u2018flat to last year\u2019 ... with a maximum recorded expense of $4.5 billion.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 120.) BofA and Merrill also agreed that Merrill\u2019s year-end bonuses would be paid in a 60/40 cash/stock split, the same as in 2007, and that \u201cbonus allocations would be made in consultation with BofA.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 121.) Taking \u201cheadcount changes\u201d into account, the parties agreed that the bonus pool would be $5.8 billion, which was greater than the pool that Merrill previously projected for 2008. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 122.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> BofA also agreed to allow Merrill to accelerate its incentive bonus payments to December 31, 2008, prior to the closing of the transaction, and \u201cahead of the disclosure date for Merrill\u2019s fourth-quarter results.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 123.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">E. <em>Fairness Opinion and the BofA Board\u2019s Recommendation of the Merger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">The principal terms of the transaction were negotiated in approximately 24 hours, from late-afternoon on Saturday, September 13, to late-afternoon on Sunday, September 14, 2008. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 101.) On Sunday, Lewis agreed that BofA would buy Merrill for $50 billion, valuing Merrill stock at $29 per share, which was a 70 percent premium over Merrill\u2019s $17 NYSE closing price the day before. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 66.; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 102.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">According to the Joint Proxy, late on Sunday afternoon, the BofA Directors met with BofA \u201csenior management and its outside advisors.\u201d (Joint Proxy at 50.) At that meeting, BofA\u2019s senior management and the Financial Advisors discussed the results of their due diligence exercise. (Joint Proxy at 55.) J.C. Flowers and FPK each delivered an oral opinion that the exchange ratio of 0.8595 of a share of BofA for every share of Merrill \u201cwas fair, from a financial point of view, to [BofA].\u201d (Joint Proxy at 51.) The Joint Proxy would later set forth the full text of the Financial Advisors\u2019 written fairness opinions. The FPK fairness opinion stated that FPK was \u201cof the opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio to be paid by [BofA] in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to [BofA].\u201d (Joint Proxy at D-3.) The J.C. Flowers opinion stated: \u201cwe are of the opinion that as of the date hereof the Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to [BofA].\u201d (Joint Proxy at C-2.) The actions of the Financial Advisors are material to the De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>rivative Complaint. They are not named as defendants in the Securities Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\">BofA\u2019s general counsel defendant Mayopoulos and BofA\u2019s outside counsel Waehtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz LLP (\u201cWachtell\u201d) then advised the board regarding \u201cthe legal standards applicable to its decisions and actions with respect to the proposed transaction and reviewed the legal terms of the proposed merger.\u201d (Joint Proxy at 51.) The BofA Board then unanimously voted to approve the transaction. (Joint Proxy at 51.) The two companies signed the Merger Agreement in the early morning of Monday, September 15. (Joint Proxy at 51.) Lewis signed on behalf of BofA, and Thain signed on behalf of Merrill. (Joint Proxy at A-46.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">F. <em>BofA Announces Secondary Offering.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">On October 7, 2008, BofA conducted a secondary offering of common stock, in which it sold 455,000,000 shares at $22 per share, netting proceeds of $9.9 billion (the \u201cSecondary Offering\u201d). (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 83.) The Secondary Offering is the basis of claims arising under the '33 Act. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 362-395.) According to the plaintiffs, the offering documents expressly incorporated the Merger Agreement and the Form 8-K filing announcing the acquisition; because the documents are alleged to be materially false and misleading, plaintiffs allege that statements made relating to the secondary offering were materially false and misleading. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 201.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">G. <em>BofA and Merrill Incur Significant Losses in the Fourth Quarter of 2008.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">In October and November 2008, while shareholder approval of the transaction was pending, Merrill incurred significant losses. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 87; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 168.) In October 2008, Merrill lost approximately $7 billion, (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 88; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 20.) Its total losses for October and November exceeded $15 billion. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 90; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 20.) In November, Merrill also took an impairment charge of approximately $2 billion to the value of its goodwill. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 91; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 20.) According to the Securities Complaint, Merrill\u2019s losses were substantial, particularly when contrasted with the $5.8 billion that BofA earned in the first nine months of 2008. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 92.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">According to the Securities Complaint, defendants Lewis, Thain, Price and Cotty were aware of Merrill\u2019s losses as they occurred. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 93.) BofA assigned 200 employees to monitor Merrill\u2019s financial condition. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 93; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 170.) Thain later stated that BofA received frequent updates on Merrill\u2019s financial condition. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 93-95.) In press reports, BofA also stated that it was \u201ckept informed of the financial condition\u201d of Merrill. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 96.) Lewis later acknowledged that he was aware of Merrill\u2019s deteriorating financial condition as it occurred in real time. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 97-98.) Lewis led weekly calls with the BofA board of directors, which included discussion of Merrill\u2019s fourth quarter losses. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 99.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">According to the Derivative Plaintiffs, the BofA Derivative Defendants \u201chad complete and unfettered access to Merrill\u2019s financial and accounting records beginning no later than September 15, 2008.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 162.) This included access to Merrill\u2019s profit and loss reports, \u201cwhich showed the facts of Merrill\u2019s deteriorating positions.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 164.) In addition, \u201cLewis, Price and other senior executives among the BofA [Derivative] Defendants received weekly reports concerning Merrill\u2019s financial condition beginning immediately after the Merger Agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>was executed.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 165 (emphasis added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">According to the Securities Complaint, Merrill\u2019s fourth-quarter losses were so significant that BofA management discussed terminating the transaction \u201con several occasions.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 100.) Shortly before Thanksgiving, BofA executives began to discuss invoking the MAC. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 100-01.) The magnitude of Merrill\u2019s losses was not disclosed to BofA\u2019s shareholders. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 101.) Within BofA, internal disagreements broke out as to whether shareholders should be informed of the Merrill losses in advance of the proxy vote. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 102.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Meanwhile, BofA\u2019s own losses were growing, making it more difficult to absorb Merrill\u2019s. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 103.) BofA was projecting a first-ever quarterly loss of $1.4 billion. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 103.) BofA executives told the Federal Reserve that BofA, excluding the Merrill acquisition, was \u201cvery thinly capitalized .... \u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">According to the Derivative Plaintiffs, at some point in November, Merrill\u2019s losses became \u201cso severe\u201d that defendant Price sought the advice of Mayopoulos and Wachtell \u201cas to whether BofA should disclose Merrill\u2019s expected fourth quarter losses to BofA shareholders.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 167.) After receiving legal advice, BofA decided not to disclose the losses. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 167.) According to the Derivative Complaint, the BofA Directors \u201cconducted weekly conference calls every Friday starting in September 2008 and continuing through December 2008, [and] could not and should not have been unaware of Merrill\u2019s accelerating losses throughout the fourth quarter.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 170.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The Derivative Plaintiffs allege that Lewis \u201cwas aware or should have been aware\u201d of a projected $9 billion fourth-quarter loss at Merrill, \u201cno later than the evening of December 3, 2008, when he received the latest weekly BofA internal report on Merrill.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 172 (emphasis omitted).) Plaintiffs allege that \u201con this occasion\u201d Craig Rosato, BofA\u2019s Chief Accounting Officer sent an email to Lewis, which reported that Merrill\u2019s fourth quarter revenues would need a downward adjustment of $3 billion. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 172.) This brought Merrill\u2019s fourth quarter loss to $9 billion. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 172.) The \u201cDecember 5, 200[8], projection was shared with the BofA Board no later than at its meeting on December 9, 2008.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 172.) By December 14, 2008, Merrill\u2019s projected loss had grown to $12 billion. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 174.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">H. <em>Joint Proxy Did Not Disclose Merrill\u2019s Growing Fourth Quarter Losses or the Bonus Arrangement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">Following the announcement of the transaction on September 15, 2008, BofA, Merrill and their respective legal counsel \u201cprepared the transactional and disclosure documents relating to the Merger.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 126.) BofA was represented by Wachtell, and Merrill was represented by Shearman &amp; Sterling, LLP (\u201cShear-man\u201d). (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 126.) The agreement regarding bonuses \u201cwas memorialized by Wachtell and Shearman\u201d in section 5.2 of a disclosure schedule attached to the Merger Agreement (the \u201cDisclosure Schedule\u201d). (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 127.) According to information provided to the SEC by several individuals, including Lewis, \u201clawyers \u25a0 at Wachtell and Shearman, and one or more of BofA\u2019s in-house lawyers, including Defendant Mayopolous [sic] ... and Defendant Brenner,\u201d decided to place this information in the Disclosure Schedule, instead of the Merger Agreement. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 129, 130.) This Disclosure Schedule, which was not available to shareholders prior to voting on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>transaction, provided that incentive bonuses for 2008 \u201cmay be awarded at levels that (i) do not exceed $5.8 billion in aggregate value (inclusive of cash bonuses and the grant date of long-term incentive awards) ... and (ii) do not result in 2008 [incentive-related] expense exceeding $4.5 billion.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 128 (quoting Disclosure Schedule).)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The terms of the merger were set forth in a definitive Joint Proxy filed with the SEC and mailed to shareholders of record on November 3, 2008. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 205; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 125.) In the Joint Proxy, the BofA Directors solicited proxies to vote on the merger at a special meeting on December 5, 2008. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 125.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The Joint Proxy explains to shareholders the terms and conditions of, and the basis for the boards\u2019 recommendations for, the acquisition. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 206; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 107-08, 125, 155.) The Joint Proxy begins with a letter to shareholders of BofA and Merrill, which features as its heading the separate corporate logos of the two companies. (Joint Proxy Cover Letter.) The letter is signed by both Lewis and Thain. (Joint Proxy Cover Letter.) Among other things, the letter states that the BofA board unanimously recommended the proposal to issue the shares necessary to purchase Merrill. (Joint Proxy Cover Letter.) By the Court\u2019s count, the Joint Proxy incorporates by reference 78 separate SEC filings of either BofA or Merrill. (Joint Proxy at 123-24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The Joint Proxy also attaches a copy of the Merger Agreement. It describes the Merger Agreement as \u201csubject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to between the parties,\u201d which \u201cmay have been included in the agreement for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties rather than to establish matters as facts.\u201d (Joint Proxy at 125.) It asserted that certain \u201cmaterials\u201d are intended \u201conly to provide you with information regarding the terms and conditions of the agreements, and not to provide any other factual information....\u201d (Joint Proxy at 125.) The Joint Proxy advised that provisions of the Merger Agreement \u201cshould not be read alone,\u201d but rather, in conjunction with the Joint Proxy and filings incorporated by reference. (Joint Proxy at 125.) Elsewhere, the Joint Proxy stated, \u201cWe urge you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the legal document governing the merger.\u201d (Joint Proxy at 76.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The Joint Proxy did not disclose the losses of Merrill or BofA in the fourth quarter of 2008, or disclose that bonuses were to be paid to Merrill personnel prior to the transaction\u2019s closing. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 106, 207; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 232(g)-(j), 233(a).) According to both complaints, the Joint Proxy falsely stated that there had been an \u201cabsence of material adverse changes\u201d to Merrill\u2019s financial conditions. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 107; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 233(b).) Both complaints assert that the Joint Proxy\u2019s incorporation by reference of a March 2008 proxy statement issued by Merrill adopted that proxy\u2019s representation that Merrill would not pay discretionary bonuses prior to January. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 108; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 232(j).) All plaintiffs contend that the Joint Proxy\u2019s representations as to the Merrill bonuses were false and misleading because Merrill had negotiated with BofA to pay up to $5.8 billion in bonuses and to make those payments earlier than in prior years, on a timeline prior to the transaction\u2019s closing. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 214-20; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 232(g)-\u00a9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">BofA filed proxy supplements on November 21, and November 26, 2008. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 221; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 239.) In the second proxy supplement Lewis stated that \u201cBank of America is positioned to ride <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>out this severe economic storm.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 222; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 239.) Lewis also made statements about BofA\u2019s capital and liquidity positions, and stated that, although BofA had received a capital injection from the federal government, \u201cth[ose] were funds that [BofA] did not need and did not seek.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 222; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 239.) By the beginning of December 2008, Merrill had incurred approximately $15.3 billion in losses, including its $2 billion impairment charge taken to the value of corporate goodwill. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 209; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20, 240.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">All plaintiffs allege that the failure to disclose Merrill\u2019s losses rendered statements in the Joint Proxy false and misleading. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 211; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 233(a).) According to plaintiffs, Merrill\u2019s losses in the fourth quarter amounted to material adverse changes to its financial condition, as was evidenced by BofA\u2019s deliberations about invoking the MAC provision of the Merger Agreement. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 211; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 233(b) &amp; (e).) As noted, the Joint Proxy represented that no material adverse change had occurred in Merrill\u2019s financial condition. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 212; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 233(b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">I. <em>Consideration of the Invocation of the MAC Clause and the Offer of Federal Capital Support.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Shareholders of BofA and Merrill voted to approve the transaction on December 5, 2008. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 112, 225; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 176.) On December 9, defendants Lewis and Price met with BofA\u2019s board of directors to discuss Merrill\u2019s financial condition. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 113.) According to the Securities Complaint, Price estimated that Merrill would lose $9 billion after taxes, and described the scope of loss as \u201cquite significant.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 113.) The Derivative Complaint alleges that by December 5, 2008, Lewis was aware of a revised projection that Merrill would incur a $9 billion after-tax loss for the fourth quarter. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 172.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">In light of the accumulating losses, Lewis considered exercising BofA\u2019s right to terminate the transaction prior to the closing, as the MAC provision contemplated. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 113; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 181, 183.) He called Treasury Secretary Paul-son on December 17, 2008. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 114; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 185.) Lewis told Paulson that BofA was \u201cstrongly considering\u201d invoking the MAC and terminating the acquisition. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 114; Deriv.

Compl. \u00b6 186.) Attendees included Paulson and Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board (the \u201cFed\u201d). (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 115; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 186.) Lewis stated that BofA was facing its first-ever quarterly loss, and that Merrill\u2019s losses were so large that they threatened BofA\u2019s solvency. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 115.) Lewis said that BofA intended to invoke the MAC, stating that BofA learned of the losses only in mid-December. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 115.) Bernanke and Paulson urged Lewis not to invoke the MAC. (Sec.

(Sec. Compl. \u00b6 116.) He agreed to provide the Fed with information about the companies\u2019 fourth-quarter performances and risk exposures. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 116.) After reviewing the materials, Fed officials concluded that Lewis\u2019s claim of surprise at Merrill\u2019s losses was not credible. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 117; Deriv.

(Sec. Compl. \u00b6 124.) Lewis indicated that the deal would proceed only if the federal government agreed to purchase Merrill\u2019s toxic assets, or else guaranteed BofA against any losses arising from them. (Sec.

Throughout the evening of December 21, 2008, according to the Derivative Complaint, Lewis \u201ccanvassed fellow Board members informally to determine whether the Board would opt to preserve their jobs and support management\u2019s recommendation not to invoke the MAC....\u201d (Deriv.

He approached Fed officials to request measures to shield BofA from potential liability. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 129-31; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 199.) Bernanke and Fed General Counsel Scott Alvarez discussed BofA\u2019s potential shareholder liability in completing the acquisition. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 129-31; Deriv.

(Sec. Compl. \u00b6 132; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 21.) According to the Securities Complaint, Lewis told the BofA board that \u201cthe verbal commitment of the Fed and Treasury\u201d was material to management\u2019s recommendation to close on the acquisition. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 133.) As characterized in the Securities Complaint, \u201cLewis concealed the bailout from investors.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 134.) He told the BofA board that the Company would not enter into a written agreement concerning federal funds, because he could not risk public disclosure of government loans prior to closing of the transaction. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 134, 136; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 197-98, 201.)

Similarly, the Derivative Plaintiffs allege that the BofA Derivative Defendants breached their fiduciary duty to BofA by failing to disclose the \u201cdevastating losses\u201d at Merrill, the board\u2019s initial belief that a material adverse event had arisen, and federal involvement in exercising the MAC clause and providing financial support.

On or around January 12, 2009, a Citigroup analyst reported that BofA might report a $3.6 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2008, and cut dividends from $0.32 to $0.05 per share. (Sec.

Later in the morning, BofA announced that Merrill\u2019s after-tax loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 totaled $15.31 billion (more than $21 billion before taxes), that BofA\u2019s quarterly losses totaled $1.8 billion, and that the federal government was providing $20 billion in capital to BofA while agreeing to provide protection against further losses on $118 billion of assets. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 145; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 243.) According to the Securities Complaint, the quarterly results for both BofA and Merrill were far below previous analyst estimates. (Sec.

After the markets closed that day, the ratings agency Moody\u2019s downgraded BofA\u2019s credit rating, and Fitch downgraded Merrill\u2019s rating to an \u201cF.\u201d (Sec.

On January 20, 2009, which was the next trading day, BofA shares declined to $5.10, representing a decline of an additional 29%. (Sec.

On January 22, 2009, Lewis terminated Thain. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 156.) That day, BofA\u2019s share price dropped from $6.68 per share to $5.71. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 161.) According to the Securities Complaint, from January 12 to January 22, 2008, the price of BofA\u2019s preferred stock fell, on average, 32%. (Sec.

Plaintiffs allege that the offering documents contained untrue statements and material omissions. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 364.) Count VII asserts that defendants BofA, Lewis, Price, Cotty, and the Underwriter Defendants unlawfully violated Section 11 of the '33 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k, because the secondary offering registration statement contained material omissions and misstatements. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 372-382.)

In June and July of 2009, Judge Chin consolidated for all purposes a number of securities actions and appointed lead plaintiffs and lead counsel for the Securities Action. (MDL Docket # # 2, 15.) At the same time, Judge Chin consolidated for all purposes several derivative actions and appointed interim lead plaintiffs and co-lead counsel. (MDL Docket # # 2, 16.) The Securities Plaintiffs filed the Consolidated Amended Class Action Securities Complaint on September 25, 2009. (MDL Docket #29.) The Derivative Plaintiffs filed the Consolidated Shareholder Derivative and Class Action Complaint on October 9, 2009. (MDL Docket #39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Three separate motions to dismiss the Securities Complaint were filed on November 24, 2009. They were respectively file-don behalf of (1) BofA, Banc of America, and all BofA officers and directors named as defendants; (2) Thain; and (3) Merrill and MLPFS. Thain and Merrill incorporate the arguments set forth by the BofA defendants. The plaintiffs filed a single memorandum in opposition to the motions. On December 8, 2009, the BofA Derivative Defendants, BofA as nominal defendant, the Financial Advisors, and several other individuals (the \u201cDerivative Merrill Defendants\u201d) filed motions to dismiss the Derivative Complaint. Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against the Derivative Merrill Defendants on February 2, 2009.

(MDL Docket # 250.)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The Derivative Plaintiffs were directed to amend the Derivative Complaint to include allegations regarding the citizenship of the Financial Advisors. (MDL Docket ## 279, 289.) Although that complaint has not yet been filed, the amendments will solely relate to allegations concerning diversity jurisdiction.

Because of its own distinct duties and the necessarily adverse interests of parties to an acquisition, Merrill asserts, there was no disclosure duty extending from Merrill to BofA shareholders, and thus no basis for liability. Thain joins in Merrill\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Nondisclosure claims asserted under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 are premised on the existence of a fiduciary or similar obligation extending from a defendant to a shareholder. <em>Chiarella v.

Dorozhko, </em>574 F.3d 42, 49 (2d Cir.2009), Judge Cabranes, writing for the panel, reviewed <em>Chiarella </em>and related authorities, and held that a fiduciary obligation is necessary only when a party\u2019s silence is the basis of a securities fraud claim. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A]n affirmative misrepresentation,\u201d by contrast, \u201cis a distinct species of fraud. Even if a person does not have a fiduciary duty ... there is nonetheless an affirmative obligation in commercial dealings not to mislead.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The SEC therefore had a viable enforcement claim, against an individual who allegedly engaged in deceptive conduct and undertook trades based on inside information, even in the absence of a fiduciary relationship between the individual and the corporation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Count II of the Securities Complaint asserts Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims against Thain and Merrill. It alleges, in a conclusory fashion, that Thain and Merrill \u201chad a duty to disclose\u201d the bonus arrangement, as well as \u201ca duty to disclose\u201d other information that required up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>dating and/or correction. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 304-05.) The basis for this duty, and why it should extend from Merrill to the shareholders of BofA, is not explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">In light of <em>Chiarella </em>and <em>Dorozhko, </em>and the Securities Complaint\u2019s absence of a plausible allegation for a fiduciary relationship running from Thain and Merrill to BofA shareholders, plaintiffs\u2019 Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims are dismissed to the extent that they are based on allegedly material omissions and the breach of a duty to disclose. For Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 purposes, this includes the purported \u201cduty to disclose\u201d the parties\u2019 bonus arrangement and allegedly adverse events that occurred while the proxy was outstanding. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 304-05.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">To the extent that the plaintiffs allege that Thain and Merrill were responsible for false and misleading statements to BofA shareholders, however, <em>Dorozhko </em>holds that no fiduciary obligation is necessary to proceed with such claims. The motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims arising out of such statements by Merrill or Thain is denied. Whether plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged fraud under the PSLRA and Rule 9(b) as to any allegedly false and misleading statement is addressed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">B. <em>Thain and Merrill\u2019s Motions to Dismiss the Section 11(a) and Rule lipa </em>\u2014 9 <em>Claims Are Denied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Merrill and Thain also move to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 claim brought under Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9. As with the Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims, they assert that no duty extends from the target company to shareholders of an acquiring company.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The text of Section 14(a) states that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for <em>any person </em>... to solicit or permit the use of his name to solicit any proxy\u201d in violation of an SEC regulation. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n(a)(l) (emphasis added). The basis for Section 14(a) liability is not the nature of the duty between the defendant and a shareholder, but whether that defendant has solicited or permitted his or her name to be used in the allegedly unlawful proxy. Rule 14a-9, in turn, prohibits \u201cany statement\u201d that is false or misleading as \u201cto any material fact\u201d at the time that it was made. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14a-9(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">As a consequence, in the Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 context, courts have permitted claims to proceed when the management of one company allegedly misstates or omits material facts to the detriment of shareholders to the other party of the transaction. <em>In re McKesson HBOC, Inc. Securities Litigation </em>held that the critical threshold for a Section 14(a) claim was participation in the drafting of the proxy: \u201canyone who knowingly participates in the distribution [of] a proxy solicitation should therefore expect to be held liable for false statements to <em>all </em>affected shareholders.\u201d 126 F.Supp.2d 1248, 1266 (N.D.Cal.2000) (emphasis in original). The claim was permitted to proceed against directors of the target company, who solicited proxies containing alleged misstatements that induced action by shareholders of the acquiring company. <em>Id. </em>As the defendants themselves note, other courts have permitted Section 14(a) claims to go forward when shareholders of one party to a transaction allege that the other party\u2019s management misstated or omitted a material fact. <em>See, e.g., Dasho v. Susquehanna Corp., </em>461 F.2d 11 (7th Cir.1972) (Stevens, J.); <em>In re AOL Time Warner, Inc. Sec. &amp; \u201cERISA\u201d Litig., </em>381 F.Supp.2d 192, 232 (S.D.N.Y.2004). Defendants argue that these cases are distinguishable, either because they arose from information that was uniquely in the knowledge of the transaction\u2019s counterparty, or else involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>statements that were false at the time they were made. But the Securities Complaint in this action asserts that certain allegedly actionable statements were false at the time they were made, and the text and judicial interpretations of Section 14(a) do not support defendants\u2019 interpretation that the information must be unique to the transaction\u2019s counterparty.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Merrill\u2019s and Thain\u2019s motions to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 claims are denied. To the extent that Merrill and Thain challenge the Securities Complaint on other grounds, the arguments will be separately addressed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">III. <em>DEFENDANTS\u2019 MOTIONS TO DISMISS PLAINTIFFS\u2019 '3J, ACT CLAIMS FOR FAILURE TO ALLEGE ACTIONABLE MISSTATEMENTS OR OMISSIONS ARE GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In both the Securities and Derivative Actions, the defendants move to dismiss on the grounds that the plaintiffs fail to allege violations of Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 with the particularity required of the PSLRA. The Securities Complaint also asserts claims under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b \u2014 5; the Derivative Complaint raises no Section 10(b) claims.

An action brought under Section 10(b) ultimately requires a plaintiff to prove (1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. <em>Stoneridge, </em>552 U.S. at 157, 128 S.Ct. 761 (citing <em>Dura, </em>544 U.S. at 341-42, 125 S.Ct. 1627).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">B. <em>Background on Section 11(a) and Rule lka-9.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">As described by the Second Circuit, a \u201cproxy statement should honestly, openly and candidly state all the material facts, making no concealment of the purposes for the proposals it advocates.\u201d <em>Mendell v.

Such a determination \u201crequires delicate assessments of the inferences a \u2018reasonable shareholder\u2019 would draw from a given set of facts and the significance of those inferences to him, and these assessments are peculiarly ones for the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450, 96 S.Ct. 2126; <em>accord Mendell, </em>927 F.2d at 673 (materiality is a mixed question of law and fact best evaluated by a jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">As formulated by the Second Circuit, in ascertaining materiality, a plaintiff must show a \u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d that disclosure of the omitted fact would have \u201csignificantly altered the \u2018total mix\u2019 of information made available.\u201d <em>Koppel v. 4987 Corp., </em>167 F.3d 125, 131 (2d Cir.1999) (quotation marks omitted).

As previously noted, the PSLRA\u2019s threshold for alleging with particularity a '34 Act violation applies to both Sections 14(a) and 10(b). <em>Beck, </em>559 F.3d at 681-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Lastly, to state a Section 14(a) claim, a plaintiff must allege \u201cthat the proxy solicitation itself, rather than the particular defect in the solicitation materials, was an essential link in the accomplishment of the transaction.\u201d <em>Mills, </em>396 U.S. at 385, 90 S.Ct. 616. In both the Securities Action and the Derivative Action, the only relevant solicitations are related to the shareholder vote that occurred on December 5, 2008. Therefore, allegations relating to events that took place after December 5, 2008, cannot form the basis of a Section 14(a) claim. <em>See In re AOL Time Warner, </em>381 F.Supp.2d at 242 (statement post-dating the shareholder vote \u201ccannot constitute a \u2018solicitation\u2019 under Section 14(a)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">C. <em>Potential for Overlapping Damages Betiveen the Direct and Derivative Section 11(a) Actions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">I first address who may recover under the Section 14(a) claims asserted in the Securities Action and the Derivative Action. In the Securities Action the shareholders of the acquiring corporation in a stock-for-stock transaction have brought a direct claim against the acquiring corporation, its directors, certain of its officers and others for violations of Section 14(a). Separately, in the Derivative Action, shareholders acting on behalf of the corporation have brought a derivative Section 14(a) claim against individuals who also are defendants in the Securities Action. It is important to distinguish the injury to shareholders <em>qua </em>shareholders from any injury to the corporation. If a harm were suffered by the shareholders as shareholders, then the same harm would not be a harm inflicted on the corporation. Similarly, if it were suffered by the corporation, then it would not be harm inflicted on the shareholder. A single act could, of course, inflict separate injury on both the corporation and the shareholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">At a pretrial conference held on May 19, 2010,1 asked the Securities and Derivative Plaintiffs to explain their damages theories. In letter briefs to the Court, the Securities Plaintiffs argued that they may recover \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d losses suffered as a result of the misstatements and omissions contained in the Joint Proxy. According to the Securities Plaintiffs, their out-of-pocket damages are equal to the diminution in the value of their personally held shares that occurred after corrective disclosures revealed the truth behind the Joint Proxy\u2019s representations. The Derivative Plaintiffs argue that BofA is entitled to damages arising from BofA\u2019s overpayment for Merrill, as well as damages that BofA incurred over and above the overpayment for Merrill, including the injury to BofA\u2019s reputation and legal fees in defending legal and regulatory proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">As the Supreme Court recognized in Borak, the \u201cinjury which a stockholder suffers from corporate action pursuant to a deceptive proxy solicitation ordinarily flows from the damage done to the corporation ....\u201d 377 U.S. at 432, 84 S.Ct. 1555. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>That is, the value of that corporation\u2019s stock may decrease because the corporation was damaged by an action that would not have been approved by fully-informed shareholders. But the value of that corporation\u2019s shares also may decrease once a corrective disclosure issues. That decrease is not necessarily co-extensive with injury to the corporation. Therefore, material omissions from a proxy statement could directly injure the corporation as well as the corporation\u2019s shareholders. <em>See Yamamoto v. Omiya, </em>564 F.2d 1319, 1326 (9th Cir.1977) (\u201c[I]n light of ... <em>Borah </em>and <em>Mills, </em>a shareholder who alleges a deceptive or misleading proxy solicitation is entitled to bring both direct and derivative suits. The former action protects the shareholders\u2019 interest in \u2018fair corporate suffrage\u2019.\u201d). There is at least a potential that the Securities Plaintiffs could show a diminution in the value of the shares that they held which was not due to an injury inflicted upon BofA. Therefore, it is possible for both sets of plaintiffs to prevail without double recovery. Both suits may proceed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Certain defendants in the Securities Action have moved to certify to the Delaware Supreme Court the question of whether shareholders of the acquiring corporation, who neither bought nor sold shares during the relevant period, have a direct claim against the acquiring corporation. Specifically, they seek certification of the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">Where a Delaware corporation issues its own shares in a stock-for-stock merger in exchange for shares held by the acquired company\u2019s shareholders, do acquiring company shareholders who were allegedly deprived of their right to cast an informed vote on the merger as a result of a materially false or misleading proxy solicitation \u2014 but who did not themselves buy, sell or exchange their shares in the merger' \u2014 -have a direct claim under Delaware law against the acquiring corporation and/or its officers or directors to recover damages for the post-merger decline in the market price of the acquiring company\u2019s shares when the allegedly misstated or omitted material facts were publicly disclosed?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">(Def. Cert. Mem. at 2.) Assuming, as I do, that this Court could in the exercise of discretion certify such a question,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I conclude that it is unnecessary. As discussed above, BofA shareholders may bring both direct and derivative claims under Section 14(a) because there is a possibility that both the shareholders and the corporation were separately injured by the alleged material misstatements and omissions. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>motion to certify a question to the Delaware Supreme Court is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">D. <em>Derivative Plaintiffs Fail to Allege That the Individual BofA Officers Are Liable Under Section 11(a) of the '31 Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">I next address whether the Derivative Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the BofA Officers may be subject to liability under Section 14(a) of the '34 Act. The \u201cstarting point in every case involving construction of a statute is the language itself.\u201d <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst, </em>425 U.S. at 197, 96 S.Ct. 1375 (quotation marks omitted). The language of Section 14(a) makes it \u201cunlawful for any person ... in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe ... <em>to solicit or to permit the use of his name to solicit </em>any proxy ....\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n(a)(l) (emphasis added). Thus, according to the plain language of Section 14(a), liability attaches only to defendants who actually solicited proxies or permitted the use of their name to solicit proxies.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The BofA proxy card, which was attached to the Joint Proxy distributed to BofA shareholders, stated in bold typeface: \u201cThis Proxy is Solicited on Behalf of the Board of Directors.\u201d (Joint Proxy, Proxy Card (emphasis in original).) Thus, the BofA Directors solicited proxies, and fall within the plain language of Section 14(a). That solicitation was not made on behalf of the BofA Officers, and the BofA Officers were not \u201cparticipants\u201d within the meaning of the SEC\u2019s regulations governing the disclosure obligations of individuals who participate in a proxy solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Schedule 14A prescribes the information required in a proxy statement. Item 4, titled \u201cPersons Making the Solicitation,\u201d provides in part that if a proxy solicitation is made \u201cotherwise than by the registrant\u201d the proxy statement shall \u201cstate and give the names of the participants in the solicitation, as defined in paragraphs (a)(iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of Instruction 3 to this item.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14a-101, Item 4(a)(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Derivative Complaint does not plausibly allege that the BofA Officers fall within Schedule 14A\u2019s definitions of \u201cparticipants in the solicitation.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.14a-101, Item 4, Instruction 3(a)(iii) (relating to groups or committees that solicit proxies, or individuals who organize, direct or arrange financing for those committees or groups); (a)(iv) (\u201c[a]ny person who finances or joins with another to finance the solicitation of proxies\u201d); (a)(v) (a person who lends money or extends credit or enters into a contract to finance \u201cor otherwise induc[es] the purchase, sale, holding or voting of securities of the registrant by any participant or other persons\u201d); (a)(vi) (\u201c[a]ny person who solicits proxies\u201d). In addition, Instruction 3(b)(iv) excludes from the definition of \u201cparticipant in a solicitation\u201d \u201c[a]ny person regularly employed as an officer or employee of the registrant or any of its subsidiaries who is not otherwise a participant.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14a-101, Item 4, Instruction 3(b)(iv). Pursuant to the SEC\u2019s governing regulations, then, the BofA Officers can only be subject to Section 14(a) liability if they permitted the use of their name to solicit the proxies.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">With the exceptions of Lewis (who is also a director) and Mayopoulos, none of the BofA Officers are mentioned in the Joint Proxy. Defendant Mayopoulos is mentioned under a section titled \u201cLegal Matters,\u201d which states: \u201cThe validity of the Bank of America common stock and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>preferred stock to be issued in connection with the merger will be passed upon for Bank of America by Timothy J. Mayopoulos, Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Bank of America.\u201d (Joint Proxy at 118.) Mayopoulos is also mentioned in section 9.4 of the Merger Agreement, which states that notices made pursuant to that agreement should be sent to several individuals, including Mayopoulos. (Joint Proxy at A-43-44.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Neither the Second Circuit nor the Supreme Court has directly addressed whether an officer may be liable for misstatements or omissions merely because his or her name appears somewhere in the text of an allegedly misleading proxy statement. Other courts have, however, concluded that Section 14(a) requires a connection between the use of an officer\u2019s name and the company\u2019s solicitation. <em>See SEC v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>629 F.2d 62, 68 (D.C.Cir.1980) (\u201cOf course, the simple appearance of one\u2019s name in a proxy statement does not trigger liability for any misstatement appearing therein.\u201d). According to the Ninth Circuit, to impose liability, \u201cthere must have been \u2018a substantial connection between the use of the person\u2019s name and the solicitation effort.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Yamamoto, </em>564 F.2d at 1323). In <em>Falstaff Brewing, </em>the D.C. Circuit followed <em>Yamamoto, </em>and found that there was a substantial connection between the use of the defendant\u2019s name \u2014 which appeared \u201celeven times in the nine-page proxy statement, in three separate items\u201d \u2014 and the solicitation effort. <em>Id. </em>at 68-69. This was due, in part because the defendant\u2019s \u201creputation as a businessman, his plan for [the company], and his other dealings that could create conflicts of interest were important to the existing shareholders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69. The defendant also reviewed a draft of the proxy statement a week before it was issued and read the final draft shortly after it was mailed to shareholders. <em>Id. </em>at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">In <em>Yamamoto, </em>the Ninth Circuit held at the summary judgment stage that a defendant could not be subject to Section 14(a) when his role in the proxy was limited to the inclusion of his \u201cname and address ... as the proposed buyer\u201d of the principal asset of the company whose shareholders were solicited. 564 F.2d at 1322-23. The Ninth Circuit concluded that the \u201cmere presence of [the individual\u2019s] name in the materials (probably required by the SEC) did not reveal any significant control by [that person] over the statement, or his adoption of it that was sufficient to justify attaching liability to him.... It is hardly conceivable that the mere revelation that [the individual] was the proposed purchaser could have been an inducing factor in the granting of a shareholder\u2019s proxy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1323. By contrast, when individuals listed in a proxy statement \u201chav[e] put their reputations in issue, [they] cannot divorce themselves from improper actions taken in the proxy battle by the participants acting under the banner of their names.\u201d <em>Chris-Craft Indus., Inc. v.

They contend that proxy materials neither misstated nor omitted Merrill\u2019s intention to award employee bonuses. For the reasons explained below, the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the Securities Complaint\u2019s Section 10(b) and 14(a) claims relating to Merrill\u2019s bonuses are denied. The motions to dismiss the Derivative Complaint\u2019s Section 14(a) claim relating to the Merrill bonuses are also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">a. <em>Qualifying Language in the Joint Proxy and Merger Agreement Did Not Disclose BofA\u2019s Consent to the Merrill Bonuses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">\u201c[U]pon choosing to speak, one must speak truthfully about material issues.\u201d <em>Caiola v. Citibank, N.A., New York, </em>295 F.3d 312, 331 (2d Cir.2002). \u201cRule 10b-5 creates a statutory duty to speak the full truth when a defendant undertakes to say anything.\u201d <em>In re Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>No. 97 Civ. 4760(JGK), 1998 WL 734365, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 20, 1998) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">The defendants contend that the Joint Proxy and the Merger Agreement could not plausibly be alleged to have been false and misleading, based in part on qualifying language that permitted Merrill to administer special employee compensation, subject to BofA\u2019s approval. I begin by reviewing the Joint Proxy\u2019s representations as to employee compensation. Under the heading, \u201cCovenants and Agreements,\u201d the Joint Proxy states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Merrill Lynch further agreed that, with certain exceptions or except with Bank of America\u2019s prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably-withheld or delayed with respect to certain of the actions described below), Merrill Lynch will not, and will not permit any of its subsidiaries to, among other things, undertake the following extraordinary actions: ... except as required under applicable law or the terms of any Merrill Lynch benefit plan, (i) increase the compensation or benefits of any current or former directors, officers or employees; (ii) pay any current or former directors, officers or employees any amounts not required by existing plans or agreements; (iii) become a party to, establish, adjust, or terminate any employee benefit or compensation plan or agreement ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">(Joint Proxy at 83-84.) Separately, the Merger Agreement included a negative covenant that Merrill would not \u201cpay any amounts to Employees not required by any current plan or agreement (other than base salary in the ordinary course of business).\u201d (Joint Proxy at A-31-32.) Defendants argue that the Merger Agreement meaningfully qualified this language, and did so in a way that disclosed Merrill\u2019s conditional authority to award bonus compensation prior to the transaction\u2019s closing. Section 5.2 of the Merger Agreement states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\"><em>Company Forbearances. </em>During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, <em>except </em>as set forth in ... Section 5.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or <em>except </em>as expressly contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, [Merrill Lynch] shall not ... <em>without the prior written consent </em>of [Bank of America]: .. (c) except as required under applicable law or the terms of any Company Benefit Plan existing as the date hereof, ... (ii) pay any amounts to Employees not required by any current plan or agreement (other than base salary in the ordinary course of business) ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">(Joint Proxy at A-31 (emphasis added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">According to the defendants, section 5.2 of the Merger Agreement provides three exceptions to its general bar against payment to employees not required by the current plan or agreement. The first exception applies to matters \u201cset forth in ... Section 5.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.\u201d The Merger Agreement defines the \u201cCompany Disclosure Schedule\u201d as setting forth \u201citems the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate ... as an exception to ... one or more of [Merrill Lynch\u2019s] covenants contained herein.... \u201d (Joint Proxy at A-7.) The Company Disclosure Schedule was included neither in proxy materials nor other public filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">The second exception is based on section 5.2(c)\u2019s carve-out for actions \u201cexpressly contemplated or permitted\u201d by the Merger Agreement. Section 5.1 of the Merger Agreement requires Merrill to \u201cconduct its business in the ordinary course in all material respects,\u201d including \u201creasonable best efforts to maintain and preserve intact\u201d its business organization and retain key officers and employees. (Joint Proxy at A-31.) According to the defendants, in a March 2008 proxy statement, Merrill explained the need to compensate employees at market rate as a means to retain them. (Exhibit 7 to the Declaration of Jonathan Goldin, dated November 24, 2009 (\u201cGoldin Dec.\u201d).) Relatedly, section 6.5(a) of the Merger Agreement promised to maintain Merrill\u2019s \u201cemployee benefit plans and compensation opportunities\u201d through December 31, 2009, on terms \u201csubstantially comparable\u201d to those already in place. (Joint Proxy at A-35.) As a result, defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>contend, shareholders were adequately apprised of Merrill\u2019s bonus practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">The third exception to the negative covenant provided that Merrill could make payments to employees, beyond base salary, with BofA\u2019s \u201cprior written consent.\u201d According to the defendants, section 5.2 was nothing more than a contractual provision that protected BofA against Merrill enjoying a \u201cblank check\u201d to pay bonuses without BofA\u2019s consent. (BofA Sec. Mem. at 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Defendants contend that the investing public was aware that Merrill would distribute billions in bonuses for employees\u2019 performance in fiscal year 2008. They note that in Merrill\u2019s Form 10-Q filed with the SEC at the close of the third fiscal quarter of 2008, Merrill announced that it had reserved $11.17 billion for 2008 compensation. Merrill\u2019s expected bonus payments also were discussed in the press. Moreover, the defendants argue that the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Joint Proxy\u2019s statements concerning compensation were not representations of fact, but rather, reflected that Merrill could not undertake certain actions without authorization from BofA.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">These arguments fail to reckon with the parties\u2019 undisclosed written agreement authorizing the payment of bonuses by Merrill. When the Joint Proxy was filed on October 31, 2008, the bonus payment to Merrill employees was more than hypothetical. Instead, BofA and Merrill had already agreed in writing that Merrill could, at its discretion, administer bonus payments up to $5.8 billion. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 72.) The bonus issue was of sufficient importance that Thain later recalled it as one of the three major topics of the negotiation. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 67.) The terms of the bonus were memorialized in the undisclosed Company Disclosure Schedule. The existence of the Company Disclosure Schedule was noted in section 5.2 of the Merger Agreement, but the Company Disclosure Schedule was not released to the public, and its content, insofar as it related to bonuses, was not summarized in the proxy materials. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 198.) Under the Joint Proxy\u2019s own terms, any compensation increases or payments not required by a preexisting plan or agreement would constitute \u201cextraordinary actions.\u201d (Joint Proxy at 83-84.) At the time the Joint Proxy and Merger Agreement were filed with the SEC and distributed to shareholders, BofA and Merrill had agreed that Merrill could make bonus payments in the amount of $5.8 billion, and make the payments on an expedited schedule that varied from Merrill\u2019s past practices. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 74.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The bonus payments ultimately totaled $3.6 billion, and not $5.8 billion. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 14.) The Merger Agreement\u2019s qualifications to its negative covenant do not apprise investors of Merrill\u2019s bonus arrangement. If \u201cprior written consent\u201d had been given to make payments of up to $5.8 billion, a reasonable investor may well have considered that information important to both the purchase of shares and the granting or withholding of a proxy.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Defendants argue, among other things, that SEC regulations do not require disclosure of bonuses in proxy statements. But the absence of an express disclosure obligation does not immunize statements that were, in fact, alleged to have been materially false and misleading. In <em>Caiola, </em>295 F.3d at 330-31, the defendant made representations to an investor about aspects of its hedging strategies. The defendant argued that it had no independent duty to disclose its hedging strategies, so that any misrepresentations made about the strategies were non-actionable. <em>Id. </em>at 330-31. The Second Circuit rejected this argument, holding that \u201cthe lack of an independent duty is not, under such circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>stances, a defense to Rule 10b-5 liability because upon choosing to speak, one must speak truthfully about material issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331; <em>accord In re Bristol Myers Squibb Co., </em>586 F.Supp.2d 148, 162 (S.D.N.Y.2008); <em>In re Credit Suisse, </em>1998 WL 734365, at *6.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Assuming the truth of the Securities Complaint, the Joint Proxy and the Merger Agreement portrayed bonus payments to Merrill employees as a contingent event, when, in reality, the parties had reached agreement as to the timing and range of bonuses. At this stage, the Court concludes that the qualifying language in the Joint Proxy and the Merger Agreement would not apprise a reasonable shareholder that BofA had already consented to the \u201cextraordinary action[]\u201d of \u201cpay[ing] any current for former directors, officers or employees any amounts not required by existing plans or agreements.... \u201d (Joint Proxy at 83-84.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">For similar reasons, the defendants\u2019 argument that the Merger Agreement merely constituted a private allocation of risk between BofA and Merrill is unavailing. According to the Joint Proxy, the Merger Agreement is \u201cthe legal document governing the merger,\u201d and shareholders were advised in the Joint Proxy to \u201cread the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety ....\u201d (Joint Proxy at 76.) A reasonable investor would have understood the Merger Agreement to constitute a statement of fact. <em>See </em>SEC\u2019s Titan Report, Exch. Act. Rel. No. 51,283, 2005 WL</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">1074830 (Mar. 1, 2005) (\u2018When an issuer makes a public disclosure of information\u2014 <em>via </em>filing a proxy statement or otherwise\u2014 the issuer is required to consider whether additional disclosure is necessary in order to put the information contained in, or otherwise incorporated into that publication, into context so that such information is not misleading. The issuer cannot avoid this disclosure obligation simply because the information published was contained in an agreement or other document not prepared as a disclosure document.\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the defendants\u2019 heavy reliance on section 5.1 of the Merger Agreement, which provides that Merrill \u201cshall ... conduct its business in the ordinary course in all material respects\u201d and \u201cuse reasonable best efforts\u201d to maintain \u201cits business organization ... and retain the services of its key officers and key employees,\u201d is unavailing. (Joint Proxy at A-31.) This language did not, as defendants argue, \u201cauthorize[ ] and contractually obligate[ ]\u201d the employee bonuses. (BofA Sec. Reply at 9,11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Of significance is the parties\u2019 decision not to file the Company Disclosure Schedule or set forth in text the key provision concerning Merrill bonuses. Item 601 of Regulation S-K, which is an SEC rule governing the filing of exhibits, requires that \u201c[a]ny material plan of acquisition\u201d does not need to attach schedules or similar attachments, \u201cunless such schedules contain information which is material to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>investment decision and which is not otherwise disclosed in the agreement or the disclosure document.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 229.601(b)(2). If schedules are omitted, the disclosure document \u201cshall contain a list briefly identifying the contents of all omitted schedules____\u201d <em>Id. </em>Section 5.2 of the Merger Agreement refers only to an unspecified \u201cexception]\u201d contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule. The proxy materials do not disclose the nature of the exception, which, according to the Securities Complaint, vitiated language in the Joint Proxy and the Merger Agreement covenanting against the \u201cextraordinary action[ ]\u201d of paying non-required compensation. A reviewing shareholder would be left to speculate about the contents of the Disclosure Schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The argument that Item 601 did not expressly require BofA or Merrill to file the Disclosure Schedule largely misses the point of the rule, which requires disclosure of information material to an investment decision. The allegations state a claim that the statements about compensation payments were misleading because they omitted information necessary to render the statements truthful. As discussed below, the omission was material. Thus, Item 601 does not provide a defense, as a matter of law, to plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In <em>Glazer Capital Management, L.P. v. Magistri, </em>549 F.3d 736 (9th Cir.2008), a Rule 10b-5 case, the Ninth Circuit held that qualifications contained in a merger agreement and a non-public disclosure schedule did not preclude liability for misstatements of contemporaneous facts. In <em>Glazer Capital </em>the acquired company announced in a press release that an internal investigation revealed potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), and did so at a point in time between the announcement of a potential merger and the merger\u2019s closing. <em>Id. </em>at 740. This announcement contradicted language in the merger agreement stating that the company was in compliance \u201cwith all laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 741. The company reported its findings to the Department of Justice and the SEC, then subsequently entered a non-prosecution agreement, paid an $800,000 fine and received a cease-and-desist order from the SEC. <em>Id. </em>at 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Plaintiffs asserted that the company\u2019s public representation of compliance \u201cwith all laws\u201d violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. <em>Id. </em>at 742. The company argued that because the alleged misrepresentations were set forth in a merger agreement rather than a filing or statement to shareholders, and that because the merger agreement\u2019s terms were expressly qualified by an unreleased disclosure schedule, no reasonable investor would rely on the merger agreement\u2019s representations. <em>Id. </em>at 741. The Ninth Circuit rejected this argument. It described the merger as \u201ca very significant event for the company,\u201d one that should have led it to \u201cexpect[ ] intense investor interest in the details of the merger ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]hat the merger agreement was a private document and included reference to a non-public disclosure schedule would not, as a matter of law, prevent a reasonable investor from relying on its terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, language in the merger agreement asserting that the company was \u201cin compliance in all material respects with all laws\u201d was deemed actionable when the company thereafter revealed its non-compliance with the FCPA. <em>Id. </em>at 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\"><em>Glazer </em>Capitol\u2019s reasoning is persuasive and consistent with the Second Circuit\u2019s approach to disclosure obligations under Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9. <em>See Wilson v. Great Am. Inds., Inc., </em>855 F.2d 987, 992 (2d Cir.1988) (Failure to disclose a \u201cprospective\u201d or \u201ccontingent\u201d material fact may run afoul of Rule 14a-9 if \u201cthere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>appears to be a reasonable likelihood\u201d that it will occur.); <em>see also </em>SEC\u2019s Titan Report, 2005 WL 1074830, at *2 (\u201c[W]here a document containing such a representation is disclosed, if additional material facts exist, such as those contradicting or qualifying the disclosure of the original representation ... omission of which makes that disclosure misleading, a company would also be required to disclose those facts.\u201d). In this instance, Merrill\u2019s bonus scheme is portrayed merely as a contingent event, when, in fact, the negotiations resulted in an agreement as to both the amount and the timing of bonus payment. There was \u201ca great probability\u201d that the bonuses were to be awarded and paid. <em>Wilson, </em>855 F.2d at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The disclosure of the Merger Agreement\u2019s covenant that Merrill \u201cshall not ... pay any amounts to Employees not required by any current plan or agreement (other than base salary in the ordinary course of business) ...\u201d was an affirmative statement that was arguably misleading in view of the undisclosed agreement on preclosing bonus payments,</p>\n<p id=\"ADn\">b. <em>Press Reports and Past Merrill SEC Filings Did Not Render the Joint Proxy Immaterial or Establish Truth on the Market as a Matter of Law at the Rule 12(b)(6) Stage.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The BofA defendants argue that in SEC filings and other public statements, Merrill placed the plaintiffs on notice as to its bonus practices. They additionally argue that reports in the press, which anticipated bonus payouts at Merrill, placed shareholders on notice of Merrill\u2019s practices. For these reasons, they argue, among other things, that the failure to disclose the bonus arrangement was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In an October 16, 2008 press release filed via Form 8-K, Merrill stated that it had thus far accrued compensation and benefit expenses of $11.2 billion for the first nine months of 2008. (Oct. 16, 2008 8-K, at Goldin Dec. Ex. 25.) In a Merrill proxy statement of March 2008, which was distributed in advance of the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, Merrill emphasized the importance of retaining talented employees, stating that competitive pay was one route to employee retention. (Goldin Dec. Ex. 7 at 28.) It stated that Merrill \u201cemphasize[s] variable pay as the core of [its] compensation policy,\u201d including an annual incentive bonus that is \u201c[p]aid in January for performance in the prior fiscal year.\u201d (Goldin Dec. Ex. 7 at 28.) Merrill filed its Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2008 on November 5, 2008, and cited \u201cNon-interest expenses\u201d as including \u201cCompensation and benefits\u201d in the amount of $11.17 billion. (Goldin Dec. Ex. 34 at 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Defendants argue that these filings, which were incorporated by reference into the Joint Proxy (Joint Proxy at 124), left it \u201capparent to any investor\u201d that base salary constituted \u201conly a portion of the $ 11.17 billion in compensation expense\u201d accrued in the first three quarters of 2008. (BofA Sec. Mem. at 18.) They further argue that media reports in outlets such as CNN, Bloomberg News, The New York Times, NBC and Fox News discussed anticipated Merrill bonuses in October 2008, with estimated total payouts ranging from $3 billion to $6 billion. (BofA Sec. Mem. at 19-20.) Cumulatively, the defendants argue, the SEC filings and the press reports informed the investing public that Merrill would pay employee bonuses. (BofA Sec. Mem. at 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">It is true that Merrill\u2019s filings reflected the compensation expenses for 2008, but plaintiffs\u2019 theory of liability is not that Merrill accumulated excessive funds for employee compensation. Rather, the Securities Complaint posits that the proxy materials gave the false impression, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>through misstatement and omission, that Merrill compensation would be limited to payments required by a preexisting plan or agreement. In essence, the Securities Complaint\u2019s theory is that BofA secretly consented to $5.8 billion in bonus awards, which later resulted in $3.6 billion of payments that might have been materially lower if BofA had effective control over the amount of the payments after closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">The timing of the Merrill bonuses contradicts past statements of company policy. Merrill\u2019s proxy of March 2008 expressly stated that employee bonuses were to be \u201c[p]aid in January for performance in the prior fiscal year.\u201d (Goldin Dec. Ex. 7 at 28.) A reasonable shareholder could have concluded that any bonus payments would then fall under the post-closing oversight of BofA. The defendants argue that the proxy\u2019s representation as to the timing of bonuses should be disregarded, since a \u201cgeneral description\u201d of \u201ccompensation philosophy\u201d for bonuses would not necessarily apply in the event that Merrill were to be acquired. (BofA Sec. Mem. at 24.) The defendants\u2019 selective reading of the March 2008 proxy amounts to cherry picking. If representations of general \u201ccompensation philosophy\u201d cannot apply to Merrill in light of acquisition-related activities, neither, then, should Merrill\u2019s other March 2008 statements of \u201ccompensation philosophy\u201d be considered applicable, including its stated practice of administering bonus payments or offering competitive salaries as a means of retaining talented employees. (Goldin Dec. Ex. 7 at 28; BofA Sec. Mem. at 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Along with their reliance on Merrill\u2019s SEC filings, the defendants argue that press reports anticipated the bonuses in a way that placed the investing public on notice of their eventual payment. Because of these press reports, the defendants argue, any failure to disclose the bonus arrangement was immaterial, and not in violation of the securities laws. \u201cAn omission is material if there is \u2018a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the \u201ctotal mix\u201d of information made available.\u2019 \u201d <em>Halperin v. eBanker USA.com, Inc., </em>295 F.3d 352, 357 (2d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Basic Inc. v.

However, I am unable to say at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, without further context, whether the cited articles speak to the Merrill bonuses with \u201ca degree of intensity and credibility\u201d that effectively counterbalances language in the Merger Agreement and Joint Proxy. <em>Ganino, </em>228 F.3d at 167; <em>see also In re eSpeed, Inc.

Consistent with my previous discussion of Thain and Merrill, the Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims against them may proceed only to the extent that liability is premised on the theory that the bonus language materially misstated facts, and not to the extent that material information was omitted. The scienter allegations relating to the bonus arrangement are addressed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">2. <em>For Substantially the Same Reasons, the Derivative Complaint Adequately States a Claim under Section 14-(q) and Rule U.a-9.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">With slight factual variations, the Derivative Plaintiffs assert the same theory as to why non-disclosure of the bonus arrangement violated Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9. According to the Derivative Plaintiffs, as of September 14, 2008, BofA \u201chad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>agreed in principle that Merrill would be authorized to pay a bonus pool that would, at most, be \u2018flat to last year\u2019 ... with a maximum recorded expense of $4.5 billion.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 120.) This agreement was reflected in a term sheet. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 120.) Taking increased head count into account, the Complaint asserts that the BofA Defendants approved a \u201cflat\u201d bonus pool of $5.8 billion. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 122.) The Derivative Complaint also alleges that the bonus agreement was one of five significant issues negotiated by BofA and Merrill. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">As detailed above, I already have concluded that Securities Plaintiffs have adequately pled that the qualifying language in the Joint Proxy and Merger Agreement did not disclose the true bonus agreement between BofA and Merrill. That conclusion applies with equal force to the Derivative Complaint, as does the determination that the Securities Complaint adequately alleges that the Merrill bonuses were material.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">3. <em>Securities Complaint Adequately Alleges the Materiality of Defendants\u2019 Omissions Concerning Fourth Quarter 2008 Losses,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The defendants in the Securities Action also move to dismiss the '34 Act claims arising out of the deteriorating financial conditions at Merrill and BofA in the fourth quarter of 2008. Plaintiffs contend that the defendants failed to disclose $15 billion in losses at Merrill in October and November 2008, just as BofA was experiencing its first quarterly loss in company history.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">According to the Securities Complaint, in October 2008, during the time between the transaction\u2019s announcement and the filing of the Joint Proxy, Merrill lost approximately $7 billion. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 88.) In an interview with the PBS program \u201cFrontline,\u201d Thain later stated, \u201cOctober was by far the worst.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 88.) Merrill continued losing approximately $1 billion a week in November, and also incurred an impairment charge to goodwill of approximately $2 billion. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 89-91.)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">The Securities Complaint alleges that BofA was aware of these losses as they occurred, and assigned approximately 200 of its employees to monitor Merrill\u2019s financial condition. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 93.) The Securities Complaint asserts that BofA executives \u201cpersonally received regular updates as the fourth quarter progressed.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 94.) According to Thain, Merrill generated daily profit and loss statements, which were contemporaneously reviewed by BofA. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 95.) In Congressional testimony, Lewis stated that Merrill distributed \u201cdetailed financial reports every week\u201d after the Merger Agreement was signed in September. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 97.) The Securities Complaint alleges that there were internal disagreements within BofA as to whether the ongoing losses should be disclosed to shareholders. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 102.)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">The defendants first argue that, as a matter of law, BofA and Merrill had no duty to update shareholders as to their financial results on an intra-quarterly basis, since quarterly reports are the mechanism for updating company finances and SEC regulations do not require intra-quarter financial statements. <em>See, e.g., Higginbotham v. Baxter Int\u2019l Inc., </em>495 F.3d 753, 760 (7th Cir.2007) (Easterbrook, J.) (\u201cThe securities laws create a system of periodic rather than continual disclo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>sures.\u201d); <em>In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., </em>114 F.3d 1410, 1432 (3d Cir.1997) (Alito, J.) (revisions to earnings forecast do not create a \u201ccontinuous duty to update the public with either forecasts or hard information that would in anyway change a reasonable investor\u2019s perception\u201d). Yet these same rulings recognize that intra-quarter updates may be required, if intervening events trigger a duty to disclose. <em>Higginbotham, </em>495 F.3d at 760 (\u201cSilence is not \u2018fraud\u2019 <em>without a duty to disclose.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added); <em>In re Burlington Coat Factory, </em>114 F.3d at 1432 (\u201c[U]pdating might be required if a prior disclosure [had] become materially misleading in light of subsequent events.\u201d) (alteration in original; quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The Joint Proxy and the 10-Q filings for the third quarter of 2008 minced no words about the challenging economic climate and the likelihood that Merrill would continue to incur losses in the near and medium term. The Joint Proxy, which was filed on November 3, 2008, stated that Merrill had suffered significant recent losses and that economic turmoil influenced its decision to pursue the transaction. Under the \u201cRecent Developments\u201d heading, the Joint Proxy states that \u201c[o]n October 16, 2008, Merrill Lynch announced a net loss from continuing operations for the third quarter of $5.1 billion, or $5.56 per diluted share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $2.4 billion, or $2.99 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2007.\u201d (Joint Proxy at 36.) The Joint Proxy stated that in deciding to proceed with the transaction, Merrill considered \u201cthe current and prospective environment in which Merrill Lynch operates, which reflects challenging and uncertain investment banking industry conditions and risks that the Merrill Lynch board of directors <em>expected to persist, </em>including: the volatile valuations and illiquidity of certain financial assets and exposures ... [and] generally uncertain national and international economic conditions!.]\u201d (Joint Proxy at 52 (emphasis added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Defendants also point to the 10-Q filings of Merrill and Bank of America for the third quarter of 2008, which were filed on November 5 and 6, 2008, respectively. Merrill\u2019s Form 10-Q stated that the \u201cadverse market environment intensified towards the end of the quarter, particularly in September, and was characterized by increased illiquidity in the credit markets, wider credit spreads, lower business and consumer confidence, and concerns about corporate earnings and the solvency of many financial institutions.\u201d (Merrill 3Q08 10Q at 82.) \u201cTurbulent market conditions in the short and medium-term will continue to have an adverse impact on our core <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>business.\u201d (Merrill 3Q08 10Q at 83.) Separately, BofA\u2019s Form 10-Q filing of November 6, 2008, stated that \u201cresulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets has adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not expect that the difficult conditions in the financial markets are likely to improve in the near future. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry.\u201d (BofA 3Q08 10Q at 175.) BofA characterized the \u201c[c]urrent levels of market volatility\u201d as \u201cunprecedented.\u201d (BofA 3Q08 10Q at 176.) \u201cIf current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d (BofA 3Q08 10Q at 176.) Investors were placed on notice that Merrill faced similar perils: \u201cMerrill Lynch and its business are subject to many of the same difficulties resulting from the market turmoil and tightening of credit as we are.... Merrill Lynch\u2019s ability to mitigate its risk by selling or hedging its exposure is also limited by the market environment, and its future results may continue to be materially impacted by the valuation adjustments applied to these positions.\u201d (BofA 3Q08 10Q at 176-77.)</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">BofA and Merrill explicitly discussed the difficulties posed by the \u201cunprecedented\u201d economic climate and the likelihood that such difficulties would persist for the near future. Specifically, both BofA and Merrill acknowledged the risk that Merrill faced risks from economic \u201cturmoil\u201d and was suffering from \u201c[tjurbulent market conditions\u201d that \u201cwill continue to have an adverse impact on our core business\u201d in the \u201cshort and medium[ ] term.\u201d (Merrill 3Q08 10Q at 83.)</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">It is also the case that, accepting the truth of the Securities Complaint\u2019s nonconclusory allegations, at the time the Joint Proxy was filed on November 3, 2008, the defendants were aware that Merrill already had incurred approximately $7 billion in losses in October 2008. This was the highest monthly loss in the company\u2019s history. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 184.) While the Joint Proxy and the third quarter 10-Q statements indeed painted a grim portrait of Merrill\u2019s near-term and medium-term prospects, when the Securities Complaint\u2019s allegations are accepted as true, at the time the Joint Proxy issued, the defendants were aware that Merrill had suffered historically large losses in October. By the time the Joint Proxy issued, the stormy forecast for the fourth quarter was not merely a projection: the storm had arrived. These losses were a known fact to company insiders, yet were not disclosed to BofA\u2019s shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The purpose of Rule 14a-9 is to \u201censure disclosures by corporate management in order to enable the shareholders to make an informed choice.\u201d <em>TSC Indus., </em>426 U.S. at 448, 96 S.Ct. 2126. Rule 14a-9 makes it unlawful to issue a proxy statement \u201cwhich omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statement therein not false or misleading.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14a-9(a). The rule was promulgated \u201cwith the goal of preserving for all shareholders who are entitled to vote, not just for those who sponsor proposals, the right to make decisions based on information that is not false or misleading.\u201d <em>United Paperworkers, </em>985 F.2d at 1198; <em>accord MONY Group, Inc. v. Highfields Capital Mgt, L.P., </em>368 F.3d 138 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201cThe SEC rules promulgated under Section 14(a) are intended to level somewhat the playing field for proxy contes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>tants and to force disclosures that promote informed shareholder voting.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Courts have held Section 14(a) claims to be viable when proxy issuers failed to adequately incorporate filings that set forth environmental liabilities, <em>United Paperworkers, </em>985 F.2d at 1200-01, omitted discussion of directors\u2019 potentially conflicting interests, <em>Mills, </em>396 U.S. at 378, 90 S.Ct. 616, and omitted disclosure of adverse court judgments, significant company loans, and the value of significant real estate holdings, <em>Wilson, </em>855 F.2d at 991\u2014 94. In <em>Wilson, </em>the Second Circuit also held that plaintiffs had asserted a viable Section 14(a) claim when the proxy statement disclosed a subsidiary\u2019s previous annual loss of $2.5 million but failed to disclose that in the first six months of the new fiscal year, that same company had already lost $2.1 million. <em>Id. </em>at 994-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The defendants\u2019 argument that the negative forecast in the Form 10-Q filings and the Joint Proxy placed shareholders on adequate notice of Merrill\u2019s perilous financial condition is inextricably intertwined with the issue of materiality. Defendants\u2019 theory invites the Court to hold that the more general \u2014 though indisputably grim\u2014 statements concerning the economic climate\u2019s effect on Merrill were sufficient to render immaterial the non-disclosure of Merrill\u2019s actual losses. A fact is material \u201cif there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote.\u201d <em>TSC Indus., </em>426 U.S. at 449, 96 S.Ct. 2126. The \u201ctotal mix\u201d of information goes beyond a proxy\u2019s four corners and includes information \u201creasonably available to the shareholders,\u201d including media reports and documents in the public domain. <em>United Paperworkers, </em>985 F.2d at 1198-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Here, accepting the truth of the Securities Complaint\u2019s allegations, Merrill\u2019s undisclosed losses of October 2008 were the largest monthly losses in the company\u2019s history. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 184.) The defendants were aware of the losses prior to the Joint Proxy\u2019s filing. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 93-95, 97.) The Court cannot conclude, as a matter of law at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, that the broad warnings of the Joint Proxy and the two 10-Q filings \u201cenable[d] the shareholders to make an informed choice.\u201d <em>TSC Indus., </em>426 U.S. at 448, 96 S.Ct. 2126.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">This is not, as the defendants assert, tantamount to an obligation that a company issue continuous updates of its financial condition.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is instead a recognition that Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 apply even in a moment of significant \u201cturbulence\u201d and \u201cturmoil.\u201d The Joint Proxy\u2019s general warnings came to fruition, and the Securities Complaint alleges in a non-conclusory manner that the losses were well known to BofA\u2019s executives and, in November, amounted to $1 billion per week. As presently alleged, the Securities Complaint plausibly asserts that both the scope and the timing of the losses raise \u201ca substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider [them] important in deciding how to vote.\u201d <em>TSC Indus., </em>426 U.S. at 449, 96 S.Ct. 2126.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">The defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss Securities Plaintiffs\u2019 '34 Act claims, to the extent that they are premised on a failure to disclose Merrill\u2019s losses of October and November 2008, is denied. However, as will be discussed, the Securities Complaint fails to raise a cogent and compelling infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>ence of scienter as to the non-disclosure of these losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">4. <em>For Substantially the Same Reasons, the Derivative Complaint Adequately Alleges That Section 11(a) and Rule lka-9 Required the Disclosure of Merrill\u2019s Fourth Quarter Losses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The Derivative Complaint contains, in essence, the same allegations regarding he scope of Merrill\u2019s losses during the fourth quarter of 2008. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 232(f), 233(a) <em>&amp; </em>(e).) The Second Circuit \u201chas construed [Rule 14a-9] to encompass the omission of significant facts subsequent to the original dissemination of the proxy statement.\u201d <em>S.E.C. v. Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc., </em>558 F.2d 1083, 1089 n. 3 (2d Cir.1977) (citing <em>Gerstle, </em>478 F.2d at 1297 n. 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The Derivative Plaintiffs have alleged in a non-conclusory manner that Merrill incurred a $4.4 billion loss in October, prior to the distribution of the Joint Proxy on November 5, 2008. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 168.) Likewise, when BofA filed its two proxy supplements, on November 21 and November 28, 2008, Merrill already had incurred increased losses during November. <em>(Id.) </em>The Derivative Complaint alleges sufficient facts to foreclose the conclusion that, at this stage, Merrill\u2019s fourth quarter losses were immaterial as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">5. <em>Claims in the Securities and Derivative Complaints Directed to the Merger Agreement\u2019s MAC Clause Are Dismissed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">a. <em>Securities Complaint Fails to Plausibly Allege That the Defendants Violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 by Failing to Disclose Developments Related to the MAC.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">The Securities Plaintiffs assert that, to the extent that the Merger Agreement warranted that no material adverse effects would arise between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the transaction, the MAC itself triggered a disclosure duty when negative events unfolded prior to the shareholder vote. Separately, they allege that internal discussions within BofA about invoking the MAC and terminating the transaction were of sufficient importance to trigger BofA\u2019s obligation to disclose the underlying sources of concern to shareholders. These allegations fail to state a plausible claim that the defendants violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 in their conduct relating to the MAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">I begin by reviewing the relevant terms of the MAC. According to the Securities Complaint, the Merger Agreement warranted that Merrill had undergone no material adverse effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement, and that this would remain true until the close of the transaction. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 211.) The MAC provides that a \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d arises when there is \u201ca material adverse effect on (i) the financial condition, results of operations or business ... taken as whole.... \u201d (Joint Proxy at A-13.) The MAC then sets forth numerous circumstances that \u201cshall not be deemed\u201d to constitute a material adverse effect. (Joint Proxy at A-13.) These carve-outs from the MAC vary in breadth and substance, and include matters as diverse as changes in accounting standards, changes in statute or regulation, acts of terrorism, \u201cchanges in global, national, or regional political conditions ... or <em>general business, economic or market conditions.\u201d </em>the failure to meet earnings projections, and changes in stock price. (Joint Proxy at A-13 (emphasis added).)</p>\n<p id=\"ADh\">At Item 1.02 of Form 8-K, Instruction 1, the SEC has promulgated a rule that \u201c[n]o disclosure is required ... during negotiations or discussions regarding a termination of a material definitive agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>unless and until the agreement has been terminated.\u201d The SEC\u2019s regulation does not entirely dispose of the plaintiffs\u2019 MAC-related disclosure claim, however. The plaintiffs do not assert that the '34 Act was violated because the defendants failed to invoke the MAC or disclose internal deliberations on whether to invoke the MAC. Rather, they contend that the Merger Agreement warranted against the existence of a material adverse effect prior to the closing. In the plaintiffs\u2019 view, the underlying fourth quarter losses at Merrill were sufficient to require disclosure of a material adverse effect, as warranted against by the MAC. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 102.)</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The Securities Complaint fails to connect its allegations of a material adverse effect to the actual language of the MAC. The Securities Complaint does not explain how the defendants\u2019 action or inaction contradicted any specific term of the MAC. It merely cites the existence of a MAC, alleges that BofA considered its invocation, and concludes, <em>ipse dixit, </em>that a material adverse effect existed and therefore further disclosure of Merrill\u2019s underlying financial conditions was required. Of particular note is that the MAC excludes as an adverse material effect changes in <em>\u201cgeneral business, economic or market conditions </em>.... \u201d (Joint Proxy at A-13.) In failing to engage the text of the MAC, the Securities Complaint falls short of \u201cdemonstrating] with specificity why and how\u201d defendants fraudulently failed to comply with the MAC\u2019s warranty against a material adverse effect. <em>Rombach, </em>355 F.3d at 174; <em>accord ATSI, </em>493 F.3d at 99 (a securities fraud complaint must explain why statements are fraudulent in nonconclusory allegations supported by fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The Securities Plaintiffs\u2019 general averment concerning the MAC does not allege fraud with particularity, and their MAC-based claim is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">b. <em>For Substantially the Same Reasons, the Derivative Plaintiffs\u2019 Section lU(a&gt;) Claims Arising from the Terms of the MAC Are Dismissed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">For the reasons stated above, the Derivative Plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on the statement in the Joint Proxy that \u201c[e]ach of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch has made representations and warranties to the other regarding, among other things ... the absence of material adverse changes,\u201d are dismissed. (Joint Proxy at 82; Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 233(b) &amp; (c).) So, too, are the Derivative Plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on the sections 7.2(a) and 7.3(a) of the Merger Agreement, which set as a condition precedent to the merger that the representations and warranties of BofA and Merrill would be true as of the \u201cEffective Time,\u201d which the Merger Agreement identified as the date when the merger became effective. (Joint Proxy at A-l, A-40-41.)</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The allegations that certain defendants discussed invoking the MAC do not save plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Internal discussions about invoking a MAC clause, and seeking legal advice regarding the same, do not, in themselves, render misleading a statement that there has not been and will not be a material adverse effect. As stated above, the SEC does not require disclosure of negotiations and discussion regarding termination unless the agreement actually has been terminated. Item 1.02 of Form 8-K, Instruction No. 1. If the mere consideration of invoking a MAC clause required disclosure of such consideration, there would be a powerful disincentive to entertain the discussion. In some cases, this would work to the detriment of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">The Derivative Plaintiffs\u2019 claim directed to the MAC is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>c. <em>Derivative Plaintiffs\u2019 Allegations Concerning Non-Disclosure of the Decision to Invoke the MAC Clause Fail to State a Claim under Section 11(a) or Rule 110-9.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The Derivative Plaintiffs allege that the Joint Proxy should have been updated to reflect that the BofA Derivative Defendants had determined that it was in BofA\u2019s best interest to invoke the MAC clause, but they declined to do so solely due to Secretary Paulson\u2019s alleged threat to replace them. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 233(c)(c).) Instead of alleging facts showing that BofA Officers or Directors had concluded a material adverse effect had occurred or that they had decided to invoke the MAC, plaintiffs make the conclusory allegation that \u201cprior to the Shareholder Vote, Defendants Lewis, Price, Curl and the BofA Board were well aware that the significant deterioration in Merrill\u2019s asset values, and its ballooning losses, justified invoking the MAC clause, yet deceptively and in bad faith took pains to conceal these facts.... \u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 181.)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The earliest date by which the Derivative Plaintiffs allege that a defendant learned that BofA could invoke the MAC clause is December 14, 2008, which postdates the shareholder vote. Plaintiffs allege that on that date, \u201cthe Wachtell law firm opined that grounds existed to invoke [the MAC] clause to terminate the Merger.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 183.) This was over one week after the shareholder vote on December 5, 2008. The remaining allegations regarding the decision to invoke the MAC clause, and the reversal of that decision, relate to events that occurred after December 14, 2008. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 184-191.)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Similarly, plaintiffs allege that the Joint Proxy should have disclosed that \u201cmanagement had received advice from\u201d internal counsel that Merrill\u2019s losses justified invoking the MAC clause. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 232(e).) However, plaintiffs have not alleged that internal BofA counsel opined that BofA could invoke the MAC clause before the shareholder vote. The particular allegations the Derivative Plaintiffs do make state only that internal counsel both gave and received advice regarding Merrill\u2019s losses (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 167, 173, 182), but plaintiffs do not allege what that advice was. The Derivative Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 14(a) claims are dismissed to the extent they are predicated on these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">6. <em>Claims Directed to the Adequacy of BofA\u2019s Due Diligence Are Dismissed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">a. <em>The Securities Complaint Fails to Plausibly Allege That the Defendants\u2019 Representations Concerning Due Diligence Violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">The Securities Plaintiffs allege that BofA\u2019s due diligence was inadequate, and that defendants unlawfully misstated the extent of their investigation of Merrill and failed to disclose its inadequacy. According to the plaintiffs, the defendants\u2019 purported failings were material. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 184.) I conclude that the Securities Complaint fails to plausibly allege that the opinions expressed concerning the adequacy of due diligence were falsely held by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">According to the Securities Complaint, on September 15, 2008, Price said in an investor call that the due diligence performed by BofA and its financial advisor had been \u201cextensive.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 179.) Price stated that BofA was aware of Merrill\u2019s operations from their years as competitors, and had also \u201csent in a large team to review areas such as asset valuations, trading positions, and the like.\u201d (Sec. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Compl. \u00b6 179.) He stated that BofA\u2019s financial advisor was familiar with Merrill\u2019s condition because it had reviewed Merrill for other potential transactions. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 179.) Lewis stated in a press conference that the company\u2019s financial ad-visors \u201chad done quite an amount of due diligence on Merrill Lynch fairly recently, and it was very, very extensive. They had looked at the marks very comprehensively .... So that was one of the key ingredients to being able to do this as quickly as we did.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 180.) As a result of the due diligence, Lewis stated, he believed that Merrill had \u201ca much lower risk profile\u201d than before. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 180.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The Securities Complaint asserts that BofA misrepresented the scope and adequacy of its diligence efforts. It alleges that BofA had not comprehensively analyzed Merrill\u2019s finances, and had no basis to make any representation about Merrill\u2019s risk profile. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 182.) It also cites an analysis by Federal Reserve officials stating that BofA\u2019s statements implied \u201csubstantial deficiencies in the due diligence carried out in advance of and subsequent to the acquisition.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 182.) In December 2008, Bernanke allegedly told Lewis that if the transaction were terminated, it would \u201creveal the falsity of his claims regarding \u2018adequate due diligence.\u2019 \u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 183.) Mac Alfriend, a vice president at the Fed, wrote to other senior Fed officials stating that Lewis \u201cis worried about stockholder lawsuits; knows they did not do a good job of due diligence and the issues facing the company are finally hitting home .... \u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 183.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The defendants argue that their representations made as to the adequacy of due diligence were appropriately qualified, and that investors therefore could not be misled as to the scope of BofA\u2019s due diligence. As they note, in the investor call, Price was questioned by several analysts about the adequacy of due diligence \u201cgiven the extremely abbreviated time frame\u201d in which the transaction was negotiated. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 179.) Defendants also rely on BofA\u2019s statements concerning its past transactions with Merrill and its financial advisor\u2019s past experiences with Merrill, as well as Lewis\u2019s statements that Merrill had reduced its risk, as opposed to stating that it was eliminated altogether. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 179-80.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Defendants also contend that BofA\u2019s representations concerning its due diligence amounted to non-actionable statements of opinion and broad generalizations that could not be a basis for shareholder reliance. They rely on <em>ECA, Local 134, </em>553 F.3d at 205-06, which held that \u201cgeneralizations\u201d regarding \u201cbusiness practices\u201d do not \u201camount to a guarantee\u201d to shareholders. But there is a difference between enthusiastic statements amounting to general puffery and opinion-based statements that are anchored in \u201cmisrepresentations of existing facts.\u201d <em>Novak, </em>216 F.3d at 315. \u201cThe sine qua non of a securities fraud claim based on false opinion is that defendants deliberately misrepresented a truly held opinion.\u201d <em>Podany v. Robertson Stephens, Inc., </em>318 F.Supp.2d 146, 153-54 (S.D.N.Y.2004) (Lynch, J.). These statements fall into the category of fact-based expressions of opinion rather than enthusiastic, vague, forward-looking puffery.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Although there is some disagreement among the district courts in this Circuit as to whether recklessness can satisfy the subjective falsity requirement, the prevailing conclusion is that a plaintiff must allege that the defendant did not actually believe the stated opinion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The First and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Ninth Circuits have also held that a plaintiff must allege that the defendant did not sincerely believe the stated opinion. <em>See Rubke v. Capitol Bancorp Ltd,., </em>551 F.3d 1156, 1162 (9th Cir.2009); <em>In re Credit Suisse First Boston Corp., </em>431 F.3d 36, 47 (1st Cir.2005), <em>overruled on other grounds by Tellabs, </em>551 U.S. 308, 127 S.Ct. 2499. This comports with the Supreme Court\u2019s view in <em>Virginia Bankshares </em>that statements of belief are statements of fact in the sense that they convey that the speaker \u201cdo[es] act for the reasons given or hold the belief stated,\u201d and that such statements may be attacked by \u201ccircumstantial evidence bearing on the facts that would reasonably underlie the reasons claimed and the honesty of any statement\u201d regarding those reasons. 501 U.S. at 1092-93, 111 S.Ct. 2749.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u201cWhile in a misstatement of fact case the falsity and scienter requirements present separate inquiries, in false statement of opinion cases ... the falsity and scienter requirements are essentially identical.\u201d <em>Podany, </em>318 F.Supp.2d at 154. This is because the subjective falsity requirement necessarily requires an inquiry into the defendant\u2019s state of mind. In <em>Novak, </em>opinion-based statements that certain inventory-related issues were \u201cin good shape\u201d or \u201cunder control\u201d were deemed actionable when defendants were alleged to have known that the opposite was true. 216 F.3d at 315. As Judge Lynch later explained in <em>Podany, </em>\u201c[i]t is not sufficient to allege ... that it would have been possible to reach a different opinion than that reached by defendant based on information available to defendant at the time, or even that the defendant\u2019s opinion was unreasonable.\u201d 318 F.Supp.2d at 154. Judge Lynch also explained that to successfully plead that an opinion was fraudulently stated, it is tantamount to successfully pleading scienter as to those same statements, \u201csince the statement (unlike a statement of fact) cannot be false at all unless the speaker is knowingly misstating his truly held opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The reasoning of Judge Lynch and others is persuasive. Thus, the PSLRA\u2019s requirement that a plaintiff must plead \u201cwith particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind,\u201d applies to the Securities Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations concerning the adequacy of due diligence. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>The Securities Complaint fails to allege with particularity that the statements by Lewis and Price were knowingly false at the time that they were uttered. Accepting the truth of the Securities Complaint, Lewis and Price based their statements concerning the adequacy of their investigation on BofA\u2019s extensive dealings with Merrill, and its financial advisor\u2019s own long history with Merrill. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 179-80.) Their confidence was based on historic interactions, and not just an investigation undertaken over the weekend of the transaction\u2019s negotiation. Moreover, Lewis\u2019s statement that Merrill had reduced its risk was not equivalent to stating that Merrill had altogether eliminated its risk. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 180.) The Securities Complaint does not plausibly allege that these opinions were falsely held at the time that they were expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\">It is true that, months later, Fed regulators and Lewis questioned whether BofA performed adequate diligence of Merrill\u2019s risk portfolio. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 182-83.) Such retrospective critiques do not amount to an allegation that Lewis and Price knew their statements were false at the time they were uttered. Because the Securities Complaint does not plausibly allege facts that Price and Lewis falsely stated their opinions about the adequacy of due diligence, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is granted as to those statements,</p>\n<p id=\"AuY\">b. <em>Similarly, the Derivative Plaintiffs Have Not Adequately Alleged That Statements in the Joint Proxy Regarding Due Diligence Violated Section H(a) and Rule lUa-9.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The Derivative Plaintiffs allege that the Joint Proxy misrepresented the level of due diligence that was performed prior to the BofA Directors\u2019 decision to approve the merger. They quote two portions of the Joint Proxy that address the due diligence process. According to the Derivative Complaint, BofA \u201csenior management\u201d and the Financial Advisors \u201cpresented the Bank of America board of directors with the findings of their due diligence investigation of Merrill Lynch and additional information, including financial information regarding the two companies and the transaction....\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 107.) The Derivative Plaintiffs also allege that the Joint Proxy \u201cstates that the due diligence investigation the BofA Defendants made of Merrill began no earlier than the late afternoon of Saturday, September 13, 2008, and was concluded by \u2018[ejarly in the morning of Sunday, September 14, 2008,\u2019 when \u2018Messrs. Thain and Lewis met in New York City [and] discussed the results of the due diligence investigations conducted by their companies\u2019 respective representatives.\u2019 \u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 111 (alteration in original).)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The Derivative Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged that those statements were false or misleading. In fact, they repeatedly emphasize throughout the Derivative Complaint the truth of the latter statement: that the due diligence process lasted for 10 hours. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 11, 102, 105, 111, 314(a).) The Derivative Complaint\u2019s allegations regarding the due diligence process essentially assert that it was \u201centirely perfunctory,\u201d and insufficient. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b63, 10, 11, 104, 107, 111, 115, 116, 118, 245, 248, 268, 300(d), 314(a).) Merely alleging that due diligence was flawed, however, does not state a claim under Section 14(a) or Rule 14a-9, which require a misleading proxy statement. <em>See Maldonado v. Flynn, </em>597 F.2d 789, 796 (2d Cir.1979) (stating that efforts \u201cto dress up\u201d breach of fiduciary duty claims as a Section 14(a) \u201csuit of clothes have consistently been rejected\u201d); <em>Koppel, </em>167 F.3d at 133 (\u201cWe have long recognized that no general cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>lies under \u00a7 14(a) to remedy a simple breach of fiduciary duty.\u201d). The Derivative Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 14(a) claim is dismissed to the extent it is based on the statements regarding the due diligence performed prior to the board\u2019s decision to approve the merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">7. <em>Securities Complaint and the Derivar tive Complaint Both Fail to Plausibly Allege That Defendants Ran Afoul of the 'Sf Act\u2019s Duty to Update.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">a. <em>Defendants in the Securities Complaint Had No General Duty to Update Certain Statements in Light of the October and November Losses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">According to the Securities Plaintiffs, some of the defendants\u2019 representations triggered a duty to update past statements. For the reasons explained below, the duty did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\u201cA duty to update may exist when a statement, reasonable at the time it is made, becomes misleading because of a subsequent event.\u201d <em>In re IBM Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>163 F.3d 102, 110 (2d Cir.1998). There is no duty to update opinions, non-material remarks, \u201cvague statements of optimism,\u201d or statements that were not forward-looking with a \u201cfactual representation that remains \u2018alive\u2019 in the minds of investors as a continuing representation. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen objectively verifiable factors cause a significant change in a party\u2019s attitude toward a merger \u2014 a \u2018sharp break from ... prior public positions,\u2019 the securities laws may require that previously disclosed intentions be corrected.\u201d <em>In re Gulf Oil/Cities Serv.

Steinberg, </em>123 F.R.D. 66, 71 (S.D.N.Y.1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">Among the statements that the Securities Plaintiffs allege should have been updated were descriptions of the acquisition as a \u201cmajor grand slam home run,\u201d the \u201cstrategic opportunity of a lifetime,\u201d and the prediction that it would \u201ccreat[e] more value for shareholders.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 191.) These vague statements of optimism did not require updating.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Also, the characterization that Merrill had \u201cdramatically\u201d lowered its risk profile did not require updating. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 80.) Plaintiffs do not dispute that Merrill had, in fact, lowered its risk profile. This was a forward-looking statement that did not trigger a duty to update. <em>In re IBM, </em>163 F.3d at 110. In addition, BofA\u2019s representations that it had a \u201cstrong capital position\u201d and that the transaction would result in a \u201cstrong capital position, funding capabilities and liquidity\u201d from the combined company are vague statements of optimism that do not require updating. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 212-13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">The Securities Plaintiffs also point to an allegedly misleading statement by Price, who, in a conference call, asserted that approximately $10 billion earned in BofA\u2019s secondary offering \u201ccovered our anticipated needs from a Merrill standpoint.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 199.) Plaintiffs contend that this statement later required updating because, in order to absorb Merrill\u2019s losses, BofA required a capital injection from the federal government. The Securities Complaint does not, however, allege a connection between any asserted shortcomings in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Secondary Offering and the losses of the fourth quarter of 2008. Even assuming a connection between the Secondary Offering\u2019s proceeds and the need to \u201ccover[]\u201d fourth quarter losses \u2014 an interpretation of the remarks that is not supported by the text of this isolated quote \u2014 Price\u2019s statement was qualified to the extent that BofA\u2019s \u201cneeds\u201d were described as \u201canticipated.\u201d (Sec.

Compl. \u00b6 233(c)), are the type of \u201cvague statements of optimism or expressions of opinion\u201d for which there was no duty to update. <em>In re IBM, </em>163 F.3d at 110. Therefore, the Derivative Plaintiffs Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 claims based on these statements are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">8. <em>Motions to Dismiss the Securities Plaintiffs\u2019 Additional Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 Claims Are Granted in Part and Denied in Part.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">The Securities Plaintiffs assert claims that implicate statements and events that occurred following the shareholder vote. The defendants contend that these statements are not actionable under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. With the exception of the defendants\u2019 alleged non-disclosure of federal financial assistance in December 2008, which will be further discussed, the motion to dismiss for failure to allege fraudulent conduct is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">a. <em>Statements in BofA\u2019s Press Release of January 1, 2009 Are Non-Actionable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Plaintiffs allege that a January 1, 2009 press release issued by BofA contains materially false and misleading statements, to the extent it states that the acquisition created \u201ca premier financial services franchise with significantly enhanced wealth management, investment banking and international capabilities.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 229.) In an accompanying press release, defendant Lewis stated that the combined firm was \u201cuniquely positioned to win market share\u201d with its \u201csignificantly enhanced\u201d capabilities. (Sec.

Plaintiffs contend that the statement was materially false and misleading because it omitted discussion of \u201ccritical developments\u201d that allegedly threatened the transaction. (Sec.

Specifically, the Securities Complaint alleges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>that in exchange for BofA\u2019s agreement to proceed with the transaction, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve provided a $20 billion capital infusion to BofA in exchange for a sale of preferred stock, and also agreed to guarantee losses of $118 billion in risky assets, the large majority of which came from Merrill. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 132.) It further alleges that these commitments were material and undisclosed. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 134.)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">The BofA defendants argue that they had no duty to disclose their communications with regulators, \u201cno matter how material [they] may be.\u201d (BofA Sec. Mem. at 53.) They cite to the SEC rules of Form 8-K, which require disclosure of \u201cmaterial definitive agreements] not made in the ordinary course of business.\u201d Form 8-K, at Item 1.01(a). According to the defendants, the Securities Complaint does not allege a definitive agreement between BofA and federal regulators that triggered a disclosure obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">According to the minutes of a board of directors meeting on December 22, 2008, Lewis stated that \u201cthe Treasury and Fed have confirmed that they will provide assistance to the Corporation to restore capital and to protect the Corporation against the adverse impact of certain Merrill Lynch assets,\u201d that \u201cthe Corporation can rely on the Fed and Treasury to complete and deliver the promised support by January 20, 2009, the date scheduled for the release of earnings by the Corporation,\u201d and that \u201cthe incoming economic team of the new administration are informed of the commitment to the Corporation by the Fed and Treasury and that all concur with the commitment of the combined federal regulators (\u2018federal regulators\u2019) to the Corporation.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 132.) The minutes summarize Lewis\u2019s remarks stating that management\u2019s recommendation to proceed with the acquisition was based on \u201cthe verbal commitment of the Fed and Treasury to have a transaction evidencing the Fed and Treasury\u2019s committed assistance in existence no later than January 20, 2009,\u201d as well as \u201cthe assurances which have been made by the Fed and Treasury and clarification that funds under the TARP program are available for distribution to the Corporation to fulfill the commitment of the Treasury and Fed.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 133.)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">According to the Securities Complaint, Lewis told the board of directors that there could be no written agreement with the federal government because such an agreement would be publicly disclosed. In an e-mail sent to the board of directors on December 22, 2008, Lewis stated: \u201cI just talked with Hank Paulson. He said that there was no way the Federal Reserve and the Treasury could send us a letter of any substance without public disclosure, which, of course, we do not want.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 134.) According to board meeting minutes, on December 30, 2008, Lewis informed the board of directors that \u201cmanagement has obtained detailed oral assurances from the federal regulators with regard to their commitment and has documented those assurances with e-mails and detailed notes of management\u2019s conversations with the federal regulators.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 135.) At the same meeting, according to the minutes, Lewis \u201cdiscussed in detail several of the conversations between Mr. Price and Mr. Warsh establishing essential elements of the commitment of the federal regulators including ... the commitment of federal regulators to deliver assistance in the form of capital and asset production to the Corporation.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 135.) Lewis said that BofA \u201chad clearly explained to the federal regulators the terms and conditions\u201d required to complete the transaction, and received \u201cstrong assurances from all relevant federal regulators and policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>makers\u201d that BofA would receive \u201cadequate and appropriate assets to neutralize the impact of the financial condition of the Corporation resulting from the Corporation\u2019s acquisition of Merrill Lynch on January 1, 2009.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 135.) The minutes of the December 30 meeting further state, \u201cMr. Lewis explained that written assurances would not be received before January 1, 2009, because any written assurances would require formal action by the Fed and Treasury, which formal action would require public disclosure.\u201d (See. Compl. \u00b6 136.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">These detailed, non-conclusory allegations plausibly allege that BofA received concrete assurances from officials at the Treasury and the Federal Reserve that BofA would receive a massive capital infusion in exchange for proceeding with the Merrill acquisition. (See. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 132-36.) As noted, the defendants contend that any agreement was not \u201cdefinitive.\u201d Form 8-K, at Item 1.01(a). The authorities cited by defendants are distinguishable. Both <em>Vladimir v. Bioenvision, Inc., </em>606 F.Supp.2d 473, 486 (S.D.N.Y.2009), and <em>Glazer v. Formica Corp., </em>964 F.2d 149, 157 (2d Cir.1992), rejected claims about the conduct of merger negotiations. Here, the Securities Complaint alleges that a definitive agreement was reached between Bank of America and federal regulators but was intentionally not memorialized in order to avoid public disclosure. Plaintiffs have adequately alleged the particulars of fraud under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. However, as explained below, the Securities Complaint fails to adequately allege scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">c. <em>Lewis\u2019s September 15 Remarks About Merrill\u2019s Liquidity Are Non-Actionable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The Securities Plaintiffs also allege that Lewis issued false statements concerning Merrill\u2019s liquidity and its sustainability as an independent entity. During the September 15, 2008 investor call, Lewis was questioned about the premium paid for Merrill, and stated, \u201cOne, probably the more likely is that Merrill had the liquidity and capacity to see this through. It\u2019s not necessarily easy because of just the times. But more likely than not, they would have seen this through and come out the other side.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 185 (emphasis omitted).) According to plaintiffs, Thain later stated that Merrill\u2019s sale was motivated by impending insolvency. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 186.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Thain\u2019s subsequent remarks cannot be imputed to Lewis, however, and the Securities Complaint does not plead with particularity that Lewis knew that his heavily qualified statement about Merrills liquidity was false at the time that he uttered it. <em>See Novak, </em>216 F.3d at 315; <em>Podany, </em>318 F.Supp.2d at 153-54. Because plaintiffs\u2019 theory of liability is premised on conclusorily imputing Thain\u2019s knowledge to Lewis, they fail to state a claim as to Lewis\u2019s September representations concerning Merrill\u2019s liquidity.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">d. <em>Statements by Lewis Regarding Regulator Pressure and Thain\u2019s Self-Interest Are Non-Actionable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">According to the Securities Complaint, Lewis made materially false and misleading statements on the September 15 investor call regarding federal pressure to complete the acquisition. In response to analyst questions about whether federal regulators pushed for the deal to be done quickly, Lewis stated that \u201cthere was absolutely no pressure.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 187.) According to the Securities Complaint, however, Treasury Secretary Paul-son spoke to Thain and demanded the transaction\u2019s completion by September 15. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 188.) In an interview with the PBS program \u201cFrontline,\u201d Thain recalled Paulson telling him, \u201cJohn, you\u2019d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>better make sure this happens.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 65.)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">The Securities Complaint also alleges that Lewis issued a false statement when he denied that Thain was motivated by self-interest during the negotiations. In the September 15 call, Lewis said in reference to Thain that \u201cit was never about him; it was always about the deal.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 189.) According to the plaintiffs, the negotiations were heavily focused on Thain\u2019s ability to receive a large compensation package for himself and his colleagues, to the point where bonus terms were one of the negotiation\u2019s biggest sticking points. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 190.) Lewis also retrospectively described the bonus talks as implicating \u201cpetty kind of selfish things.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 78.)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">With respect to the foregoing, the plaintiffs have not alleged fraud with particularity. While Lewis\u2019s denial of federal pressure was a statement of then-existing fact, the Securities Complaint does not allege with particularity that Lewis possessed any knowledge that contradicted his public comments. In their opposition memorandum, the plaintiffs attempt to impute Thain\u2019s conversations with Paulson to Lewis, arguing that the Securities Complaint does not allege that pressure was exerted \u201csolely\u201d on Lewis and observing that it is \u201cnot credible\u201d that BofA would have expedited the transaction without federal pressure. (Sec. Opp. Mem. at 60.) Such allegations are premised upon speculation and fail to satisfy the PSLRA\u2019s bar against \u201cconclusory\u201d fraud claims \u201cunsupported by factual assertions.... \u201d <em>ATSI, </em>493 F.3d at 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Lewis\u2019s comments that Thain\u2019s actions were \u201calways about the deal\u201d and \u201cnever about him\u201d were subjective characterizations concerning Thain\u2019s character and intentions, and were too vague and opinion-based for a reasonable investor to rely upon them as a statement of fact. <em>See In re Merrill Lynch Auction Rate Sec.

Compl. \u00b6 232(a).) In addition, plaintiffs allege that the Joint Proxy failed to disclose the \u201csubstantial risk that the true value of those assets was substantially less than the stated value, impairing the value of the Merger to BofA shareholders.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 232(c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">The allegation that the BofA Directors concealed Merrill\u2019s financial condition was addressed in substance above. The remainder of these allegations are conclusory. <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949. They do not identify which assets were too complex or illiquid to value accurately or what the actual values were. In addition, the Joint Proxy disclosed that one of the considerations of Merrill\u2019s board in recommending the merger was the \u201cvolatile valu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ations and illiquidity of certain financial assets\u201d of Merrill. (Joint Proxy at 52.) Thus, the Derivative Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 14(a) claims are dismissed to the extent they are predicated on the statements regarding the value of Merrill\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">b. <em>Derivative Plaintiffs Have Not Adequately Alleged That Statements about Steps Taken to Improve Merrill\u2019s Financial Condition Were Misleading.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The Joint Proxy stated that Merrill continued to \u201creduce exposures and de-leverage [its] balance sheet.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 134.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In addition, plaintiffs allege that during a September 15, 2008, press conference, defendant Price stated that Merrill had made progress in reducing its risk exposure. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 234.) At the same press conference, Lewis stated that a member of J.C. Flowers had commented that Merrill\u2019s marks were \u201cnight and day from the time we first looked at it to now.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 236.)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The Derivative Plaintiffs claim that these statements were misleading because Merrill, in fact, was suffering additional losses throughout October and November 2008. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20, 232(d).) But the fact that Merrill continued to suffer additional losses does not mean that Merrill had not reduced its exposure and deleveraged its balance sheet. Plaintiffs have not alleged that Merrill took some action \u2014 other than suffering losses \u2014 that increased its leverage. In addition, the Merrill 3Q08 Form 10-Q, which was incorporated by reference into the Joint Proxy, disclosed that \u201c[t]urbulent market conditions in the short and medium-term will continue to have an adverse impact the valuation adjustments\u201d to Merrill\u2019s positions. (Merrill 3Q08 Form 10-Q at 83.) The BofA 3Q08 Form 10-Q stated that Merrill\u2019s \u201cfuture results may continue to be materially impacted by the valuation adjustments....\u201d (BofA 3Q08 Form 10Q at 177.) However, even if plaintiffs could allege facts demonstrating that these statements were misleading \u2014 which they do not \u2014 those statements cannot form the basis of a claim under Section 14(a) or Rule 14a-9, which are directed to the contents of a proxy solicitation. The comments here were made at a press conference, and there is no allegation that they were incorporated by reference into the Joint Proxy. Therefore, plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under Section 14(a) or Rule 14a-9 based on the above statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">c. <em>Derivative Plaintiffs Have Not Adequately Alleged That Statements Regarding Additional Government Funds to Close the Merger and the Government Guarantee Were Misleading.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">The Joint Proxy discussed the federal government\u2019s Capital Purchase Program (\u201cCPP\u201d), in which the government was authorized to invest in financial institutions and to purchase the financial instruments the institutions held. (Joint Proxy at 35.) The Joint Proxy disclosed that BofA had entered into an agreement with the Treasury by which the Treasury would purchase $15 billion of a \u201cnew series of preferred stock.\u201d (Joint Proxy at 35.) In addition, if the merger were completed prior to the Treasury\u2019s planned investment in Merrill, then the Treasury would purchase from BofA $10 billion in additional preferred stock. (Joint Proxy at 35.) The Joint Proxy further disclosed that, in light of the pending merger, Merrill had decid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>ed not to sell securities to the Treasury. (Joint Proxy at 36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">According to Derivative Plaintiffs, these statements \u201cbecame false and misleading when the [Joint Proxy] was never updated to include information concerning Merrill\u2019s and BofA\u2019s growing third and fourth quarter losses, which were already approximately $15.3 billion by this time and which would require additional TARP funding for BofA to close the Merger and absorb Merrill.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 148.) The fact that these two companies were suffering losses during the fourth quarter does not make the statements about BofA\u2019s and Merrill\u2019s participation in the CPP false or misleading. Plaintiffs allege that the statements were false or misleading because \u201calmost immediately after the votes were tallied, the [BofA Derivative Defendants] went to the federal government to seek additional assistance (on top of the $25 billion already received in that fall).\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 177.) However, plaintiffs have not alleged facts sufficient to draw a reasonable inference that prior to the shareholder vote any defendant knew that BofA would need additional federal funding. In fact, plaintiffs quote from an article in their Derivative Complaint which states that \u201c[discussions over these [additional government] funds began in mid-December when Bank of America approached the Treasury Department.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 241.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The Derivative Plaintiffs have not stated a Section 14(a) claim based on these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">d. <em>Derivative Plaintiffs Have Not Alleged That the BofA Directors\u2019 Recommendation Regarding the Merger Was Subjectively False.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">In the Joint Proxy, the BofA Directors recommended the transaction\u2019s approval. According to the Joint Proxy, the BofA board \u201cdetermined that the merger, merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Bank of America and its stockholders and unanimously recommends that you vote \u2018FOR\u2019 approval of the issuance of shares of Bank of America common stock in the merger.\u201d (Joint Proxy at 29.) According to plaintiffs, these \u201crecommendations were based on the BofA Defendants\u2019 bad faith and disloyalty in desiring to acquire Merrill no matter what the price tag or future liabilities, not on any reasoned determination that the transaction was in the best interests of BofA or its shareholders.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 156.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">The Derivative Plaintiffs do not dispute that the board\u2019s recommendation of the merger was a statement of opinion. As previously discussed, statements of opinion are actionable under Section 14(a) only if they are objectively and subjectively false. <em>Virginia Bankshares, </em>501 U.S. at 1092-93, 111 S.Ct. 2749. As discussed, to satisfy the subjective falsity requirement, \u201cplaintiffs must allege with particularity that defendants did not sincerely believe the opinion they purported to hold.\u201d <em>Podany, </em>318 F.Supp.2d at 154. Thus, the PSLRA\u2019s requirement that a plaintiff must plead \u201cwith particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind,\u201d applies to the Derivative Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the BofA Directors\u2019 opinion was false or misleading. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">The Derivative Plaintiffs have not alleged that the board members did not actually hold the opinion they expressed in the Joint Proxy. In fact, in Count VIII of the Derivative Complaint, the count asserting the Section 14(a) claim, plaintiffs state that their claim for relief \u201cis not based on any allegations of knowing or reckless conduct by any defendant,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>that plaintiffs\u2019 Section 14(a) \u201cclaim does not allege, and does not sound in, fraud, and Plaintiffs disclaim any reliance upon or reference to allegations of fraud.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 346.) Even if allegations of recklessness could satisfy the subjective falsity requirement, which, as discussed above, they cannot, the Derivative Plaintiffs have disclaimed any allegation of recklessness in their Section 14(a) claims.

In scrutinizing scienter allegations, a court is to consider \u201cwhether <em>all </em>of the facts alleged, taken collectively, give rise to a strong inference of scienter, not whether any individual allegation, scrutinized in isolation, meets that standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322-23, 127 S.Ct. 2499 (emphasis in original). A court also \u201cmust take into account plausible opposing inferences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323, 127 S.Ct. 2499. This requires close and comparative scrutiny: \u201c[T]he inference of scienter must be more than merely \u2018reasonable\u2019 or \u2018permissible\u2019 \u2014 it must be cogent and compelling, thus strong in light of other explanations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324,127 S.Ct. 2499.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">In satisfying the scienter pleading threshold, \u201c[a] complaint will survive ... only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324, 127 S.Ct. 2499. A plaintiff may demonstrate this by alleging facts \u201c(1) showing that the defendants had both motive and opportunity to commit the fraud or (2) constituting strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.\u201d <em>ATS I, </em>493 F.3d at 99. Motives that are common to corporate officers \u2014 for instance, \u201cthe desire for the corporation to appear profitable and the desire to keep stock prices high to increase officer compensation\u201d \u2014 do not rise to the level of scienter. <em>ECA Local 134, </em>553 F.3d at 198. \u201cRather, the \u2018motive\u2019 showing is generally met when corporate insiders allegedly make a misrepresentation in order to sell their own shares at a profit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When the defendant is a corporate entity, \u201cthe pleaded facts must create a strong inference that someone whose intent could be imputed to the corporation acted with the requisite scienter.\u201d <em>Teamsters Local 445 Freight Div.

Dynex Capital Inc., </em>531 F.3d 190, 195 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Alternatively, a plaintiff who cannot make a scienter showing through motive and opportunity can still \u201craise a strong inference of scienter under the strong circumstantial evidence prong, though the strength of the circumstantial allegations must be correspondingly greater if there is no motive.\u201d <em>ECA Local 134, </em>553 F.3d at 198-99 (quotation marks omitted). The Second Circuit has stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u201csecurities fraud claims typically have sufficed to state a claim based on recklessness when they have specifically alleged defendants\u2019 knowledge of facts or access to information contradicting their public statements. Under such circumstances, defendants knew or, more importantly, should have known that they were misrepresenting material facts related to the corporation.\u201d <em>Novak, 216 </em>F.3d at 308. In addition, recklessness also may be successfully pleaded \u201cwhere plaintiffs alleged facts demonstrating that defendants failed to review or check information that they had a duty to monitor, or ignored obvious signs of fraud.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Circumstantial evidence may support a claim of \u201cdeliberate illegal behavior,\u201d or \u201cconduct which is highly unreasonable and which represents an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cIntentional misconduct is easily identified since it encompasses deliberate illegal behavior, such as securities trading by insiders privy to undisclosed and material information, or knowing sale of a company\u2019s stock at an unwarranted discount.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Defendants contend that the PSLRA and Rule 9(b) apply to the plaintiffs\u2019 Section 14(a) claims, and that because the plaintiffs\u2019 Section 14(a) claims sound in fraud, they are required to allege scienter under the PSLRA and Rule 9(b). <em>Wilson, </em>however, held that negligence is sufficient to establish liability under Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9: \u201cLiability can be imposed for negligently drafting a proxy statement.\u201d 855 F.2d at 995. It concluded that a proxy statement containing \u201cmaterially false or misleading statements\u201d was, \u201c[a]s a matter of law,\u201d sufficient to establish liability under Rule 14a-9. <em>Id. </em>Judge Posner\u2019s opinion in <em>Beck, </em>559 F.3d at 682, is also instructive.

In <em>Rombach, </em>the Second Circuit concluded that when a '33 Act complaint employs verbiage more commonly associated with fraud than negligence, claims under the '33 Act may be subject to Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA\u2019s heightened pleading standard. <em>Id. </em>at 171. Rombach\u2019s concerns do not apply here. While the defendants argue that the Securities Complaint\u2019s characterization of the Joint Proxy as \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d assert claims that sound in fraud, the text of Rule 14a-9 itself prohibits the speaker from uttering \u201cfalse or misleading\u201d statements \u201cwith respect to any material fact .... \u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14a-9(a). The defendants\u2019 proposed application of <em>Rombach </em>would treat any Rule 14a-9 claim quoting the underlying rule as one sounding in fraud. Such a reading is inconsistent with <em>Wilson, </em>as well as the persuasive reasoning of <em>Beck.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Moreover, the plaintiffs have expressly disavowed any claim of fraud as to their Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 claims.

BofA\u2019s top human resources officer later stated that there was a \u201cgiant gap\u201d between the bonuses administered at BofA and those at Merrill, and stated that for every dollar in bonuses a BofA employee might receive, a Merrill employee would receive three.

According to the Securities Complaint, both were closely involved in the details of the bonus negotiations, the resolution of which was concealed to BofA shareholders and, the Securities Complaint asserts, contradictory to representations in the Merger Agreement and the Joint Proxy. Together, these allegations raise an inference of recklessness that is \u201cat least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.\u201d <em>Tellabs, </em>551 U.S. at 314, 127 S.Ct. 2499; <em>see also Freudenberg v.

(scienter adequately alleged when internal communications about pursuing high-risk loans contradicted public statements of conservative investment philosophy).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">By contrast, the plaintiffs fail to allege scienter as to defendants Price and Cotty. In their opposition memorandum, the plaintiffs argue that \u201cdetailed allegations demonstrate^]\u201d close involvement by Price and Cotty in the transaction, rendering it \u201cneither plausible nor credible\u201d that they were unaware of the bonus arrangement. (Sec. Opp. Mem. at 78.) As support, plaintiffs cite only to remarks by Price concerning due diligence and general allegations about Price and Cotty\u2019s roles in the negotiations. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36-37, 179.) The allegations are too thin to ascribe even negligence to Price or Cotty, as Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 require.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">As to the BofA directors, the Securities Complaint fails to allege scienter, but ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>quately alleges negligence. The Securities Complaint alleges that the board of directors \u201cvoted to approve the merger, including Merrill\u2019s bonuses .... \u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 55.) The plaintiffs do not allege with particularity that the BofA directors recklessly or intentionally violated Section 14(a). The Joint Proxy failed to disclose the bonus arrangement or summarize the relevant contents of the Disclosure Schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">The Joint Proxy was solicited on the directors\u2019 behalf. <em>(See </em>Joint Proxy, Proxy Card.) As directors, they had authority over the Joint Proxy and other SEC filings, reviewed the contents of the Merger Agreement and recommended shareholder approval of the transaction. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 55, 206, 315-16, 345.) If the directors were aware that the Joint Proxy was materially deficient (as is alleged), or if they should have been aware of deficiencies but took no steps to remedy or inquire about them (as is also alleged), the negligence standard of Section 14(a) would be satisfied. <em>Wilson, </em>855 F.2d at 995; <em>In re JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Sec. Litig., </em>MDL No. 1783, 2007 WL 4531794, at *8 (N.D.Ill. Dec. 18, 2007). An allegation of deliberate non-disclosure \u201cdemonstrates a culpable state of mind far in excess of negligence.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>855 F.2d at 995. The Securities Complaint sufficiently alleges negligence on the part of BofA\u2019s directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The motions to dismiss the Securities Complaint\u2019s bonus-related allegations is therefore granted in full as to Price and Cotty, and granted as to the Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims asserted against the BofA directors.

The negligence standard is satisfied if the directors were aware that the Joint Proxy was materially deficient. <em>Wilson, </em>855 F.2d at 995. According to the Derivative Complaint, the bonus payment was one of five issues negotiated between BofA and Merrill. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 101.) BofA agreed to allow Merrill to pay $5.8 billion in bonuses on an accelerated basis prior to the transaction\u2019s closing. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 101.) The Derivative Complaint alleges that the BofA Directors reviewed the terms of the proposed transaction before approving it. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 107.) Finally, the Derivative Plaintiffs allege that the bonus payments were \u201cknown to\u201d Lewis and BofA\u2019s Compensation and Benefits Committee (composed of defendants Mitchell, Ryan, Sloan and Spangler), and that these defendants \u201cspecifically approved\u201d the bonus payments. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 53-56, 224.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Although the BofA Directors relied on others, including legal counsel, to prepare the Joint Proxy, it is plausibly alleged that they should have been aware that it did not disclose the existence of the bonus agreement. Such an allegation is sufficient. This is not akin to holding the BofA Directors to a strict liability standard. <em>Cf. Salit v. Stanley Works, </em>802 F.Supp. 728, 733 (D.Conn.1992) (\u201cWhere plaintiffs have not pled that the individual defendants knew of the facts allegedly omitted from the proxy statement (and, not being alleged to have been personally involved in its issuance, therefore, had no duty to see that they were included in the statement), plaintiffs have insufficiently pled a negligence claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\"><em>In re McKesson HBOC, Inc., </em>relied upon by the BofA Directors, is distinguishable. 126 F.Supp.2d at 1267. In that case, the directors of an acquiring corporation relied on the audit provided by the acquired company\u2019s accounting firm, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>so were unaware of the underlying accounting improprieties that were not disclosed in the proxy statement. <em>Id. </em>Here, according to the Derivative Complaint, the BofA Directors were aware of the bonus agreement, and a review of the Joint Proxy would have shown them that the agreement was not disclosed. It is true, as defendants argue, that the negligence standard \u201cdoes not make impermissible any reliance on expertise of legal or financial counsel in areas pertinent to their respective expertise,\u201d or \u201cimpose upon directors the role of guarantors or insurers of the accuracy of proxy statements.\u201d <em>Gould v.

Eichler, </em>264 F.3d 131, 142-44 (2d Cir.2001), the Second Circuit discussed the threshold for pleading scienter against a defendant who is alleged to have recklessly failed to disclose material facts to shareholders. A plaintiff must allege, \u201c \u2018at the least, conduct which is highly unreasonable and which represents an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142 (quoting <em>Honeyman v. Hoyt (In Re Carter-Wallace, Inc. Sec, Litig.), </em>220 F.3d 36, 39 (2d Cir.2000)). Discussing <em>Novak </em>and <em>Roth-man, Kalnit </em>noted that a reckless omission case arises when a defendant knowingly sanctions procedures that violate company policy or avoids adequate financial disclosure. <em>Id. </em>at 142-43. For scienter purposes, the Second Circuit distinguished <em>misleading statements </em>in the merger context from a defendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful <em>omissions: </em>\u201cBecause, as discussed earlier, this case does not present facts indicating a clear duty to disclose, plaintiffs scienter allegations do not provide <em>strong </em>evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">As discussed in detail above, the Joint Proxy and the defendants\u2019 Form 10-Q filings for the third quarter of 2008 contained detailed disclosures of the dire economic forecast for the coming fourth quarter. I have previously concluded that, at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, plaintiffs have adequately alleged the materiality of the fourth quarter losses. However, the Securities Complaint fails to allege <em>\u201cstrong </em>evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). This is not an instance when, for example, a company\u2019s alleged financial perils were misleadingly downplayed or concealed by accounting abuses, only to be contradicted by internal documents. <em>See, e.g., AUSA Life Ins. Co. v. Ernst &amp; Young, </em>206 F.3d 202, 220-22 (2d Cir.2000). The Securities Complaint sufficiently alleges that the magnitude of the losses was material, but does not sufficiently allege how the failure to disclose the losses was <em>\u201chighly </em>unreasonable\u201d and \u201crepresented] an <em>extreme departure </em>from the standards of ordinary care .... \u201d <em>Kalnit, </em>264 F.3d at 142 (empha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>sis added). The Securities Complaint fails to adequately and plausibly explain why a defendant would be motivated to accurately disclose a \u201cturbulent\u201d and \u201ctumultuous\u201d economic forecast for the quarter yet recklessly or intentionally conceal the dire reality as the quarter unfolded.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Because the Securities Complaint fails to allege scienter as to defendants\u2019 failure to disclose the fourth quarter losses, plaintiffs\u2019 Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims arising from the defendants\u2019 failure to disclose the fourth quarter losses are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">2. <em>Securities Complaint Adequately Alleges Negligence As to the Losses, and Its Section 11(a) and Rule lIa-9 Claims Survive.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">To plead negligence under Section 14(a), the plaintiffs need not allege \u201chighly unreasonable\u201d conduct, an \u201cextreme departure\u201d from the ordinary of care, or <em>\u201cstrong </em>evidence\u201d of recklessness. <em>Kalnit, </em>264 F.3d at 142, 144. The Securities Complaint need only allege awareness of material deficiencies in a proxy statement. <em>Wilson, </em>855 F.2d at 995. In this respect, there is a significant distinction between conduct that is knowingly or recklessly fraudulent, which the Securities Complaint has failed to allege, versus awareness of deficiencies. The Securities Complaint does not satisfy the threshold of alleging fraud; it does, however, adequately set forth a theory grounded in negligence. As previously noted, Cotty acted as Merrill\u2019s interim CEO, had weekly meetings with Thain and provided regular updates to Lewis and Price. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 93-97.) Lewis held weekly meetings with the board of directors to update it on Merrill\u2019s losses. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 99.) According to the Securities Complaint, the individual defendants were aware of the losses as they were incurred and failed to disclose them, despite internal dissent as to whether the losses should be disclosed in advance of the shareholder vote. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 102.)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Proxy statements must disclose \u201call material objective facts relating to the transaction.\u201d <em>Mendell, </em>927 F.2d at 674. The Securities Complaint plausibly alleges that the fourth quarter losses were material, that all defendants were aware of the losses as they occurred, and that they had a duty to disclose them. As a result, the Securities Complaint adequately alleges a strong inference of negligence on the part of the defendants as to the failure to disclose the losses of the fourth quarter of 2008. Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss this portion of plaintiffs\u2019 Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 claims are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">3. <em>Derivative Complaint Adequately Alleges Negligence As to Merrill\u2019s Fourth Quarter Losses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Section 6.2 of the Merger Agreement obligated Merrill to grant BofA access to all of its \u201cproperties, books, contracts, commitments and records.\u201d (Joint Proxy at A-34.) According to the Derivative Complaint, shortly after the merger was announced, BofA placed a 200-member team at Merrill. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 170.) The BofA Directors \u201cconducted weekly conference calls every Friday starting in September 2008 and continuing through December 2008 .... \u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 170.) After the merger was announced, defendant Lewis began receiving financial projections and reports on Merrill\u2019s financial condition. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 165-66.) Weekly reports containing Merrill\u2019s actual losses for the fourth quarter were distributed to Lewis and other defendants. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 20.) These reports showed that Merrill lost $7 billion in October and $6.3 billion in November. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 20.) According to the Derivative Complaint, the BofA Derivative Defendants \u201cdecided not to disclose such losses following a telephone call on November 20, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>2008 with the Wachtell law firm.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 167.)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Drawing all reasonable inferences in them favor, the Derivative Plaintiffs have raised a strong inference that the BofA Directors were aware of the losses incurred by Merrill during the fourth quarter of 2008. Although the Derivative Plaintiffs do not allege that the BofA Directors discussed Merrill\u2019s losses or its financial performance during their weekly conference calls, it is reasonable to infer that they did, given the size of the Merrill transaction (27 percent of BofA\u2019s market capitalization (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 103)) and the fact that BofA senior management received regular reports on Merrill\u2019s performance. Therefore, the Derivative Plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts to allow this claim to progress past the pleading stage. Finally, as discussed previously, the BofA Directors\u2019 advice-of-counsel defense is unavailing at this stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">F. <em>Securities Complaint Does Not Allege Scienter for the Failure to Disclose Federal Financial Support for the Transaction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The Securities Complaint fails to satisfy the PSLRA\u2019s scienter threshold as to BofA\u2019s agreement to receive federal capital support in December 2008. The scienter allegations on this claim are thin. The Securities Complaint explicitly asserts scienter only as to Lewis\u2019s actions. The scienter allegations going to the other individual defendants make no mention of the issue. Other portions of the Securities Complaint that assert a Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim going to federal support say little by way of the defendants\u2019 states of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Plaintiffs contend that Lewis was \u201cconscious\u201d of avoiding liability over nondisclosure of federal financial support, since he unsuccessfully sought out a letter from Bernanke providing immunity from civil claims arising out of the acquisition. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6244.) The Securities Complaint does not, however, contend that Lewis or any other defendant stood to gain from non-disclosure. Plaintiffs do not allege that a quid pro quo-type arrangement was implicated in Lewis\u2019s request to Bernanke, or that failing to disclose the federal funding brought a benefit to any defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">The Securities Complaint also alleges that the decision not to disclose federal support originated in an instruction by Paulson. According to the Securities Complaint, Paulson \u201cinstructed\u201d Lewis not to disclose BofA\u2019s receipt of federal financial support, among other things. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 249.) Lewis also noted in an email to the Board that Secretary Paulson declined to \u201csend us a letter of any substance without public disclosure which, of course, we do not want.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 134 (emphasis omitted).) There is no allegation that Lewis or any other defendant hatched a scheme to avoid public disclosure of the federal capital support. Rather than self-interested motivations, Lewis, according to the Securities Complaint, acted as \u201cinstructed\u201d by Paulson. While Paulson\u2019s instruction would not necessarily preclude a finding of scienter if other allegations established motive or recklessness, it anchors the defendants\u2019 concealment to Paulson\u2019s directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">The Securities Complaint also asserts that BofA long intended to disclose the federal support in tandem with its announcement of fourth quarter results. For instance, Board minutes note that the Fed and Treasury had promised \u201cto complete and deliver the promised support by January 20, 2009, the date scheduled for the release of earnings .... \u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 132.) According to Board minutes, BofA planned to announce the federal support \u201cin conjunction with [BofA\u2019s] earnings release on January 20, 2009,\u201d and no written assurance would be made prior to January 1, 2009, \u201cbecause any written assurances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>would require formal action by the Fed and Treasury, which formal action would require public disclosure.\u201d (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 136.) As it had planned, BofA announced the federal financial support on January 16, in tandem with its announcement of the fourth-quarter financial results. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 144-45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The Complaint does not plausibly allege how the announcement\u2019s timing offers circumstantial evidence of intent or motive to deceive and defraud. <em>See, e.g., ECA, Local 134, </em>553 F.3d at 199 (to allege motive and opportunity to defraud, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant \u201cbenefitted in some concrete and personal way from the purported fraud.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). Nor does it reflect \u201chighly unreasonable\u201d conduct representing \u201can extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care .... \u201d <em>Kalnit, </em>264 F.3d at 142. Rather, assuming the truth of the Complaint\u2019s allegations, the defendants were acting at the instruction of the Treasury Secretary during a moment of acute economic and political uncertainty. There are no allegations of personal gain derived from the federal funds, or a violation of a statute or regulation in a \u201chighly unreasonable\u201d manner. As currently pleaded, the plaintiffs fail to allege scienter as to the non-disclosure of BofA\u2019s federal financial support, and the claim is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">V. <em>DERIVATIVE PLAINTIFFS HAVE ADEQUATELY ALLEGED LOSS CAUSATION FOR THEIR SECTION Ufa) CLAMS AGAINST THE BOFA DIRECTORS AND DEMAND IS EXCUSED FOR THOSE CLAMS.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">A. <em>Derivative Plaintiffs Have Adequately Alleged Loss Causation for Their Section Ufa) Claims Against the BofA Directors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The PSLRA requires a plaintiff to sufficiently allege \u201cthat the act or omission of the defendant ... caused the loss for which the plaintiff seeks to recover damages.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(4). The defendants in the Securities Action have not challenged the Securities Complaint\u2019s loss causation allegations. The defendants in the Derivative Action, however, argue that it was not possible for any alleged nondisclosure to have harmed BofA because BofA\u2019s directors and certain senior officers allegedly knew the truth. Therefore, their knowledge should be imputed to BofA, which could not have been misled by the Joint Proxy.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">In general, the knowledge of fully-informed, disinterested and independent directors will be attributed to the corporation. <em>Maldonado, </em>597 F.2d at 795 (dismissing a derivative claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 because the knowledge of disinterested directors \u201cwas attributable to the Corporation and no 'deception\u2019 occurred within the meaning of Rule 10b-5\u201d). However, the BofA Derivative Defendants\u2019 argument is inapplicable in the context of the Derivative Action. First, the only Second Circuit authority defendants cite in support of their argument is the <em>Maldonado </em>case, which recognized that \u201c[w]hen a corporate action requires shareholders\u2019 approval, full disclosure of material information must be made to them.\u201d 597 F.2d at 793. \u201cWhere approval by the shareholders is not necessary, however, full disclosure to a disinterested board of directors is equivalent to full disclosure to the shareholders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Only where shareholder approval is unnecessary will the \u201cknowledge of the disinterested\u201d directors \u201cbe attributed to the corporation and its stockholders, precluding deception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is not the case here, because the BofA shareholders\u2019 approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>was necessary to consummate the merger. (Joint Proxy at 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Second, in <em>Borak, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that, depending on the circumstances, Section 14(a) claims may be asserted derivatively, and stated that the \u201cinjury which a stockholder suffers from corporate action pursuant to a deceptive proxy solicitation ordinarily flows from the damage done the corporation,\u201d but that the \u201cdamage suffered results not from the deceit practiced on [an individual shareholder] alone but rather from the deceit practiced on the stockholders as a group.\u201d 377 U.S. at 432, 84 S.Ct. 1555. Thus, according to <em>Borak, </em>even in a derivative context, the proper inquiry is whether the shareholders were deceived, not whether the corporation itself was deceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The authorities cited by BofA Derivative Defendants are not to the contrary, because they dismissed derivative claims brought under Section 10(b) and Rule lob-5, in which the corporation could only recover if it was deceived. In <em>Maldonado, </em>the Second Circuit dismissed the derivative Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims because, given the knowledge of the independent and disinterested directors, there could not have been deception on the corporation. 597 F.2d at 795. In <em>Falkenberg v. Baldwin, </em>the court dismissed the plaintiffs derivative Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim because, \u201c[i]n the absence of an adequate allegation of conflict of interest, or of deception by one group of officers or directors, or of a controlling influence over the directors and officers, the claim of a fraud in this context is meaningless.\u201d No. 76 Civ. 2409, 1977 WL 1025, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 13, 1977).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In contrast to these cases, the Derivative Plaintiffs have alleged that the corporation was damaged by a deception of the shareholders. This is sufficient to state a derivative claim under <em>Borak.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">B. <em>Demand Is Excused for the Derivative Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 14(a) Claims Against the BofA Directors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Generally, a corporation\u2019s board of directors manages the affairs of the corporation. This would include the decision whether the corporation will bring suit on a potential claim against a third party. However, a derivative action \u201cpermits an individual shareholder to bring suit to enforce a corporate cause of action against officers, directors, and third parties.\u201d <em>Kamen v. Kemper Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>500 U.S. 90, 95, 111 S.Ct. 1711, 114 L.Ed.2d 152 (1991) (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cConcerned about the potential for abuse of the remedy, however, equity courts established as a precondition for the suit that the shareholder demonstrate that the corporation itself had refused to proceed after suitable demand, unless excused by extraordinary conditions.\u201d <em>Scalisi v. Fund Asset Mgmt. L.P., </em>380 F.3d 133, 138 (2d Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted). Thus, in general, before a plaintiff may bring a derivative action, the plaintiff must first demand that the board of directors bring suit. <em>Id. </em>\u201cHowever, demand may be excused where a shareholder is able to show that demand would be futile.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">The Derivative Plaintiffs have not made a demand on the BofA board for any of the derivative claims the plaintiffs have asserted. Plaintiffs instead allege that demand is excused for all of their claims. (Deriv. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Compl. \u00b635.) Rule 23.1(b)(3), Fed.R.Civ. P., requires a plaintiff bringing a derivative action who has not made a demand on the corporation\u2019s board to state with \u201cparticularity\u201d in the complaint the reasons for not making demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Rule 23.1 does not create a demand requirement; it merely sets the standard for pleading that demand is excused. <em>Kamen, </em>500 U.S. at 96, 111 S.Ct. 1711 (\u201cOn its face, Rule 23.1 speaks only to the adequacy of the shareholder representative\u2019s pleadings.\u201d). It is the substantive law of the state of incorporation which determines whether there is a demand requirement, and if it is required, \u201cwhether demand is, in fact, futile.\u201d <em>Scalisi, </em>380 F.3d at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">BofA is a Delaware corporation. Delaware law provides two separate tests for analyzing whether demand is excused as futile. Under the test set forth in <em>Aronson v. Lewis, </em>demand is excused if the plaintiff alleges \u201cparticularized facts\u201d creating \u201ca reasonable doubt ... that: (1) the directors are disinterested and independent [or] (2) the challenged transaction was otherwise the product of a valid exercise of business judgment.\u201d 473 A.2d 805, 814 (Del.1984), <em>overruled on other grounds by Brehm v. Eisner, </em>746 A.2d 244 (Del. 2000). \u201cThe essential predicate for the <em>Aronson </em>test is the fact that a <em>decision </em>of the board of directors is being challenged in the derivative suit.\u201d <em>Rales v. Blasband, </em>634 A.2d 927, 933 (Del.1993) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">However, \u201c[w]here there is no conscious decision by directors to act or refrain from acting, the business judgment rule has no application,\u201d making it impossible to perform the <em>Aronson </em>inquiry. <em>Id. </em>\u201cConsistent with the context and rationale of the <em>Aronson </em>decision, a court should not apply the <em>Aronson </em>test for demand futility where the board that would be considering the demand did not make a business decision which is being challenged in the derivative suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 933-34. In such cases, \u201ca court must determine whether or not the particularized factual allegations of a derivative stockholder complaint create a reasonable doubt that, as of the time the complaint is filed, the board of directors could have properly exercised its independent and disinterested business judgment in responding to a demand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 934. If so, then under the <em>Rales </em>test, demand is excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">A director is \u201cinterested\u201d if \u201che or she will receive a personal financial benefit from a transaction that is not equally shared by the stockholders,\u201d or if \u201ca corporate decision will have a materially detrimental impact on a director, but not on the corporation and the stockholders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 936. In such cases, a director is presumed to be unable to exercise business judgment \u201cwithout being influenced by the adverse personal consequences resulting from the decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cHowever, where a director\u2019s interest is based on his potential personal liability, the director can only be considered \u2018interested\u2019 if the potential personal liability rises to \u2018a substantial likelihood;\u2019 it is not sufficient that \u2018a mere threat\u2019 of personal liability is alleged.\u201d <em>In re Am. Int\u2019l Group, Inc. Derivative Litig., </em>700 F.Supp.2d 419, 431 (S.D.N.Y.2010) (quoting <em>Rales, </em>634 A.2d at 933); <em>see also Seminaris v. Landa, </em>662 A.2d 1350, 1354 (Del.Ch.1995). \u201cIndependence means that a director\u2019s decision is based on the corporate merits of the subject before the board rather than extraneous considerations or influences.\u201d <em>Aronson, </em>473 A.2d at 816. Demand \u201cfutility is gauged by the circumstances existing at the commencement of a derivative suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 810. \u201c[D]irectors are entitled to a presumption that they were faithful to their fiduciary duties,\u201d and \u201cthe burden is upon the plaintiff in a deriv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ative action to overcome that presumption.\u201d <em>Beam v. Stewart, </em>845 A.2d 1040, 1048-49 (Del.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The <em>Rales </em>test applies to the Section 14(a) claims against the BofA Directors because plaintiffs have not alleged that the BofA Directors made a conscious decision to exclude certain information from the Joint Proxy. <em>See In re Am. Int\u2019l Group, </em>700 F.Supp.2d at 430; <em>Seminaris, </em>662 A.2d at 1354. Plaintiffs are not challenging a business judgment about which information to include in the Joint Proxy. As discussed above, the Derivative Complaint adequately alleges that the Joint Proxy contained material misstatements and omitted material facts, and that the BofA Directors were negligent in allowing this to occur. The directors faced a \u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d of personal liability on the Section 14(a) claim at the time the suit was commenced. This would have prevented them from exercising their disinterested and impartial judgment in responding to a demand request. Demand is therefore excused with respect to the Section 14(a) claim against the directors. <em>Id. </em>at 434 (\u201cApplying the <em>Rales </em>test ... the Court considers whether Plaintiff has pleaded sufficient particularized facts to create, by demonstrating a substantial likelihood of personal liability, a reasonable doubt that [the directors] could have exercised disinterested and independent judgment with respect to a demand to assert the claims.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">VI. <em>DERIVATIVE COMPLAINT FAILS TO STATE A SECTION 11(a) CLAIM AGAINST THE FINANCIAL ADVISORS.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The only statements contained in the Joint Proxy attributable to the Financial Advisors are the fairness opinions that they orally provided to BofA on September 14, 2008, (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 140-145), and were included in written form in the Joint Proxy. (Joint Proxy at C-l-2, D-l-3.) FPK stated as follows: \u201cwe are of the opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio to be paid by [BofA] in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view,\u201d to BofA. (Joint Proxy at D-3.) J.C. Flowers\u2019s opinion stated: \u201cwe are of the opinion that as of the date hereof the Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to [BofA].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at C-2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">As previously set forth in my discussion of representations going to the adequacy of BofA\u2019s due diligence, statements of opinion are actionable under Section 14(a) only if plaintiffs adequately plead that the opinions were actually false, and that the speaker did not actually hold the opinion expressed. <em>Virginia Bankshares, </em>501 U.S. at 1092-93, 111 S.Ct. 2749; <em>Podany, </em>318 F.Supp.2d at 154. The Derivative Plaintiffs have not pled facts that allow the Court to draw a strong inference \u2014 or even a reasonable inference \u2014 that the Financial Advisors did not believe that the exchange ratio of the merger was fair to BofA from a financial point of view. Plaintiffs allege that the Financial Advisors \u201clacked any reasonable basis to conclude that the Merger was fair to BofA,\u201d but they do not allege that the Financial Advisors did not believe their opinions. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 146.) As discussed above, even if the subjective falsity requirement for stating a Section 14(a) claim based on an opinion could be satisfied by recklessness, plaintiffs have disclaimed any reliance on recklessness in their Section 14(a) claim. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 346.) Therefore, the Derivative Plaintiffs have failed to state a Section 14(a) claim against the Financial Advisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">VII. <em>SECURITIES DEFENDANTS\u2019 MOTION TO DISMISS THE SECTION 20(a) CLAIM IS DENIED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">The defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Count VI of the Securities Complaint, which as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>serts control person liability pursuant to Section 20(a) of the '34 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a), is denied. Defendants\u2019 argument is based solely on the necessity of a primary violation in order to proceed with a section 20(a) claim. <em>See, e.g., Rombach, </em>355 F.3d at 177-78. To the extent that the Securities Complaint adequately pleads a primary violation, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Count VI is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">VIII. <em>SECURITIES DEFENDANTS\u2019 MOTION TO DISMISS THE SECURITIES PLAINTIFFS\u2019 '33 ACT CLAIMS IS GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Counts VII through IX assert claims under sections 11, 12 and 15 of the '33 Act. Count VII asserts that BofA, Lewis, Price, Cotty, BofA\u2019s board of directors, Banc of America and MLPFS violated Section 11 of the '33 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k, in the conduct of the Secondary Offering of October 2008. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 372-82.) Count VIII alleges that BofA, Banc of America and MLPFS violated Section 12(a) of the '33 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77i (a)(2), as the issuer and underwriters of a secondary offering made using a registration statement that misstated and omitted material facts. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 383-90.) Count IX asserts control-person liability against Lewis, Price and the BofA board pursuant to Section 15 of the '33 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77o. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 391-95.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">On October 7, 2008, BofA announced its plans to raise $10 billion in a secondary offering, selling 455,000,000 shares of common stock at $22 per share. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 363.) Banc of America and MLPFS underwrote the offering. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6363.) The secondary offering was set forth in a registration statement, which incorporated a prospectus supplement. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 364.) Plaintiffs allege that these offering documents violated the '33 Act to the extent that they incorporated by reference the Merger Agreement filed on Form 8-K with the SEC on September 18, 2008, which allegedly misstated and omitted material information concerning Merrill\u2019s employee bonuses. (Sec. Compl. 11365.) Separately, the plaintiffs allege that the registration statement was misleading to the extent that it incorporated BofA\u2019s press release of September 15, 2008, which was filed with the SEC on Form 8-K and included certain statements dismissed above as exemplars of puffery.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Sec. Compl. \u00b6 369.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Defendants have submitted little support for their motion to dismiss the '33 Act claims. Defendants argue that plaintiffs should be required to plead scienter, but that if the lower threshold of negligence governs, the defendants contend that the Securities Complaint still fails to state '33 Act violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">The Second Circuit recently observed that \u201c[i]ssuers are subject to \u2018virtually absolute\u2019 liability under Section 11, while the remaining potential defendants under sections 11 and 12(a)(2) may be held liable for mere negligence.\u201d <em>In re Morgan Stanley Info. Fund Sec. Litig., </em>592 F.3d 347, 359 (2d Cir.2010). Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) \u201cgive rise to liability more readily\u201d than Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. <em>Id. </em>at 360; <em>see also Herman &amp; MacLean v. Huddleston, </em>459 U.S. 375, 382, 103 S.Ct. 683, 74 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>L.Ed.2d 548 (1983) (\u201cLiability against the issuer of a security is virtually absolute, even for innocent misstatements.\u201d); <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst, </em>425 U.S. at 200, 96 S.Ct. 1375 (in Section 11, \u201cCongress created express liability regardless of the defendant\u2019s fault ....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Section 11 establishes liability for any material misstatement or omission in a registration statement. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(a). Section 12(a)(2) establishes liability for \u201c[a]ny person who ... offers or sells a security ... by the use of any means or instruments ... which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements ... not misleading. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>771 </em>(a)(2). It is true that a '33 Act plaintiff must allege scienter when the underlying activity is part of a fraudulent scheme. <em>See, e.g., In re Morgan Stanley, </em>592 F.3d at 358; <em>Zirkin v. Quanta Capital Holdings Ltd., </em>No. 07 Civ. 851 (RPP), 2009 WL 185940, at *11-12 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 23, 2009). Even if plaintiffs had so alleged, this Court has concluded that the Securities Complaint adequately alleges scienter as to the bonus-related Section 10(b) claim, and the defendants\u2019 arguments do not clarify how such an analysis would vary for the '33 Act claims, if it all. Specifically, it is unclear whether the defendants contend that scienter should separately be alleged as to the contents of the registration statement, or whether they contend the scienter analysis of the '33 Act remains focused on the Joint Proxy and Merger Agreement, since they were incorporated by reference into the offering materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">For the same reasons set forth in the Section 14(a) discussion above, the reasoning of <em>Rombach, </em>355 F.3d at 171-72, does not require heightened pleading for any state-of-mind requirement as to the '33 Act claims. First, the defendants offer only a conclusory argument that the '33 Act allegations sound in fraud. <em>(See </em>BofA Sec. Mem. at 30 n. 20 (incorporating Section 14(a) arguments by footnote).) Second, the Securities Complaint sufficiently alleges that the '33 Act claims sound in negligence rather than fraud. (Sec. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 362 (\u201cThe Securities Act claims are based solely on strict liability and negligence, and are not based on any knowing or reckless conduct by or on behalf of the <em>defendants </em>\u2014 i.e., they do not allege, and do not sound in, fraud \u2014 and Lead Plaintiffs specifically disclaim any allegations of fraud, scienter, or recklessness in these non-fraud claims.\u201d); 372 (\u201cFor purposes of this [Section 11] claim, Lead Plaintiffs expressly exclude and disclaim any allegation that could be construed as alleging or sounding in fraud or intentional or reckless misconduct.

This claim is based solely on negligence.\u201d).) These allegations of negligence satisfy the notice pleading requirements of Rule 8, Fed.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">To the extent that the plaintiffs allege violations of the '33 Act due to the non-actionable puffery contained in the September 15 press release, the '33 Act claims are dismissed. The defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the '33 Act claims are otherwise denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>As with the section 20(a) claim, the defendants rely on an absence of any primary violation as grounds for dismissing the Section 15 claim.

Pis. Fin. Adv. Opp. at 2.) Thus, the Derivative Plaintiffs have abandoned this claim. <em>See Lipton v. Cnty. of Orange, </em>315 F.Supp.2d 434, 446 (S.D.N.Y.2004) (\u201cThis Court may, and generally will, deem a claim abandoned when a plaintiff fails to respond to a defendant\u2019s arguments that a claim should be dismissed.\u201d). It is dismissed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">B. <em>Motion to Dismiss the Derivative Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claims Against the BofA Officers and Directors Is Granted.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">In Count I of their Derivative Complaint, plaintiffs assert a derivative claim for breach of fiduciary duty against the BofA Officers and the BofA Directors. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 312-15.) In Count VI, plaintiffs assert a derivative claim for breach of the \u201cduties of complete candor and full disclosure\u201d against the same defendants. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 336-38.) Both claims allege that the defendants breached fiduciary duties owed to BofA. The parties essentially collapse the two counts, and instead, have briefed the breach of fiduciary duty claims in terms of whether there was a breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the transaction\u2019s approval, and whether there was then a breach of fiduciary duty after the board\u2019s approval. The BofA Directors have not moved to dismiss the Derivative Complaint insofar as it asserts a breach of fiduciary duty claim for actions taken after they approved the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">1. <em>Demand Is Not Excused for the Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claims Arising from the Merger Approval Because the Derivative Plaintiffs Have Failed to Raise a Reasonable Doubt That the Board Acted Disloyally or in Bad Faith When It Approved the Merger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">a. <em>BofA Directors Were Disinterested and Independent When They Approved the Merger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">Because approving the merger was the BofA Directors\u2019 business decision, the <em>Aronson </em>test for demand excusal applies. Under the <em>Aronson </em>test, demand is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>excused if the plaintiff alleges \u201cparticularized facts\u201d creating \u201ca reasonable doubt ... that: (1) the directors are disinterested and independent [or] (2) the challenged transaction was otherwise the product of a valid exercise of business judgment.\u201d 473 A.2d at 814. The Derivative Complaint does not allege particular facts raising a reasonable doubt that the directors were independent or disinterested when they approved BofA\u2019s merger with Merrill. There are no allegations that any of the directors had a personal financial stake in the merger, or that any personal financial benefit accrued to the directors as a result of the merger, other than any benefit that accrued to the BofA shareholders. None of the directors are alleged to have worked for Merrill, been a director of Merrill or owned Merrill stock at the time of the merger. In fact, the BofA Directors held a substantial number of BofA shares at the time of the merger. (Joint Proxy at 12 (stating that as of the record date, BofA Directors and \u201cexecutive officers\u201d had the right to vote approximately 36.5 million shares of BofA).) The directors, therefore, were disinterested under Delaware law. <em>See Rales, </em>634 A.2d at 936; <em>see also In re J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. Shareholder Litig., </em>906 A.2d 808, 821 (Del.Ch.2005), <em>aff'd, </em>906 A.2d 766 (Del.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Although the Derivative Complaint alleges several reasons why the directors were not independent, it does not allege facts sufficient to excuse demand. For example, the Derivative Complaint alleges that the size of the BofA board makes it \u201clarge and unwieldy such that it can be and is dominated by Lewis, who ... has hand picked the majority of the BofA Board.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 271(f).) Similarly, the Derivative Plaintiffs allege that defendants Lewis and Gifford \u201care in a position to, and do dominate and control\u201d the board. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 284(b).) These are conclusory statements, and the Derivative Complaint does not allege particularized facts showing that directors are dominated by Lewis or by Gifford. <em>Aron-son, </em>473 A.2d at 816 (\u201c[A] plaintiff charging domination and control of one or more directors must allege particularized facts manifesting a direction of corporate conduct in such a way as to comport with the wishes or interests of the corporation (or persons) doing the controlling.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The Derivative Plaintiffs allege that nine of the directors had no banking or finance experience and in approving the Merrill acquisition relied heavily on those that did. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 271(h).) For this reason, according to the Derivative Plaintiffs, these nine directors were not independent. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 271(h).) This allegation is conclusory. Plaintiffs have not alleged particularized facts demonstrating that these nine directors relied heavily on other directors when they approved the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Plaintiffs allege that at least two and potentially all of the directors were not independent, according to the NYSE\u2019s listing standards. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 271(a), (b) &amp; (e).) According to the Derivative Complaint, under those standards, \u201c[a] director who receives ... more than $100,000 per year in direct compensation from the listed company, other than director and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation[,] is not independent.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 271(e) (alterations in original).) In addition, the Derivative Plaintiffs also allege that Lewis and Gifford were \u201cnot independent under ... the Company\u2019s own Director Independence Standards.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 271(a) &amp; (b).) But that does not mean these directors lack independence sufficient to disable them from fairly assessing the transaction. <em>See Beam, </em>845 A.2d at 1049 (director independence \u201cis a fact-specific determination made in the context of a particular case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Plaintiffs also allege that defendants Gifford, Countryman and May \u201ceach serve as both a trustee of NSTAR ... and a member of the Board of Directors of CBS Corporation,\u201d and that because defendant May is the Chairman of NSTAR, the other two directors are beholden to him. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 271(i).) Likewise, plaintiffs allege that defendants Sloan and Tillman serve together on another company\u2019s board of directors. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6271\u00ae.) Even if certain directors were beholden to each other, it does not follow that the directors based their decision on something other than the corporate merits. There also remained a majority of directors who were independent of each other and disinterested.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The Derivative Plaintiffs\u2019 argue that demand is excused because BofA\u2019s directors and officers\u2019 insurance policy contains an \u201cinsured vs. insured\u201d exclusion. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 284(g).) Courts applying Delaware law have repeatedly rejected this argument. <em>In re Am. Int\u2019l Group, </em>700 F.Supp.2d at 433 (collecting cases applying Delaware law). Finally, I have considered the remainder of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, including the allegations regarding director compensation, and conclude that plaintiffs have not alleged particular facts creating a reasonable doubt about that the directors were independent.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">b. <em>Derivative Complaint Fails to Plead That the BofA Directors Acted, Disloyally or in Bad Faith When They Approved the Merger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The second prong of the <em>Aronson </em>test requires plaintiffs to plead particularized facts creating a reasonable doubt that the merger was not a product of a \u201cvalid exercise of business judgment.\u201d <em>Aronson, </em>473 A.2d at 814. This requires plaintiffs to plead facts sufficient to support an inference that the board committed a non-exculpated breach of fiduciary duty. <em>In re Lear Corp. Shareholder Litig., </em>967 A.2d 640, 647-48 (Del.Ch.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">The BofA certificate of incorporation provides that, \u201c[t]o the fullest extent permitted [under Delaware law,] a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation ... for monetary damage for breach of his duty as a director.\u201d (Exhibit B to the Declaration of Lawrence Portnoy in Support of the Motion to Dismiss the Derivative Complaint (\u201cPortnoy Dec.\u201d).)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that a corporation\u2019s certificate of incorporation may exculpate directors for breaches of fiduciary duty, other than breaches of the duty of loyalty or \u201cfor acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law.\u201d 8 Del.Code Ann. \u00a7 102(b)(7). Thus, to satisfy the second prong of <em>Aronson, </em>plaintiffs must plead facts creating a reasonable doubt that the board did not act honestly or in good faith. <em>In re Walt Disney Co. Derivative Litig., </em>825 A.2d 275, 286 (Del.Ch.2003). \u201cSuch a claim cannot rest on facts that simply support the notion that the directors made an unreasonable or even grossly unreasonable judgment.\u201d <em>In re Lear Corp., </em>967 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>652. \u201cRather, it must rest on facts that support a fair inference that the directors consciously acted in a manner contrary to the interests of [the corporation] and its stockholders.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The Derivative Plaintiffs argue that their allegations regarding the speed with which the due diligence process was conducted and the merger was approved, the fact that no board committee was appointed to review the merger, and that there was no attempt to negotiate better terms, sufficiently allege that the board acted in bad faith. Plaintiffs rely on <em>Disney </em>for support.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">In holding that plaintiffs had pled a non-exculpated breach of fiduciary duty, <em>Disney </em>stated that \u201cthe facts alleged in the new complaint suggest that the defendant directors <em>consciously and intentionally disregarded their responsibilities, </em>adopting a \u2018we don\u2019t care about the risks\u2019 attitude concerning a material corporate decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289 (emphasis in original). In contrast to the board in <em>Disney, </em>the BofA Directors met with senior members of BofA management and outside advisors. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 107.)

Compl. \u00b6 107.)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Essentially, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations amount to a claim that the BofA board\u2019s review and approval of the merger was inadequate. That, however, cannot form the basis of a claim that the directors acted in bad faith. <em>Lyondell Chem. Co. v. Ryan, </em>970 A.2d 235, 243 (Del.2009). Although the BofA board acted quickly in approving the merger, the Derivative Complaint does not allege that they acted disloyally, or that they were so inadequately informed that they could not exercise their business judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The remainder of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding the board\u2019s approval amount to <em>post-hoc </em>criticisms that the BofA board made a poor deal. A poor decision does not mean that the directors acted disloyally. Consequently, plaintiffs were not excused from making a demand on the board for their breach of fiduciary duty claims against the BofA Directors and Officers arising from the time prior to and including the board\u2019s decision to approve the merger, and those claims are dismissed pursuant to Rule 23.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">2. <em>Alternatively, Plaintiffs Have Failed to State a Claim Against the BofA Derivative Defendants for Breach of Fiduciary Duty Arising from the Time Prior to and Including the Board\u2019s Approval of the Merger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">The Derivative Plaintiffs argue that the BofA Derivative Defendants breached their fiduciary duty to BofA by \u201cagreeing to acquire Merrill after only 10 hours of due diligence, based on incomplete information and insufficient analysis,\u201d and by \u201cagreeing to pay tens of billions of dollars in valuable BofA common stock for Merrill, at a time when Merrill was in a liquidity turmoil, faced [an] imminent bankruptcy filing, and could otherwise have been acquired for mere \u2018pennies\u2019 on the dollar.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 314(a) \u00abfe (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">Rule 23.1 requires plaintiffs to plead particular facts showing why demand is excused, and Rule 8(a) only requires plaintiffs to plead enough facts to state a plausible claim. Although those two standards are different, for substantially the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>reasons just discussed, plaintiffs have failed to state a claim against the BofA Directors for a non-exculpated breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Officers of Delaware corporations owe the same fiduciary duties to the corporation as do its directors. <em>Gantler v. Stephens, </em>965 A.2d 695, 708-09 (Del.2009). Unlike the BofA Directors, section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law does not allow BofA to exculpate the officer defendants from breaches of their fiduciary duty of care. Both parties agree that the standard for liability for breaching the duty of care is \u201cgross negligence.\u201d <em>See In re Lear Corp., </em>967 A.2d at 651. To demonstrate gross negligence, plaintiffs must allege that the officers acted with \u201creckless indifference to or a deliberate disregard of the whole body of stockholders or actions which are without the bounds of reason.\u201d <em>Tomczak v. Morton Thiokol, Inc., </em>CIV. A. No. 7861, 1990 WL 42607, at *12 (Del.Ch. Apr. 5, 1990). This standard is \u201cextremely stringent.\u201d <em>In re Lear Corp., </em>967 A.2d at 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Plaintiffs allege that defendants Curl and Lewis negotiated the terms of BofA\u2019s acquisition of Merrill, and that each played a pivotal role in the due diligence on Merrill. Specifically, the Derivative Plaintiffs have alleged that Curl headed BofA\u2019s negotiation team and negotiated the Merrill bonus payments and the price BofA would pay for Merrill. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54, 101.) Plaintiffs also allege that Lewis and Price formed a 45-member team to perform the due diligence of Merrill, which lasted less than a day. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 234.) Although plaintiffs take issue with the terms of the deal, and the fact that the negotiations lasted only \u201ca matter of hours,\u201d they have not pled any facts that allow the Court to reasonably infer that Curl, Lewis or Price conducted these negotiations recklessly or with deliberate disregard to the BofA shareholders\u2019 interests. The mere fact that these officers represented BofA in negotiating the merger and in performing the due diligence of Merrill does not mean that they acted recklessly or outside the bounds of reason, even if the deal turned out to be a bad one.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The Derivative Complaint fails to set forth nonconclusory factual allegations that, if proven, would amount to gross negligence on the part of other BofA Officers. Plaintiffs argue that, based on the positions of these individuals, it may be reasonably inferred that each officer was a member of, or perhaps led, BofA\u2019s 45-member due diligence team. The only facts alleged that invite this inference are the officers\u2019 job titles, and for a few of them, a cursory job description. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 60-67.) Plaintiffs do not allege that these officers were part of BofA\u2019s due diligence team. They do not allege facts sufficient to support a reasonable inference that even if these defendants were part of the BofA due diligence team, they were grossly negligent in performing their due diligence functions. Therefore, plaintiffs have failed to allege that the BofA Officers breached their fiduciary duty of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Likewise, plaintiffs have failed to allege that the BofA Officers breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty to the corporation. There is no allegation that the BofA Officers were motivated by a self-interest that was not shared by the BofA shareholders, or by ill will. Therefore, plaintiffs can only state a claim for breach of the fiduciary duty of loyalty if they successfully allege that the officers acted in bad faith. <em>Lyondell, </em>970 A.2d at 239-40. \u201c[B]ad faith encompasses not only an intent to harm but also intentional dereliction of duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240. Thus, fiduciaries act in bad faith if they \u201cknowingly and completely failed to undertake their responsibilities.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 243-44. There are no allegations supporting such an inference. Therefore, the claims against the BofA Officers for breach of fiduciary duty arising out of the negotiation and approval of the merger are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">3. <em>BofA Officers\u2019 Motion to Dismiss the Claims Based on Post-Approval Breaches of Fiduciary Duty is Granted.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The BofA Director defendants do not move to dismiss the breach of fiduciary duty claims to the extent they are based on events that occurred between the board\u2019s approval of the merger and its closing. The BofA Officer defendants, however, move to dismiss the breach of fiduciary duty claims arising out of their actions after the board approved the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">a. <em>Derivative Plaintiffs Have Not Adequately Alleged That the BofA Officers Breached the Duty of Disclosure.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The Derivative Plaintiffs allege that the BofA Officers breached their fiduciary duty by failing to update the Joint Proxy to disclose the Merrill bonus agreement and Merrill\u2019s losses from the fourth quarter of 2008. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 314(c) &amp; (d), 337(a) &amp; (b).) They also allege that the BofA Officers breached their duty of disclosure by not disclosing that \u201cthe Board had determined a [MAC] had occurred justifying rescission of the Merger, or that the BofA [Derivative] Defendants purportedly had received threats from Secretary Paulson if the MAC clause were invoked, or that the decision to invoke the MAC had been rescinded, or that BofA had sought and obtained $138 billion in additional TARP funding to complete\u201d the transaction. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 314(c), 337(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">The \u201cduty of disclosure\u201d is not an independent duty, but rather an application of both the duties of care and of loyalty. <em>Pfeffer v. Redstone, </em>965 A.2d 676, 684 (Del.2009). Under Delaware law, the duty of disclosure requires \u201cdirectors to provide the stockholders with accurate and complete information material to a transaction or other corporate event that is being presented to them for action.\u201d <em>Malone v. Brincat, </em>722 A.2d 5, 10 (Del.1998). \u201cCorporate fiduciaries can breach their duty of disclosure under Delaware law by making a materially false statement, by omitting a material fact, or by making a partial disclosure that is materially misleading.\u201d <em>Pfeffer, </em>965 A.2d at 684 (quotation marks and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">Delaware case law generally treats the duty of disclosure as one that applies to directors or, in some cases, majority shareholders. <em>E.g., Malone, </em>722 A.2d at 9 (\u201cThis Court has held that aboard of directors is under a fiduciary duty to disclose material information when seeking shareholder action.\u201d); <em>Stroud v. Grace, </em>606 A.2d 75, 84 (Del.1992) (\u201c[D]irectors of Delaware corporations are under a fiduciary duty to disclose fully and fairly all material information within the board\u2019s control when it seeks shareholder action.\u201d); <em>Wayne Cnty. Emp. Ret. Sys. v. Corti, </em>Civ. Act. No. 3534-CC, 2009 WL 2219260, at *8 (Del.Ch. July 24, 2009) (\u201cWhen a board of directors seeks shareholder action, the fiduciary duty of disclosure, which is a specific application of the duties of care and loyalty, requires that the board disclose fully and fairly all material information within the board\u2019s control.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>996 A.2d 795 (Del.2010).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The parties have not cited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>any case in which an officer of a Delaware corporation has been held liable for breaching a duty of disclosure by failing to disclose material information not included in a proxy statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">However, in 2009, the Delaware Supreme Court held that officers of Delaware corporations, \u201clike directors, owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty,\u201d to their corporation, and those fiduciary duties \u201care the same as those of directors.\u201d <em>Gantler, 965 </em>A.2d at 708-09. In so holding, the court explicitly noted that it was simply reiterating a well-established principle of Delaware law. <em>Id. </em>at 709 n. 36 (\u201cThat officers and directors of Delaware corporations have identical fiduciary duties has long been an articulated principle of Delaware law.\u201d) (citing <em>Guth v. Loft, Inc., 5 </em>A.2d 503, 510 (Del.1939)).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The <em>Gantler </em>court\u2019s comment that officers\u2019 fiduciary duties are \u201cthe same as those of directors\u201d was contained in a discussion of the duty of loyalty. The court was also presented with duty of disclosure claims. In the opinion containing the judgment reversed by the Delaware Supreme Court, the Court of Chancery specifically noted that the plaintiffs had asserted a disclosure claim against the directors of a corporation, as well as one individual who was an officer but not a director. <em>Gantler v. Stephens, </em>Civ. Act. No. 2392-VCP, 2008 WL 401124, at *19 n. 135 (Del.Ch. Feb. 14, 2008). Those plaintiffs argued to the Court of Chancery that the officer could be liable on a duty of disclosure theory because he was a \u201cfiling person\u201d under the federal securities laws. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Chancery ultimately did not address whether this was a viable theory because it dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on other grounds. <em>Id. </em>In reversing the dismissal, the Delaware Supreme Court likewise did not address the issue. However, in its discussion of the plaintiffs\u2019 duty of disclosure claim, the court reiterated the \u201cwell-settled\u201d rule \u201cthat <em>\u2018directors </em>of Delaware corporations [have] a fiduciary duty to disclose fully and fairly all material information within the board\u2019s control when it seeks shareholder action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gantler, </em>965 A.2d at 710 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">There is no indication that in remarking about the duties of officers, the Delaware Supreme Court was imposing on officers, whose duties, responsibilities and authority may be relatively limited in this context, a duty to disclose to shareholders material facts that were omitted from a proxy statement. Such a duty could encourage a series of independent communications from officers to shareholders, instead of one message from the single body tasked with managing the affairs of Delaware corporations: the board of directors. It therefore appears that Delaware law did not require the BofA Officers to disclose to shareholders material information that was omitted from the Joint Proxy.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Delaware law also recognizes that a separate violation of fiduciary duty can occur \u201c[w]hen the directors are not seeking shareholder action, but are deliberately misinforming shareholders about the business of the corporation, either directly or by a public statement .... \u201d <em>Malone, </em>722 A.2d at 14. Even assuming this duty did apply to the BofA Officers, the Derivative Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were based on omissions, not deliberate misinformation. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 314, 337.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">The BofA Officers\u2019 motion to dismiss is granted with respect to the Derivative Plaintiffs\u2019 duty of disclosure claims,</p>\n<p id=\"ABC\">b. <em>Alleged Decision to Retract the Invocation of the MAC Clause.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">Aside from their non-disclosure claims, plaintiffs also allege that the BofA Officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>breached their fiduciary duty when they \u201cfail[ed] to invoke the MAC clause or otherwise terminate or renegotiate the Merger even though they knew and had determined that it was in BofA\u2019s best interests to do so.\u201d (Dex*iv. Compl. \u00b6 314(e).) Specifically, the Dexdvative Complaint alleges that dui'ing November and December 2008, several BofA Officers discussed whether BofA could invoke the MAC clause (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 181), sought and rendered legal advice regarding the MAC clause, (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 182), and ultimately received advice that grounds existed for invoking the MAC clause (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 184). At some point between December 17 and 21, two of the BofA Officers, Price and Brinkley, are alleged to have formed an opinion that BofA would prevail in a lawsuit over the MAC clause. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 187.) These allegations are sufficient only to support an inference that these defendants were evaluating BofA\u2019s positions regarding the MAC clause. They are not sufficient to state a plausible claim that these defendants acted with \u201creckless indifference,\u201d a \u201cdeliberate disregard\u201d of the BofA shareholders, or that the BofA Officers acted disloyally. <em>Tomczak, </em>1990 WL 42607, at *12.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">According to the Derivative Complaint, the BofA board decided to invoke the MAC clause on December 21, 2008. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 188.) It is also alleged that the board reversed this decision on December 22, 2008, after Secretary Paulson allegedly threatened to \u201cremove BofA\u2019s management and Board from their offices.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 188, 196.) Although the Derivative Complaint alleges that cexlmn BofA Officers attended the December 22 meeting at which Lewis \u201cformally sought the Board\u2019s concurrence with management\u2019s decision\u201d not to invoke the MAC clause, and that there was \u201cno dissent from the consensus\u201d at that meeting (Dexiv. Compl. \u00b6 196), there is no allegation that the BofA Officers other than Lewis advised the board to reverse its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The Derivative Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that the BofA Officers breached their fiduciary duty with regard to the claims arising from the BofA board\u2019s decision not to invoke the MAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">C. <em>Derivative Plaintiffs Have Failed to State a Claim for Unjust Enrichment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The Derivative Complaint asserts a claim of unjust enrichment against the BofA Officers. The defendants ax-gue that North Carolina law applies to plaintiffs\u2019 claim for unjust enrichment because BofA\u2019s principal place of business is in North Carolina and most of the BofA Officers are citizens of North Carolina. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42, 59-65.) Plaintiffs do not specifically deny that North Carolina law applies, but they cite to Delaware authority in their opposition brief I need not decide which state\u2019s law applies, as there is no conflict between the applicable laws of the two jurisdictions. <em>Rogers v. Grimaldi, </em>875 F.2d 994, 1002 (2d Cir.1989) (a federal court exercising supplemental jxxrisdiction applies the choice of law rules of the forum state); <em>In re Allstate Ins. Co. (Stolarz), </em>81 N.Y.2d 219, 223, 597 N.Y.S.2d 904, 613 N.E.2d 936 (N.Y.1993) (\u201cThe first step in any case presenting a potential choice of law issue is to determine whether there is an actual conflict between the laws of the jurisdictions involved.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Under North Carolina law, a plaintiff must adequately allege that the defendant has been enriched \u201cat another\u2019s expense under circumstances that, in equity and good conscience, call for an accounting by the wrongdoer.\u201d <em>Ellis Jones, Inc. v. W. Waterproofing Co., Inc., </em>66 N.C.App. 641, 646, 312 S.E.2d 215 (N.C.Ct.App. 1984). Under Delaware law, unjust en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>riehment is the \u201cunjust retention of a benefit to the loss of another, or the retention of money or property of another against the fundamental principles of justice or equity and good conscience.\u201d <em>Fleer Corp. v. Topps Chewing Gum, Inc., </em>539 A.2d 1060, 1062 (Del.1988). Under both states\u2019 laws, unjust enrichment occurs when a person has been enriched, to the detriment of another, under unfair or inequitable circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">According to the Derivative Complaint, the BofA Officers were unjustly enriched because they \u201cfailed to achieve BofA\u2019s business and financial goals except in an illegitimate and unlawful manner,\u201d and therefore, \u201cthe incentive compensation payments\u201d to these defendants \u201cwere not properly awarded for the work performed and results achieved.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 330.) Plaintiffs seek the return of any incentive compensation awarded to these defendants. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 330.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Plaintiffs have not alleged that the BofA Officers benefitted from the unlawful conduct alleged in the Derivative Complaint. Plaintiffs have not alleged that the \u201cincentive compensation\u201d the BofA Officers received was tied to the consummation of the merger with Merrill. Similarly, plaintiffs do not allege what \u201cBofA\u2019s business and financial goals\u201d were, let alone how the alleged wrongdoing asserted in the Derivative Complaint helped the BofA Officers achieve those goals. Because plaintiffs have failed to allege facts showing why it would be unfair or inequitable to allow the BofA Officers to retain their incentive compensation, their claim for unjust enrichment is dismissed for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">In addition, demand is not excused for this claim. The Derivative Plaintiffs did not name the BofA Directors in the unjust enrichment claim. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 325-31.) There are no allegations in the Derivative Complaint connecting the board to the alleged unjust enrichment of the officers. Plaintiffs do not allege that the board set the compensation levels for the \u201cincentive compensation\u201d at issue. Even if the members of the Compensation and Benefits Committee set the incentive compensation for the BofA Officers, the Derivative Plaintiffs have not pled particular facts creating a reasonable doubt that the majority of the board (even excluding Lewis) who were not members of that committee could have exercised their disinterested and independent business judgment in considering a demand to file suit. <em>Rales, </em>634 A.2d at 934. Demand for the unjust enrichment claim, therefore, is not excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">D. <em>Derivative Plaintiffs Have Failed to State a Claim for Contribution.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Plaintiffs assert a claim for contribution against the BofA Directors and Officers. The BofA Derivative Defendants cite Delaware law on contribution. The Derivative Plaintiffs do not dispute that Delaware law applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">Under Delaware law, the right of contribution is governed by the Uniform Contribution Among Tort-feasors Law, 10 Del.Code Ann. \u00a7 6301, <em>et seq. </em>The \u201cinherent requirement\u201d of a claim for contribution \u201cis that the parties are joint tortfeasors who share a \u2018common liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Builders &amp; Managers, Inc. v. Dryvit Sys., Inc., </em>No. Civ. A. 00C11111JEB, 2004 WL 304357, at *2 (Del.Super.Ct. Feb. 13, 2004). According to the Derivative Complaint, the BofA Derivative Defendants have \u201cexposed BofA to a significant liability under various federal and state laws,\u201d causing BofA to suffer a \u201csubstantial harm.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 333-34.) Plaintiffs have not alleged facts showing that BofA has suffered any liabilities under federal or state laws, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>or what \u201csubstantial harm\u201d has been done to BofA as a result of its joint tortfeasance with the BofA Directors and Officers. Plaintiffs\u2019 bare recitation of the elements of this cause of action does not satisfy the pleading requirements of Rule 8(a), and this claim is dismissed. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955. In addition, under Delaware law, a \u201cjoint tort-feasor is not entitled to a money judgment for contribution until he or she has by payment discharged the common liability or has paid more than his or her pro rata share thereof.\u201d 10 DeLCode Ann. \u00a7 6302(b). Plaintiffs have not alleged any payment made by BofA to discharge a common liability of BofA and the BofA Derivative Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">E. <em>Demand Is Not Excused for the Derivative Plaintiffs\u2019 Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Professional Negligence Claims Against the Financial Advisors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Plaintiffs assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty and professional negligence against the Financial Advisors. The <em>Rales </em>test applies to these claims because they do not challenge a BofA board decision. <em>Rales, </em>634 A.2d at 934 n. 9 (\u201cFor example, if a stockholder brings a derivative suit alleging that a third party breached a contract with the corporation, demand should not be excused simply because the subject matter of the suit \u2014 the third party\u2019s breach of contract \u2014 does not implicate the business judgment rule.\u201d); <em>see also In re Trump Hotels S\u2019holder Derivative Litig., </em>No. 96 Civ. 7820(DAB), 2000 WL 1371317, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">In Count II of the Derivative Complaint, plaintiffs allege that the Financial Advisors \u201cowed BofA and its shareholders the duty to perform due diligence necessary to accurately and reliably determine whether the terms of the proposed Merger and exchange ratio were fair from a financial point of view to BofA and continued to be fair.\u201d (Deriv.

Compl. \u00b6 319.) In Count III, plaintiffs allege that the Financial Advisors \u201cfailed to exercise the care that a professional employed to render\u201d a fairness opinion would have employed given the circumstances and, therefore, the fairness opinions \u201chad no reasonable basis in fact,\u201d and were false and misleading. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 322-23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">These claims, therefore, arise from the same facts and circumstances as the plaintiffs\u2019 breach of fiduciary duty claim against the BofA Directors and Officers for approving the merger. Given my conclusion that the BofA board was disinterested and independent, and that plaintiffs had failed to plead particular facts showing that the BofA board committed a non-exculpated breach of fiduciary duty in approving the merger, I conclude that at the time the Derivative Complaint was filed, the BofA board could have \u201cproperly exercised its independent and disinterested business judgment in responding to a demand\u201d on these claims. <em>Rales, </em>634 A.2d at 934. The demand requirement, therefore, is not ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>cused, and these claims are dismissed pursuant to Rule <em>28.1.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">F. <em>Derivative Plaintiffs Fail to State a Direct Claim Against the BofA Directors and Officers for Breach of Fiduciary Duty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In addition to asserting derivative claims, the Derivative Plaintiffs also assert one direct claim. They allege that the BofA Derivative Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the BofA shareholders by failing to \u201ccorrect, update, or supplement the disclosures in the Proxy Statement\u201d and by concealing \u201cthe fact of an authorized $5.8 billion in bonuses to be paid to Merrill executives.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 358.) According to the Derivative Complaint, these breaches deprived the shareholders \u201cof their right to cast an informed vote at the Shareholder Vote on the Merger on December 5, 2008.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 359.) As a recovery, plaintiffs seek \u201cthe amounts which BofA spent to negotiate the transaction and prepare the [Joint Proxy], including $20 million in fees to the [Financial Advisors], over $100 million in fees to the Waehtell law firm, and tens of millions of dollars in [expenses for] printing and disseminating the [Joint Proxy], tallying votes, and otherwise im-</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">plementing the solicitation of shareholders.\u201d (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 860.)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Plaintiffs have not alleged a causal connection between the harm alleged \u2014 denial of their right to vote \u2014 and the damages they seek. Plaintiffs do not allege that if the BofA defendants had not breached their fiduciary duties, these costs would not have been incurred. Instead, plaintiffs allege that the harm they suffered was from casting votes that were not fully informed. But, as plaintiffs concede, the costs they seek to recover because of these alleged breaches \u201cwould have been incurred [by BofA] regardless [of] whether shareholders had voted the Merger down and/or the Merger had been rescinded or the Merger price renegotiated.\u201d (Deriv. Pis. Opp. Br. at 48.) Put differently, the Derivative Complaint does not plausibly allege that BofA would have avoided these costs if the Joint Proxy contained more fulsome and complete disclosures. Thus, plaintiffs\u2019 claim for damages is not \u201clogically and reasonably related,\u201d <em>In re J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. S\u2019holder Litig., </em>906 A.2d 766, 773 (Del.2006), to the harm they are alleged to have suffered \u2014 denial of the right to cast a fully informed vote. Plaintiffs\u2019 direct claim is therefore dismissed.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>G. <em>This Action Will Not Be Stayed or Dismissed in Favor of the Delaware Action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">A separate stockholder derivative action is currently pending in Delaware Court of Chancery, <em>In re Bank of America Corporation Stockholder Derivative Litigation, C.A. </em>No. 4307-VCS (the \u201cDelaware Action\u201d). That action asserts a claim against the BofA board for breach of fiduciary duty and a claim for waste of corporate assets against the directors and others. (Delaware Action Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 157-164, attached as Exhibit C to the Declaration of Kevin L. Oufnac, dated February 8, 2010.) As alternative relief, the BofA Derivative Defendants ask the Court to abstain from exercising jurisdiction over this action because it is substantially similar to the Delaware Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Both parties agree that in determining whether abstention is appropriate, the Court should apply the six-factor test set forth in <em>Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 817, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976). <em>See Vill. of Westfield v. Welch\u2019s, </em>170 F.3d 116, 120 (2d Cir.1999) (\u201cAbstention under <em>Colorado River </em>applies where, as in the instant case, state and federal courts exercise concurrent jurisdiction simultaneously.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo determine whether abstention under <em>Colorado River </em>is appropriate, a district court is required to weigh six factors, with the balance heavily weighted in favor of the exercise of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 121 (quotation marks omitted). Those six factors are: \u201c(1) the assumption of jurisdiction by either court over any res or property; (2) the inconvenience of the federal forum; (3) the avoidance of piecemeal litigation; (4) the order in which jurisdiction was obtained; (5) whether state or federal law supplies the rule of decision; and (6) whether the state court proceeding will adequately protect the rights of the party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>No one factor is dispositive. <em>Id. </em>Because abstention is \u201can exception to a court\u2019s normal duty to adjudicate a controversy properly before it, the district court\u2019s discretion must be exercised within the narrow and specific limits prescribed by the particular abstention doctrine involved.\u201d <em>Dittmer v. Cnty. of Suffolk, </em>146 F.3d 113, 116 (2d Cir.1998). \u201cThus, there is little or no discretion to abstain in a case which does not meet traditional abstention requirements.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">I assume, for these purposes, that the Delaware Action is a parallel state-court proceeding. The first factor favors the exercise of jurisdiction, because this is not an <em>in rem </em>action. <em>Vill. of Westfield, </em>170 F.3d at 122 (\u201c[T]he absence of a res points toward exercise of federal jurisdiction.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted; alteration incorporated).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Turning to the second and third factors, this forum is not inconvenient to the defendants as they already are litigating a claim arising out of substantially similar facts in this forum. The mere potential for conflicting outcome between the two actions does not justify abstention under the \u201cpiecemeal litigation\u201d factor. <em>Colorado River, </em>424 U.S. at 816, 96 S.Ct. 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">The fourth factor tips in favor of abstention because, according to plaintiffs\u2019 brief, jurisdiction was obtained by the Delaware court on January 22, 2009, and by this Court on January 28, 2009. Additionally, the Delaware action already has progressed beyond the motion to dismiss stage. (Portnoy Dec. Ex. C.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">The fifth factor favors exercising federal jurisdiction. State law applies the rule of decision on the remaining breach of fiduciary duty claims, and on the demand requirement, but federal law applies the rule of decision on the remaining Section 14(a) claims. <em>Vill. of Westfield, </em>170 F.3d at 124 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>(\u201c[T]he presence of federal issues strongly advises exercising federal jurisdiction.\u201d). Here, I view this as a significant consideration because important federal policies are implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Finally, regarding the sixth <em>Colorado River </em>factor, there is nothing before the Court to indicate that the Delaware court is an inadequate vehicle for the plaintiffs\u2019 protection, which counsels in favor of abstention.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Although some of the factors favor abstention, the test is not mechanical, and I conclude that on balance, abstention is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">H. <em>Derivative Plaintiffs May File a Motion Requesting Leave to Amend.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The Derivative Plaintiffs have requested leave to amend the Derivative Complaint. The Court should \u201cfreely give leave\u201d to amend a complaint \u201cwhen justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2). Plaintiffs argue that leave to amend \u201cis well warranted here, where new information emerges almost every day from the SEC and [New York Attorney General] investigations, media reports, and Congressional hearings.\u201d (Deriv. Pis. Opp. Br. at 58.) Plaintiffs, however, have not identified any information that they would include in an amended complaint. Therefore, plaintiffs\u2019 request for leave to file an amended complaint is denied without prejudice. Plaintiffs\u2019 may file a motion to amend their Derivative Complaint within 20 days of the date of hereof. Should plaintiffs choose to file such a motion, they should consider whether an impermissible conflict exists. <em>See supra </em>note 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">X. <em>LETTERS OF FEBRUARY 2010 PLAY NO PART IN THE CONSIDERATION OF THESE MOTIONS.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">I briefly address a flurry of submissions made by the parties in February and March 2010, which purported to advise Judge Chin of a complaint filed by the New York Attorney General and developments in a separate SEC action. No party argues that the reported developments have a preclusive effect on this case. They play no part in this Memorandum and Order. The relevance of those proceedings, if any, may be revisited at a later point.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">The Securities Complaint states Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims against Lewis, Thain, BofA and Merrill for alleged misstatements related to the bonus arrangement, and against Lewis and BofA for alleged omissions related to the bonus arrangement. The Securities Complaint states claims under Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 against Lewis, Thain, BofA, Merrill and the BofA directors as to the bonus arrangement. It also states claims under Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 against all defendants arising out of their failure to disclose Merrill\u2019s fourth quarter 2008 losses. Because the foregoing claims survive, the Securities Complaint states a claim for control person liability pursuant to Section 20(a) of the '34 Act. Finally, the Securities Complaint states claims under the '33 Act based on the alleged misstatements and omissions concerning Merrill\u2019s bonus payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">The motions to dismiss are GRANTED as to the Securities Complaint\u2019s other theories of liability. (MDL Docket # 59, 62, 64.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">The Derivative Complaint does not state a claim against the Financial Advisors, and their motion to dismiss is GRANTED. (MDL Docket # 92.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">The Derivative Complaint states Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 claims against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>BofA Directors for misstatements and omissions related to the bonus arrangement and for failing to disclose Merrill\u2019s fourth quarter 2008 losses. The BofA Directors have not moved to dismiss the breach of fiduciary duty claims arising from their actions or omissions after they approved BofA\u2019s acquisition of Merrill. The BofA Derivative Defendants\u2019 and nominal defendant BofA\u2019s motions to dismiss are GRANTED with respect to the other theories of liability asserted in the Derivative Complaint. (MDL Docket ## 118, 127.) The Derivative Plaintiffs may file a motion to amend within 20 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The motion to certify a question to the Delaware Supreme Court is DENIED.

The defendants named in the Securities Complaint for their actions while on the BofA board of directors are William Barnet HI, Frank P. Bramble, Sr., John T. Collins, Gary L. Countryman, Tommy R.

Prior to the negotiations, Merrill was projecting a bonus pool of, at most, $5.1 billion, with a recorded expense of $3.5 billion. (Deriv. Compl. \u00b6 122.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b332-5\">. In a letter to the Court, the defendants in the Securities Action argue that the Securities Plaintiffs cannot prove transaction causation. <em>Wilson v. Great Am. Indus., Inc., </em>979 F.2d 924, 931 (2d Cir.1992) (\"We recognize that loss causation or economic harm to plaintiffs must be shown, as well as proof that the misrepresentations induced plaintiffs to engage in the subject transaction, that is, transaction causation.\u201d). The Securities Plaintiffs' theory is that the BofA shareholders were harmed when the BofA shares decreased in value after the truth about the transaction became public. The merger with Merrill could have been consummated only with BofA shareholder approval of the transaction. (Joint Proxy at 12.) Thus, the Joint Proxy was an essential link in the transaction because the acquisition could not have occurred without the shareholder vote. The Securities Plaintiffs have adequately pled transaction causation. <em>Mills, </em>396 U.S. at 384-85, 90 S.Ct. 616 (\"Where there has been a finding of materiality, a shareholder has made a sufficient showing of causal relationship between the violation and the injury for which he seeks redress if, as here, he proves that the proxy solicitation itself, rather than the particular defect in the solicitation materials, was an essential link in the accomplishment of the transaction.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b332-11\">. <em>See </em>Del. Sup. Ct. R. 41(a)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b335-8\">.

The SEC\u2019s report in the Titan case, which was issued to \"highlight[]\u201d required disclosure of contractual terms as required by Rules 10b-5 and 14a-9, constituted an informal agency interpretation, and is not entitled to the high deference afforded the product of an agency\u2019s notice-and-comment rulemaking. <em>See, e.g., New York City Emp. Ret. Sys. v. S.E.C., </em>45 F.3d 7, 12-13 (2d Cir.1995) (\"courts will not accord great deference\u201d to an SEC no-action letter, as it is an interpretative statement and not a formal rule). To the extent that the Titan Report is well reasoned, the SEC has plenary power to interpret the '34 Act, and defendants have not argued that the Titan Report breaks with past pronouncements, I afford the Titan Report some deference. <em>See United States v. Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. 218, 227-29, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001) (listing factors for weighing an interpretative statement's power to persuade).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b342-5\">. Defendants argue that <em>Kronfeld, </em>as well <em>United Paperworkers, </em>985 F.2d at 1199, should be disregarded because they predate the \"Internet era.\u201d The Second Circuit has not overruled or limited the reasoning of either opinion, however, and <em>Koppel, </em>which was decided in the \"Internet era\u201d year of 1999, cited <em>United Paperworkers\u2019s </em>reasoning as authoritative on matters concerning the availability of information to shareholders. 167 F.3d at 131\u2014 32. I decline the defendants\u2019 invitation to disregard governing Second Circuit precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b343-8\">. As discussed more fully below in the section addressing negligence and scienter, Rule 9(b) does not apply to the Derivative Plaintiffs' Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 claims because they do not sound in fraud.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b344-5\">.
