Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon his plea of guilty of two counts of driving while intoxicated as a felony (Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1192 [2], [3]; \u00a7 1193 [1] [c]) and one count of aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in the first degree (Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 511 [3]). He contends that the plea colloquy, taken together with the additional colloquy when he sought permission to retain new counsel, is insufficient to support his conviction. Defendant did not make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction. Thus, defendant has failed to preserve his contention for our review <em>(see, People v Lopez, </em>71 NY2d 662, 665; <em>People v Ayala, </em>226 AD2d 1127, <em>lv denied </em>88 NY2d 964). In any event, there is no merit to defendant\u2019s contention. Defendant, in making an application to retain new counsel, claimed that he was \u201cfuzzy\u201d about his guilt or innocence. County Court noted, however, that during his plea allocution defendant admitted that he was driving the vehicle in question while intoxicated and while his license was suspended or revoked.
