Memorandum: Contrary to our prior determination on the appeal in this tax certiorari proceeding <em>(see, Matter of Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v Assessor of Town of Geddes, </em>239 AD2d 911), the Court of Appeals has held that, with respect to four of its properties, petitioner raised a genuine factual issue whether the properties should be character<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>ized as specialties. The Court concluded that petitioner \u201cprovided substantial evidence, based on sound theory and objective data, that a credible dispute exists as to the proper characterization of its properties and consequently, the validity of its valuation methodology\u201d <em>(Matter of Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v Assessor of Town of Geddes, </em>92 NY2d 192). The Court of Appeals further determined that, with respect to the remaining properties that are specialties, petitioner established \u201cby sound theory and objective data\u201d that a genuine factual dispute exists as to valuation <em>(Matter of Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v Assessor of Town of Geddes, supra, </em>at 199). The Court of Appeals directed us to review the record to determine whether petitioner established by a preponderance of the evidence that the four properties in dispute were not specialties and that those properties and the remaining properties were overvalued and the amount of the overvaluation. Because we held as a matter of law that petitioner failed to meet its initial burden of overcoming the presumption that the challenged assessments were valid, we did not previously address those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\">Having considered the issues raised but not determined on the appeal, we conclude that Supreme Court properly granted the petitions and reduced the assessments on petitioner\u2019s property for the 1990 through 1993 tax years. Petitioner established by a preponderance of the evidence that the four properties at issue do not have the defining characteristics of specialty properties (see, <em>Matter of Allied Corp. v Town of Camillus, </em>80 NY2d 351, 357, <em>rearg denied </em>81 NY2d 784). Those four properties, \u201cwhile rendering the property suitable to the owner\u2019s use, are not truly unique to [its] business but, in fact, make the property adaptable for general industrial use\u201d <em>(Matter of Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. v Kiernan, </em>42 NY2d 236, 240). Thus, reproduction cost (new) less depreciation (RCNLD) is not the only appropriate method for valuing those structures <em>(cf., Matter of Allied Corp. v Town of Camillus, supra, </em>at 360). Rather, petitioner\u2019s appraiser arrived at \u201ca fair and realistic value of the property involved\u201d by employing a hybrid method of valuation utilizing RCNLD, income capitalization and comparable sales <em>(Matter of Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. v Kiernan, supra, </em>at 242; <em>see, G.R.F., Inc. v Board of Assessors, </em>41 NY2d 512, 514-515).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Petitioner further established by a preponderance of the evidence that its gas and electric transmission and distribution property was overvalued by respondents for the tax years at issue. Petitioner employed the services of a qualified real estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>appraiser specializing in the appraisal of utility property. His report, utilizing RCNLD, presents a \u201cdetailed, competent appraisal\u201d of the transmission and distribution property \u201cbased on standard, accepted appraisal techniques\u201d <em>(Matter of Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v Assessor of Town of Geddes, supra, </em>at 196). Respondents, on the other hand, presented an appraisal report that was properly stricken by the court because it failed to comply with 22 NYCRR 202.59 (g) (2). Under the circumstances, the court properly reduced petitioner\u2019s assessments in accordance with petitioner\u2019s appraisal.
