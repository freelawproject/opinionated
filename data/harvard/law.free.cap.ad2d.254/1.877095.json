His enrollment in boarding school is to be accomplished during the 1998-1999 academic year at the midyear break or such other opportune time during the school year such that the disruption in his life is minimized. This will remove the child, for the time being, from the harmful environment resulting from the parties\u2019 <em>de facto </em>joint custody arrangement (see, <em>Eschbach v Eschbach, </em>56 NY2d 167, 171; <em>Braiman v Braiman, </em>44 NY2d 584), which, during these highly contentious divorce proceedings, has proven to be unworkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The record further suggests that the boys would benefit from the father maintaining a greater presence in their lives. We therefore condition his guardianship upon his establishing permanent residence in the City of New York, i.e., he is directed to: buy or lease an apartment in a residential building; spend three out of every four weekends each month in New York during the boys\u2019 academic year; and to remain in New York each fall and spring for as long as necessary in order to assist the boys in settling into their respective schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">It is also our view that the custody issue here requires renewed consideration. Given the passage of time since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>earlier proceedings and the likelihood of changed circumstances, such consideration requires that further proceedings be held, including a hearing with updated evidence as to both children and parents, and further review by Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">The custody hearing court\u2019s award of interim counsel fees to respondent did not constitute an abuse of discretion. The award permitted her to complete the original custody hearing. The issues raised concerning her alleged conversion of property and the excessiveness of the fees charged by her counsel can and should be addressed at such time when the issues of equitable distribution and counsel fees are addressed in the parties\u2019 pending divorce action.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">We have considered the parties\u2019 remaining contentions for affirmative relief and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Motion to strike respondent-appellant\u2019s reply brief in her appeal of final custody order denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Motion for anonymous status granted to the extent of publishing the instant decision with the above-stated caption.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ\">Concur \u2014 Lerner, P. J., Milonas, Rosenberger, Nardelli and Williams, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
