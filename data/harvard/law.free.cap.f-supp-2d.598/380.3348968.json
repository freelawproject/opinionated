BERMAN, District Judge.</author>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-14\">Recognizing that percentage of funds is the preferred method of assessing fees in a settlement like this, with lodestar analysis providing only a check, I can effectively gauge appropriate attorney fees only if I know the total value of the settlement. But although I am satisfied that the coupon settlement has value to the class, I am not confident of the redemption rate that has been projected and thus of the settlement\u2019s total value. Therefore, I have determined to delay award of attorney fees until experience shows how many vouchers are exercised and thus how valuable the settlement really is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-15\"><em>In re Compact Disc Minimum Advertised Price Antitrust Litig., </em>292 F.Supp.2d 184, 189-90 (D.Me.2003) (Hornby, D.J.)

R. Civ.P.\u201d) for final approval of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>settlement of this action as (originally) proposed on December 31, 2003 (\u201cSettlement\u201d); (2) pursuant to Fed R. Civ. P. 23(h) and 54(d)(2) for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses to Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel (\u201cClass Counsel\u201d) in the amount of $19,340,000.00 (\u201cClass Counsel\u2019s Fee Application\u201d) to be shared among up to 42 (sets of) attorneys; and (3) for an award of $5,000 to each of 32 Class representatives (\u201cClass Representatives\u201d) or a total of $160,000 in incentive compensation (\u201cIncentive Compensation\u201d). <em>(See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum in Support of the Joint Application of Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel for an Award of Attorneys\u2019 Fees, Reimbursement of Expenses and an Award of Incentive Compensation to the Class Representatives, dated April 20, 2004 (\u201cPL Fee Mem.\u201d).) Defendants \u201cagreed to pay the [Class Counsel\u2019s Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Expenses] separately from [Defendants\u2019] agreement to provide valuable vouchers\u201d (\u201cVoucher Program\u201d) and other relief to UPS customers under the Settlement. <em>(Id. </em>at 5.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendants did not oppose Class Counsel\u2019s Fee Application or the Class Representatives\u2019 Incentive Compensation. <em>(See </em>Settlement \u00a7 V(D)(1) (\u201cDefendants will not oppose an award of total Attorneys\u2019 Fees equal to or less than\u201d $19,340,000).)</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">At the Court\u2019s request, Plaintiffs filed supplemental papers in which Class Counsel documented a \u201clodestar\u201d of $6,944,964.00 along with $1,066,403.60 in expenses through May 21, 2004, for total lodestar and expenses of $8,011,367.60. <em>(See </em>Order, dated May 5, 2004; Declaration of Stanley M.

Schweinberg, Ann Reid Warrington, William McGrath, Paul Redd, John P. Hale, Jr., Sound Deals, Inc., Digital Playroom, Inc., Kearney D. Hutsler, P.C., Joel Shapiro, and Transnational News Co., Inc. (the \u201cCoordinated Objectors\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who seek an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses in the amount of $500,000, from which the Coordinated Objectors collectively seek to be paid an \u201cincentive award\u201d of $1,000 (Petition For An Award of Attorney\u2019s Fees and Expenses By Coordinated Objectors\u2019 Counsel, dated July 9, 2004 (\u201cCoord. Obj. Fee Mem.\u201d), at 8) (together, the \u201cObjectors\u2019 Counsel\u2019s Fee Applications\u201d). By an agreement, dated July 1, 2004, among Objectors\u2019 Counsel, Class Counsel, and Defendants, it was agreed, among other things, that: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Class Counsel would reduce their application for expenses by $204,975.39; and (2) the parties would \u201cnot oppose....

The Court determined that Class Counsel\u2019s fees could not properly be assessed under either the \u201clodestar\u201d or \u201cpercentage\u201d methods until (1) Judge Fox issued his report regarding Class Counsel\u2019s lodestar and expenses, and (2) the Court \u201cdetermin[ed] the Settlement\u2019s actual benefit to the Class\u201d (which \u201ccannot accurately be assessed until the rate at which Class Members redeem UPS Vouchers is known\u201d). <em>(Id. </em>at *15-16.) The Court also held that it could not determine Objectors\u2019 Counsel\u2019s Fee Applications, \u201cas they are predicated (contingent), in part, upon a final determination of Class Counsel\u2019s Fees.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at *17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">On November 29, 2004, Judge Fox issued a thoughtful and comprehensive report and recommendation (\u201cReport\u201d) recommending that Class Counsel\u2019s collective lodestar be reduced from $6,944,964.00 to $5,652,271.36 and that Class Counsel\u2019s expense award be reduced from $1,066,403.60 to $753,144.25.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(See </em>Report at 1.) On December 16, 2004, Class Counsel filed objections to the Report. <em>(See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsels\u2019 Combined Response to Magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation Concerning Lodestar and Expenses, dated December 16, 2004 (\u201cClass Counsel Response to R &amp; R\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">At the Court\u2019s request, on September 9, 2005, Plaintiffs and Defendants submitted a Joint Report Relating to Conclusion of Voucher Redemptions (\u201cJoint Report\u201d) stating that all UPS Settlement Vouchers had expired, and that \u201cthe value of goods and services for which Vouchers were redeemed totaled $4,863,877.\u201d (Joint Report \u00b6 4 (emphasis added).) This amount contrasts sharply with Class Counsel\u2019s earlier estimates of the value of the Voucher Program. <em>(See </em>Affidavit of Plaintiffs\u2019 economic expert, Harvey S. Rosen, dated April 20, 2004 (\u201cRosen Aff.\u201d), \u00b65 &amp; n.2 (estimating the aggregate \u201cface value\u201d of the Voucher Program at $265 million, and estimating \u201cthe aggregate monetary value\u201d of the Voucher Program at $205 million).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">\u25a0On September 12, 2005, the Court directed Plaintiffs and Defendants to submit <em>\u201cseparate </em>sworn declarations detailing the monetary value, if any, to the Class of the structural changes described in the [Court\u2019s July 30, 2004] Decision.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>der, dated Sept. 12, 2005.) On September 26, 2005, Plaintiffs submitted a declaration of Dr. Rosen, who \u201cconclud[ed] to a reasonable degree of economic certainty that a conservative range of the value of the structural changes is between $79.8 million and $142.4 million----\u201d (Declaration of Harvey S. Rosen, dated Sept. 26, 2005, \u00b6 8.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendants submitted the declaration of their counsel, Steven M. Kaufmann, that \u201cDefendants are not in a position to assign a meaningful monetary value to the various disclosure and structural changes to the EV Insurance program under the Settlement.\u201d (Declaration of Steven M. Kaufmann, dated Sept. 26, 2005 (\u201cKaufmann Decl.\u201d), \u00b62.) In a memorandum endorsement, dated September 26, 2005, the Court stated that \u201cDefendants\u2019 submission is not convincing nor is it, respectfully, likely that Defendants are unable, <em>e.g., </em>with the help of outside consultants if need be, to come up with a meaningful ] and documented valuation of the entire settlement \u2014 coupons plus \u2018structural changes.\u2019 \u201d (Memorandum Endorsement, dated Sept. 26, 2005.) In response, on or about October 6, 2005, Defendants submitted a Supplemental Submission Regarding the Monetary Value of the Structural Changes Under the Settlement (\u201cDefs\u2019 Supp. Submission\u201d) describing the value of the \u201cprimary \u2018structural changes\u2019 \u201d as follows: First, as to the \u201cchanges ... to the use of licensed insurance agents and independent claim adjusters to adjust claims,\u201d Defendants stated that \u201c[w]hile the independence of these licensed professionals may provide intangible consumer protection, there is no evidence that these measures resulted in more claims paid or \u2018the return of more premiums\u2019 to customers as plaintiffs suggest.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 2.) \u201cIn fact, the ratio of paid claims to premiums in this program was fairly constant from 1984-003,\u201d and \u201cactually decreased slightly after the institution of the Settlement compliance measures.... \u201d <em>(Id. </em>(citing Declaration of Hathaway Jones, dated Oct. 5, 2005 (\u201cJones Decl.\u201d), \u00b6\u00b6 2-3).) Second, \u201cUPS had stopped reinsuring the EV program with OPL [Defendants Overseas Partners, Ltd. and Overseas Partners Capital Corp.] and instead began reinsuring the program through a wholly owned subsidiary\u201d (while \u201calso putfting] in place independent claims adjusters and us[ing] licensed insurance agents,\u201d Jones Decl. \u00b6 4) \u201cbefore this Settlement ... and was a conservative move by UPS to eliminate the tax issue for future years.\u201d (Defs\u2019 Supp. Submission at 3 (citing Jones Decl. \u00b6 3^4).) The \u201cthird structural change stipulated that UPS [make] additional disclosures related to EV Insurance concerning the exclusion from coverage of Articles of Unusual Value, that the price of EV Insurance is surcharged by Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. franchisees, and that the purchase of EV Insurance is optional.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Defendants commented that \u201c[w]hile UPS believes that prior disclosures were adequate, the additional disclosures certainly also provide a broad and clear explanation,\u201d but that \u201cUPS cannot ascribe a monetary value to those changes.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">For the reasons set forth below, Class Counsel\u2019s Fee Application is granted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>part and denied in part; the application for an award of Incentive Compensation to the Class Representatives is denied; Class Counsel\u2019s Objections to Judge Fox\u2019s Report are denied (as explained below); and Objectors\u2019 Counsel\u2019s Fee Applications and motion for incentive compensation are denied. The Court awards Class Counsel $2,407,294 in legal fees and $753,144.25 in expenses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">II. Legal Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u201cThe trend in this Circuit is toward the percentage method, which directly aligns the interests of the class and its counsel and provides a powerful incentive for the efficient prosecution and early resolution of litigation.\u201d <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., </em>396 F.3d 96, 123 (2d Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1044, 125 S.Ct. 2277, 161 L.Ed.2d 1080 (2005). \u201c[T]he lodestar remains useful as a baseline even if the percentage method is eventually chosen\u201d; where the lodestar is \u201cused as a mere cross-check, the hours documented by counsel need not be exhaustively scrutinized.\u201d <em>Goldberger v. Integrated Resources, Inc., </em>209 F.3d 43, 50 (2d Cir. 2000). \u201c[N]o matter which method is chosen, district courts should continue to be guided by the traditional criteria in determining a reasonable common fund fee, including: \u2018(1) the time and labor expended by counsel; (2) the magnitude and complexities of the litigation; (3) the risk of the litigation ...; (4) the quality of representation; (5) the requested fee in relation to the settlement; and (6) public policy considerations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The party seeking attorneys\u2019 fees bears the \u201cburden of establishing entitlement to an award----\u2019\u201d <em>Savoie v. Merchants Bank, </em>166 F.3d 456, 463 (2d Cir.1999) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">A. Class Counsel\u2019s Fee Application 1. Legal Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">Class Counsel sought a total award of $19,340,000.00 ($18,478,571.70 in legal fees and $861,428.30 in expenses) to be paid by UPS and shared among up to 42 sets of Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel (and including up to $600,000 in Objectors\u2019 Counsel\u2019s fees and expenses). (PI. Fee Mem. at 1; Objector Settlement \u00b6 4; Report.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Class Counsel initially argued that \u201c[t]his settlement presents an ideal case for using the percentage of the common benefit as the basis for determining an award of fees.\u201d (PI. Fee Mem. at 6; <em>see id. </em>(\u201cCourts in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Second Circuit recognize that the preferred approach to awarding fees and the reimbursement of expenses when Counsel\u2019s efforts have created a common benefit is the percentage of the value of the benefit.\u201d).) Under this approach, the \u201crequested fees [of $18,478,571.70] represent less than 10% of the value of the Settlement,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>which Class Counsel estimated in 2004 to be over $205 million. (PI. Fee Mem. at I, 10; <em>see </em>Transcript of May 21, 2004 Fairness Hearing at 59-60; Rosen Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8-9.) As it happens, the requested fees are approximately 280% greater than the $4,863,877 actual value of the redeemed coupons. <em>(See </em>Joint Report \u00b64.)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In December 1994, Class Counsel stated that \u201c[i]n light of this Court\u2019s adoption of the view that a percentage of the fund cannot be awarded in a settlement that provides in kind benefits [coupons] until the number of class members who choose to take advantage of the benefits is actually known, ... Plaintiffs request that the ... Court calculate the fee using only the lodestar approach, and consider the appropriate factors in assessing the multiplier to be provided.\u201d <em>(See </em>Class Counsel Response to R &amp; R at 5-9.) As noted, Class Counsel sought a $6,944,964 lodestar <em>(see </em>Attachment to Chesley 5/6/04 Deck) and suggested a 2.7 multiplier (Class Counsel Response to R &amp; R at 7 n.14, 9), which would yield legal fees of $18,751,402. <em>(See </em>page 385 n. 10, <em>supra.) </em>Class Counsel also argued that the \u201claw does not require the Court to base the fee award on the redeemed vouchers.\u201d (Plaintiffs\u2019 Response to Objections to the Award of Attorneys\u2019 Fees, dated May 6, 2004 (\u201cPI. Opp. Mem.\u201d), at 21-22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The Court finds that the percentage method of calculating legal fees, rather than the lodestar, is appropriate in this case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See Wal-Mart, </em>396 F.3d at 123 (\u201cThe trend in this Circuit is toward the percentage method.... \u201d); <em>In re Compact Disc, </em>370 F.Supp.2d at 322 (\u201cthe percentage of fund method is the prevailing approach for a common fund case like this, subject to check by the lodestar approach\u201d). The lodestar approach is not appropriate (especially if enhanced by a multiplier as Class Counsel suggest) where, as here, the lodestar substantially exceeds the value to the class of the coupons redeemed, <em>e.g., </em>$6,944,964.00 (lodestar) versus $4,863,877 (coupons redeemed). <em>See, e.g., Strougo v. Bassini, </em>258 F.Supp.2d 254, 262-63 (S.D.N.Y.2003) (employing percentage approach where lodestar exceeded settlement value); Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(h) Adv. Comm. Note (In determining counsel\u2019s fees, \u201c[o]ne fundamental focus is the result actually achieved for class members.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The \u201c[determination of an appropriate fee award starts with assessing a percentage against the amount recovered.\u201d <em>Compact Disc, </em>370 F.Supp.2d at 321. The total value of the Settlement (\u201cSettlement Value\u201d) in this case consists of: (1) the value of the Voucher Program; (2) the value of injunctive relief (\u201cStructural Changes\u201d); and (3) total awarded legal fees and expenses. <em>See Johnston v. Comerica Mortg. Corp., </em>83 F.3d 241, 245-46 (8th Cir.1996) (\u201cThe award to the class and the agreement on attorney fees represent a package deal. Even if the fees are paid directly to the attorneys, those fees are still best viewed as an aspect of the class\u2019 recovery.\u201d); <em>Manual for Complex Litigation </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>\u00a7 21.7, at 335 (4th ed. Fed. Jud. Center 2004) (\u201cIf an agreement is reached on the amount of a settlement fund and a separate amount for attorney fees and expenses ... the sum of the two amounts ordinarily should be treated as a settlement fund for the benefit of the class.... The total fund could be used to measure whether the portion allocated to the class and to attorney fees is reasonable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The value of the Voucher Program consists of the total dollar value of redeemed vouchers or $4,863,877, which is 2.4% of Plaintiffs\u2019 original estimate of voucher redemptions, <em>i.e., </em>$205 million. <em>See Compact Disc, </em>370 F.Supp.2d at 321 (\u201cthe actual realized value of the vouchers\u201d consisted of vouchers actually redeemed by class members); <em>see also </em>Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-2, 119 Stat. 4, \u00a7 3(a), codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1712 (\u201cIf a proposed settlement in a class action provides for a recovery of coupons to a class member, the portion of any attorney\u2019s fee award to class counsel that is attributable to the award of the coupons shall be based on the value to class members of the coupons that are redeemed.\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The value of the Structural Changes is more difficult to quantify. Until the Court\u2019s recent request, neither party had, in fact, assigned a monetary value to the Structural Changes. Plaintiffs\u2019 expert had initially stated that, although the Structural Changes had \u201cvery substantial\u201d value, he could not \u201cquantify the precise economic value\u201d (Rosen Aff. \u00b6 9), and Defendants have consistently taken the position that they were \u201cnot in a position to assign a meaningful monetary value\u201d to the Structural Changes (Kaufmann Deck \u00b6 2).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKR\">Precisely because the value of injunctive relief is difficult to quantify, its value is also easily manipulable.... We hold, therefore, that only in the unusual instance where the value to individual class members of benefits deriving from injunctive relief can be accurately ascertained may courts include such relief as part of the value of a common fund for purposes of applying the percentage method of determining fees. When this is not the case, courts should consider the value of the injunctive relief obtained as a \u201crelevant circumstance\u201d in determining what percentage of the common fund class counsel should receive as attorneys\u2019 fees, rather than as part of the fund itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-9\"><em>Staton, </em>327 F.3d at 974 (citations omitted); <em>accord Linney v. Cellular Alaska Partnership, </em>1997 WL 450064, at *6-7 (N.D.Cal. July 18, 1997) (Where class action settlement consisted of $6 million cash recovery plus \u201cinjunctive relief with a value, although no doubt substantial, that can only be estimated,\u201d and which class counsel\u2019s expert valued at between $20.9 million and $34.2 million, court granted legal fees of $2 million, or one-third of the cash recovery. \u201cTherefore, even if one argues that the injunctive relief provided for in the settlement is worthless, a proposition the Court and the parties sincerely doubt, class coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>sel will receive no more than one-third of the relief obtained for the class\u201d), <em>ajfd </em>151 F.3d 1234 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The Court has considered the opinion of Plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Dr. Rosen, who \u201cconservatively\u201d estimates the value of the Structural Changes at $79.8 million to $142.4 million. Respectfully, Dr. Rosen\u2019s perspective is not persuasive because, among other things, he (vastly) overestimated the value of the Voucher Program, <em>ie., </em>by over 4,000%. (Rosen Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8-9.) While the Structural Changes may \u201cconfer a substantial benefit upon the Class,\u201d Settlement Order, 2004 WL 1724980, at *14, they were not, insofar as the record shows, considered to be worth (much less exceed) the value of the Voucher Program <em>(id.). </em>The Court is mindful of Defendants\u2019 evaluation of (some of) the Structural Changes, for example, that there is little evidence that UPS customers benefitted from the \u201cchanges ... to the use of licensed insurance agents and independent claim adjusters to adjust claims,\u201d and that, for tax purposes, UPS had already \u201cstopped reinsuring the EV program with OPL\u201d prior to the Settlement. <em>(See </em>pages 384-85, <em>supra </em>(quoting Defs\u2019 Supp. Submission and Jones Decl.).)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Defendants also commented that \u201c[w]hile UPS believes that prior disclosures were adequate, the additional [Structural Change] disclosures certainly also provide a broad and clear explanation,\u201d but that \u201cUPS cannot ascribe a monetary value to those changes.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Rather than attempt to assign a specific dollar value to the Structural Changes, the Court is acknowledging that they do benefit the Class by awarding legal fees at the upper end (30%) of the Settlement Value commonly awarded under the percentage method, although still substantially lower than the fees sought by counsel. <em>See Sta-ton, </em>327 F.3d at 974 (citations omitted) (\u201ccourts should consider the value of the injunctive relief obtained as a \u2018relevant circumstance\u2019 in determining what percentage of the common fund class counsel should receive as attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d); <em>accord Linney, </em>1997 WL 450064, at *6-7.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">In determining the appropriate legal fee award, the Court has also reviewed the factors set forth in <em>Goldberger v.

As to the second factor, \u201c[t]his four-year old action is legally and factually complex as it involves, among other things, contract, RICO, and antitrust claims filed in 27 different state and federal cases on behalf of over 2.6 million Plaintiffs against 27 named Defendants.\u201d Settlement Order, 2004 WL 1724980, at *11. As to the third <em>Goldberger </em>factor, <em>i.e., </em>the risk of the litigation, this case did not appear exceptionally risky, particularly at the time it was commenced. <em>See Goldberger, </em>209 F.3d at 54-55 (the risk to counsel \u201cmust be measured as of when the case is filed\u201d); <em>accord In re Bristol-Myers Squibb Secs.

That is, at the time virtually all of the consolidated cases were filed in 1999 and 2000, there had been a ruling very favorable to Plaintiffs by the United States Tax Court (the \u201cTax Court Ruling\u201d). <em>See UPS of America, Inc. v.

While this case was pending, the Tax Court Ruling was reversed, on June 20, 2001, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. <em>UPS of Am., Inc. v.

As noted, the value of the vouchers redeemed is only $4,863,877 in comparison to the $205 million predicted by Class Counsel. And, the value of the Structural Changes is difficult to quantify. It would be anomalous and unacceptable for counsel to fare better than the Class, for example to receive 280% more than the Class actually received, as Class Counsel suggest. While \u201cthis case is undoubtedly a losing proposition for [Class Counsel],\u201d the settlement value ultimately \u201cwas very modest.\u201d <em>Compact Disc, </em>370 F.Supp.2d at 323 (awarding fee of less than 18% of total settlement value because voucher redemptions proved to be much lower than predicted); <em>see, e.g., In re Auction Houses Antitrust Litig., </em>No. 00 Civ. 0648, 2001 WL 170792, at *9 (S.D.N.Y.

Expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Class Counsel initially requested $1,066,403 in expenses <em>(see </em>Attachment to Chesley 5/6/04 Decl.) and, thereafter, reduced their expense request by $204,975.39 (Chesley 7/8/04 Decl. \u00b6 15; Objector Settlement \u00b6 2; Report at 5-6), apparently resulting in a final expense request of $861,428.30 <em>(see </em>page 385, supra). Judge Fox recommended that Class Counsel\u2019s expense award be set at $753,144.25 based upon, among other things, the following guiding principles: \u201cfee applications that do not contain [sufficient] supporting data\u201d or that contain \u201cvague\u201d descriptions should normally be disallowed (Report at 11); expenses will be limited to \u201c$500 per round-trip flight,\u201d $100 per day for meals and $200 per night for lodging, and $0.25 per facsimile page <em>(id. </em>at 11-12); and expenses relating to duplicative staffing will be disallowed <em>(id. </em>at 10, 42, 44). <em>(See also </em>Case Management Order at 4-10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Plaintiffs filed objections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report arguing that, among other things: Judge Fox\u2019s \u201cknowledge of the case was limited\u201d and that he \u201cneither asked for additional information nor conducted any hearings\u201d (Class Counsel Response to R &amp; R at 2^4); the \u201cblanket reductions for travel and additional attorney participation are unusually harsh\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 4-5); and Judge Fox erred regarding a variety of individual expense requests <em>(id. </em>at Exs.

Bartlett, </em>776 F.Supp. 815, 817 (S.D.N.Y.1991).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> First, the Court appointed three Lead Counsel on July 7, 2000, one liaison counsel on February 2, 2001, and two counsel to represent certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>subclasses on November 12, 2002. The Case Management Order (and later orders) \u201cacknowledged\u201d that seven attorneys have \u201cagreed among themselves to serve as Plaintiffs\u2019 EVIC Steering Committee.\u201d <em>(See </em>page 389 n. 16, <em>supra.) </em>Second, Judge Fox\u2019s decision to reduce vague or insufficiently itemized expenses was entirely appropriate. <em>(See, e.g., </em>Report at 49 (rejecting $19,291.05 in unitemized expenses requested by Milberg, Weiss, Bershad &amp; Shulman, L.L.P. relating to \u201cExpert/Consultants Fees,\u201d \u201cTravel/ Meals,\u201d and \u201cSecretary/Support Staff Disbursements\u201d).) It was Class Counsel\u2019s burden to establish entitlement to fees, <em>Savoie, </em>166 F.3d at 463; it was not Judge Fox\u2019s burden to fill gaps in Class Counsel\u2019s application. <em>See Hynes v.

Nor are Judge Fox\u2019s reductions for excessive travel expenses (Report at *11-12) \u201cunusually harsh\u201d (Class Counsel Response to R <em>&amp; </em>R at 4-5). <em>See, e.g., Mark Andrew of the Palm Beaches, Ltd. v.

Judge Fox reasonably reduced expenses relating to duplicative attorney participation, including Plaintiffs\u2019 practice of sending multiple attorneys to court conferences (Report at 42, 44). <em>See, e.g., Anderson v.

It awards Class Counsel legal fees amounting to $2,407,294, or approximately 30% of the Settlement Value. In addition, the Court awards Class Counsel $753,144.25 in expenses.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">B. <em>Class Representatives\u2019 Incentive Payment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">Class Counsel seeks an award of Incentive Compensation in the amount of $5,000 for each of the 32 Class Representatives, for a total of $160,000.
