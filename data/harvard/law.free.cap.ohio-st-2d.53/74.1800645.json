C. 2923.03(1)), effective January 1, 1974, unless said testimony is supported by other probative evidence. There was evidence by witnesses other than Willoughby to support a jury finding that the crime charged was committed, but there was no evidence other than the testimony of Willoughby identifying the appellant as one of the three persons involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">R. C. 2923.03(D) relates to \u201ccomplicity\u201d and provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">\u201cNo person shall be convicted of complicity under this section solely upon the testimony of an accomplice, unsupported by other evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">This statute was enacted after the decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Flonnory </em>(1972), 31 Ohio St. 2d 124, in which paragraph three of the syllabus reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">\u201cA conviction may be based upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, except where otherwise specifically provided by statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">The exception provided for by the statute changes the general rule recognized by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Flon</em>nory, <em>supra. </em>In this day of plea bargaining and immunized testimony, and under such a statute, it is vitally important that one implicating an accomplice do something more than point a finger. His testimony must be corroborated by some other fact, circumstance, or testimony which also points to the identity of the one he accuses as a guilty actor.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The specific statutory language of R. C. 2923.03 (D) is otherwise meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence must he set aside. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b102-6\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Celebrezze, W. Brown, P. Brown, Sweeney and Locher, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b101-11\">tn view of the independent finding by the Court of Appeals that \u201cthe claim of Willoughby that Myers was linked with the crime is uncorroborated,\u201d with which we concur, we need not determine how much corroboration is sufficient. However, where other' states have required,. by statute or judicial decision, corroboration of accomplice testimony, the test has generally been \u201c \u2018to eliminate from consideration the evidence of the accomplice witness and then to examine the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>dence of other witnesses with the view to ascertain if there be inculpatory evidence * * * which tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Forbes </em>v. <em>State </em>(Tex.
