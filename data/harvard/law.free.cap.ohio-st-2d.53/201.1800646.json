Util. Comm. </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 1, as authority for the above proposition. However, such heavy reliance on <em>Beiter Line </em>and similar cases is unfounded, for two reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">First, this court in <em>Beiter Line </em>stated that the commission <em>\u201cis not obligated * </em>* * to make a specific finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>that there is public convenience and necessity as to extended motor carrier service * *</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In <em>Beiter Line, </em>this court stated only that <em>repeated </em>findings of public convenience and necessity were not required ; the concept was not made irrelevant. Quite clearly this court stated, at page 7, that convenience and necessity \u201cis the very object of such zone extension.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Second, there is an important factual distinction between the instant cause and the cases cited by appellants. In the latter the carriers were municipally based, and therefore uniformity of service between the municipality and its commercial zone was desirable. However, in the instant case, appellants\u2019 base point is Fairfield County, not the city of Columbus, and thus the policy arguments for uniformity are not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Alternatively, appellants assert that reciprocal rights to serve a commercial zone inure to a common carrier serving a municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">In <em>Highway, Inc., </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1959), 169 Ohio St. 195, this court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\"><em>\u201cIt is not error </em>for the * * * [commission] to extend reciprocal privileges to all motor carriers holding authority * * * within the municipality about which a zone is being created.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">The above case clearly does not require the commission to grant reciprocal rights. A commission finding will not be disturbed unless it is manifestly against the weight of the evidence and so clearly unsupported by the record as to show misapprehension, mistake, or willful disregard of duty. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St. 2d 142, 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">Appellants have not met this burden. Indeed, their claims of unfairness are not supported by specific evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">The order of the commission is neither unreasonable nor unlawful and is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b229-14\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Celebrezze, W. Brown, P. Brown, Sweeney and Locher, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
