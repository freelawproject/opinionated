C. 2317.40, and that as such, is inadmissible in evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule based on this court\u2019s holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tims </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St. 2d 136. Appellee, on the other hand, contends that the log book is an official report kept by officers of this state as required by regulations promulgated by the Director of Health, and thus, was properly admitted in evidence under the official-reports-as-evidence exception to the hearsay rule found in B. C. 2317.42. Determination of the applicable exception to the hearsay rule directly affects the outcome in this cause, since, in authenticating the document during trial the prosecution did hot call as a witness the custodian, supervisor, or maker of the record as required under R. C. 2317.40, but rather merely submitted a certified copy of the report as permitted under R. C. 2317.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">R. C. 2317.42 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">\u201cOfficial reports made by officers of' this state, or certified copies of the same, on a matter within the scope of their duty as defined by statute, shall, insofar as relevant, be admitted as evidence of the matters stated therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">'' ' In discussing the necessity for the official-reports-aseviderice exception, this court noted that:</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">\u201cThe General Assembly, recognizing <em>the </em>need for <em>an </em>authority that \u2018would make admissible various sorts of reports dealing with matters seldom disputable and only provable otherwise at disproportionate inconvenience and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>cost\u2019 (5 Wigmore on Evidence [3 Ed.], 699 Section 1672), enacted Section 2317.42, Revised Code, thereby greatly facilitating the production of evidence with little chance of it being untrustworthy.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Colvin </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St. 2d 86, at 89. As commented in 5 Wigmore on Evidence (3 Ed.), 618, Section 1632:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">\u201c* * * When ^ is a part of the <em>duty of a public, officer </em>to make a statement as to a fact coming within his official cognizance, the great probability is that he does his duty and makes a correct statement. The consideration that regularity of habit, a chief basis for the exception for regular entries * <em>* </em>will tend to this end is not here an essential one; for casual statements, such as certificates, may be admissible, as well as a regular series of entries in a registry. The fundamental circumstance is that an official duty exists to make an accurate statement, and that this special and weighty duty will usually suffice as a motive to incite the officer to its fulfillment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Applying the above statutory provisions to the cause at bar, the court finds that portions of the permanent logbook are admissible under the official-reports-as-evidence exception. . Clearly, police officers of the city of Wooster are \u201cofficers of this state\u201d within the meaning of R. C. 2317.42. Furthermore, under the rules promulgated by the Director of Health pursuant to R. C. 3701.143,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> members of the police department of the city of Wooster have the duty of conducting calibration tests on breath analysis machines and recording the results therefrom in a permanent log book kept on file at the station. Specifically, the rules require, in part, that, except for sober-meters, breath testing instruments must be calibrated by a qualified senior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>operator \u201cusing methods and techniques for calibration recommended by the manufacturer of the calibration instrunient or the director of health\u201d no less frequently than after every ten tests, or after every nine days if fewer than ten tests are performed in any nine-day period (Ohio Administrative Code Rule 3701-53-04 [A]), and that the results of the calibration tests shall be kept in a record book for not more than three years. (Ohio Administrative Code Rule 3701-53-04[C].)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In accord with our holding that certified copies of an official report regarding the proper calibration of the breath analysis machine are sufficiently reliable to warrant their \u00e1dmissibility in evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule are <em>Wester </em>v. <em>State </em>(Alaska 1974), 528 P. 2d 1179, certiorari denied 423 U, S . 836; <em>State </em>v. <em>McGeary </em>(1974), 129 N. J. Super. 219, 322 A. 2d 830; <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodward </em>(1 Ore. App. 338), 462 P. 2d 685; <em>Stroupe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth </em>(1974), 215 Va. 243, 207 S. E. 2d 894; and <em>Duff </em>v. <em>State </em>(Crim. App. Tex. 1974), 503 S. W. 2d 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">A common approach adopted by a growing number of jurisdictions with respect to questions concerning the proper foundation needed for the introduction of breath analysis test results in evidence is set forth by the Court of Appeals of New York in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gower </em>(1977), 42 N. Y. 2d 117, 366 N. E. 2d 69, at page 71, wherein that court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\"><em>\u201c* * </em>* Perhaps of greater importance than the procedural issue concerning the admissibility of particular forms of documentary evidence, is the underlying question of substantive law \u2014 what foundation must now be laid, for the admission of breathalyzer results. Breathalyzer equipment and procedures have become familiar and their use is now commonplace. Reliability has been demonstrated and the results of such testing where properly performed are universally accepted. This is not to say, however, that no foundation should be any longer required for introduction of breathalyzer evidence. It is to say that there may now appropriately be some relaxation of the rigorous prerequi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>sites properly required to authenticate the reliability of the scientific equipment and procedures where they were first employed. Based on a wealth of practical experience greater dependence can now properly be placed on according full opportunity, through pretrial discovery and other means, to test and challenge the probative worth of the evidence. Thus, emphasis may be shifted from technical issues of admissibility of evidence to means for measuring its persuasive weight. No precise or even general guidelines can be laid down in advance; necessarily the requirements in each case will depend on the peculiar circumstances of that case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">We find this approach persuasive. In Ohio, it is not questioned that through pre-trial discovery under Crim. R. 16 the defense may obtain the name of the individual responsible for conducting the calibration test, and determine through deposition under Crim. R. 15 whether such individual utilized the proper methods in calibrating the machine. Furthermore, the defense may subpoena the official as a witness to testify at trial under Crim. R. 17 if deemed necessary. These protections adequately provide the defense every opportunity of insuring that the breath analysis machine was in proper working order when used in testing the defendant. To require as a matter of law that the officer who performed the calibration test (who perhaps has conducted several such tests as a matter of routine) testify at trial where the permanent record of the calibration tests and the results therefrom are readily available does not merit adoption by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Because certified copies of portions of the permanent log book qualify under the official-reports-as-evidence exception, the court finds that the documents in issue were properly authenticated by the prosecution under R. C. 2317.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The remaining question to be resolved is the impact of Tims, <em>supra </em>(9 Ohio St. 2d 136), to the cause at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">In the syllabus of <em>Tims, </em>at page 136, this court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">\u201cThe Business Records as Evidence Act, Section 2317.-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>40, Revised Code, which allows the admission into evidence of records without substantiation by the person who actually performed the acts which resulted in such record, is not applicable to criminal proceedings so as to allow the admission into evidence under such act of hospital records showing the results of a physical examination of an alleged rape victim.\u201d Although language in the syllabus narrowly confines the holding of the case to the Business Records as Evidence Act as applied to the admissibility of hospital records in criminal proceedings, there is broad language in the .main body of the opinion suggesting that the Business Records as Evidence Act, as well as the Official Reports as Evidence Act by analogy, are not applicable in such proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The latter interpretation of the holding in <em>Tims, supra, </em>is unacceptable for several reasons. As pointed out by this court in <em>Williamson Heater Co. </em>v. <em>Radich </em>(1934), 128 Ohio St. 125, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Nickles </em>(1953), 159 Ohio St. 353, 359, the holding of the syllabus must be read and interpreted in conjunction with the corresponding facts of the ease. The <em>Tims </em>case only involved the admissibility of hospital records; it clearly did not set forth a general rule proscribing the introduction in evidence of all documents that may qualify as a business record. This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that this court, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kehn </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St. 2d 11, specifically held that bank deposit slips, offered as circumstantial evidence of a coin payoff following a</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>vending machine company burglary, were properly qualified under R. C. 2317.40 as admissible in evidence. In <em>Colvin, supra </em>(19 Ohio St. 2d 86), at page 91, the court rejected the contention that evidence admitted under the Official Reports as Evidence Act violated the accused\u2019s right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Furthermore, decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States have repeatedly indicated that the right of confrontation is not one without well-recognized exceptions. <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts </em>(1934), 291 U. S. 97, at 107; <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1965), 380 U. S. 400, at 407; <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1973), 410 U. S. 284, at 288-299. In <em>Dowdell </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1911), 221 U. S. 325, at 330, the Supreme Court recognized that \u201c [d] ocumentary evidence to establish collateral facts, admissible under the common law, may be admitted in evidence\u201d in a criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">In determining what evidence is admissible in a criminal trial as an exception to the hearsay rule irrespective of the accused\u2019s basic right of confrontation, the Supreme Court has looked to \u201cindicia of reliability which have been widely viewed as determinative of whether a statement may be placed before the jury though there is no confrontation of the declarant.\u201d <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Evans </em>(1970), 400 U. S. 74, at 89. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Chambers, supra, </em>at page 295, while \u201c* * * denial or significant diminution [of an accused\u2019s right of confrontation] calls into question the ultimate \u2018integrity of the fact-finding process\u2019 and requires that the competing interest be closely examined [citation omitted] * * \u201cthe right to confront and to cross-examine is not absolute and may, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests iii the criminal trial process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">This case-by-case approach in resolving the apparent conflict between the Confrontation Clause and the hearsay exceptions recognizes that the former was \u201c* * * not [designed] to serve as a rigid and inflexible barrier against the orderly development of reasonable and necessary exceptions to the hearsay rule\u201d <em>(Kay </em>v. <em>United States </em>[C. A. 4, 1958], 255 F. 2d 476, at 480; see, also, 5 Wigmore on Evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>deuce, 155, Section 1397), bnt was \u201c* * * to advance a practical concern for the accuracy of the truth-determining process in criminal trials by assuring that \u2018the trier of fact [has] a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the prior statement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dutton, supra, </em>at 89. It is just such an approach this court has utilized in holding that copies of pages contained in a permanent log book are admissible in the instant proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">It is important to note that we are not further expressly or implicitly holding that <em>all </em>documents qualifying under the Official Reports as Evidence Act are admissible in a criminal proceeding. As stated in <em>California </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1970), 399 U. S. 149, at 155:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">\u201cMobile it may readily be conceded that hearsay rules and the Confrontation Clause are generally designed to protect similar values, it is quite a different thing to suggest that the overlap is complete and the Confrontation Clause is nothing more or less than a codification of the rules of hearsay and their exceptions as they existed historically at common law. Our decisions have never established such a congruence; indeed, we have more than once found a violation of confrontation values even though the statements in issue were admitted under an arguably recognized hearsay exception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In conclusion, the court finds that the documentary evidence <em>sub judice </em>qualifies under the Official Reports as Evidence Act pursuant to R. C. 2317.42, that the document is sufficiently reliable to warrant its admissibility in evidence despite the fact that the declarant is not present at trial, and that the holding of <em>Tims, supra, </em>is not controlling-given the facts of this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b226-10\">O\u2019Neill, C.
