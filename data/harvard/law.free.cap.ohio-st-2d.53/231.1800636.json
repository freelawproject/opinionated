Provision was made in the public debt chapter of the United States Code (Section 765, Title 31) authorizing receipt of such bonds at par plus accrued interest in payment of taxes on the estate of the deceased holder. Because of this unique capacity for effecting federal estate tax savings these bonds are popularly referred to as \u201cflower bonds.\u201d However, to the extent that flower bonds can be used to pay estate taxes, they are includible in the federal gross estate at the higher of par value or market value on the date of death, plus accrued interest, even though they may be selling below par on the date of the holder\u2019s death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">The sole issue presented by this appeal is whether the bonds in question should have been included in the decedent\u2019s Ohio estate tax return at their par value, or at their market value on the date of Mr. Kaufman\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">The definition of the term \u201cmarket value\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>codified within R. C. 5731.01(B), which section provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\">\u201cThe value of any property included in the gross estate shall be the price at which such property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. All relevant facts and elements of value as of the valuation date shall be considered in determining such value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">It is the position of the Tax Commissioner that daily market price quotations from a stock exchange cannot establish the proper value of these particular bonds for estate tax purposes. Rather, it is contended that by dying Kaufman \u201cenabled his estate to \u2018sell\u2019 the bonds to the Federal Government at face value to pay federal death taxes,\u201d thereby creating another market for the estate which was \u201cdifferent from the market in which living persons dealt.\u201d Thus, appellant urges that under the present circumstances <em>par </em>value is equivalent to this unique \u201cmarket\u201d value.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">We find this argument to be untenable. As the appellate court below so succinctly observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">\u201c* * * The executor of the deceased\u2019s estate is not a willing seller as he must redeem the bonds to the extent there is federal estate tax liability or subject himself to an action for breach of fiduciary duty. Nor can the Treasury Department of the Federal Government be considered a willing buyer when it accepts bonds at par value, since it has previously contracted itself by the terms of the bonds to do so. Yet the Ohio statute unequivocally sets out a \u2018willing buyer-willing seller\u2019 standard. Thus, it cannot be said that the statute authorizes recognition of an additional market created by the United States Government at the date of decedent\u2019s death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Appellant contends further that, by virtue of the second sentence in R. C. 5731.01(B), any factor which would influence the value of the disputed bonds must be considered in the determination of their value. In effect, appellant argues that the valuation of property included in a gross estate must reflect what the property is worth to' the estate, not what the property was worth to a decedent, <em>vis., </em>the open market price on the date of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Clearly, appellant\u2019s line of argument confuses market value, the standard defined by the General Assembly in R. C. 5731.01(B), with actual value, in this instance the peculiar augmented value realized only when the executrices were able to utilize the flower bonds to extinguish federal estate tax liability. Although the second sentence of R. C. 5731.01(B) states that \u201c[a]ll relevant facts and elements of value as of the valuation date shall be considered in determining \u2022 such value,\u201d we believe it apparent that \u201csuch value\u201d refers to the market valuation standard set forth in the preceding sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">In <em>In re Estate of Power </em>(1970), 156 Mont. 100, 476 P. 2d 506, the Supreme Court of Montana, in a situation similar to the one herein, construed the Montana inheritance tax statute, which specified the \u201cclear market value\u201d standard. The court held that the value, for state inheritance tax purposes, of United States Treasury H bonds, was the market value, and not the face value of the bonds, commenting as follows at page 106:</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\u201cIn our view where, as here, \u2018clear market value\u2019 is the standard of valuation for Montana inheritance tax purposes, a peculiar value to an individual executor not reflected in the market generally has no place in inheritance tax valuation. Such inflated value to a particular executor is not the \u2018clear market value\u2019 to which the statute refers. -And what better evidence'of market value exists than the price commanded by such bonds in open market transactions ?</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">\u201cThe redeemability of United States Treasury bonds at par in discharge of federal estate tax liability is one element of their value reflected in the price at which they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>can he bought and sold in the open market. To attribute an additional value to them in the hands of an executor who is in a position to so use them not only destroys the standard of \u2018clear market value\u2019 governing inheritance tax valuation, but amounts to double taxation of the same \u2018element of value.\u2019 \u201d Accord <em>In re Estate of Voss </em>(1973), 55 Ill. 2d 313, 303 N. E. 2d 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">We share the belief that the potential for tax savings inherent in flower bonds is a relevant factor in the determination of their market value, and as such is undoubtedly reflected in over-the-counter market quotations. Because this court may not sanction any deviation from the market value standard set forth in R. C. 5731.01(B) we must conclude that the Probate Court erred in determining that the United States Treasury H bonds should have been listed at par value in the decedent\u2019s Ohio estate tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The parties have stipulated that decedent died on a Saturday, having purchased the bonds in question on the last preceding business day. Accordingly, in this instance the purchase price constituted the market value on the valuation date. It is therefore unnecessary to remand this cause for a determination of the value of the bonds, as had been ordered by the appellate court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">As modified, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b261-9\">Herbert, W.

Indeed, they can be marketed so readily for $400,000 that, should the executrices have sold them for less, the beneficiary would and should have cited them for removal \u2014 and with just cause \u2014 for malfeasance and misfeasance.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">To reckon the value of the bonds at $316,313.86 is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>ignore not only the reality that the United States Treasury will redeem them for $400,000 but also the precise mandate expressed by the General Assembly in E. C. 5731.01 (B) that \u201c[a]ll relevant facts and elements of value as of the valuation date shall be considered in determining such value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">In <em>Bankers Trust Co. </em>v. <em>United Slates </em>(C. A. 2, 1960), 284 F. 2d 537, certiorari denied, 366 U. S. 903, the valuation of \u201cflower bonds,\u201d which could be used at par value as a credit against the federal estate tax, rather than at their lower market price at the date of death, was premised upon the provision in paragraph (a) of Treasury Eegulation 105, Section 81.10, that \u201c [a] 11 relevant facts and elements of value as of the applicable valuation date should be considered in every case.\u201d I can perceive no logical difference between the preceding two sentences that would justify this aberrant interpretation of E. O. 5731.01(B) espoused by the majority. The California Supreme Court determined that, for the purpose of the inheritance tax imposed by California, \u201cflower bonds\u201d should be appraised at their par value to the extent that they can foe used to pay federal estate taxes. <em>Estate of Rosenfeld </em>(1965), 62 Cal. 2d 432, 398 P. 2d 783. The applicable regulation therein provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">\u201c \u2018In any case in which it is established that the value per share or bond on the basis of the selling or bid and asked prices does not reflect the market value of a security, other relevant facts and elements of value will also be considered in determining its market value.\u2019 (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 18, Section 13951 [f].)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">In determining that \u201cbid\u201d and \u201casked\u201d prices did not reflect the market value of the \u201cflower bonds,\u201d the California Supreme Court \u25a0 reasoned, at page 434, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\u201cIt is common knowledge that one of the chief reasons for the purchase of the type of bond here involved is the advantageous marketability at the death of the holder, the United States Government having created an additional market for the bonds in which the estate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>the holder is assured of an opportunity to obtain par value to the extent there is federal estate tax liability that may be extinguished by their surrender.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u201cTo some extent, this advantageous marketability is reflected in the over-the-counter market quotations; but, as pointed out in the <em>Bankers Trust Company </em>case, <em>supra, </em>284 F. 2d 537, 538, sales in the open market do not reflect the full value of such bonds in the estate of a holder whose death has made them redeemable at par value if they are used to extinguish federal estate tax liability. <em>This fact constitutes a \u2018relevant fact and element of value\u2019 which must be considered in determining the market value of the bonds.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\"><em>Matter of Behm </em>(1963), 19 A. D. 2d 234, 241 N. Y. S. 2d 264, similarly held that \u201cflower bonds\u201d used at their par value toward payment of federal estate tax should be valued at their par value and not a lower quoted market value in a New York estate tax return. Eecognizing a state policy of conforming its method of valuation with the federal estate tax law, the court, after citing the <em>Bankers Trust Co. </em>case, <em>supra, </em>further stated, at page 236:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">\u201cWhat better evidence of value can there be of an asset of an estate than the price which the estate\u2019s representative secures for the property, in this case the bonds?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">In support of its conclusion, the majority relies upon <em>In re Estate of Voss </em>(1973), 55 Ill. 2d 313, 303 N. E. 2d 9. Its application to the cause <em>sub judice, </em>hoAvever, was clearly belied within that very decision, Avherein the court stated, at page 316:</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">\u201cThe various cases cited to us which reach a conclusion contrary to that expressed in this opinion construe statutes and regulations which contained standards of valuation different from those contained in the Illinois statute. These statutes and regulations authorize the court to consider other factors than market value, such as \u2018other relevant facts and elements of value.\u2019 <em>In re Estate of Rosenfeld, </em>62 Cal. 2d 432, 42 Cal. Rptr. 447, 398 P. 2d 783; <em>In re Estate of Young </em>(P. Ct. 1969), 16 Ohio Misc. 332, 243 N. E. 2d 123; <em>Bankers Trust Co. </em>v. <em>United States </em>(2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Cir. 1960), 284 F. 2d 537, cert. denied, 366 U. S. 903, 6 L. Ed. 2d 204, 81 S. Ct. 1047.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Also, <em>In re Estate of Power </em>(1970), 156 Mont. 100, 476 P. 2d 506, fails to buttress the majority\u2019s resolution of the instant cause. The Supreme Court of Montana, in that case, found, in distinguishing <em>Bankers Trust Go., supra, Behm, supra, </em>and <em>Bosenfeld, supra, </em>that no statute or regulation authorized the court to consider \u201cother relevant facts and elements of value.\u201d Both <em>In re Estate of Voss, </em>supra, and <em>In re Estate of Power, supra, </em>furthermore involved an inheritance tax, while Ohio has imposed an estate tax. See <em>Estate of Aul </em>v. <em>Haden </em>(1970), 154 W. Va. 484, 177 S. E. 2d 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">In neither of the cases relied upon by the majority was the court confronted with a mandate similar to that contained in R. C. 5731.01(B) that \u201c[a]U relevant facts and elements of value as of the valuation date shall be considered in determining such value.\u201d Where courts were faced with analogous directions imposed only by regulations or state policy, the instructions were not whimsically cast aside, but adhered to. It is readily apparent that the General Assembly, through the incorporation of wording in R. C. 5731.01(B), effective July 1, 1968, identical in all relevant aspects with the wording construed in the <em>Bankers Trust Go. </em>case, <em>supra, </em>decided in 1960, sought to effectuate in Ohio the same standards of valuation dictated in the federal estate tax. The majority has defeated this legislative attempt, leaving a result that is indeed quizzical. \"While the bonds are valued by their issuer and sole beneficiary of their sale, the United States Treasury, at par, $400,000, for the federal estate tax, the state of Ohio and its residents, who have derived no benefit from the bonds, are forced to value these bonds not at par but at their lower market value, on the pretext of the \u201cwilling buyer and the willing seller\u201d standard of valuation that is also found in the federal estate tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Therefore, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b264-8\">O\u2019Neill., C. J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
