Although he admits submitting a resignation, he avers that he made a revocation of this resignation prior to its acceptance by the commission and its members. However, the commission did \u201caccept\u201d the resignation and proceed to appoint an interim and, eventually, a permanent director.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">A writ of <em>quo warranto </em>issues only where there is a clear legal right to the relief requested and is not the proper remedy to test the right of a person having prima facie title to an office. \u201cThe proper method of procedure in a case of this character is by mandamus rather than <em>quo warranto.\" State, ex rel. Keyser, </em>v. <em>Babst </em>(1920), 101 Ohio St. 275, 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">However, the propriety of the relief here requested is obviously bottomed upon resolution of a contractual law question. It is not the obligation of this court or the Court of Appeals to resolve contractual disputes in the guise of applications for extraordinary writs, especially in view of the fact that appellant has a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law under either Section 116 of the Akron City Charter<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>claratory judgment proceeding under E.
