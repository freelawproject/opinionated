C. 3937.18 is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-11\">\u201c(A) No automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death suifered by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle shall be de- \u25a0 livered or issued for delivery in this state with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state unless an equivalent amount of coverage for bodily injury or death is provided therein or supplemental thereto under provisions approved by the superintendent of insurance, for the protection of persons insured thereunder wh\u00f3 are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death, resulting therefrom. The named insured shall have the ' right to reject such coverage, or may require the issuance of coverage . for bodily injury or death in accordance with a schedule of optional lesser\" amounts approved by the superintendent, that shall be no less than \u2018 the limits set forth in Section 4509.20 of the Revised Code for bodily <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> injury or death. Unless the named insured requests such coverage in ' writing, such coverage need not be provided in or supplemental to a renewal policy where the named insured has rejected the coverage in connection with a policy previously issued to him by the same insurer.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b29-14\">Potter, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar\">The appellant\u2019s sole proposition of law is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-15\">\u201cInsurance contract provisions which reduce the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>amount of recovery of damages under the uninsured motorist protection clause therein by the amount of expenses for medical services (paid or payable under the medical payments portion of said policy) are valid, enforceable contractual provisions which may be properly invoked by the insurer. The trial court erred by overruling defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and in granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion [s] for summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The basic question presented by this appeal and as presented to the Court of Common Pleas and Court of Appeals is whether the uninsured motorist coverage afforded in the policy issued by the appellant to the respective appellees-polieyholders met the requirements of R. C. 3937.-18 or whether the proposed setoff for medical services is in derogation of the public policy and purpose underlying R. C. 3937.18. Both coverages, uninsured motorist and medical payments, were optional and a separate premium was paid for each.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">For the reasons hereinafter set forth we hold appellant\u2019s proposition of law not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Decisions in other jurisdictions relative to the deduction of medical payments from uninsured motorist awards have not been consistent or uniform.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant urges the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>reversal of the appellate court\u2019s judgment herein, and contends that the insurance clause in question contained in a voluntary contract is not contrary to the public policy of the state, and that the public policy of the state disapproves double recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Appellees, in essence, maintain that appellant\u2019s proposal permits a double premium but only a single recovery. Each views the suggestion of the other with disfavor and as being contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Although a tortfeasor may not benefit from insurance carried by the injured party, in the instant cause the col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>lateral source doctrine is not relevant. The insurer is not in the position of a tortfeasor, the parties being in the contractual relationship of insured and insurer. See <em>Pryor </em>v. <em>Webber </em>(1970), 23 Ohio St. 2d 104; <em>Koeper </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins. Co. </em>(E. D. Mo. 1972), 354 F. Supp. 93. Governing this contractual relation is the public policy of the state of Ohio as established by the uninsured motorist statute, R. C. 3937.18. In delineating this public policy Justice Herbert in <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutl. Ins. Co. </em>(1973), 33 Ohio St. 2d 50, stated the following, at pages 52 and 53:</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u201cThe basic purpose of R. C. 3937.18 is clear. It \u2018is designed to protect persons injured in automobile accidents from losses which, because of the tortfeasor\u2019s lack of liabil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>ity coverage, would otherwise go uncompensated.\u2019 <em>Abate </em>v. <em>Pioneer Mutual Cas. Co. </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St. 2d 161, 165, 258 N. E. 2d 429; <em>Curran </em>v. <em>State Automobile Mutl. Ins. Co. </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St. 2d 33, 266 N. E. 2d 566; see, also, Note 1, 20 Cleve. L. Rev. 10 (1971). In other words, the legislative purpose in creating compulsory uninsured motorist coverage was to place the injured policyholder in the same position, with regard to the recovery of damages, that he would have been in if the tortfeasor had possessed liability insurance.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-5\">\u201cAs suggested by <em>Abate </em>and <em>Curran, supra, </em>R. C. 3937.18, <em>ab initio, </em>enunciated a public policy in this state. Private parties are without power to insert enforceable provisions in their contracts of insurance which would restrict coverage in a manner contrary to the intent of the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-6\"><em>Bartlett, supra, </em>dealt with the deduction of workmen\u2019s compensation payments from an uninsured motorist award; here, we are concerned with deductions for medical payments. Giving a liberal construction to effectuate the intent of the General Assembly that coverage be afforded to persons injured through the acts of uninsured motorists (see <em>Curran </em>v. <em>State Automobile Mutl. Ins. Co. </em>[1971], 25 Ohio St. 2d 33, 38), we hold that the rationale of this court in <em>Bartlett, supra, </em>applies to the proposed deduction of medical payments, and the policyholder may recover, subject to his policy limits, to the same extent he would be entitled to recover from his tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Similar holdings may be found in other states. See, <em>e. g., Bacchus </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins. Group Exchange </em>(1970), 106 Ariz. 280, 282-283, 475 P. 2d 264, which states as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">\u201cPermitting offsets of any type would allow insurers, by contract, to alter the provisions of the statute and to escape all or part of the liability which the Legislature intended they should provide. The medical payment coverage part of the policy is independent of the uninsured motorist coverage and should be treated the same as if it were carried with a different company. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">\u201c* * * The fact that the motorist sees fit to clothe him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>self with other insurance protection and pays a premium therefor \u2014 such as medical payments \u2014 cannot alter the mandatory safeguards that the Legislature considers necessary for the well being of the citizen drivers of our state. More particularly, a policy provision which the insured considers to be additional protection and for which he pays a premium with such extra protection in mind cannot be transposed by the insurer into a reduction of the mandatory minimum coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\u201cIt is our opinion that in enacting Section 20-259.01 A. R. S. it was the intent of the Legislature that each insured who availed himself of uninsured motorist coverage would have available <em>not less than </em>$10,000 per person and $20,000 per occurrence. Any attempt, by contract or otherwise, to reduce any part of this amount is violative of the statute.\u201d See, also, <em>Tulley </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(S. D. W. Va. 1972), 345 F. Supp. 1123; <em>Tuggle </em>v. <em>Government Employees Ins. Co. </em>(Fla. 1968), 207 So. 2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The uninsured motorist coverage required to be offered by R. C. 3937.18 in all automobile or vehicle liability policies issued in the state of Ohio cannot be diluted or diminished by payments made to the insured pursuant to the medical payment provision of the same contract of insurance. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court, of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b34-8\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Celebrezze, W. Brown, P.
