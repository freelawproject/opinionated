Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXB\">The Court of Appeals held that the search of defendant\u2019s automobile by Cleveland Police Officer Thomas Schraf and the seizure of articles admitted in evidence during his trial for aggravated burglary were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>unreasonable and in violation of defendant\u2019s right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the provisions of Section 14, Article I of the Constitution of Ohio.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The instant cause involves the warrantless search of defendant\u2019s automobile subsequent to his being stopped on the highway by police officers and arrested for a minor traffic violation (running a red stop light).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">It is well-settled that warrantless searches are <em>\u201cper se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment \u2014 subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire </em>(1971), 403 U. S. 443, 454-455; <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1967), 389 U. S. 347, 357. The state has the burden of establishing the application of one of the exceptions to this rule designating warrantless searches as \u201cper se unreasonable.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Call </em>(1965), 8 Ohio App. 2d 277; <em>State </em>v. <em>Person </em>(1973), 34 Ohio Misc. 97; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jeffers </em>(1951), 342 U. S. 48, 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The state argues, and we agree, that the search of defendant\u2019s automobile was reasonable under the \u201cautomobile exception\u201d enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1925), 267 U. S. 132. <em>\u201cCarroll, supra, </em>holds a search warrant unnecessary where there is probable cause to search an automobile stopped on the highway; the ear is movable, the occupants are alerted, and the car\u2019s contents may never be found again if a warrant must be obtained.\u201d <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Maroney </em>(1970), 399 U. S. 42, 51; <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, supra, </em>at page 460; <em>Dyke </em>v. <em>Taylor Implement Mfg. Co. </em>(1968), 391 U. S. 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>In the instant cause, the exigent circumstances necessary to bring the search of defendant\u2019s automobile within the ambit of <em>Carroll </em>are present. The car was stopped on the public highway. Kessler\u2019s passenger, Robin Right-son, was alerted to the intentions of the police, was not placed under full police custody, and could have readily moved the automobile, thus, \"remov[ing] evidence from official grasp.\u201d <em>Cardwell </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1974), 417 U. S. 583, 590. However, the issue remains whether Police Officer Schraf had probable cause to search the defendant\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The requisite probable cause is defined in Carroll, <em>supra, </em>at page 149, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\"># # ,a belief, reasonably arising out of circumstances known to the seizing officer, that an automobile or other vehicle contains that which by law is subject to seizure and destruction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Violation of a traffic ordinance does not, in itself, justify a search of the offender\u2019s automobile. <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodford </em>(1971), 26 Ohio Misc. 51, 55. The police must have \" \u2018probable cause\u2019 to believe that they will find the instrumentality of a crime or evidence pertaining to a crime before they begin their warrantless search.\u201d <em>Dyke </em>v. <em>Taylor Implement Mfg. Co., supra, </em>at page 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The facts which the state contends constitute probable cause to search defendant\u2019s car include: the furtive movement of the passenger ducking down out of sight after spotting the police vehicle; the car fit the description given the officers of a vehicle involved in recent burglaries in the area; the officers had observed the car in the same area several days before; the auto ran a red light when the police vehicle began to follow; and Officer Schraf recognized the defendant as one who had been previously arrested for burglaries in the area. In addition, there is the failure of Kessler to produce a driver\u2019s license or show proof of ownership of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Furtive movements alone are not sufficient to justify the search of an automobile without a warrant. <em>People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number><em>Superior Court of Yolo County </em>(1970), 91 Cal. Rptr. 729, 478 P. 2d 449. However, where a furtive movement has been made by occupants of a vehicle in response to the approach of police officers, the addition of other factors may give rise to a finding of probable cause to search the vehicle. Such other factors have included: police knowledge of recent burglaries in the area, <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(1970), 6 Cal. App. 3d 373, 86 Cal. Rptr. 49; police knowledge of prior criminal involvement by the driver of the automobile, <em>Trusley </em>v. <em>State </em>(Tex. Crim. App. 1974), 505 S. W. 2d 861; <em>In re K. </em>(1970), 14 Cal. App. 3d 94, 92 Cal. Rptr. 39; and the failure of the driver to produce a driver\u2019s license or identification, <em>People </em>v. <em>Goodrick </em>(1970), 11 Cal. App. 3d 216, 89 Cal. Rptr. 866; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watkins </em>(1974), 23 Ill. App. 3d 1054, 320 N. E. 2d 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Furtive or suspicious gestures were also considered in the determination of probable cause in the Ohio cases of <em>State </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(1973), 36 Ohio Misc. 29; and <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaines </em>(1974), 40 Ohio App. 2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Although the above cases are not determinative of the issue herein, all the enumerated factors are present in the instant cause. Therefore, we hold that, under the facts herein, Officer Schraf had reasonable cause to believe that the automobile driven by defendant contained contraband subject to seizure or concealed the instrumentality or evidence of a crime before he made the warrantless search of that automobile. The officer had \u201cmore than a mere suspicion and under the circumstances the officer\u2019s actions were nothing more than good diligent police work at the proper time.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gravin </em>(1974), 44 Ohio App. 2d 303, 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">In view of the exigent circumstances and presence of sufficient probable cause, the limited search of the front-passenger section of defendant\u2019s automobile by Officer Schraf was reasonable in its scope and intensity, and constitutionally permissible. The trial court did not err in admitting in evidence those articles seized in the aforemen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>tioned search of defendant\u2019s automobile. Appellant\u2019s first proposition of law is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The Court of Appeals also held that the butter knife and the piece of manila paper listing homes in the Kamm\u2019s Corner area of Cleveland were irrelevant and should not have been admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Although the manila paper did not list the Mueller home, it did contain many of the addresses in the immediate area of the burglary in question. As such, it is directly linked to, and holds as much probative value as, the cross-reference directory which was held to be relevant by both the trial court and Court of Appeals. The manila piece of paper was properly admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">We agree that the butter knife was irrelevant and should not have been admitted. However, such error by the trial court was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dickerson </em>(1907), 77 Ohio St. 34; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967), 386 U. S. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b236-10\">Herbert, Sweeney and Locher, JJ., concur. Celebrezze, J., concurs in the judgment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b236-11\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., and W. Brown, J., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b233-8\"> The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A87\">\u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">The provisions of Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution are essentially the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
