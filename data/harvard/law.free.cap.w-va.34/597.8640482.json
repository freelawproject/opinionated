That adversary possession-for the period fixed by the statute operates to create or transfer to the party in possession a title which will enable him either to defend his possession or recover possession against a title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>once the better title, is well settled. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Burnsides, </em>1 Gratt. 165; <em>Core </em>v. <em>Faupel, </em>24 W. Va. 242; <em>Hall v. Hall, </em>27 W. Va. 480; 1 Lomax, Dig. tit. 24, \u00a7 16, p. 621; 3 Wait, Act. &amp; Def. 19; <em>Nowlin </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>25 Gratt. 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">But the counsel for appellant contend that the facts proven as certified by the bill of exceptions from which I have above quoted, do not make out a case of adversary possession, because from them it does not appear that such possession was adverse or exclusive. I think the -adverse character of the possession in a legal sense clearly appears. There is the deed from Richard Adkins to Samuel Adkins purporting to convey the legal title, and possession under it, and this imports a claim against the world, and, taken alone, makes it hostile against even Richard Adkins, the grantor; for while the possession of a vendee under an executory contract contemplating a future conveyance is , not hostile or adverse to the vendor, yet, where the purchaser is in possession under a deed purporting to convey the land he is holding adversely to the world, including the vendor from whom his title and possession are derived. <em>Core </em>v. <em>Faupel, </em>24 W. Va. 239; <em>Nowlin </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>25 Gratt. 137; opinion in <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>McClure, </em>10 Gratt. 305. How could the adverse character of the possession be proven? Not by a witness stating that the holding was adverse. That would be stating matter of opinion \u00f3f the law. The facts being given, the law determines whether the possession is or is not adverse. When once we know that possession is held by a person under a claim of title in himself, and the possession is of the kind required by law, and there is nothing shown to deprive it of its hostile character, it is hostile and adverse, and, where the party is claiming under an instrument purporting to pass the legal title, itis adverse even to the grantor. Thus, so far as regards the character of possession, that is, whether it was adverse or not, it would be adverse against defendant, even if he derived title from Richard Adkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Next, was such possession exclusive? Why is it not exclusive ? Here is a sole grantee in possession under his deed, in actual possession \u201cby occupation, cultivation and inclosure,\u201d holding against the world in a legal point of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>view, or under a legal presumption, as I think I have shown, without any appearance of a community of interest or possession with another, without a syllable of evidence to suggest that anybody else participated in the possession of the tract until the entry of the defendant, and we are asked to say that it is not an exclusive possession. The law on such facts will say that it is exclusive <em>prima facie. </em>The case of <em>Core </em>v. <em>Faupel, </em>24 <em>W. </em>Va. 238, cited by counsel for appellant, lays down the proposition that, \u201cto constitute such possession as will bar the title of the legal owner of the land, it must be adverse, actual, visible, and exclusive, continuous, and under a claim or color of title;\u201d and that, \u201cif any one of these constituents is wanting, the possession will not effect a bar of the legal title.\u201d The only elements of this definition of adversary possession pointed out by appellant\u2019s counsel as wanting in the present case are the elements of adverseness and exclusiveness; and we hold that these qualities are not absent from the possession in the present case, and that the possession in it fills the measure set up in the case of <em>Core </em>v. <em>Faupel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The next question is, do the plaintiffs connect themselves with Samuel Adkins\u2019s right and possession by showing that they are his heirs ; for they sue as such ? This depends largely upon the grammatical construction and punctuation of one of the clauses which I have quoted above from the certificate of facts. After stating that Samuel Adkins was charged with and paid taxes during his life, the clause in question states \u201cthat since his death the said land was continued upon said land-books in the name of Samuel Adkins\u2019s heirs, the plaintiffs, since the death of Samuel Adkins and paid the taxes charged thereon, and he in his lifetime paid the taxes to the time of his death.\u201d The appellant\u2019s counsel would place a semi-colon after the word \u201cheirs,\u201d and make the word \u201cplaintiffs\u201d the nominative to the verb \u201cpaid,\u201d which would punctuate the plaintiff\u2019s out of this Court, for there would then be nothing to show that the plaintiffs are heirs of Adkins; while the other side.would make the noun .\u201cplaintiffs\u201d in the objective case, as a noun in apposition to the noun \u201cheirs,\u201d and thus make the language assert that the plaintiffs are such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>heirs. The composition is bad; but the plain intention of the language is to declare that Samuel Adkins was charged with and paid taxes in his lifetime; and that the plaintiffs, as his heirs, were charged with and paid taxes after his death. Where intention is clear, too minute a stress is not to be laid on grammatical accuracy, for it is an old legal maxim, <em>\u201cmala grammatica non vitiat </em>chartam ;\" and punctuation is not regarded in construction against intent. 2 Min. Inst. 950; 1 Bish. Crim. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 348, 354; Bish. Stat. Crimes, \u00a7\u00a7 81, 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\">But really, as to this point, there is no inaccuracy of grammar or punctuation; for, as the printed record is before us, the word \u201c plaintiffs,\u201d with its article, follows immediately the word \u201cheirs,\u201d and the words \u201cthe plaintiffs \u201d are properly set off with commas, as they should be in this instance, in a ease of apposition; so that the word \u201c plaintiffs \u201d limits the \u00bfmeaning of the word \u201c heirs,\u201d and denotes that they are the same persons as the heirs, according to the grammatical sense of a noun in apposition; and thus the location of the words, the punctuation and the plain meaning derived from the whole context concur in indicating that the word \u201c plaintiffs \u201d is not nominative to the word \u201c paid,\u201d but in apposition to the word \u201cheirs,\u201d and declares that the plaintiffs are heirs, though we have to supply a word in order to give the verb \u201cpaid\u201d a nominative. The presence of the word \u201cand\u201d would be against making the word \u201cplaintiffs\u201d such nominative ; but if after it we supply the pronoun \u201cthey,\u201d as nominative to \u201cpaid,\u201d we but subserve and execute the manifest intention. This avoids the objection of punctuating away the verdict of the jury, against the plain intention. So we hold that the first proposition of the appellant, namely, that plaintiffs failed to make out a <em>frima facie </em>case, is not sustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Nowr, as to the proposition that the defendant showed a better title. The defendant gave in evidence the record of a chancery suit brought in the Circuit Court of Lincoln county, at latest as early as the year 1870, by John Alford against Richard and Samuel Adkins and others, to sell lands of said Richard and Samuel Adkins to pay a debt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>against them. The bill is very general in its description of the land it sought to sell. It alleged that Richard Adkins owned land in Sheridan township, in Lincoln county, \u201c viz., one tract of three hundred acres, one of eighty six acres, one of twelve acres, one of one hundred, and fifty acres, and-of twenty five acres, aggregating five hundred and seventy three acres;\u201d and that the said Samuel owned land in said township, \u201c viz., one tract of twenty five acres, one tract of forty eight acres, and one tract of one hundred and four acres, aggregating one hundred and seventy seven acres.\u201d A decree of sale in the case directed the sale of \u201c the unsold land in plaintiff\u2019s bill mentioned.\u201d The special commissioner appointed to sell, filed a report that, under decree in another case, there had been sold, for a paramount claim, all the land which he had been directed to sell,- except two hundred and fourteen acres, and that he had sold the two hundred and fourteen acres, not saying of what tracts in the bill mentioned the two hundred and fourteen acres was made up. By his deed the commissioner conveyed to the purchaser Alford 'one tract of twelve acres, and one of twenty five acres, as owned by Richard Adkins, and one of twenty five acres, one of forty eight acres, and one of one hundred and four acres, as owned by Samuel Adkins. Alford conveyed to Spurlock two hundred and fourteen acres as an entire tract, by metes and bounds. The defence claims that the land sold under the chancery suit covers the land in controversy, and that, as both Richard and Samuel Adkins were parties to that suit, Samuel Adkins could not set up his possession as adverse during its pendency but only from the date of the deed of the commissioner conveying the land to the purchaser, 12th January, 1876, and that as Spurlock entered under Alford in 1884, there had not elapsed an adverse holding of ten years under Samuel Adkins when Spurlock entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The case of <em>Creigh </em>v. Henson, 10 Graft. 231, is relied on for appellant. I do not see its force in this case. It holds that as against the trustee in a deed of trust, and the person to whom he sells, the grantor in possession is a tenant at sufferance, and not an adversary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>claimant, and that a purchaser under him by executory agreement is likewise so, and their possession not adverse. The person seeking to set up adversary possession held under an agreement, not a deed conveying the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">The case of <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>25 <em>W. </em>Va. 757, holds that a party does not hold adversely so as to avail himself of the statute of limitations during the pendency of the suit., and that a purchaser from him during its pendency is in no better plight as to those claiming under and through the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">This is good law, but the case of the defendant does not come under it. (1) The sale was of two hundred and fourteen acres, without further description, and the decree directed the commissioner to convey the land sold. He conveyed, not a tract of two hundred and fourteen acres, but five separate tracts,' the deed not even saying that they made up two hundred and fourteen acres, though when added they do. The evidence, either record or other, must show that the land conveyed is that directed to be conveyed, for the commissioner has no authority to convey any other. In <em>Cales </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>8 Gratt. 6, Judge AlleN said that, as the decree merely directed the commissioner to sell and convey a tract of one thousand and one hundred acres referred to in the bill, such a general description of the land did not satisfactorily prove the authority of the commission to convey the tract conveyed, and that it was incumbent on parties claiming under the deed to show by the record what specific tract the commissioner was directed to sell and convey. In <em>Waggoner </em>v. <em>Wolf, </em>28 <em>W. </em>Va. 820, it was held that, when a commissioner\u2019s deed is offered to prove title, it is necessary to introduce so much of the record as will identify the land ; that is, show that the land ordered to be sold is the same as that conveyed by the commissioner. That is a question of the commissioner\u2019s power. But suppose all the record is shown, but when shown it does not satisfactorily appear that the land conveyed is the same that was directed to be conveyed, the deed can not pass title.' Here it does not appear that the five separate tracts conveyed were the laud sold. True, the bill specified those five tracts as owned by the defendant, but the decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>of sale did not distinctively authorize their sale, hut only unsold land, without specification. \"Were these tracts unsold? We do not know. There is nothing to show that these five tracts conveyed were the same land sold, except from the circumstance that when added they aggregate the quantity sold, two hundred and fourteen acres. (2) But, if we concede that the land sold and directed to he conveyed is the same as that conveyed, yet there is nothing to show the identity of that land with the fifty acres sued for in this case. hTo tract mentioned in the record of the chancery suit or commissioner\u2019s deed is called fifty acres. It must appear, not only that the commissioner conveyed the very land he was authorized to convey to pass title, hut it must also appear that the laud sold is that which the plaintiffs claim in their suit, in order to render their possession not adversary, under the principles laid down in <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Andrews, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">So we conclude that the defendant neither showed hotter title, nor anything to deprive the plaintiffs of the benefit of the possession of Samuel Adkins and his heirs, the plaintiffs. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
