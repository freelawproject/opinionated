Memorandum: Defendant contends that, if we reverse his March 10, 1988 conviction, the guilty plea underlying his July 7, 1988 conviction must be vacated because it was expressly conditioned on the court\u2019s promise that the sentence imposed thereon would run concurrently with, and not exceed, that imposed on the prior conviction <em>(see, People v Fuggazzatto, </em>62 NY2d 862; <em>People v Clark, </em>45 NY2d 432, 440). Affirmance of defendant\u2019s March 10, 1988 conviction <em>(see, People v Brown </em>[appeal No. 1], 167 AD2d 847 [decided herewith]) is dispositive of defendant\u2019s <em>Fuggazzatto </em>claim. (Appeal from judgment of Monroe County Court, Wisner, J.\u2014 robbery, second degree.) Present\u2014Callahan, J. P., Denman, Boomer, Lawton and Davis, JJ.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
