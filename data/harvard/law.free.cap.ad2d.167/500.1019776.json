The extent of delay was minimal, there existed a justifiable excuse for the delay, and a sufficient affidavit of merit was provided. Moreover, the defendants have failed to allege prejudice and there is no evidence that the plaintiffs intended to abandon the case <em>(see, Belsky v Lowell, </em>117 AD2d 575). Thompson, J. P., Brown, Kunzeman and Eiber, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
