Aronin, J.), dated May 1, 1989, which granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the action was barred by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, and denied the plaintiff\u2019s cross motion to dismiss the defendant\u2019s affirmative defense that workers\u2019 compensation coverage was the plaintiff\u2019s exclusive remedy.</p><p id=\"b563-5\">Ordered that the order and judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p><p id=\"b563-6\">It is well settled that controversies regarding the applicability of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law rest within the primary jurisdiction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board <em>(see, Botwinick v Ogden, </em>59 NY2d 909; <em>O\u2019Rourke v Long, </em>41 NY2d 219; <em>Becker v Clarkstown Cent. School Dist., </em>157 AD2d 641), including issues as to the existence of an employer-employee relationship <em>(see, Calhoun v Big Apple Wrecking Corp., </em>162 AD2d 574). In the instant case, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board determined that the plaintiff was the employee of Hoti Realty Management Company, and that he was injured during the course of his employment. The plaintiff was accordingly awarded workers\u2019 compensation benefits. This determination was final and binding <em>(see, O\u2019Connor v Midiria, </em>55 NY2d 538; <em>Calhoun v Big Apple Wrecking Corp., supra), </em>and, thus, the plaintiff may not maintain the instant action against the defendant proprietor of Hoti Realty Management Company and his fellow servant <em>(see, </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 [6]), by arguing that he was in fact employed by an altogether different commercial entity.</p><p id=\"b563-7\">We have reviewed the plaintiff\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit. Harwood, J. P., Balletta, Miller and O\u2019Brien, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
