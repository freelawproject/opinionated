Accordingly, any error surrounding its admission was harmless <em>(see, People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230, 242).</p><p id=\"b587-10\">The defendant\u2019s claim that he was denied the right to testify before the Grand Jury is without merit since he did not serve written notice of his intent to testify upon the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Attorney <em>(see, </em>CPL 190.50 [5] [a]; <em>People v Harris, </em>150 AD2d 723; <em>People v Morales, </em>163 AD2d 332). Similarly, the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment upon the ground that he was denied the right to testify before the Grand Jury was properly denied inasmuch as he not only failed to make such a request but also delayed in making the motion to dismiss until several weeks after his arraignment <em>(see, </em>CPL 190.50 [5] [c]; 210.45 [1]; <em>People v Morales, supra). </em>Thompson, J. P., Brown, Kunzeman and Eiber, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
