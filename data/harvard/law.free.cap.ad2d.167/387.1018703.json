The affidavit of merit primarily alleged legal defenses such as res judicata, based upon settlement of a 1977 suit by the plaintiff on similar facts, and the bar of the disclaimer and merger clauses contained in the parties\u2019 1976 realty contract. Although a subsequent pretrial deposition of this same executive vice-president cast some doubt upon his familiarity with the facts of this case, to which familiarity he had earlier attested, we agree with the Supreme Court that this new information did not establish perjury or warrant vacatur of the relief originally granted to the defendant.</p><p id=\"b421-7\">We note, however, that since the appendix to the defendant\u2019s brief contains documents dehors the record, the defendant is denied costs on appeal. Thompson, J. P., Lawrence, Eiber and Ritter, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
