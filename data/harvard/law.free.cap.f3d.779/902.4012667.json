A judge requested a vote on whether to rehear the matter en banc. The matter failed to receive a majority of the votes of the nonre-cused active judges in favor of en banc reconsideration. Fed. R.App. P. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-25\">The petitions for rehearing en banc are DENIED.</p>\n<author id=\"b929-26\">O\u2019SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge, joined by RAWLINSON and BEA, Circuit Judges, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc:</author>\n<p id=\"b929-27\">One month after the panel in these cases struck down the traditional marriage laws of Idaho and Nevada, the Sixth Circuit upheld the essentially identical laws of Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, and Kentucky. <em>See DeBoer v. Snyder, </em>772 F.3d 388 (6th Cir.2014). Clearly the same-sex marriage debate is not over. Indeed, not only does the debate now divide the federal circuit courts and state legislatures, but it continues to divide the American public.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>of course, the Supreme Court has not yet decided the issue, notwithstanding innuendo in the panel\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Thoughtful, dedicated jurists who strive to reach the correct outcome\u2014including my colleagues on the panel here\u2014have considered this issue and arrived at contrary results. This makes clear that\u2014 regardless of one\u2019s opinion on the merits of the politically charged and controversial issues raised by these cases\u2014we are presented with a \u201cquestion of exceptional importance\u201d that should have been reviewed by an en banc panel. <em>See </em>F.R.A.P. 35(a). Indeed, if for no other reason, we should have reheard these cases in order to consider the arguments of our colleagues on the Sixth Circuit, who, reviewing the same question raised here, arrived at the opposite result. <em>See DeBoer, </em>772 F.3d 388. Whether my colleagues agree or disagree with the <em>DeBoer </em>majority, at the very least, the panel should' have granted rehearing to address the points raised in that opinion. Instead, we have utterly ignored another circuit\u2019s reasoned contribution to the debate. Such a clear circuit split on such an exceptionally important issue demands en banc review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">Because the panel opinion neglects to address the issues raised in the conflicting Sixth Circuit opinion, and 1) overlooks binding Supreme Court precedent, 2) fails to respect bedrock principles of democratic self-governance, and 3) ignores the adverse implications of its opinion on our federal structure, I must respectfully dissent from our decision not to rehear these cases en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">Even if the exceptional importance of the issues and the circuit split were somehow insufficient to warrant our rehearing these cases en banc, we still should have concluded rehearing was merited. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>panel fails to follow the Supreme Court\u2019s precedential command that federal courts must avoid substituting their own definition of marriage for that adopted by the states\u2019 citizenry. By refusing to rectify this error, we let stand an impermissible judicial intrusion into a debate reserved to the states\u2019 political processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">For decades, our nation has engaged in an \u201cearnest and profound debate\u201d on marriage policy. <em>See Washington v. Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. 702, 735, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997) (praising the American public\u2019s on-going conversation on the \u201cmorality, legality, and practicality of physician-assisted suicide\u201d and ultimately declining to interfere); <em>see also Hollingsworth v. Perry, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2652, 2659, 186 L.Ed.2d 768 (2013) (\u201cThe public is currently engaged in an active political debate over whether same-sex couples should be allowed to marry.\u201d). State by state, citizens have considered the issue of same-sex marriage and, through legislation, popular referendum, or constitutional amendment, voiced their views on this question of immense public importance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">Until quite recently, the judiciary has allowed this earnest democratic debate to continue unobstructed. Forty-two years ago, the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal -from a Minnesota Supreme Court decision, <em>Baker v. Nelson, </em>which held that \u201c[t]he equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, like the due process clause, is not offended by the <em>state\u2019s </em>classification of persons authorized to marry.\u201d 291 Minn. 310, 191 N.W.2d 185, 187 (1971) (emphasis added). Dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal \u201cfor want of a substantial <em>federal </em>question,\u201d 409 U.S. at 810, 93 S.Ct. 37 (emphasis added), the <em>Baker </em>Court confirmed that the Constitution commits questions of marriage policy to the citizens of each state, and that absent exceptional circumstances, federal courts should resist the temptation to interfere with a state marriage regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">This is not to say that a state\u2019s \u201cpowers to regulate marriage are unlimited notwithstanding the commands of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Loving v. Virginia, </em>388 U.S. 1, 7, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967). There are clearly exceptional circumstances in which judicial interference is needed\u2014no more so than when a husband and wife face criminal sanctions merely for marrying when they happen to be of different races. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">But while \u201cinvidious racial discrimina-tions\u201d warranted judicial action in <em>Loving v. Virginia, </em>no such discrimination is implicated here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, to argue that <em>Loving </em>controls here requires asserting that the Supreme Court forgot about <em>Loving </em>only five years later when it decided <em>Baker. </em>If the panel had any lingering doubts as to whether judicial interference is appropriate, <em>Baker </em>makes clear that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-15\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b931-16\">Loving holds that \u201crestricting the freedom to marry solely because of racial classifications violates the central meaning of the Equal Protection Clause\u201d and that the \u201cFourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restriet-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>ed by invidious racial discriminations.\u201d <em>Loving, </em>388 U.S. at 12, 87 S.Ct. 1817. Thus, Loving stands as a clear prohibition on racial discrimination in laws defining and regulating marriage, but it simply does not follow that Loving also somehow prevents the states from defining marriage as a union of a man and a woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Indeed state laws that define marriage as a union of a man and a woman bear little resemblance to the Virginia statute that <em>criminalized </em>Mildred and Richard Loving\u2019s marriage merely because Mildred was black and Richard was white. <em>Id. </em>at 11, 87 S.Ct. 1817. Virginia recognized that Mildred and Richard had married in the District of Columbia, but \u201cto maintain White Supremacy,\u201d <em>id., </em>the state legislature chose to punish them for having the courage to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Chief Justice Warren recognized that such punishment contravened the constitutional command that \u201cthe freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discriminations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12, 87 5.Ct. 1817. But it is difficult to draw from this holding the conclusion that <em>Loving </em>is \u201cdirectly on point,\u201d <em>Latta, </em>771 F.3d at 478 (Reinhardt, J., concurring), as to whether marriage may be defined as an opposite-sex relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Of course, states are not <em>compelled </em>to define marriage as such an opposite\u2014sex union\u2014simply look to the many states that, since <em>Loving, </em>have defined it by statute or popular vote to extend to gay and lesbian couples.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But states are also not <em>compelled </em>by the federal Constitution to define marriage differently than the \u201cgenerally accepted\u201d opposite-sex relationship Mildred and Richard sought to enter in <em>Loving. See Loving, </em>388 U.S. at 11, 87 S.Ct. 1817; <em>cf. Bishop v. Smith, </em>760 F.3d 1070, 1108-09 (10th Cir.2014) (Holmes, J., concurring) (explaining that Oklahoma\u2019s codification of marriage as an opposite-sex relationship \u201ccannot sensibly be depicted as \u2018unusual\u2019 where the State was simply exercising its age-old police power to define marriage in the way that it, along with every other State, always had\u201d and noting that Oklahoma\u2019s law \u201cformalized a definition that every State had employed for almost all of American history, and it did so in a province the states had always dominated\u201d); <em>Hdmdldinen, </em>No. 37359/09, HUDOC, at *19, *24 (explaining that the European Convention does not impose an obligation to recognize same sex marriage, and that only ten of the 47 member states of the Council of Europe recognize such marriages).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Loving </em>states that \u201c[u]nder our Constitution, the freedom to marry or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State,\u201d but it says nothing about the states\u2019 power to define marriage, as every state has done for almost all of American history, as a male-female relationship. <em>Loving, </em>388 U.S. at 12, 87 S.Ct. 1817.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">It is utterly unsurprising then, that only five years after <em>Loving, </em>when the viability of the \u201cgenerally accepted\u201d opposite-sex definition of marriage was squarely before the Court, the Court concluded no substantial federal question was implicated. <em>Baker, </em>409 U.S. 810, 93 S.Ct. 37. Such a conclusion was completely consistent with <em>Loving: </em>there simply is no conflict in hold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>ing both that the Constitution prohibits racial restrictions on the right to enter marriage, and that the Constitution is not offended by a state\u2019s choice to define marriage as an opposite-sex relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Of course we cannot ignore Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s observation, as true as ever, that if \u201cthe Courts are to regard the Constitution, and the Constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the Legislature, the Constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply.\u201d <em>Marbury v. Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">We must ask, then: Is leaving the political process intact here not an impermissible abdication of our \u201cauthority, and indeed [] responsibility, to right fundamental wrongs left excused by a majority of the electorate?\u201d <em>DeBoer, </em>772 F.3d at 436-37 (Daughtrey, J., dissenting). Is this situation not analogous to those, where, even while recognizing \u201cthat certain matters requiring political judgments are best left to the political branches,\u201d we must ensure that courts and not the political branches, \u201csay what the law is?\u201d <em>Boumediene v. Bush, </em>553 U.S. 723, 765, 128 S.Ct. 2229, 171 L.Ed.2d 41 (2008) (citing <em>Marbury, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) at 177).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Simply put, no. We are a Court of Appeals, not the Supreme Court, and our obligation is to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-8\">adhere to the view that if the Court has branded a question as unsubstantial, it remains so except when doctrinal developments indicate otherwise.... [T]he lower courts are bound by summary decisions by th[e Supreme] Court until such time as the Court informs [them] that [they] are not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-12\"><em>Hicks v. Miranda, </em>422 U.S. 332, 344-45, 95 S.Ct. 2281, 45 L.Ed.2d 223 (1975) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-13\">Far from avoiding our responsibilities, following <em>Baker </em>here constitutes the only permissible exercise of our limited authority\u2014the eagerness of the panel members to pronounce their views on the merits of same-sex marriage notwithstanding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When the Supreme Court \u201cconcludes [an] appeal should be dismissed because the constitutional challenge\u201d presented \u201cwas not a substantial one,\u201d it makes a prece-dential decision on the merits. <em>Hicks, </em>422 U.S. at 344, 95 S.Ct. 2281 (citing <em>Ohio ex rel. Eaton v. Price, </em>360 U.S. 246, 247, 79 S.Ct. 978, 3 L.Ed.2d 1200 (\u00cd959); R. Stern &amp; E. Gressman, <em>Supreme Court Practice </em>197 (4th ed.1969); C. Wright, <em>Law of Federal Courts </em>495 (2d ed.1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-14\">Indeed, when \u201ca precedent of th[e Supreme] Court has direct application in a case,\u201d we must follow it even if it \u201cappears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions.\u201d <em>Rodriguez de Qui\u00b6 as v. Shearson/AMEX, Inc., </em>490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989). \u201c[T]he Court of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to [the Supreme] Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.\u201d <em>Id. Baker </em>is a precedential disposition on the merits which <em>Hicks </em>and <em>Rodriguez de Qui-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number><em>jas </em>make clear we are not at liberty to disregard.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">The panel ignores <em>Rodriguez de Quijas </em>and attempts to turn the command of <em>Hicks </em>on its head. Rather than heeding the clear statement that \u201cthe lower courts are bound by summary decisions by th[e Supreme] Court until such time as the Court informs [them] that [they] are not,\u201d the panel searches for \u201cdoctrinal developments\u201d that, when interpreted <em>just so, </em>imply that <em>Baker </em>is no longer good law. Apparently the panel believes the Supreme Court, rather than speaking clearly when it overrules dispositions on the merits, \u201cinforms\u201d the lower courts of an overruling with so many winks and nods.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Unfortunately, the panel is not without company in its approach. <em>See, e.g., Baskin v. Bogan, </em>766 F.3d 648, 659-60 (7th Cir.2014) (doctrinal developments preclude application of <em>Baker); Bostic v. Schaefer, </em>760 F.3d 352, 373-75 (4th Cir.2014) (same); <em>Bishop, </em>760 F.3d at 1079-81 (same); <em>Kitchen v. Herbert, </em>755 F.3d 1193, 1204-08 (10th Cir.2014) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">Yet neither am I. <em>See, e.g., DeBoer, </em>772 F.3d at 399-402 <em>(Baker </em>is still binding precedent); <em>Massachusetts v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>682 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2012) (same), <em>cited in U.S. v. Windsor, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2675, 2688, 2693, 186 L.Ed.2d 808 (2013); <em>Conde-Vidal v. Garcia-Padilla, </em>No. 14-1253 PG, 54 F.Supp.3d 157, 163-64, 2014 WL 5361987, at *6 (D.P.R. Oct. 21, 2014) (same); <em>cf, Hdmdldinen, </em>No. 37359/09, HUDOC, at *24 (holding, like <em>Baker, </em>that same-sex marriage is an issue reserved to the democratic process).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">Wishing that <em>Baker </em>has been overruled, however, does not make it so. Indeed, even if the panel\u2019s tea-leaf-reading approach to finding implicit overruling were viable, it still could not plausibly argue that <em>Baker </em>has been abrogated. In making the determination that \u201cdoctrinal developments\u201d indicate that the Court no longer views <em>Baker </em>as good law, the panel relies on <em>United States v. Windsor, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2675, 186 L.Ed.2d 808, <em>Lawrence v. Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003), and <em>Romer v. Evans, </em>517 U.S. 620, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996). But each of these cases presented distinctly different questions from whether a <em>state </em>may lawfully define marriage as between a man and a woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-14\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b934-15\">In <em>Windsor, </em>the Court struck down a <em>federal </em>law that intruded on a state\u2019s prerogative to define marriage, what the Court characterized as \u201c \u2018virtually [an] exclusive province of the States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Windsor, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2691 (quoting <em>Sosna v. Iowa, </em>419 U.S. 393, 404, 95 S.Ct. 553, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975)). If anything, <em>Windsor\u2019s </em>emphasis on the unprecedented federal intrusion into the states\u2019 authority over domestic relations reaffirms <em>Baker's </em>conclusion that a state\u2019s definition of marriage presents no \u201csubstantial federal question.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>409 U.S. at 810, 93 S.Ct. 37. The <em>Windsor </em>opinion expressly \u201cconfined [itself] to ... lawful marriages\u201d recognized by other states and disavowed having any effect on state laws which themselves regulate marriage. <em>Windsor, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2696.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-16\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b934-17\">Likewise, in <em>Lawrence, </em>the Court did not implicate <em>Baker </em>when it struck down Texas\u2019s criminal anti-sodomy law on the ground that it interfered with personal autonomy. Like in <em>Windsor, </em>the <em>Lawrence </em>Court expressly stated that it was not deciding whether a state must recognize same-sex marriages. <em>See Lawrence, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>539 U.S. at 578, 123 S.Ct. 2472 (\u201cThe present case does not involve ... whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Similarly, <em>Romer </em>did not involve the definition of marriage, but rather a Colorado constitutional amendment that \u201cnullifie[d] specific legal protections for [homosexuals] in all transactions in housing, sale of real estate, insurance, health and welfare services, private education, and employment\u201d as well as laws providing protection \u201cfrom discrimination by every level of Colorado government.\u201d <em>Romer, </em>517 U.S. at 629,116 S.Ct. 1620. Such a \u201c[s]weeping and comprehensive change\u201d in Colorado law that withdrew existing anti-discrimination protections for homosexuals \u201cacross the board\u201d is easily distinguishable from a law defining marriage. <em>Id. </em>at 627, 633, 116 S.Ct. 1620; <em>see also </em>Kenji Yoshino, <em>The New Equal Protection, </em>124 Harv. L.Rev. 747, 777-78 (2011) (noting that \u201cthe Court emphasized that <em>Romer </em>might be a ticket good only for one day\u201d as the amendment at issue effectuated an \u201cunprecedented\u201d harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">Windsor, Lawrence, and Romer simply do not limit the states\u2019 authority to define marriage and certainly do not contradict Baker\u2019s conclusion that the Constitution does not require states to recognize same-sex marriage. See <em>Bishop, </em>760 F.3d at 1104 (Holmes, J., concurring) (explaining that state laws defining marriage as between an opposite-sex couple are clearly distinguishable from those at issue in Romer and Windsor as they neither \u201ctarget ] the rights of a minority in a dangerously expansive and novel fashion\u201d as in Romer, nor do they \u201cstray[] from the historical territory of the lawmaking sovereign just to eliminate privileges that a group would otherwise receive,\u201d as the federal law did in Windsor).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">Our place in the federal judicial hierarchy carries with it restrictions that, inconvenient as they may be to implementing our policy choices, restrain and guide our discretion. We cannot ignore our obligation to follow <em>Baker1 </em>s precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">Not only does the panel fail to abide by Supreme Court precedent, but, by injecting itself in the public\u2019s \u201cactive political debate over whether same-sex couples should be allowed to marry,\u201d <em>Hollings-worth, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2659, it acts in a way Justice Kennedy has deemed \u201cinconsistent with the underlying premises of a responsible, functioning democracy.\u201d <em>Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1623, 1637, 188 L.Ed.2d 613 (2014) (plurality opinion). Rather than allow further change \u201cprimarily [to] be made by legislative revision and judicial interpretation of the existing system,\u201d the panel chooses to \u201cleap ahead\u2014 revising (or even discarding) the system by creating a new constitutional right and taking over responsibility for refining it.\u201d <em>Dish Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, </em>557 U.S. 52, 74, 129 S.Ct. 2308, 174 L.Ed.2d 38 (2009). Such a leap should never be made lightly, yet here the panel takes it without regard to the fact that our country\u2019s citizens have shown themselves quite capable of \u201cengaging] in serious, thoughtful examinations\u201d of the issue of same-sex marriage. <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. at 719, 117 S.Ct. 2258.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">In some states, democratic majorities have enacted laws that expand the traditional definition of marriage to include same-sex relationships. <em>See Windsor, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2710-11 (noting, for example, that in Maryland, voters approved a measure, by a vote of 52% to 48%, establishing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>\u201cMaryland\u2019s civil marriage laws allow gay and lesbian couples to obtain a civil marriage license\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In other states, voters have elected to retain the centuries-old, traditional idea that marriage is limited to opposite-sex couples. <em>Id. </em>(noting a North Carolina constitutional amendment providing that \u201c[mjarriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this State\u201d). Indeed, in Maine, citizens voted to reject same-sex marriage in 2009 (by a vote of 58% to 47%) only to change course in 2012, voting to permit same-sex marriages by that same margin. <em>Id. </em>It seems marriage-defining is a state-law issue that the states are quite capably handling through deliberation in their own state lawmaking processes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">The panel\u2019s opinion cuts short these \u201cearnest and profound debatefs],\u201d silencing the voices of millions of engaged and politically active citizens. <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. at 735, 117 S.Ct. 2258. By doing so, the panel suggests that citizens of Nevada and Idaho, indeed of the nation, are not capable of having this conversation, or of reaching the \u201ccorrect\u201d conclusion. But such a view eschews the very foundational premises of democratic self-governance. As Justice Kennedy wrote in <em>Schuette, </em>\u201cIt is demeaning to the democratic process to presume that the voters are not capable of deciding an issue of this sensitivity on decent and rational grounds.... Freedom embraces the right, indeed the duty, to engage in a rational, civic discourse in order to determine how best to form a consensus to shape the destiny of the Nation and its people.\u201d <em>Schuette, </em>134 S.Ct. at 1637.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">\u25a0Nothing about the issue of same-sex marriage exempts it from the general principle that it is the right of the people to decide for themselves important issues of social policy. On the contrary, the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Windsor </em>recognizes the importance to democratic self-government of letting <em>the People </em>debate marriage policy. The <em>Windsor </em>Court reminded us that \u201c[t]he dynamics of state government in the federal system are to allow the formation of consensus respecting the way the members of a discrete community treat each other in their daily contact and constant interaction with each other.\u201d <em>Windsor, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2692.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">Despite such express instruction from the High Court, the panel assumes it is <em>its </em>right, indeed <em>its </em>duty to reach the conclusion that it does. But recent developments suggest otherwise. As the Sixth Circuit\u2019s <em>DeBoer </em>decision reminds us, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>\u201c[b]etter in this instance ... to allow change through the customary political processes, in which the people, gay and straight alike, become the heroes of their own stories by meeting each other not as adversaries in a court system but as fellow citizens seeking to resolve a new social issue in a fair-minded way.\u201d <em>DeBoer, </em>772 F.3d at 421; <em>see also Garcia-Padilla, </em>No. 14-1253 PG, 54 F.Supp.3d at 168, 2014 WL 5361987, at *11 (\u201c[O]ne basic principle remains: the people, acting through their elected representatives, may legitimately regulate marriage by law.\u201d); <em>Robicheaux v. Caldwell, </em>2 F.Supp.3d 910, 926-27 (E.D.La.2014) (noting the importance of respecting democratic voices).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">The healthy, spirited, and engaged debate over marriage policy represents the virtues of democratic self-governance. The panel\u2019s opinion shuts down the debate, removing the issue from the public square. In so doing, it reflects a profound distrust in\u2014or even a downright rejection of\u2014our constitutional structure. As the Court warned in <em>Osborne, </em>this course of action \u201ctakes[s] the development of rules and procedures in this area out of legislatures and state courts shaping policy in a focused manner and turn[s] it over to federal courts applying the broad parameters of the [Fourteenth Amendment].\u201d 557 U.S. at 56,129 S.Ct. 2308.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">Justice Powell, dissenting in the noted death penalty case <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>warned of the \u201cshattering effect\u201d such an approach has on the principles of \u201cfederalism, judicial restraint and\u2014most importantly\u2014separation of powers.\u201d 408 U.S. 238, 417, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972) (Powell, J., dissenting). Justice Powell acknowledged that in situations where, as here, \u201cthe language of the applicable provision provides great leeway and where the underlying social policies are felt to be of vital importance, the temptation to read personal preference into the Constitution is understandably great.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, he maintained that despite the temptation, \u201cit is not the business of [courts] to pronounce policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the panel\u2019s inability to resist such temptation reflects a \u201clack of faith and confidence in the democratic process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464-65, 92 S.Ct. 2726.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">Federal courts have a \u201cproper\u2014and properly limited\u2014role\u201d in a democratic society. <em>Allen v. Wright, </em>468 U.S. 737, 750, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984) (quoting <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 498, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975)). When we artificially expand our role, not only does it flout the Constitution, it also has deleterious effects on the civic health of our country. We should not be so quick to presume we know what\u2019s best. Judicial humility in service of democratic self-rule is reason alone to rehear these cases en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">In addition to sweeping aside the virtues of democracy, the panel ignores our federal structure. The panel fails to recognize the principle that marriage law, like other areas of domestic relations, has been and should continue to be an area committed to the states. <em>See Windsor, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2691-92 (\u201cState laws defining and regulating marriage, of course, must respect the constitutional rights of persons, but, sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>ject to those guarantees, regulation of domestic relations is an area that has long been regarded as a <em>virtually exclusive province of the </em>States.... [T]he incidents, benefits, and obligations of marriage are uniform for all married couples within each State, though they may vary, subject to constitutional guarantees, from one State to the next.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>682 F.3d at 12 (explaining that \u201cDOMA intrudes extensively into a realm that has from the start of the nation been primarily confided to state regulation\u2014domestic relations and <em>the definition </em>and incidents of lawful marriage\u201d (emphasis added)). The panel\u2019s opinion ignores this important aspect of Our Federalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">\u201cLong ago,\u201d the Supreme Court \u201cobserved that \u2018the whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife, parent and child, belongs to the laws of the States and not to the laws of the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Elk Grove Unified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow, </em>542 U.S. 1, 12, 124 S.Ct. 2301, 159 L.Ed.2d 98 (2004) (quoting <em>In re Burns, </em>136 U.S. 586, 593-94, 10 S.Ct. 850, 34 L.Ed. 500 (1890)). Indeed, for over a century, federal courts have recognized that actions concerning domestic relations are entrusted to state legislatures and state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">In the latest Supreme Court opinion addressing the issue of same-sex marriage, the Court gave a ringing endorsement of the central role of the states in fashioning their own marriage policy. <em>Windsor, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2689-93. \u201cBy history and tradition,\u201d the Court stated in <em>Windsor, </em>\u201cthe definition and regulation of marriage ... has been treated as being within the authority and realm of the separate States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2689-90. Indeed, the Court continued, \u201c[t]he recognition of civil marriages is <em>central </em>to state domestic relations law applicable to its residents and citizens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2691 (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>(\u201cThe definition of marriage is the foundation of the State\u2019s broader authority to regulate the subject of domestic relations .... \u201d); <em>Williams v. North Carolina, </em>317 U.S. 287, 298, 63 S.Ct. 207, 87 L.Ed. 279 (1942) (\u201cEach state as a sovereign has a rightful and legitimate concern in the marital status of persons domiciled within its borders.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">Thus, in <em>Windsor, </em>the Court struck down the <em>federal intmsion </em>into a realm committed to the states, emphasizing the exclusive role that states have in regulating marriage law. <em>Windsor, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2691. <em>Windsor\u2019s </em>holding and reasoning show an unquestionable attention to \u201cthe concerns for state diversity and state sovereignty\u201d in the marriage policy context. <em>Id. </em>at 2697 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). The panel\u2019s opinion ignores the \u201cundeniable\u201d conclusion that <em>Windsor\u2019s </em>\u201cjudgment is based on federalism.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\"><em>Windsor </em>was correct in resting its holding on federalism. In striking down the federal <em>legislature\u2019s </em>intrusion into this area of law committed to the states, it held Congress to the same standards to which federal <em>courts </em>have long adhered. Simply stated: the federal judiciary has affirmatively sought to <em>avoid </em>encroachments into state domestic relations policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">Federal judges have used various doctrinal mechanisms to refrain from intruding into the uncharted waters of state domestic relations law. As the Court explained in <em>Ankenbrandt v. Richards, </em>courts have often avoided such an intrusion by invoking the \u201cdomestic relations exception\u201d to federal jurisdiction under the diversity statute. 504 U.S. 689, 693, 112 S.Ct. 2206, 119 L.Ed.2d 468 (1992). Other courts have extended the exception to federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>question jurisdiction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Jones v. Brennan, </em>465 F.3d 304, 306-08 (7th Cir.2006). And others have invoked abstention doctrines to avoid state-law domestic relations issues. <em>See, e.g., Moore v. Sims, </em>442 U.S. 415, 423-35, 99 S.Ct. 2371, 60 L.Ed.2d 994 (1979); <em>Coats v. Woods, </em>819 F.2d 236, 237 (9th Cir.1987) (\u201cThis case, while raising constitutional issues, is at its core a child custody dispute.\u201d); <em>Peterson v. Babbitt, </em>708 F.2d 465, 466 (9th Cir.1983) (\u201cThere is no subject matter jurisdiction over these types of domestic disputes.\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">In one notable case, the Supreme Court refrained from ruling on the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance\u2014certainly a question of key constitutional import\u2014because doing so would have required rejecting a state court order regarding parental rights of the plaintiff. <em>Newdow, </em>542 U.S. at 17, 124 S.Ct. 2301. Because the case involved \u201chard questions of domestic relations [that were] sure to affect the outcome,\u201d it would have been \u201cimproper\u201d to exercise jurisdiction and \u201cthe prudent course [was] for the federal court to stay its hand rather than reach out to resolve a weighty question of federal constitutional law.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Smith v. Huckabee, </em>154 Fed.Appx. 552, 555 (8th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Newdow </em>in declining to exercise jurisdiction over questions implicating state domestic relations law); <em>United States v. MacPhail, </em>149 Fed.Appx. 449, 456 (6th Cir.2005) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">In short, through various doctrinal mechanisms, federal courts have avoided the kind of federal intrusion into state domestic relations law exemplified by the panel\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Whatever the\u2019 doctrinal tool, the result is the same: because family law issues\u2014including the definition and recognition of marriage\u2014are committed to the states, federal courts ought to refrain from intruding into this core area of state sovereignty.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">Here, our court need not decide which of these many potential sources of restraint we should draw from. After all, the Supreme Court has already instructed us that a state\u2019s marriage law judgments simply do not present substantial federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>questions that justify intrusion. <em>Baker, </em>409 U.S. at 810, 93 S.Ct. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">The panel\u2019s failure to follow Baker\u2019s command upsets our federal structure and warrants en banc reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">The panel\u2019s opinion ignores the wisdom of a sister circuit, disregards binding Supreme Court precedent, intrudes on demor cratic self-governance, and undermines our Constitution\u2019s commitment to federalism. I respectfully dissent from our regrettable failure to rehear these cases en banc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-14\">. <em>See, e.g., </em>http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/ elections/2014/US/house/exitpoll ' (showing that in exit polling at the November 2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>election, respondents were equally divided, 48%-48%, on the question of whether same-sex marriage should be legally recognized in their state).</p>\n<p id=\"AiB\">The debate even divides the globe'\u2014and the <em>DeBoer </em>majority is in agreement with one of the world's most prominent human rights' tribunals.
