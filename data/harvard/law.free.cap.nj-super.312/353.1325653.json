Plaintiff also claims that defendant owed plaintiffs founder and trustee, Elinor Mulligan, a fiduciary duty to publish the advertisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The essential facts are not in dispute. Because of the nature of defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> plaintiff is entitled to \u201call the favorable inferences,\u201d <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 536, 666 A.2d 146 (1995), and we adopt for present purposes its version of the facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">Pant,her Valley is a private, gated community of some 1,200 individual households and a population of some 4,000 persons. It covers approximately 1,500 acres in Allamuehy Township in Warren County. All Panther Valley property owners are members of the Panther Valley Property Owners Association (PVPOA), which is governed by a 9-member Board of Trustees elected by the members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">For many years, the PVPOA has published a monthly newsletter called <em>The Panther, </em>which identifies itself as \u201cThe Official Communication Medium of the Panther Valley Community.\u201d <em>The Panther </em>\u201cserves as a community bulletin board and is mailed free of charge to Panther Valley residents,\u201d and has no other distribution. Since PVPOA rules and regulations forbid \u201csoliciting of any kind within Panther Valley\u201d, <em>The Panther </em>is the only effective means of communication among all residents of the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">The only written guidelines governing publication of materials in <em>The Panther </em>are guidelines for letters to \u201cThe Mailbox\u201d, instituted in mid-1996, which are actually \u201cletters to the editors\u201d. Those letters are subject to numerous restrictions including no more than 250 words; they must be signed using full name, address and phone number; the Communications Committee will select letters for publication; and selection will be based upon \u201crelevance, timeliness and eonstructiveness.\u201d <em>The Panther </em>accepts paid advertising and has a rate chart for such ads. There are no regulations or guidelines governing the content of advertising. Publication of <em>The Panther </em>is supervised by an editor and Communications Committee appointed by and answerable to the Board of Trustees, with the assistance of a professional staff member employed by the PVPOA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">Elinor Mulligan is a resident of Panther Valley, and has been since 1972, and is a member in good standing of the PVPOA. She happens to be an attorney, and her law firm regularly advertises in <em>The Panther. </em>Ms. Mulligan is also the founder and incorporator of the William G. Mulligan Foundation for the Control of First Aid Squadders and Roving Paramedics (Plaintiff and hereinafter \u201cMulligan Founda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>tion\u201d) of which she serves as one of the three trustees. The Foundation was organized for certain stated purposes including the promotion and advancement of public knowledge of the rights and privileges granted by law to volunteer first aid and rescue squads and their members and to salaried paramedics. As a consequence of an unfortunate incident in 1991 following the death of Ms. Mulligan\u2019s husband, Ms. Mulligan had filed suit against the Allamuchy-Green First Aid Squad (hereinafter \u201cAGFAS\u201d) and the paramedics the squad called to Ms. Mulligan\u2019s home at that time. The lawsuit was an effort to clarify the legal rights and obligations of such persons. The ease was entitled <em>Mulligan v. Allamuchy-Green First Aid Squad, et al. </em>The summary judgment granted all defendants by the Superior Court confirming the extensive immunity of first aid squads and their members under New Jersey law was then affirmed by the Appellate Division in an unreported opinion (App.Div.A-6801-94Tl) and certification was denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\"><em>The Panther </em>regularly prints materials favorable to the AGFAS urging PVPOA members to join and contribute to the squad and to call upon it for services. And, the June 1996 issue of <em>The Panther </em>contained an article under the heading \u201cGood Judgment\u201d which favorably reported that the dismissal of Ms. Mulligan\u2019s suit against the AGFAS had been upheld by the Appellate Division. All of these materials including the aforedescribed article were planted in <em>The Panther </em>without any charge to AGFAS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">On January 15, 1997, on behalf of the Mulligan Foundation, Ms. Mulligan submitted an advertisement to be placed in the February issue of <em>The Panther </em>explaining the legal rights and privileges of first aid squads such as the AGFAS and of salaried paramedics which had been confirmed by the state courts as a result of the Mulligan case. The submission used the same \u201cTrue-False\u201d format of some of the AGFAS published submissions and was accompanied by a check in full payment for the ad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">By telephone on January 17, confirmed by a letter dated January 17 from defendant Scott Minter, as chairman of the PVPOA Communications Committee, Ms. Mulligan was informed that her ad had been rejected for publication. The ground[s] stated for rejection was that \u201cit appears to be more of an editorial than an advertisement.\u201d A subsequent letter dated February 10, also signed by Mr. Minter, stated that \u201cit would be more appropriate to print your copy in the \u2018Mailbox\u2019 column as an editorial piece,\u201d but went on to say that such a submission would have to be substantially edited to eliminate certain \u201cnegative comments\u201d. Mr. Minter further advised Ms. Mulligan that any submission to the \u201cMailbox\u201d would have to be of a \u201cconstructive nature\u201d which he explained meant \u201cit does not contain negative or pejorative statements or allusions about individuals, provides suggested solutions for perceived problems, etc.\u201d Ms. Hauschild later explained that it was her opinion that the proposed advertisement was \u201cunpleasant and inappropriate\u201d, but conceded that was an ad hoc determination unguided by any rules or guidelines of the PVPOA or the newsletter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">. This suit followed, seeking an Order prohibiting defendants PVPOA Trustees from refusing publication of Plaintiffs ad in <em>The Panther. </em>(Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Defendants dispute only plaintiffs claim that its ad was \u201crejected\u201d and that defendants acted in an \u201carbitrary\u201d manner. Defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>insist'they \u201cagreed to publish Mrs. Mulligan\u2019s \u2018opinions\u2019 about the Rescue Squad\u201d and \u201casked only that the \u2018ad\u2019 comply with guidelines adopted for editorial comment and delete references which would identify specific individuals due to the notoriety generated by the prior litigation between Mrs. Mulligan and the Rescue Squad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Plaintiff argues that defendants violated the free speech provision of the New Jersey Constitution by refusing to accept the advertisement for publication. It claims that the action of the trustees impermissibly turned Panther Valley into a \u201cpolitical isolation booth,\u201d in which only one side of a public issue could be heard. Defendants claim that as a private entity that has not invited any public participation, it does not have to allow plaintiff to speak on its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">In his decision, the motion judge noted that the First Amendment does not \u201cprotect rights of speech and assembly against interference or impairment by private individuals.\u201d He said that the amendment \u201cposes no limitations upon the owner of private property used nondiscriminatorily for private purpose only, even though such use may trench upon the speech and assembly activities of other persons.\u201d The judge performed an analysis under the test set forth in <em>State v. Schmid, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>535, 423 A.2d 615 (1980), <em>appeal dismissed, sub nom. Princeton Univ. v. Schmid, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>100, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>867, 70 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>855 (1982), and concluded under the New Jersey Constitution that the PVPOA \u201cin publishing the Panther has a right to refuse to publish ads that it feels are not advertisements but are more editorial in content than advertisements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Before us, plaintiff concedes \u201cthat if the First Amendment\u2019s definition of <em>press </em>is broad enough to encompass such a private community association\u2019s newsletter, defendants\u2019 federal rights are superior to plaintiffs\u2019 rights under the New Jersey Constitution.\u201d Stated differently, plaintiff concedes that if <em>The Panther </em>is \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>press,\u201d plaintiff cannot prevail given the First Amendment protections enjoyed by \u201cthe press.\u201d However, plaintiff claims that the publishers and editors of <em>The Panther </em>do not constitute \u201cthe press\u201d in the constitutional sense, but rather are merely \u201cfiduciaries with an obligation to manage a community resource.\u201d Plaintiff therefore insists that the New Jersey Constitution requires that defendants publish its submission. Defendants point out that <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, H 6, also guarantees freedom of \u201cthe press\u201d and claim, without citation, that \u201cneither the United States nor the New Jersey Constitution has been construed to limit First Amendment protections to the \u2018press\u2019 as defined by implication by the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">We will assume, as do the parties before us, that plaintiff is correct and that this case, involving a private homeowner association monthly newsletter to its residents, does not involve freedom of the \u201cpress,\u201d as. that term is used in either the First Amendment to the federal Constitution or <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, H 6.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As. such, we conclude that defendants are protected under the State Constitution which guarantees the right to acquire, possess and protect private property. <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. 1,11; <em>see also N.J. Const, </em>art. 1,1120.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Art. I, H 6, of our State Constitution provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">Every person may freely speak, write and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that right. No law shall be passed to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech or of the press.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number><em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, II18, also guarantees the right of assembly. As a result, our Supreme Court has concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">the Stale Constitution furnishes to individuals the complementary freedoms of speech and assembly and protects the reasonable exercise of those rights. These guarantees extend directly to governmental entities as well as to persons exercising governmental powers. <em>They are also available against unreasonably restrictive or oppressive conduct on the part of private entities that have otherwise assumed, a constitutional obligation, not to a,bridge the individual exercise of such freedoms because of the public use of their property.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\"><em>[State v. Schmid, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 560, 423 A.2d 615 (1980) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">In <em>Schmid, </em>the Court held that Princeton University, though a private institution, could not evict defendant or prosecute him as a trespasser while he was endeavoring to distribute political literature on campus.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In so holding, the Court recognized the need to \u201cachieve the optimal balance between the protections to be accorded private property and those to be given to expressional freedoms exercised upon such property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562, 423 A.2d 615. In balancing the rights of speech and assembly upon private property and the extent to which such property owners can reasonably restrict those rights, the Court adopted a three-part test which requires consideration of 1) the nature, purpose, and primary use of such private property, 2) the extent and nature of the public\u2019s invitation to use that property, and 3) the purpose of the expressional activity undertaken upon such property in relation to both the private and public use of the property. <em>Id. </em>at 563, 423 A.2d 615. Even when an owner of private property is constitutionally obligated to honor speech and assembly rights of others, the owner is entitled to fashion reasonable rules and regulations to control the time, mode, opportunity and site for the individual exercise of expressional rights on the property. <em>Ibid. </em>In this regard, consideration must also be given to whether there exists convenient and feasible alternative means to individuals to engage in substantially the same expressional activity. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>In <em>Bellemead, Dev. Corp. v. Schneider, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>571, 574, 483 A.2d 830 (App.Div.1984), <em>certif. denied, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>210, 501 A.2d 894 (1985), we stated that the <em>Schmid </em>framework of analysis requires \u201can initial determination of whether the owner has devoted [the] property to some public use.\u201d In <em>Bellemead, </em>the owner of five office buildings in the Meadowlands Corporate Center was not compelled \u201cto admit a union organizer on [its] properties to distribute leaflets to office workers at building entrances adjacent to employee parking lots.\u201d We held that because plaintiffs had not devoted their property to any public use, the three-part <em>Schmid </em>test need not be considered. <em>Id. </em>at 575, 423 A.2d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In <em>State v. Brown, </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>61, 62, 513 A.2d 974 (App. Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>53, 526 A.2d 140 (1986), anti-abortion demonstrators picketed a private health-care facility located in an office complex. The plaintiff was convicted of criminal trespass for picketing on the premises, and we affirmed the conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 62-63, 513 A. 2d 974. We found that \u201c[t]he tenants and their invitees [were at the office complex] by specific invitation\u201d and that the general public was not invited to use, nor used, the property. <em>Id. </em>at 65, 513 A.2d 974. Based on those facts, we determined that the premises were not devoted to a \u201cpublic use as that term is used in the freedom of expression cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66, 513 A.2d 974. We, therefore, held that an analysis of the three <em>Schmid </em>factors was not necessary, but added that if the analysis were undertaken, the office complex would not be considered public because it was \u201cnot the functional equivalent of a suburban shopping center nor a place to which a general consumer would go to shop for personal, household or general business merchandise.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>at 66, 513 A.2d 974. It had no common area, and no places that contemplated the congregation of people or the dissemination of literature. <em>Ibid. </em>In affirming the conviction, we also found that \u201c[t]he second of the <em>Schmid </em>factors, the extent and nature of the invitation of the public, also disfavors defendant.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In <em>New Jersey Coalition Against War in the Middle East v. J.M.B., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>326, 650 A.2d 757, (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 <em>U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>812, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>62, 133 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 25 (1995), a citizens group sued the owners of private shopping malls to compel the owners to grant access to the private properties to allow the group to engage in leafletting. Under the <em>Schmid </em>test, the Court found a constitutional obligation to permit the leafletting by plaintiffs at certain regional and community shopping centers. <em>Id. </em>at 334, 650 A.2d 757. Speaking through Chief Justice Wilentz, the majority concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">Although the ultimate purpose of these shopping centers is commercial, their normal use is all-embracing, almost without limit, projecting a community image, serving as their own communities, encompassing practically all aspects of a downtown business district, including expressive uses and community events. We know of no private property that more closely resembles public property. The public\u2019s invitation to use the property \u2014 the second factor of the <em>[Schmid </em>J standard \u2014 is correspondingly broad, its all-inclusive scope suggested by the very few restrictions on the invitation that are claimed, but not advertized, by defendants. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">As for the third factor of the standard \u2014 the relationship between the purposes of the expressions! activity and the use of the property \u2014 the free speech sought to be exercised, plaintiffs leafletting, is wholly consonant with the use of these properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 333-34, 650 A.2d 757.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">In <em>Guttenberg Taxpayers and Rentpayers Ass\u2019n. v. Galaxy Towers, </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>101, 102, 686 A.2d 344 (App.Div.1995), a political association sought an injunction to prohibit a condominium association from preventing it from distributing pamphlets on the condominium association\u2019s property during a school board election. Galaxy Towers was a private, residential property of 1,075 condominium units located in three high-rise buildings with related common elements such as hallways, elevators, lobbies and a parking garage. <em>Id. </em>at 103, 686 A.2d 344. The lobby and the garage were guarded by security personnel. <em>Ibid. </em>Within the complex, there was a shopping center known as the Galaxy Mall, which was owned by a third party. <em>Ibid. </em>The mall was open to the public and contained entrances to the Galaxy Towers. <em>Ibid. </em>However, the public \u201c[was] never invited into or permitted to enter Galaxy Towers without permission.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>No \u201ccanvassing or solicitation,\u201d either by residents or outsiders, was permitted. <em>Ibid. </em>The polling place for the residents of Galaxy Towers was in</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the Galaxy Mall. <em>Ibid. </em>However, the condominium association did, in its regular newsletter and in special notices and bulletins, endorse candidates for local elective office. <em>Id. </em>at 104, 686 A.2d 344. We held that the <em>Schmid </em>test controlled, that \u201c[t]he required balancing of property rights and free speech rights depend[ed] on a discreet consideration of the facts concerning the use of the property, as well as the practices of the condominium association with regard to its endorsement of political candidates and issues, and other activities deemed pertinent\u201d and remanded for \u201ca plenary hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108, 686 A.2d 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">On remand, the trial judge noted that to permit \u201cpublic access\u201d there had to be \u201can initial determination that there is some type of public dedication of the property.\u201d <em>Guttenberg Taxpayers and Rentpayers Ass\u2019n, </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>404, 409, 688 A.2d 156 (Ch.Div. 1996), <em>aff'd, 297 N.J.Super. </em>309, 688 A.2d 108 (App.Div.1996), <em>certif. denied, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>141, 693 A.2d 110 (1997). The judge found that Galaxy was \u201croutinely used for political campaigning,\u201d distribution of \u201cpolitical leaflets and handbills [were] part of the normal, everyday activities that occur on the property,\u201d and that the residents \u201cexpect[ed] as a matter of course\u201d that election materials would be \u201cplaced under their doors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409, 688 A.2d 156. The judge also found that because the condominium had become essentially a \u201c 'company town\u2019 ... in which political access controlled by the Association [was] the only \u2018game in town,\u2019 ... [distribution of plaintiffs\u2019 literature in essentially the same manner in which the Association\u2019s literature is distributed [was] the only effective way plaintiffs [could] be guaranteed equal access to the registered voters in Galaxy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411, 688 A.2d 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Plaintiff argues that its claim is even stronger than that of the plaintiffs in <em>Galaxy </em>because Ms. Mulligan, unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Galaxy, </em>was a member of the community with which she desired to communicate. However, the William G. Mulligan Foundation, not Elinor Mulligan, is the plaintiff seeking to place the advertisement, and its position ignores the three prong test developed in <em>Schmid </em>and the fact that defendants have not dedicated any part</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>of their property to some public use. Although <em>The Panther </em>accepts advertising from local businesses, that invitation to the community does not constitute public use of the premises similar to that in which our courts have upheld the right of free speech on private property. Unlike Princeton University, the Galaxy Mall, or any other shopping center, the public is not permitted on any part of defendants\u2019 property. To the contrary, it is a gated community with access only by invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In <em>J.M.B., supra, </em>the Supreme Court reiterated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">In <em>Schmid [supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>535, 423 A.2d 615,] we ruled that our State Constitution conferred on our citizens an affirmative right of free speech that was protected not only from governmental restraint \u2014 the extent of First Amendment protection \u2014 but from the restraint of private property owners as well. We noted that those state constitutional protections are \u201cavailable against unreasonably restrictive or oppressive conduct on the part of private entities that have otherwise assumed a constitutional obligation not to abridge the individual exercise of such freedoms because of the public use of their property.\u201d [84 <em>N.J. </em>at 560, 423 A.2d 615.] And we set forth the standard to determine what public use will give rise to that constitutional obligation. The standard takes into account the normal use of the property, the extent and nature of the public\u2019s invitation to use it, and the purpose of the expressional activity in relation to both its private and public use. This \u201cmulti-faceted\u201d standard determines whether private property owners \u201cmay be required to permit, subject to suitable restrictions, the reasonable exercise by individuals of the constitutional freedoms of speech and assembly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563, 423 A 2d 615. That is to say, they determine whether, taken together, the normal uses of the property, the extent of the public\u2019s invitation, and the purpose of free speech in relation to the property\u2019s use result in a suii ability for free speech on the property that on balance, is sufficiently compelling to warrant limiting the private property owner\u2019s right to exclude it; a suitability so compelling as to be constitutionally required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\"><em>[New Jersey Coalition, v. J.M.B., supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 333, 650 A.2d 757.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQq\">Without considering the reasonableness of the restrictions or limitation defendants placed on plaintiffs \u201cadvertisement,\u201d we conclude that the normal uses of the property, the absence of invitation for public use, and the type of the speech involved here do not compel us to limit defendants\u2019 rights as owners of private property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In so holding, we recognize another fundamental difference plaintiff tries to develop in order to distinguish this case from the controlling precedent. Plaintiff claims that because Ms. Mulligan is a member of defendants\u2019 private association, she has a state constitutional right to exercise her right of free speech in the newsletter of the association of which she is a member, and, independently, that defendants breached a fiduciary duty they owed to her. But, as the trial judge noted, plaintiff is not a member of the Association, and Ms. Mulligan is not the plaintiff. Moreover, plaintiff does not challenge the denial of its belated endeavor to add her as a plaintiff after summary judgment was entered. In any event, while the motion judge referred to Ms. Mulligan as an Association member in his opinion and later indicated that the result would not have been \u201cany differen[t]\u201d had Ms. Mulligan been added as a plaintiff, the record does not adequately develop the rights and obligations of membership in the Association and the relationship between the Association members, and trustees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find it both unnecessary and unwise to decide the interesting and difficult question raised before us concerning Ms. Mulligan\u2019s individual right to compel publication of the advertisement or, perhaps more appropriately, a statement submitted by her personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-12\"> Plaintiff does not contend that the matter was inappropriately considered on motion for summary judgment. <em>See R. </em>4:6-2; <em>R. </em>4:46.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\"> In the absence of briefing, we do not consider the issue. <em>But see, e.g., Branzburg </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>408 <em>U.S. </em>665, 704-05, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2646, 2668-69, 33 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 626, 653 (1972); <em>Lovell v. City of Griffin, Ga., </em>303 <em>U.S. </em>444, 450-52, 58 <em>S.Ct. </em>666, 668-69, 82 L. <em>Ed. </em>949, 952-54 (1938).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b390-9\"> There is no dispute that the federal constitution gives no general right of free speech on private property. <em>See New Jersey Coalition Against War in the Middle East v. J.M.B., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>326, 349, 650 A.2d 757 (1994), <em>certif. denied, </em>516 <em>U.S. </em>812, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>62, 133 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 25 (1995). Plaintiff, therefore, does not challenge that part of Judge Harry Seybolt\u2019s comprehensive opinion dealing with the federal constitution. We also agree with his conclusion under the State Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b391-9\"> Princeton did not have reasonable regulations governing such conduct in place at the time. <em>Id. </em>at 568-69, 423 A.2d 615.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b395-9\"> As a result, we need not consider the impact of the fact that plaintiffs claim would require defendants to do something at a cost \u2014 print the advertisement\u2014 even though plaintiff is willing to offset the costs thereof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b396-8\"> Defendants attached the PVOA bylaws to a certification in the record, but there was no consideration of the \"rights of membership\" or the nature and obligations of the Association, its Board of Trustees, Committees or officers other than the context of the plaintiff's constitutional rights. The trial court proceedings focused on the constitutional argument, and while plaintiff suggests before us that Ms. Mulligan's membership in defendant Association affects the balance under <em>Schmid, </em>plaintiff did not argue in the trial court (nor really argues before us) that the corporate charter or any specific bylaw has been violated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
