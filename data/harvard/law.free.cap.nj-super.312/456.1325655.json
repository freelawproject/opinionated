(temporarily assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">This case again raises the issue of the necessity of providing the jury with a special charge on identification where the critical issue in dispute is the identification of defendant, and defendant requests such charge. After a trial resulting in a hung jury, defendant Delbert Green was again tried and convicted of first degree armed robbery, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15 \u2014 1; fourth degree possession of knife under circumstances not manifestly appropriate for such lawful uses as it may have, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5(d); and third degree possession of a knife with the purpose to use it unlawfully against the person of another, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4(d). Defendant was sentenced to an aggregate term of fifteen years in prison. Defendant appeals and claims numerous trial errors. We conclude that the trial judge\u2019s refusal to charge the jury on identification was plain error, clearly capable of producing an unjust result, <em>R. </em>2:10-2, and warrants a new trial. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">To put the issue in context, we briefly relate the facts adduced at trial. On October 14, 1995, Marie Noelcin was in the parking lot of a bank at Irvington Center when a man put his hand on the car door, put a knife to her side and said \u201cGive me the chain.\u201d He then grabbed the $1,000 gold chain and medallion from her neck and ran. Noelcin described the man as a thin black man with a moustache, wearing a baseball hat, <em>jean shorts </em>and a black shirt. At the first trial, Noelcin was initially unable to identify defendant but did soon thereafter. At the second trial, she again identified defendant as the man who robbed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">After the man left, Noelcin screamed and two men, Ray Belen and his brother-in-law, Saleem Dawson, came to her aid. She explained what had happened, and Belen proceeded to give chase for about two blocks but was unable to catch the robber. He described the man, whom he only saw from the back, as wearing a hat, <em>dark jeans </em>and a dark jacket. Noelcin, Belen and Dawson drove in Noelcin\u2019s car and proceeded to search for the man.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Defendant was observed near the Pathmark supermarket, a few blocks away. When confronted, defendant indicated he was coming from the Pathmark and denied taking the chain. He then walked away and was followed by the three in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The trio followed defendant, at one point offering money for the return of the chain, to Beth Israel Hospital in Newark. At the hospital, various discussions took place between defendant, Noelcin and security officers at which time it was established that defendant was carrying a knife. Defendant steadfastly denied taking the chain while Noelcin continued her accusations that defendant had robbed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The police initially learned of the incident when a call was received by the Irvington Police Department at about 5:30 p.m. that a woman was screaming in the bank parking lot in Irvington Center. The police arrived a few minutes later but found no one present. At 7:15 p.m., the police proceeded to Beth Israel where they investigated the robbery. Again, Noelcin accused defendant of the robbery, and, again, defendant denied involvement. A protective pat-down of defendant revealed a black handled folding knife. Defendant was arrested. At the police station, the police recovered a baseball hat from defendant\u2019s coat. A search of defendant failed to produce the chain.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Defendant testified on his own behalf and claimed that he had been dropped off at the Pathmark by a friend, Ray Snell. He then walked a short distance to a Merit Gas station where he made a collect call to his girlfriend, Yolanda Hadley. While walking to her house, he was approached by Noelcin, Belen and Dawson. Both Snell and Hadley corroborated defendant\u2019s version of the events. In fact, Hadley\u2019s phone bill establishes that the call was made at 5:12 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">During defense counsel\u2019s summation, counsel focused the jury\u2019s attention on the identification issue. The trial judge charged the jury but did not give the special identification charge despite defendant\u2019s request, the judge commenting, \u201cit\u2019s covered in the elements and the authorities say that\u2019s sufficient when it comes to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>identity.\u201d After the charge, the jury returned with a series of questions, most of which were directed to the issue of identification. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all charges. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">On appeal, defendant raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\"><em>POINT I </em>THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S REFUSAL TO CHARGE THE JURY ON IDENTIFICATION, WHEN IDENTIFICATION WAS THE ESSENTIAL ISSUE IN THE CASE, DEPRIVED DEFENDANT OF A FAIR TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKR\"><em>POINT II </em>DEFENDANT WAS DEPRIVED OF A FAIR TRIAL BECAUSE \u2019 THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY BARRED DEFENSE COUNSEL FROM ARGUING IN HIS SUMMATION THAT DEFENDANT HAD PRODUCED ALIBI EVIDENCE AND THEN FAILED TO INSTRUCT THE JURY ON DEFENDANT\u2019S ALIBI DEFENSE. (Partially Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARI\"><em>POINT III </em>IMPROPER RESTRICTIONS ON DEFENSE COUNSEL\u2019S CROSS-EXAMINATION OF BOTH THE VICTIM AND A STATE\u2019S WITNESS DEPRIVED DEFENDANT OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO CONFRONT AND CROSS-EXAMINE WITNESSES.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">A. The Trial Court\u2019s Restrictions On Defendant\u2019s Right To Cross-Examine Ray Belen For Bias Deprived Defendant Of His Right To A Fair Trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">B. The Trial Court\u2019s Refusal To Allow Defense Counsel To Elicit The Victim\u2019s Statement That She Would Identify The Perpetrator \u201cIf He Shows Up Here\u201d Was Prejudicial Error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\"><em>POINT IV </em>THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S REFUSAL TO GRANT DEFENSE COUNSEL\u2019S REQUEST FOR A BRIEF ADJOURNMENT SO THAT A CHARACTER WITNESS COULD TESTIFY TO DEFENDANT\u2019S GOOD CHARACTER DENIED DEFENDANT A FAIR TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-10\"><em>POINT V </em>THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S REFUSAL TO PROVIDE A FULL AND ACCURATE ANSWER TO A QUESTION ASKED BY THE JURY REQUIRES A REVERSAL OF HIS CONVICTIONS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\"><em>POINT VI </em>THE ENTIRE TRIAL WAS SO INFECTED WITH ERROR THAT EVEN IF THE INDIVIDUAL ERRORS, AS SET FORTH, <em>SUPRA, </em>DO NOT CONSTITUTE REVERSIBLE ERROR, THE ERRORS IN THE AGGREGATE DENIED DEFENDANT A FAIR TRIAL. (Not Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-12\"><em>POINT VII </em>THE FIFTEEN-YEAR TERM IMPOSED UPON MR. GREEN IS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">We have carefully reviewed the record and conclude that Point I is of merit and warrants a reversal and remand for a new trial. That being the case, Point II, Point IV, Point V, Point VI and Point VII are moot. We deem Point III to be without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(a)(2). We now turn our attention to the issues raised by Point I.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>\u201cAppropriate and proper charges to a jury are essential for a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Green, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>281, 287, 430 A.2d 914 (1981). A court must provide proper instructions to a jury because the \u201cfaithful performance of a court\u2019s duty of expounding the law for the jury\u2019s guidance and instruction requires a plain and clear exposition of the issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288, 430 A.2d 914. The jury charge should therefore cover all essential matters. <em>Ibid. </em>Erroneous instructions on matters or issues that are material to the jury\u2019s deliberation are presumed to be reversible error in criminal prosecutions. <em>State v. Warren, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>571, 579, 518 A.2d 218 (1986). We recently commented, \u201cThe charge to the jury is the road map for the jury to follow in its quest for the truth. <em>State v. Martin, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>2, 35, 573 A.2d 1359 (1990). There is little room for shortcuts or abbreviated charges which preclude the jury from finding its way.\u201d <em>State v. Allen, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>421, 431-32, 706 A.2d 220 (App.Div.1998). Incomplete or erroneous jury instructions are \u201cpoor candidates for rehabilitation under the harmless error philosophy.\u201d <em>State v. Simon, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>191, 206, 398 A.2d 861 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The necessity of a proper identification charge has been the subject of extended discussion by our courts. In <em>State v. Green, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>281, 430 A.2d 914, the court held that where identification was the \u201ckey issue\u201d and the \u201cmajor, if not the sole, thrust of the defense,\u201d and in view of the \u201cpotential danger of mistaken eyewitness identification,\u201d the defendant had a right to expect a proper identification charge. <em>Id. </em>at 291-92, 430 A.2d 914. Failure to give such charge was found to be plain error. <em>Id. </em>at 294, 430 A.2d 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Thereafter, in <em>State v. Frey, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>326, 476 A.2d 884 (App.Div.1984), we held that the failure to give the <em>Green </em>charge, even though not requested, was plain error where there was an absence of eyewitnesses other than the victim, and defendant denied guilt. \u201cGiven the total circumstances surrounding the events under scrutiny and the limited period of time the victim was able to see the perpetrator before her eyes were taped, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>potential for a mistaken identification becomes readily apparent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329, 476 A.2d 884. We added that \u201c[t]he Model Jury Charge on identification instructs the jury on how to determine identification and the reliability of that identification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330, 476 A.2d 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">We reached a different result in <em>State v. Salaam, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>66, 541 A.2d 1075 (App.Div.1988), but observed that \u201cthe corroborative evidence offered by the State rendered] the issue of identification far less compelling than it was in <em>Green </em>or <em>Frey.\u201d Id. </em>at 70, 541 A.2d 1075. The failure to give the identification charge there was not plain error. In <em>Salaam, </em>unlike here, the victim observed defendant for five minutes before the robbery and defendant was returned to the scene, in custody ten minutes after the robbery and possessed a number of one-dollar bills, the primary denomination of monies taken. In addition, defendant also possessed the toy pistol that was used in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">We have further addressed the identification issue in two recent <em>cases </em>\u2014 State <em>v. Middleton, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>22, 690 A.2d 623 (App.Div.1997), and <em>State v. McNeil, </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>266, 696 A.2d 757 (App.Div.1997). In <em>Middleton, </em>no identification charge as prescribed in <em>State v. Green, supra, </em>was given or requested. We commented that \u201c[i]t is well settled that when identification is the crucial issue in the case, the defendant is entitled to a discrete and specific instruction, providing \u2018appropriate guidelines\u2019 and \u2018focussing the jury\u2019s attention on how to analyze and consider the factual issues with regard to the trustworthiness of [the eyewitnesses\u2019s] in-eourt identification.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Middleton, supra, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 32, 690 A.2d 623 (quoting <em>Green, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 292, 430 A.2d 914).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">In <em>McNeil, </em>as here, identification was the only issue in the trial. We held that the identification charge was required under <em>Green. State v. McNeil, supra, </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 273, 696 A.2d 757. And, as here, the charge was requested. While there was some corroborative evidence against the defendant, that evidence was weaker than the corroborative evidence in <em>Salaam </em>and was in substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>dispute. Because of the cumulative error in <em>McNeil, </em>we did not reach the question of whether the failure to charge identification, standing alone, was reversible error. Here, we reach that issue and conclude that the failure to charge identification is itself reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The State concedes that identification was the main issue in this case, but suggests that failure to charge identification was harmless error. The State argues that there was corroborating evidence in the hat and knife bringing these facts within the scope of <em>Salaam,. </em>The State further asserts that the jury instructions made it clear that the State had to prove that this particular defendant committed the robbery. Finally, it urges that defense counsel\u2019s ability to emphasize the deficiencies in the victim\u2019s identification cured any failure to provide a specific identification charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In the charge given, the judge told the jurors that they were to determine the credibility of the witness.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">And in determining whether a witness is worthy of belief and, therefore, credible, you may take into consideration various factors. Among those factors are the appearance and demeanor of the witness, the manner in which the witness may have testified, the witness\u2019 interest in the outcome of the trial if any, the witness\u2019 means of obtaining knowledge of the facts, the witness\u2019 power of discernment, meaning the witness\u2019 judgment, the witness\u2019 understanding, the witness\u2019 ability to reason, to observe, to recollect and to relate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Defense counsel attempted to establish that the victim\u2019s emotional state combined with the brief time involved in the robbery caused her to misidentify the defendant. In his closing argument, defense counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">Marie Noelcin was obviously very upset through this entire ordeal. From the parking lot to Beth Israel, She was very upset. Everybody agrees she was very upset. She was Angry. She was agitated____ And that degree of upset raised her blood pressure and all the things that she talked about and could directly affect what she was seeing!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">Defense counsel also mentioned the victim\u2019s inability to identify defendant at an earlier proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-13\">You heard today when she [the victim] was first asked if she saw the man in court. She said she did not see him. It was only when the Prosecutor said look around that she pointed to Mr. Green and said that\u2019s the man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>What does that tell you about the confidence that she herself had in identifying the face, not the clothes, but the face of the person that confronted her in the parking lot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">When questioned by the prosecutor after her statement that she didn\u2019t see the person in the courtroom, she looked around and identified Mr. Green. Her inability to do that when first asked is something you should think about in deciding whether or not you can rely on what she tells you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Moreover, one feature of this trial, which distinguishes it from \u2022 any of the cases discussed above, was the questions asked by the jury. The jury sent a note and requested to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWp\">hear the testimony regarding how the defendant was identified on Lyons Avenue by the victim and Ray. For instance, clothing, location of identification and direction of traffic, et. cetera. Two, victim\u2019s testimony of what the perpetrator was wearing when the initial robbery occurred____ Three, testimony of Irvington police officer of what Mr. Green was wearing when arrested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">After the judge asked the jury to be more specific, the jury sent another question: \u201cMay we hear the testimony by Mrs. Noelcin concerning when she first saw Mr. Green on Lyons Avenue, what she said to identify him up to the point that Mr. Beilin [sic] began talking to Mr. Green. (We\u2019re trying to ascertain how she identified Mr. Green on Lyons Avenue.)\u201d A readback occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">All parties understood the issue, and certainly the jury as the finder of fact was entitled to a specific and detailed instruction consistent with the charge approved in <em>Green </em>to assist them in their fact-finding responsibility. Contrary to the State\u2019s position, defense counsel\u2019s summation and the jury\u2019s questions support the view that the identification charge was a critical element missing from the jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">The trial judge\u2019s suggestion in denying the requested charge that the authorities support such denial is in error. <em>Green, Salaam, Frey, </em>and <em>Middleton </em>address the issue in the context of whether it is <em>plain error </em>not to give the charge when no request is made. Here counsel requested the charge. The identification issues in this case were substantial and genuine. The victim identified defendant as wearing short jeans; Belen claimed defendant was wearing jeans. The \u201ccorroborative\u201d evidence was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>generic baseball hat never identified as to color or distinguishing characteristics.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s whereabouts at 5:12 p.m. \u2014 minutes before the robbery \u2014 were corroborated by a telephone bill reflecting a collect call. The victim initially failed to identify defendant in the courtroom. All of these issues compelled an identification charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">We conclude that where requested and where the facts of the case raise a genuine and substantial issue as to identification, the charge must be given. Insuring a fair trial requires no less. The failure to charge the jury on identification deprived defendant of such protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b497-13\"> The victim also indicated a knife was used but was unable to identify the knife recovered from defendant as the knife used during the robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
