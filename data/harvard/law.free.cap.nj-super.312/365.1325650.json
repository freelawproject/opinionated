Defendant also appeals from the denial of his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Defendant alleges that the trial judge erred in: 1) allowing plaintiffs counsel to read portions of defendant\u2019s expert\u2019s videotaped deposition into evidence; 2) directing a verdict on the issue of informed consent; 3) failing to instruct the jury that the partial judgment for plaintiff on informed consent could not form the basis for its finding as to whether defendant deviated from the accepted standards of care on the medical malpractice claim; 4) denying his motion for a new trial even though the jury verdict was excessive, and in failing to grant a remittitur; and 5) imposing sanctions as a result of defendant\u2019s failure to provide plaintiff with her treating physicians\u2019 records.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">We conclude from the unique facts of this case that the trial judge\u2019s deviation from the dictates of <em>Graham, v. Gielchinsky, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>361, 599 <em>A.</em>2d 149 (1991), and his conclusion that the use of defendant\u2019s retained expert\u2019s <em>de bene esse </em>deposition constituted an exceptional circumstance within the purview of <em>R. </em>4:10-2(d)(3), was reasonable and within the trial judge\u2019s discretion. Alternatively, even were we to conclude that the trial judge erred, that error was harmless, thus not justifying a reversal of the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>verdict and the order for judgment entered thereon. We find that defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The trial in this case was the third trial following two prior mistrials. Prior to the first trial, a discovery and <em>de bene esse </em>deposition of defendant\u2019s medical expert was conducted and videotaped. On August 21, 1995, the first trial commenced. Prior to opening statements, defendant withdrew Robert B. King, M.D. as an expert witness. Plaintiffs counsel moved to admit portions of King\u2019s videotaped <em>de bene esse </em>deposition. Judge Yanoff concluded that plaintiff had been unfairly surprised by defendant\u2019s decision not to use King as an expert witness, and therefore held that the videotaped deposition was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Prior to the close of plaintiffs case and after plaintiffs medical expert had testified, plaintiffs counsel moved to bar defendant\u2019s medical expert, Jerold B. Graff, from using medical records obtained from plaintiffs treating physicians, Kevin Leen and Gary Rombough, which were not provided to plaintiff by defendant in discovery. The judge granted a mistrial after concluding that defendant\u2019s counsel should have provided the records to plaintiff, and that the records were \u201cabsolutely crucial\u201d to plaintiffs case. Plaintiffs counsel moved for sanctions, costs and counsel \u25a0 fees. Ultimately, a sanction of $12,500 was imposed, but payment was stayed until the conclusion of the new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">A second trial before Judge Yanoff and a jury commenced on November 18, 1996. During plaintiffs counsel\u2019s opening statement, he informed the jury that they would see the videotaped deposition of King. Defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the comment and the use of the videotape at trial. The trial judge sustained the objection and held that King\u2019s deposition was not admissible. The judge granted plaintiffs motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">The third trial, which forms the basis for this appeal, took place in June 1997 before Judge Yanoff and a jury. Prior to opening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>arguments, plaintiffs counsel again moved to admit King\u2019s videotaped deposition. This time the judge held that portions of the deposition were admissible. At the conclusion of the trial the jury found in favor of plaintiff and awarded her $150,000 in compensatory damages. Defendant\u2019s subsequent motion for a new trial was denied. However, the judge reduced the sanctions and costs previously imposed against defendant from $12,500 to $2,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In 1983, plaintiff suffered an initial outbreak of shingles or herpes zoster,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which resulted in blisters in the area under her right breast and around her right side, for which she was hospitalized for approximately one week. After her discharge, plaintiffs blisters \u201cburst,\u201d resulting in scars which looked like white patches. Plaintiff testified that after the blisters healed, she continued to experience a constant itch in the affected areas which she described as \u201csometimes ... bad, and other times ... alright.\u201d Plaintiff indicated that she also experienced pain if she \u201cpressed\u201d on the affected area.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Plaintiff was diagnosed with postherpetic neuralgia, an acute, chronic condition which occurs following an initial outbreak of shingles <em>in </em>approximately twenty percent of patients. Symptoms of postherpetic neuralgia are sensitivity to touch, pain and itching in the affected area.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">According to plaintiff, between 1983 and April 15,1991, she was medically treated on two occasions: in 1984 by Dr. Kevin Leen primarily for the itch attributable to shingles and for pain in her right chest; and in January 1989 by Dr. Gary Rombough for injury to her right ribs and shoulder as a result of a fall in a supermarket.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>On April 15,1991, plaintiff went to defendant Meadowlands Pain Management Center<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was examined by Kantha. According to defendant, he observed scars in the \u201cdistribution of [plaintiffs] fourth, fifth, and sixth chest nerves\u201d or \u201cthoracic dermatomes.\u201d Plaintiff also described suffering from \u201cpain and itching, aching, [and a] sore breast.\u201d As a result, defendant concluded that plaintiff \u201cwas in moderate distress due to post-herpetic neuralgia.\u201d Defendant recommended that plaintiff undergo treatment consisting of a series of three epidural steroid injections into the spinal area. However, plaintiff declined the treatment because she could not afford it. Defendant did not discuss any alternative forms of treatment and did not discuss prescribing any medication for plaintiffs condition. Defendant testified and stipulated at trial that he specifically did not discuss prescribing for plaintiff acetylsalicylic acid (\u201cASA\u201d), the active ingredient in aspirin, dissolved in chloroform.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">On April 18, 1991, defendant mailed plaintiff a prescription for 100 cc\u2019s of a three-percent solution of ASA dissolved in chloroform. The prescription provided that plaintiff was to apply 1 cc of the solution locally, three times per day, in an open space, and was to avoid contact with her eyes. The prescription came with no forwarding letter or other instructions. Defendant testified that he sent plaintiff the prescription because he felt \u201cbad\u201d that she could not afford the recommended treatment of steroid injections. Plaintiff testified that she thought it was \u201ckind\u201d of defendant to send her a prescription.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">On April 25, 1991, plaintiff received the prescribed medicine from a pharmacy. Plaintiff took the medicine home, disrobed and, with the help of her daughter, applied the ASA solution to the area under her right breast using the eyedropper provided with the prescription. Plaintiff immediately felt a \u201cterrible\u201d burning in the area where the solution had been applied. She put ice on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>area. Over the course of the weekend the pain became worse and the area had become festered and yellow with pus.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">On Monday, April 29, 1991, plaintiff telephoned defendant, who instructed her to come to his office. Plaintiff told defendant that she could not get to the office because she could not get a ride and could not get her clothes on. Defendant then instructed plaintiff to \u201csee her doctor immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">On April 30, 1991, plaintiff went to Dr. Leen\u2019s office where she was diagnosed as having sustained an approximately five-inch by five-inch infected third-degree burn beneath her right breast as a result of using the ASA solution. She was treated with antibiotics and the bums eventually healed. The pain, however, did not go away. She described it as a constant throbbing in the area under her right breast and sharp knifelike pain shooting into her back. The pain was constant, and ranked a one hundred on a scale of one to one hundred. Plaintiff testified that she had never experienced this type of severe pain before.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">As a result, plaintiff testified that she has been unable to work as a nanny despite her desire and job offers to do so. She also testified that the constant pain made concentrating difficult, and her sleep was disturbed and restless. She could not interact with her grandchildren to the same degree as she had in the past, as they were afraid to touch her for fear of hurting her. Additionally, she could no longer wear a bra or form-fitting clothes, which made her feel \u201c[tjerrible.\u201d She was also unable to do housework unassisted. She testified that she did not \u201cfeel too much [sic] about myself. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m worth much anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Plaintiffs expert dermatologist, Victor Silverstein, testified that he was not critical of the fact that defendant Kantha attempted to use ASA dissolved in chloroform to treat plaintiffs postherpetic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>neuralgia, but of the way in which defendant had prescribed the medication. For example, Silverstein testified that defendant deviated from accepted medical practice in prescribing, without adequate explanation and without disclosing the medical risks associated with its use, a medication which could burn a patient. According to Silverstein, it was known at the time of this incident that ASA, an acid, had a tendency to burn when applied to the skin. Silverstein testified that defendant had failed to obtain plaintiffs informed consent before prescribing the medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Silverstein also testified that defendant deviated from acceptable care by mailing the prescription to plaintiff and permitting her to apply it at home without adequate instructions. Silverstein explained that in 1991 the use of ASA in chloroform was an \u201cexperimental\u201d treatment for postherpetic neuralgia with unknown risks and reactions. As such, the standard of care required that defendant personally apply the solution to a small test area on plaintiffs skin to observe any adverse reaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Silverstein testified that these deviations caused plaintiffs injury. He explained that the blistering under plaintiffs breast caused by the herpes had left scar tissue which was thinner and weaker than normal skin. The application of chloroform, a solvent, dissolved the skin\u2019s natural protective oily layer. ASA, an acid, when applied to the unprotected, compromised skin under plaintiffs breast, caused a chemical reaction or a burn. The effect was exacerbated when the solution became trapped in the skin folds under plaintiffs breast, causing it to be rubbed into the sensitive skin and resulting in a third-degree burn. The third-degree burn irritated the already compromised nerve endings, reactivating the original herpes pain and sensitivity. According to Silverstein, plaintiffs pain was permanent and no treatments were available to alleviate it. As of the date of trial, plaintiff was sixty-seven years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Pursuant to Judge Yanoffs pre-trial ruling, plaintiffs counsel then read to the jury unredacted portions of the videotaped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>testimony of defendant\u2019s expert neurological surgeon, Robert King.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Dr. King was the leading proponent of the use of ASA or aspirin in chloroform for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. In fact, King\u2019s 1988 clinical note published in a medical journal, describing the use of aspirin in chloroform on twelve patients with postherpetic neuralgia, was the only reference material available describing this treatment. King, <em>Concerning the Management of Pain Associated with Herpes Zoster and of Postherpetic Neuralgia, </em>33 Pain 73 (1988)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The article does not, however, discuss whether burns are a risk of using aspirin or ASA in chloroform on patients suffering from postherpetic neuralgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">King testified that the symptoms of postherpetic neuralgia are \u201csensitive skin to the touch\u201d in the affected area, scarring, and pain which is often described as \u201csharp, throbbing, heavy ache, [and] burning.\u201d Plaintiff had scars in the area underneath her right breast.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">King testified that defendant\u2019s prescription of three grams of ASA in chloroform was not \u201cunreasonable\u201d for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia, but that he usually prescribes aspirin in a \u201cfree-standing powder\u201d form, which consists of ASA and some chalk dissolved in chloroform. King admitted that the only difference between the prescriptions was that aspirin, as opposed to ASA, dissolved in chloroform left a white powder residue enabling the physician to tell where the treatment had been applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Regarding the method of application, King testified that it is generally \u201ca matter of style.\u201d He gave his patients detailed instructions regarding the risks and benefits of the treatment, demonstrated the proper application, and applied the first few applications of the solution to his patients in his office. He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>applied the solution with a cotton ball, not an eye dropper. If a patient were to apply the solution to the area under her breast, King would instruct the patient to \u201c[b]e very careful,\u201d making sure that the solution was dry before allowing the breast to touch the treated area to prevent burns.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">King learned about this treatment from an unnamed doctor who had told King that he was using it \u201cwith great success.\u201d King began using this treatment on his patients in the 1970\u2019s, and had treated over one hundred patients. He testified that of those patients, approximately six to twelve had been burned by the treatment because the chloroform had not evaporated under a skin fold. King believed that the chloroform caused the burn.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">King testified that there had been no clinical trials to test the use of aspirin or ASA in chloroform on patients with postherpetic neuralgia. The solution was also not FDA-approved and was not listed in the <em>Physician\u2019s Desk Reference. </em>He also agreed that at the time of this incident the use of ASA in chloroform was a relatively new treatment for postherpetic neuralgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Defendant testified that he had first become aware of the use of ASA in chloroform to treat postherpetic neuralgia by reading King\u2019s 1988 article. He subsequently attended meetings where the use of ASA in chloroform was discussed. As a result, he prescribed the ASA in chloroform solution to approximately fifty patients, none of whom reported an adverse reaction. Defendant admitted that in 1991 he was aware that aspirin taken internally could irritate the lining of the stomach causing gastro-intestinal distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Dr. Gerald Graff, defendant\u2019s expert dermatologist, testified that defendant did not deviate from the accepted standards of care in failing to inform plaintiff about the risks associated with the use of ASA in chloroform because there were no reported risks in any of the medical literature. Graff admitted that plaintiff had suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>fered a localized burn in the area where the ASA in chloroform solution had been applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Defendant argues in point one that the trial judge erred in allowing plaintiffs counsel to read unredacted portions of defendant\u2019s expert\u2019s videotaped deposition. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Judge Yanoff concluded that King was the leading proponent of the ASA in chloroform treatment and that his 1988 clinical note was the only literature discussing this procedure.1 Thus, the judge held this case presented an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d justifying admission pursuant to <em>R. </em>4;10 \u2014 2(d)(3) which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">A party may discover facts known or opinions held by an expert ... who has been retained or specially employed by another party in anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial and who is not expected to be called as a witness at trial <em>only </em>upon a showing of <em>exceptional circnm,stances </em>under which it is impractical for the party seeking discovery to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">In reaching this decision, the judge considered the implications of both <em>R. </em>4:16-l(e) and <em>R. </em>4:14-9(e), the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Graham v. Gielchinsky, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>361, 363, 599 A.2d 149 (1991) (recognizing that admission of evidence is generally addressed to the trial judge\u2019s sound discretion), and our decision in <em>Genovese v. New Jersey Transit Rail Operations, Inc., </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>375, 560 A.2d 1272 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>196, 570 A.2d 960 (1989). In <em>Genovese, </em>we reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-11\">It is cheaper for litigants, more convenient for experts, and more efficient for the court to permit a party to present a videotaped deposition if the party elects to do so. It would discourage the use of the device if an expert\u2019s deposition could be used substantively by the other side. No useful purpose would be served. Furtherance of the Rule\u2019s purposes dictates that a trial court should not ordinarily permit the use by another party of an <em>R. </em>4:14-9(e) deposition of a treating physician or an expert as substantive evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 381, 560 A.2d 1272.]</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">Nevertheless, the court indicated that \u201c[t]here may be special</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>circumstances justifying exceptions to the general rule.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Several federal courts have addressed this issue in applying <em>Fed.R.Civ.P. </em>26(b)(4)(B)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, which is identical to <em>R. </em>4:10-2(d)(3). The federal rule was designed to promote fairness by \u201cprecluding unreasonable access to an opposing party\u2019s diligent trial preparation.\u201d <em>Durflinger v. Artiles, </em>727 <em>F.</em>2d 888, 891 (10th Cir.1984) (citing Advisory Committee Notes, <em>Fed.R.Civ.P. </em>26(b)(4)(B)). Generally, the party seeking to discover or admit into evidence his or her adversary\u2019s expert opinion under the federal rule \u201c \u2018carries a heavy burden\u2019 in demonstrating the existence of exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Ager v. Jane C. Stormont Hosp. and Training Sch. for Nurses, </em>622 A.2d 496, 503 (10th Cir.1980) (quoting <em>Hoover v. United States Dept. of Interior, </em>611 A.2d 1132, 1142 n. 13 (5th Cir.1980)). One method of showing \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d under the federal rule is by establishing that there are no other available experts, other than the adversary\u2019s, in the same field or subject area. <em>Marine Petroleum Co. v. Champlin Petroleum Co., </em>641 A.2d 984, 993-94 (D.C.Cir.1979) (holding that the plaintiff Marine did not carry its burden of; demonstrating exceptional circumstances because it did not show that it was \u201cimpracticable\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>for it to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by means other than the defendant\u2019s expert); <em>Eliasen v. Hamilton, </em>111 <em>F.R.D. </em>396, 402 (N.D.Ill.1986) (holding that the defendant failed to show exceptional circumstances because there were other experts available in the same field or subject area).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Here, the question was whether plaintiff established that it was \u201cimpracticable\u201d for her to \u201cobtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means____\u201d <em>R. </em>4:30 \u2014 2(d)(3); <em>see Graham, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>at 373, 599 A.2d 149. It is undisputed that King was the leading proponent of the use of ASA or aspirin in chloroform to treat postherpetic neuralgia. It was also undisputed that King\u2019s 1988 clinical note was the only medical reference in existence regarding the treatment. Additionally, according to this record King had conducted the only investigation or evaluation of the effects of the treatment. In fact, defendant became aware of the treatment by reading King\u2019s 1988 clinical note.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">One additional consideration was the fact that although plaintiffs expert Silverstein could explain the effect of the treatment, he admitted that it was \u201cexperimental,\u201d and that he had <em>not </em>become aware of it until plaintiffs counsel forwarded materials from this case for his review nor was he aware of any other physicians who were using the treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">However, this case presents the unusual circumstance where defendant\u2019s expert was not only the leading proponent of a rare treatment, but also the only physician to study its effects, and other than defendant, the only physician according to this record to have actually used the treatment. In that respect it would have been \u201cimpracticable\u201d for plaintiff to \u201cobtain facts or opinions\u201d as to the actual use of the treatment on patients with postherpetic neuralgia by means other that King\u2019s deposition. <em>R. </em>4:10-2(d)(3). Thus, King was not one of the \u201ccottage industry\u201d experts referred to in <em>Graham, supra, </em>he was the only other expert who had actually utilized the treatment. 126 <em>N.J. </em>at 373, 599 A.2d 149. Under these unusual circumstances, we conclude the judge did not abuse his discretion in finding that plaintiff had established her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>burden of showing \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:10-2(d)(3), and in admitting unredaeted portions of King\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Additionally, the transcript was read to the jury without the jury being able to detect whose witness King had originally been, or differentiate between what had been direct examination by defendant\u2019s counsel and cross-examination by plaintiffs counsel. \u201cGenerally, when an expert formerly retained by a party is allowed to testify for an adverse party, he is restricted from mentioning the prior affiliation.\u201d <em>General Motors Corp. v. Jackson, </em>636 So.2d 310, 314 (Miss.1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>928, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>317, 130 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>279 (1994). <em>See also Graham, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>at 363, 599 A.2d 149 (stating that the trial court properly prohibited the expert from relying on any confidential information or suggesting that the adverse party had originally consulted him).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">In reaching this unusual decision, the trial judge read the entire transcript of King\u2019s videotaped deposition. He redacted much of the testimony, including all portions of the deposition addressing the issue of informed consent. The judge also required that the admissible portions of the deposition be read to the jury without the jury being told whose witness King had originally been, and the jury was not advised which attorney had asked any particular question during the deposition. Even if the judge\u2019s decision was error, we conclude that in light of the overwhelming evidence that Kantha deviated from the standard of care in prescribing medication without explaining its use to plaintiff, that any error was not plain error requiring reversal of the judgment and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">[At the request of the Appellate Division, Points V through VIII do not merit publication, and therefore are omitted.
