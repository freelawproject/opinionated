We reverse as to both claims and remand to the Fund for consideration of the merits of the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">On November 18, 1986, and January 6, 1987, a residential potable well located at 331 Constitution Drive, Lacey Township, in the area designated as MUA Zone 12, was discovered to contain benzene, a hazardous substance, in excess of the level established as acceptable for drinking purposes. Subsequent potable well water sampling found a total of thirteen (13) residential potable wells within Zone 12 to be contaminated with excessive levels of benzene, toluene, xylene and mercury, all hazardous substances. On February 28,1991, petitioner filed a Spill Fund claim, seeking \u201creimbursement of costs incurred\u201d by having its water supply lines extended into Zone 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">In July, 1990, a residential potable well located in the Lanoka Harbor section of Lacey Township, in the area designated as MUA Zone 10, was discovered to contain trichloroethylene (TCE), a hazardous substance, in excess of the level established as acceptable for drinking purposes. Subsequent potable well water sampling found a total of twenty-five (25) residential potable wells <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>within Zone 10 to be contaminated with excessive levels of TCE, 1,1, dichloroethylene, 1,2, dichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride, all hazardous substances. On June 22, 1992, petitioner filed a Spill Fund claim, seeking \u201creimbursement of costs incurred\u201d by having its water supply lines extended into Zone 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">On January 3, 1995, the administrator issued Notices of <em>Intent </em>to deny the claims citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11k, which states that \u201cClaims shall be filed with the administrator not later than one year after the date of discovery of damage.\u201d Lacey, in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.Un, requested arbitration, and the matter was transferred to the Office of Administrative Law. A motion by the Administrator for summary decision was denied by <em>the </em>arbitrator and, on July 8 and 9, 1996, a hearing was conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">On December 18, 1996, the arbitrator issued his final decision. With respect to the primary issue in the case, namely, whether petitioner\u2019s claims were time-barred by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.Ilk, the arbitrator noted that the \u201cfacts for purposes of that question were undisputed\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">Petitioner sought reimbursement for two water projects within Lacey Township, known as zone 10, ... and zone 12. .. In July 39\u00a3)0 hazardous substances in excess of safe drinking water standards were discovered in zone 10. Petitioner solicited bids for a water extension project into this area on January 2, 1991, a contract was awarded on January 23,1991, and construction began on May 2,1991. The zone 10 claim was filed on June 22, 1992, and sought $181,834. The first contaminated wells were discovered in zone 12 during the latter part of 1986 and into 1987. Petitioner solicited bids for a water transmission main on November 20, 1989, the first contract was entered into on December 20, 1989, and construction began on February 18, 1990. Petitioner filed its zone 12 claim on February 28, 1991, seeking reimbursement of $746,540.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Recalling Ms prior conclusion in denying summary decision because \u201cpetitioner discovered its damage when it committed to supply water into zones 10 and 12 and that a clear manifestation of this commitment came when it contracted to extend water lines into these areas,\u201d the arbitrator repeated his conclusion that \u201cpetitioner\u2019s zone 10 and zone 12 applications are untimely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>As to Lacey\u2019s assertion \u201cthat its prior dealings with respondent led it reasonably to conclude that claims would be reviewed without strict attention to the statute of limitations,\u201d the arbitrator noted that while it was \u201ctrue that the then administrator used the commencement of construction as the discovery date of damage and thus interpreted the Act liberally to favor petitioner\u201d with regard to its 1988 Spill Fund claims for Zone 2 and Zone 6, the arbitrator found that this did not suggest a waiver by the administrator of the one-year statute of limitations in <em>N.J.S.A </em>58:10-23.11k, or that the administrator \u201clulled ... [Lacey] into believing that the statute of limitations would not apply.\u201d The arbitrator denied both of petitioner\u2019s claims, concluding \u201cthat- petitioner\u2019s zone 10 and zone 12 applications were untimely and that respondent did not contribute to this in any substantial way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">We first consider Lacey\u2019s contention, raised for the first time on appeal, that denial of the claims is \u201cincorrect as a matter of law\u201d because petitioner, \u201cas a political subdivision of the State of New Jersey, has 10 years to pursue this civil claim in accordance with the clear and unambiguous language utilized by the Legislature in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1.2.\u201d The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) responds that Lacey \u201ccannot rely on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1.2 to establish that it has ten years to file its ... Spill Fund claims\u201d because, in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11k, the Legislature \u201cclearly and unmistakably established a one-year limitation period for the filing of Spill Fund claims.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1.2 <em>(L. </em>1991, <em>c. </em>387, \u00a7 2) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">a. <em>Except where a limitations provision expressly and specifically applies to actions commenced by the State </em>or where a longer limitations period would otherwise apply, and subject to any statutory provisions or common law rules extending limitations periods, any civil action commenced by the State shall be commenced within ten years next after the cause of action shall have accrued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">b.

In a series of recent decisions, the New Jersey Supreme Court has abolished the nullum tempus rule. The effect of these decisions is to subject the State to the same limitations periods applicable to private litigants. This bill proposes to establish a uniform ten-year statute of limitations for actions commenced by governmental entities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">This ten-year period would apply <em>unless another statute expressly provides a different period for actions commenced by the State. </em>As in the ease of private litigants, statutory provisions extending limitations periods under particular circumstances would extend the ten-year period where applicable. The bill would also provide that in no case would the ten-year period be deemed to have begun prior to January 1, 1992.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">Under the bill, \u201cState\u201d is defined to include not only the State but also its political subdivisions, and their departments, divisions, agencies, bureaus, boards, commissions or offices, including public authorities and public agencies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">In <em>Department of Environmental Protection v.

Instead, we ruled that the action by the DEPE, pursuant to the Pesticide Control Act of 1971, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1F-1 to -18, was controlled by the ten-year statute of limitations set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1.2. <em>Id. </em>at 34, 628 A.2d 761. Therefore, we reversed the order dismissing DEPE\u2019s complaint without prejudice and remanded the matter to the Chancery Division for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>hearing for the assessment of penalties pursuant to the Pesticide Act. <em>Id. </em>at 34-35, 628 A.2d 761. We explained that DEPE\u2019s action under the Pesticide Act was not time-barred by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-10, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\">[I]t is not \u201cexpressly and specifically dear-\u201d that the two-year statute of limitations set forth in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:14-10 applies to actions brought under the Pesticide Act, and therefore, this action by the DEPE was controlled by the ten-year statute of limitations set forth in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:14-1.2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">[266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 34, 628 A.2d 761.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">In <em>State v. Cruz Construction Co., Inc., </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>241, 652 A.2d 741 (App.Div.1995), defendants filed motions to dismiss the State\u2019s complaint, demanding damages for breach of contract \u201con the ground that the claims asserted against them were barred by the ten-year limitation period of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1.1,\u201d which barred a complaint thereunder if brought \u201cmore than 10 years after the ... construction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243-44, 652 A.2d 741. Primarily, the trial judge denied their motions because, in view of <em>Rutgers v.

We granted defendants leave to appeal, but affirmed the order denying their motions to dismiss the State\u2019s complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 242-43, 248-50, 652 A.2d 741. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">In <em>Larckmont, </em>we stated that <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:14-1.2 applies to actions brought by the government, unless it is \u201cexpressly and specifically\u201d clear that another limitations period applies. <em>See Larckmont, supra, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 34, 628 A.2d at 761. We held that[,] since there was no express and clear language that <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:14-10 applied to actions brought by the Department of Environmental Protection under the Pesticide Act, the ten-year statute of limitations under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:14-1.2 applied to its claim. <em>Id </em>Applying the <em>Larckmont </em>reasoning to the facts of this case, since it is not, \u201cexpressly and specifically\u201d clear that <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:14-1.1 applies to the State, we hold that the State\u2019s action is controlled by the ten-year \u2022 statute of limitations of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2AU4-1.2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">[279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 248-49, 652 A.2d 741.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">In contrast, in <em>New Jersey Transit Corporation v.

The Court stated that the \u201cLegislature could not have intended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1.2 to give governmental entities a longer statute of limitations than they previously had enjoyed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588, 661 A.2d 778. According to the Court, the statute of limitations previously enjoyed by the State and its constituent parts was set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:3-21. <em>Id. </em>at 592, 661 A.2d 778. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">We have previously interpreted \u201ctaxpayer feeling aggrieved\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:3-21 broadly to include all entities having an interest in the real property that is the subject of a property tax assessment____ No cases support Transit\u2019s claim that state instrumentalities are not \u201ctaxpayers\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">[139 <em>N.J. </em>at 588, 661 A.2d 778 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">It is a well established precept of statutory construction that when two statutes conflict, the more specific controls over the more general---- <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:3-21 establishes a detailed procedure whereby aggrieved taxpayers can appeal a property assessment.

That statute does not specifically delineate which State actions are governed by the statute and which are not. Bather, that statute applies generally to all State claims not expressly controlled by other statutory limitation periods. Since N.J.S.A 54:3-21 is much more specific than <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1.2, the former prevails over the latter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-15\">We therefore hold that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1.2 is inapplicable to the State or its constituent parts in challenges to real-property tax assessments. The Legislature determined in <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:3-21 that aggrieved taxpayers must file their petitions of appeal on or before ... August 15 ... of the tax year. We have held that the State is a taxpayer under that statute. Nothing in the legislative history of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1.2 indicates that the Legislature intended thereby to overturn the otherwise then-accepted conclusion that the State, <em>qua </em>taxpayer, must adhere to the specific limitations periods contained in <em>NJ.S.A. </em>54:3-21. Consequently, the State falls within the specific and express limitations period in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:3-21.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-16\">[139 <em>N.J. </em>at 591-92, 661 A.2d 778.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-17\">In the present case, Lacey was established under and exists in accordance with the Municipal and County Utilities Authorities Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:14B-1 to -69. Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:14B-3(5), a \u201cmunicipal authority\u201d includes a \u201cmunicipal utilities authority created by one or more municipalities.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:14B-20 states that \u201c[ejvery municipal authority shall be a public body politic and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>corporate, constituting a political subdivision of the State.\u201d <em>See also Jordan v.

Thus, Lacey is a \u201cpolitical subdivision of the State.\u201d Given this, it is undisputed that petitioner is within the definition of \u201cState\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1.2(c), which defines that term in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1.2 as meaning the State and \u201cits political subdivisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Lacey\u2019s claim against the Spill Fund is a \u201ccivil action,\u201d as that term is used in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:14-1.2. \u201c[C]ivil action\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A: 14-1.2 encompasses \u201ccivil claims\u201d by a political subdivision of the State \u201cagainst public entities,\u201d such as petitioner\u2019s Spill Fund claims here. <em>New Jersey Transit, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 591, 661 A.2d 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Significantly, the Spill Act <em>(L. </em>1976, c. 141) was initially enacted on January 6, 1977. The effective date of the Spill Act was April 1, 1977. <em>L. </em>1976, c. 141, \u00a7 29. Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11g(a), the Spill Fund is \u201cstrictly liable, without regard to fault, for all cleanup and removal costs and for direct and indirect damages no matter by whom sustained.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10 \u2014 23.11g; <em>Handy &amp; Harman v.

Upon receipt of any claim, the administrator shall as soon as practicable inform all affected parties of the claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">[Emphasis qdded.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>We are satisfied that the question of whether <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:14-1.2 established a ten year statute of limitations for governmental entities that applies to claims against the Spill Fund is controlled by the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>New Jersey Transit, supra. </em>The Court\u2019s finding, that \u201c[t]he Legislature could not have intended <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:14-1.2 to give governmental entities a longer statute of limitations than they had previously enjoyed,\u201d is just as applicable here. 139 <em>N.J. </em>at 588, 661 A.2d 778. The Legislature made clear its intent to subject claims against the Fund by the State and its political subdivisions to the one year limitation for the filing of claims by using the term \u201cperson\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11k. \u201cPerson\u201d is defined in <em>N.J.S.A </em>58:10-23.11b to include governmental entities. This provision was enacted in 1977, notwithstanding the fact that, at that point in time, statute of limitations generally were not applicable to the government under the <em>nullum tempus </em>doctrine. <em>New Jersey Educ. Facilities Auth. v. Gruzen Partnership, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>66, 592 A.2d 559 (1991). Thus, the one year limitation for filing Spill Act claims is applicable to the State, its subdivisions, and its agencies, as it was not the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1.2 to give governmental entities a longer statute of limitations than previously enjoyed. <em>New Jersey Transit, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 588, 661 A.2d 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">We, therefore, turn to the question of whether Lacey filed timely under <em>N.J.SA </em>58:10-23.11k. Lacey stresses that what is involved here is a claim for reimbursement of costs \u201cin accordance with the provisions of <em>N.J.

Under <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:lJ-3.6, the SFCA is defined as the geographic area \u201cconsisting of the currently known extent of ground water pollution determined by the Department pursuant to <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:lJ-3.7, combined with the most probable pollution migration zone determined by the Department pursuant to <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:lJ-3.8.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">In <em>Matter of Thomas, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>580, 651 A.2d 1063 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>95, 660 A.2d 1194 (1995), we indieat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>ed that, if a municipal utilities authority \u201chad to build a water supply and distribution system to provide water to residences whose groundwater supply had been contaminated by a discharge of hazardous substances,\u201d this would constitute \u201cservices ... necessary to remediate an environmental insult and, therefore, would constitute \u2018cleanup and removal costs\u2019 under \u00a7 23.11g, as defined in \u00a7 23.11b.\u201d 278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 587-88, 651 A.2d 1063. Because these services would fall into the \u201ccategory of remediation,\u201d we indicated that the municipal utilities authority\u2019s costs that were \u201cnecessary to the construction of the new water system\u201d would be payable out of the Spill Fund as \u201ccosts of remediation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583, 651 A.2d 1063.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">DEP acknowledges that this appeal involves a \u201cSpill Fund claim for the cost of extending a waterline, ostensibly to address groundwater contamination,\u201d specifically stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">LMUA seeks payment of two ...

Two principles of statutory construction guide our conclusion: 1) \u201cstatutes should be interpreted in accordance with their plain meaning,\u201d <em>Munoz v. New Jersey Automobile Full Ins. Underwriting Assoc., </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>377, 384, 678 A.2d 1051 (1996); and that \u201c \u2018[i]n discerning ... intent we consider not only the particular statute in question, but also the entire Legislative scheme of which it is a part,\u2019 \u201d <em>Cornblatt v.

Our conclusion is consistent with the regulations adopted by the Department pertaining to the \u201cProcessing of Damage Claims pursuant to the Spill Compensation and Control Act.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:1J-1.1 -9.24.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>The regulations, effective January 4, 1993, provide that they \u201cshall apply to the processing of all claims which have not been paid, settled or denied on or before the operative date of this chapter, notwithstanding the date upon which any such claim was filed with the Department.\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:1J-I.2(b). We consider the regulations to be applicable to Lacey\u2019s claim as it was neither paid, settled, or denied before January 4,1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><em>N.J.AC. </em>7:lJ-3.1(a) states that \u201cWater Supply Systems Claims (WSSCs) are eligible for compensation from the Fund only in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.\u201d The \u201cprovisions of <em>N.J.

Pursuant to <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:1J-1.4, the term \u201cdamages\u201d is meant to include \u201call cleanup and removal costs and all direct and indirect damages <em>actually incurred, </em>no matter by whom sustained, arising in connection with a discharge of a hazardous substance, or in connection with a threatened discharge ...\u201d [Emphasis added]. Costs and damages include Water Supply System Claims to the extent that a water purveyor, such as Lacey, may expend costs in an area delineated as SFCA. <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:1J-3.1. The expense must be \u201c[d]irectly associated with supplying potable water to real property in an area within or outside the SFCA for which the Department has determined ... that the existing source of potable water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>is unsuitable for human consumption due to a discharge.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:lJ-3.2(a)l and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">While it is incumbent upon Lacey to demonstrate that the costs it expended in connection with its Water Supply Systems Claim are compensable under the provisions of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:lJ-3.2, it is clear under the plain meaning of the regulations that damages are those \u201cclean up and removal costs and all direct and indirect damages <em>actually incurred.\u201d N.J.A.C. </em>7:1 J- \u2014 1.4; <em>Munoz, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 384, 678 A.2d 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:5-16 prohibits any local unit or body, such as Lacey, from paying out any of its monies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">a. unless the person claiming or receiving the same shall first present a detailed bill of items or demand, specifying particularly how the bill or demand is made up, with the certification of the party claiming payment that it is correct. The governing body may, by resolution, require an affidavit in lieu of the said certification, and the clerk or disbursing officer of the local unit may take such affidavit without cost, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">b. unless it carries a certification of some officer or duly designated employee of the local unit having knowledge of the facts that the goods have been received by, or the services rendered to, the local unit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">Additionally, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:5-17 provides that a governing body of a local unit \u201cshall approve or disapprove all claims.... Claims shall be approved or disapproved in the maimer prescribed by the rules\u201d promulgated either by the bureau or by an ordinance written in accordance with certain statutory specifications set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:5-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">Thus, until the official act of the governmental agency authorizing the payment pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:5-16 and 5-17 takes place, the costs are not actually incurred and, therefore, are not eligible for payment as they do not fall within the definition of damages as set forth in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:1J-1.4. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:lJ-2.4(a) specifically provides that the claimant, to be eligible for compensation, must have \u201cactually suffered damages which are the subject of the claim\u201d and that \u201c[a] claim shall be ineligible for compensation from the fund to the extent that the damages which are the subject of the claim are contingent or speculative.\u201d The decision to provide an alternate water source, the approval of contracts for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>construction of the means needed to supply the water, and the start of construction do not constitute the actual incurring of the cost by the authority. Inasmuch as no costs were \u201cactually incurred\u201d by Lacey until payment was authorized, discovery of Lacey\u2019s damages coincided with the date that the governing body authorized payment of the expenditure.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">In conclusion, we hold that the arbitrator\u2019s denial of Lacey\u2019s cost-reimbursement claims because they were untimely filed under the one-year limitations period in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11k was \u201cincorrect as a matter of law.\u201d Lacey\u2019s claim, having been filed within one year of the authorization of payments made for which \u2022Lacey seeks recovery, is timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Therefore, we reverse the decision denying Lacey\u2019s claims because of untimely filing. We remand for consideration of the merits of the claims.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
