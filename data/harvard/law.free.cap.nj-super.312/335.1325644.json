(Howden), and its divisional president, defendant Claude Tribert, committed slander, violated the New Jersey Conscientious Employee Protection Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-1 <em>et seq. </em>(CEPA), interfered with his advantageous relations, and committed a <em>prima facie </em>tort, which essentially was a claim of common law wrongful discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Through a series of motions brought by defendants, partial summary judgment was granted as to each of plaintiffs claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff appeals. We affirm and conclude that: (1) CEPA does not apply to post-employment retaliatory negative references; (2) plaintiffs CEPA claim for retaliatory discharge was time-barred, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-5; (3) plaintiffs common law wrongful discharge claim was properly dismissed on summary judgment because he reported defendants to OSHA <em>after </em>he was fired; (4) plaintiff was not entitled to partial summary judgment that his termination was in retaliation for attempting to protect his right to a safe workplace; (5) plaintiffs slander claim was properly dismissed pursuant to <em>Mick v. American Dental Ass\u2019n, </em>49 <em>N.J.Super. </em>262, 139 A.2d 570 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>74, 141 A.2d 318 (1958), and the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 577, 584; and (6) plaintiffs claim for interference with advantageous relations with prospective employers was properly dismissed for lack of sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Plaintiff was hired by the Solbern Division (Solbern) of defendant Howden on August 6, 1987, to supervise its stockroom at an annual salary of $30,874. On January 11, 1989, plaintiff wrote a note to defendant Tribert, stating: \u201cThe outside crane and hoist is not safe in present condition. The beam needs repair. The safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>does not work on the hoist. The switch still operates after releasing the up or down button. Please have the repairs made asap.\u201d Plaintiff was terminated on March 9, 1989. After his termination, plaintiff advised OSHA of various dangerous conditions at the Solbern facility. OSHA conducted an inspection of the Solbern facility on May 9, 1989, and cited the company for certain violations but found nothing wrong with the outside crane and hoist.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Between March 1989 and November 1990, using a resume that listed Solbern as his immediate past employer, plaintiff received, but did not accept, at least six offers of employment after contacting about 125 potential employers. Although pre-trial discovery revealed that plaintiff maintained records of the 125 companies to whom he applied for employment, he never contacted these companies to ask why he had not received an offer of employment or whether they had received a negative reference from Tribert or Solbern. Tribert, however, admitted at his deposition that he informed one unidentified prospective employer in July or August 1990 that plaintiff reported Howden to OSHA and that plaintiff \u201cmight be known as the type of person that sailed OSHA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">In November 1990, plaintiff and his friend, Stanley Halley, discussed the idea that Tribert may be giving plaintiff negative job references. Plaintiff and Halley agreed that Halley would pose as a prospective employer to Tribert in order to elicit Tribert\u2019s comments. Together, they drafted a letter on fictitious letterhead and plaintiff mailed the letter to Tribert. Tribert spoke with Halley later that month.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">In his conversation with Tribert, Halley intended to find out if Tribert was \u201ccausing Mr. Beck not to be able to get any meaningful employ---- I didn\u2019t care whether he agreed or disagreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>[with that], I was just wondering whether he was the man who was giving Mr. Beck a bad time getting employed.\u201d Halley thought he could find out this information \u201c[b]y finding out if this is the man who does not think Mr. Beck is a person of quality to hire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">According to Halley,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">[Tribert] brought up the point that Mr. Beck was mingling with other employees and always trying to make deals, buying or selling something. And he also went on to tell me that Mr. Beck called OSHA on the company, which caused a lot of problems to the company. He called OSHA after his employment was terminated at Solbern. And after we had this little discussion I told Mr. [Tribert] that I thought it would probably be a good idea then maybe if we too did not hire Mr. Beck, and [Mr. Tribertl thought it was a very good idea not to be involved with Mr. Beck.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Thereafter, Halley informed plaintiff of the contents of this conversation. Plaintiff then removed his employment at Solbern from his resume.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Shortly thereafter, on December 17, 1990, plaintiff requested that another friend, John Donnell, pose as a prospective employer to find out what Tribert was saying about him. The following conversation ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">TRIBERT: ... [W]ould you like to know what I feel about [plaintiff]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-11\">DONNELL: Yes, if you could tell me that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-12\">TRIBERT: Well basically the gentleman is an average worker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-13\">DONNELL: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-14\">TRIBERT: I don\u2019t care too much for his character. I mean that has nothing to do with the job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-15\">DONNELL: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-16\">TRIBERT: I had to, eventually because of that, I had to still do something, so I discharged him. And in return he filed a complaint with the OSHA people by planting a piece of evidence that didn\u2019t exist before his departure, which, you know, certainly upset me to no end but in any case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-17\">DONNELL: That is something. In terms of \u2014 although that presents a problem which I\u2019ll have to investigate. In terms of loyalty and attendance, could you tell me anything about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-18\">TRIBERT: Loyalty, I don\u2019t know. Attendance, it was fair \u2014 nothing unusual about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-19\">DONNELL: But he was terminated for what, just\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>TRIBERT: No, he was basically terminated because \u2014 two things: the load that we had and his contribution were not all that swift \u2014 and we decided we corid do without him and we let him go.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Plaintiff certified that he \u201cdefinitely did not have either Halley or Donnell contact defendants for the purpose of getting evidence on which [he] could base a law suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Two weeks after the Donnell-Tribert conversation, plaintiff filed his complaint. During pre-trial discovery, plaintiff disclosed that during the ensuing months after removing Solbern from his resume, he applied to an additional twenty-five employers and received three offers of employment. He eventually accepted a job paying $22,500 per year plus an eight percent bonus, or a total of $24,300, but which provided benefits having a value of $2,000 less than the benefits he received at Solbern.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">At his deposition, plaintiff testified that he did not feel that he suffered any damages as a result of the statements made by Tribert to Halley and Donnell following their request for a reference. Moreover, the deposition testimony of both Halley and Donnell demonstrates that neither Halley\u2019s nor Donnell\u2019s opinion of plaintiff changed as a result of Tribert\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">We first address plaintiffs claim that defendants violated CEPA. Plaintiff alleged two distinct claims under CEPA: (1) a claim for damages caused by negative job references made by Tribert in retaliation for plaintiffs reporting Howden to OSHA; and (2) a claim for retaliatory discharge. The motion judge concluded that: (1) the CEPA prohibition of \u201cany retaliatory action\u201d by an employer does not apply to retaliatory negative references; and (2) plaintiffs CEPA claim for retaliatory discharge was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">Plaintiff appeals contending that he has an actionable claim under CEPA for damages caused by defendants\u2019 retaliatory negative references and that he may also maintain an action for a continuing CEPA violation which began with his wrongful dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>charge and ended with the negative references. We turn first to the question of whether negative retaliatory references are actionable under CEPA. Plaintiff argues: \u201cThere is nothing in CEPA which says or implies that the only type of retaliatory conduct it prohibits is a wrongful discharge.\u201d He further contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">Among the most important \u201cterms or conditions\u201d of any employment are the references that the employer will give to potential future employers. Each of Tribert\u2019s retaliations against plaintiff by responding to requests for references by blacklisting and slandering him was therefore an \u201cadverse employment action\u201d against plaintiff and violated CEPA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Defendants argue to the contrary, stating that \u201can adverse employment action \u2018in the terms and conditions of employment\u2019 cannot, by definition, include a <em>post-employment </em>negative reference.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">CEPA\u2019s history has been reviewed exhaustively, most recently in <em>Regan v. City of New Brunswick, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>342, 702 A.2d 523 (App.Div.1997), and need not be reiterated here. We do, however, recognize the purpose of CEPA \u201cto protect and encourage employees to report illegal or unethical workplace activities and to discourage public and private sector employers from engaging in such conduct,\u201d and that CEPA should be liberally construed to achieve its remedial purpose. <em>Abbamont v. Piscaiaway Township Bd. of Educ., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>405, 431, 650 A.2d 958 (1994). Still, CEPA\u2019s express language, as well as the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Young v. Scheming Corp., </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>16, 660 A.2d 1153 (1995), clearly indicate that CEPA does not apply to post-employment retaliatory negative references.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">While construing the applicability of CEPA\u2019s waiver provision to claims other than retaliatory discharge claims and agreeing \u201cwith the Appellate Division\u2019s factual analysis in determining why certain claims were not waived,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 31, 660 A.2d 1153, the Supreme Court stated in <em>Young </em>that \u201c\u2018[t]he language \u201cother adverse employment action taken against an employee <em>in the terms and conditions of employment </em>\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-2e (emphasis added), does not include actions which might affect an employment relationship, or potential employment relationship, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>between the employee and a third party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32, 660 A.2d 1153 (quoting <em>Young v. Schering Corp., </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>221, 239-40, 645 A.2d 1238 (App.Div.1994)). The plaintiff in <em>Young </em>brought a CEPA claim against his former employer, alleging that it terminated him for objecting to company research practices. <em>Id. </em>at 21-22, 660 A.2d 1153. Like plaintiff here, the plaintiff in that case also asserted claims for post-employment defamation, slander and malicious interference with prospective employment. <em>Id. </em>at 23, 660 A.2d 1153.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u2022 In holding that the plaintiffs common law claims were not waived, the Court in <em>Young </em>stated that \u201c \u2018[e]ven if plaintiff can establish that ... [his employer] interfered with prospective employment opportunities, such conduct will not constitute a violation of CEPA.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32, 660 A.2d 1153 (quoting <em>Young, supra, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 239-40, 645 A.2d 1238). The statute, according to the Court, \u201c \u2018covers action taken only with respect to the employment relationship established between the employer and employee.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Young, supra, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 240, 645 A.2d 1238). The Supreme Court\u2019s approval of this court\u2019s construction of CEPA in <em>Young, supra, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>221, 645 A.2d 1238, is contrary to plaintiffs assertion that CEPA applies to post-employment negative retaliatory references.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Moreover, CEPA defines \u201cemployee\u201d as \u201cany individual who performs services for and under the control and direction of an employer----\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:19-2b. The use of the present tense \u2014 \u201cperforms\u201d\u2014suggests the Legislature intended to include under CEPA only adverse employment actions that are taken against an employee while he or she is still an employee, and not after termination. Along similar lines, the Legislature distinguished \u201cemployees\u201d from \u201cformer employees\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:19-5 by allowing \u201cformer employees\u201d terminated in violation of CEPA one year to file an action under the Act. If the Legislature intended \u201cterms and conditions of employment\u201d to include job references given by an employer for former employees, then it would have included the term \u201cformer employees\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:19-2e, which defines \u201cretaliatory action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>We also i-eject plaintiffs argument, predicated on <em>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., </em>519 <em>U.S. </em>337, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997), that retaliatoi-y negative references constitute \u201cadverse employment action\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-2e. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Robinson </em>held that a former employee could maintain an action under Section 704(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, <em>see </em>42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 2000e-3(a), for an employer\u2019s post-employment negative retaliatory references. <em>Id. </em>at---, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 849, 136 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 816-17. The Court\u2019s decision in <em>Robinson </em>was based on an ambiguity in the definition of the word \u201cemployee\u201d in the statute. <em>See </em>42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 2000e(f). \u201cEmployee\u201d is defined as \u201c \u2018an individual employed by an employer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 846, 136 L.Ed.2d at 814 (quoting 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 2000e(f)). The Court concluded that it was unclear whether the term included a company\u2019s former employees, and held that former employees were protected because the statute lacked any \u201ctemporal qualifier\u201d indicating that it only covered present employees. <em>Robinson, supra, </em>519 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 846-47, 186 L.Ed.2d at 813-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Unlike the statute at issue in <em>Robinson, </em>there is no ambiguity in CEPA regarding who is an \u201cemployee\u201d for purposes of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-2b and -2e. Further, as the Third Circuit noted in <em>Nelson v. Upsala College, </em>51 <em>F.3d </em>383, 388 n. 7 (3d Cir.1995), also involving a Title VII claim, \u201cthe possibility that the denial of a retaliation claim for conduct not related to an employment relationship will discourage Title VII activity is slight because se3\u00daous retaliatory conduct unrelated to an employment relationship will be actionable under state law.\u201d That rationale is equally applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">Plaintiff also contends that his CEPA claim for wrongful discharge should not have been barred by the statute of limitations because \u201cthe discharge was <em>p&amp;rt </em>of a continuing series of CEPA violations, including defendants\u2019 retaliatory negative references, which tolled the running of the limitations peiiod on the discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>CEPA\u2019s statute of limitations provision states: \u201cUpon a violation of any of the provisions of this act, an aggrieved employee or former employee may, <em>within one year, </em>institute a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-5 (emphasis added). Plaintiff was terminated on March 9,1989, but did not file his CEPA claim until December 31, 1990, almost twenty-two months later. Were we to accept plaintiffs contention, however, we would measure the running time of the limitations period from the last occurrence, the last act of alleged retaliatory negative references, and not from the first occurrence, plaintiffs termination. <em>West v. Philadelphia Elec. Co., </em>45 F.3d 744, 754 (3d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">We conclude that plaintiffs CEPA wrongful discharge claim was properly dismissed as time-barred, and that the conduct alleged by plaintiff does not fit within the \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d doctrine. The alleged conduct here is more akin to two separate and distinct employer actions, and not \u201cintentional, pervasive, and regular,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 756, or \u201cmore than the occurrence of isolated or sporadic acts of intentional [conduct],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 755 (citation omitted). Plaintiffs termination was a \u201cdiscrete event\u201d which triggered his duty to \u201cassert his rights arising from that deprivation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Clearly, Tribert\u2019s informing one unidentified prospective employer in July or August 1990 that plaintiff contacted OSHA does not constitute \u201ca persistent, on-going pattern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 755; <em>see also Terry v. Mercer County Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>249, 253, 414 A.2d 30 (App.Div.1980), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>141, 430 A.2d 194 (1981) (involving alleged discrimination in the payment of wages over of period of time, such that each pay period constituted a continuing violation of the relevant statute); <em>Decker v. Board of Educ., </em>153 <em>N.J.Super. </em>470, 474, 380 A.2d 285 (App.Div.1977) (same), <em>certif. denied, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>612, 384 A.2d 842 (1978); <em>see also Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>363, 381, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>1114, 1125, 71 L.Ed.2d 214, 230-31 (1982) (involving alleged discrimination under the federal Fair Housing Act where the defendant appeared to have a policy of denying the availability of housing to African-Americans, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>under that policy, engaged in a series of violations of a single section of the statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Further, as defendants point out, courts applying the continuing violation doctrine in other contexts have held that negative references following an alleged retaliatory discharge do not constitute a \u201ccontinuing violation.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Berry v. Board of Supervisors of L.S.U., </em>715 F.2d 971, 980 (5th Cir.1983) (\u201c[C]ases where an employee is discharged without the actionable period but is injured by his former employer\u2019s discriminatory references within the period, indicate that the latter acts are not a continuation of the initial discharge.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 <em>U.S. </em>868, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>232, 93 L.Ed.2d 158 (1986); <em>Tarvesian v. Carr Div. of TRW, Inc., </em>407 <em>F.Supp. </em>336, 338-40 (D.Mass.1976) (holding that the plaintiffs charges of negative references given by his former employer \u201csimply do not constitute a \u2018continuing pattern of discrimination\u2019 as that term has been developed in case law\u201d and that \u201c[t]he mere insertion of the word \u2018continuing\u2019 into an otherwise unconnected sequence of events does not create a pattern of the kind necessary to suspend the normal time limitations on Title VII actions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Plaintiff argues on appeal that the trial court erred in dismissing his common law wrongful discharge claim. The trial court dismissed the wrongful discharge claim because (1) plaintiff waived this claim by bringing an action under CEPA for retaliatory discharge based on the same proofs, and (2) plaintiff informed OSHA of Howden\u2019s dangerous workplace only after he was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Since we conclude that the motion judge correctly dismissed plaintiffs common law wrongful discharge claim on the merits, we need not consider the first reason relied upon by the trial judge, which predated our decision in <em>Crusco v. Oakland Care Ctr., Inc., </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>605, 702 A.2d 1363 (App.Div.1997) (holding that a former employee\u2019s assertion of a CEPA claim in a complaint did not bar her from bringing a common law wrongful discharge claim, where the CEPA claim was time-barred). <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number><em>also Ballinger v. Delaware River Port Auth., </em>311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>317, 709 A.2d 1336 (App.Div.1998) (following <em>Crusco </em>and holding that plaintiffs who erroneously pled an unavailable CEPA claim were not barred from asserting wrongful discharge claims based on the same proofs). Plaintiffs common law wrongful discharge claim was properly dismissed on the merits because plaintiff was terminated <em>before </em>he filed his report with OSHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">It is undisputed that plaintiff was an at-will employee who could be fired by defendants \u201cfor no specific reason or simply [for] bothering the boss.\u201d <em>Velantzas v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., Inc., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>189, 191, 536 A.2d 237 (1988). \u201cHowever, a terminated at-will employee has a cause of action against the employer for wrongful termination when the discharge violates state law or public policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191-92, 536 A.2d 237 (citing <em>Pierce v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>58, 417 A.2d 505 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">A common law claim under <em>Pierce, </em>though, has been distinguished from the broader CEPA claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">Although the enactment of CEPA did not abolish the <em>Pierce </em>common-law cause of action, we are persuaded that the Legislature intended that the <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-8 waiver prevent an employee from pursuing both statutory and common-law retaliatory discharge causes of action. It thus sought to curtail essentially cumulative remedial actions.

Plaintiff did not notify OSHA of these conditions until \u201cthe latter part of April,\u201d almost two months after his March 9, 1989, termination.

These statements also do not form the basis for a slander claim because they were not published. The <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 577 cmt. e, at 203 (1977), provides that \u201cthe communication to a servant or agent of the person defamed is a publication although if the communication is in answer to a letter or a request from the other or his agent, the publication may not be actionable in defamation.\u201d Further, \u201c[a]n honest inquiry or investigation by the person defamed to ascertain the existence, source, content or meaning of a defamatory publication is not a defense to an action for its republication by the defamer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 584, at 242. \u201cThe rule stated in [Section 584] is applicable only to the publication of defamatory matter at the request or procurement of a plaintiff who acts honestly for the purpose of ascertaining the existence, source, content or meaning of a prior defamatory publication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 584 cmt. a, at 242. \u201cTo come within [Section 584], the defamatory matter must be repeated.

He testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">he had read that the Bureau of Public Information of the American Dental Association had invited inquiries with respect to the opposition to fluoridation and he requested [his friend] to write the letter because he \u201cwas always being kidded [by all his associates] about being opposed to fluoridation 4 4 * \u201d \u201cI had been so active in opposing fluoridation in the Army and before I went into the Service, I wondered if they had anything on me.

It is offensive to an elementary sense of justice that after securing defendant\u2019s candid expression of its opinion of plaintiffs views on fluoridation through his use of [his friend\u2019s] letter as a provocative decoy, he should be permitted to sue for the injury he thus invited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5Z\"><em>Id. </em>at 276, 139 A.2d 570.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Defendants are correct in their contention that \u201c[cjontrary to plaintiffs assertion, Dr. Mick <em>did not </em>request that his friend write the Association for the purpose of eliciting statements that could form the basis of a legal action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">We also agree with defendants that <em>Mick </em>\u201cis strikingly similar to this action\u201d and that the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception as explained in <em>Mick </em>and the <em>Restatement </em>does not apply here. Neither Halley nor Donnell contacted Tribert to ascertain \u201cthe existence, source, content or meaning of a prior defamatory publication.\u201d <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 584 cmt. a. Rather, like the plaintiff in <em>Mick, </em>they and plaintiff were curious as to what Tribert might say about plaintiff. As defendants point out, Halley and Donnell \u201chad no knowledge that Tribert had previously made any slanderous remarks, and were not inquiring concerning the substance of any such previous remarks.\u201d Since Halley\u2019s and Donnell\u2019s communications with Tribert served as \u201cprovocative decoys,\u201d plaintiff \u201cshould [not] be permitted to sue for the injury he thus invited.\u201d <em>Mick, supra, </em>49 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 276, 139 A.2d 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Moreover, in our view, Tribert\u2019s defamatory statements to Halley and Donnell may not be actionable because the statements were either true, <em>see Kass v.

Although we recognize that a portion of Tribert\u2019s comments arguably were based on his conjecture,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> even that statement may be subject to a qualified privilege. <em>See ibid.; see also Erickson v. Marsh &amp; McLennan Co., Inc., </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>539, 563, 569 A.2d 793 (1990) (discussing qualified privilege generally). Because we conclude that plaintiffs slander claim based on these statements is barred by <em>Mick, supra, </em>we need not consider the applicability of qualified privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Plaintiff also claims that the trial court erred in dismissing his claim for intentional interference with a prospective economic relationship. The trial court held that \u201c[t]here is absolutely nothing ... which ... anyone could even infer that ... a [slanderous] statement was made to other prospective employers, other than [plaintiffs] friends, and which resulted in the plaintiff not receiving a job that he otherwise would have received. Therefore, [defendant\u2019s] motion [for summary judgment] is granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">To prove a claim for interference with an advantageous economic relationship, plaintiff must show: (1) the existence of a reasonable expectation of economic advantage; (2) intentional and malicious interference with that expectation, (3) the interference caused plaintiff to lose the prospective economic advantage; and (4) damage. <em>See Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Electronics Corp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>739, 751-52, 563 A.2d 31 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Plaintiffs claim here clearly fails for lack of sufficient evidence. He offered no proof that any of the 125 firms to whom he applied for employment was actually in contact with Tribert. Although Tribert admitted communicating with one unidentified prospective employer, plaintiff is unable to demonstrate that the employer failed to offer a position to plaintiff due to the information provided by Tribert. Moreover, Tribert\u2019s statement to the unidentified caller was true, and thus plaintiffs claim is foreclosed. <em>See C.R. Bard, Inc. v. Wordtronics Corp., </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>168, 173-74, 561 A.2d 694 (Law Div.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">We have thoroughly canvassed the record.

When plaintiff's complaint was dismissed, the trial court, with the consent of the parties, dismissed without prejudice defendant\u2019s counterclaim, thus permitting plaintiffs appeal from a final judgment of dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\"> In a certification filed by plaintiff in response to one of defendants' motions for partial summary-judgment, he contended that OSHA inspected only a one-ton crane but had failed to inspect the two-ton crane, which was the subject of plaintiff's complaint. This distinction is irrelevant to the disposition of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b384-8\"> As noted in the reproduction of Tribert's conversation with.Donnell, <em>supra </em>page 5, Tribert accused plaintiff of \"planting evidence\" in anticipation of OSHA's investigation.
