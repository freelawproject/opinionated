A Coahoma County jury convicted Herman Jackson of possession of marijuana of more than thirty grams but less than one kilogram with intent to sell, transfer, barter, distribute, or dispense. The trial court sentenced him to ten years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) as a subsequent drug offender\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and as a non-violent habitual offender. Jackson now appeals, raising several issues through his counsel and pro se.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. In June 2013, a confidential informant (CI) told narcotics agents with the\n   Clarksdale Police Department that Jackson possessed a large amount of marijuana and that he was selling it out of his home at 343-B Bolivar Street. Officers considered the CI reliable because the informant had provided information in numerous prior cases and was instrumental in helping to obtain prior convictions. Officers presented the CI's information to a judge and obtained a warrant to search Jackson's house. Officers then conducted \"loose surveillance\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the house for approximately twenty-four hours, during which time Jackson did not enter or leave the house. Shortly thereafter, Jackson was seen driving within three blocks of his home. Knowing there was an active warrant for Jackson's arrest due to unpaid municipal fines,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   officers stopped him and transported him to 343-B Bolivar Street. Officers informed Jackson they were going to search his home. When asked for a key, Jackson stated he did not have one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officers therefore kicked the door in and conducted a thorough search of the home while Jackson remained in the patrol car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Even though the home was modest, numerous surveillance cameras were mounted outside to record the house's exterior area. Inside, there was a digital video recorder (DVR) connected to the video-surveillance system, showing the exterior of the house on four split screens on a monitor in real-time. On a living-room sofa, two clear plastic baggies containing a green leafy substance were found, as well as a significant amount of the same substance and some packaging materials in the bedroom on a dresser. Officers also seized from the bedroom a box of sandwich baggies, a set of digital scales, and the DVR system found in the closet. Additionally, they recovered several utility bills that were addressed to Jackson at this address, and Jackson's social-security card, which was lying on a living-room table. A ceramic container on top of the refrigerator in the kitchen was filled with sandwich baggies and a green leafy substance. Female clothing and cosmetics were also observed in the home, indicating a female apparently lived at the residence; however, a male's pair of pants was also observed and photographed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. After the search, Jackson was transported to the Clarksdale Police Department and booked. Jackson requested to use the telephone and made three calls, all of which were recorded without his knowledge and later admitted into evidence at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the calls, Jackson made several statements indicating the house that the officers searched and the drugs were his. While officers did not witness the telephone calls, one officer identified Jackson's voice from the recordings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. A Coahoma County grand jury indicted Jackson for possessing more than thirty grams but less than one kilogram of marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of\n   Mississippi Code Annotated section 41-29-139(b)(1) (Rev. 2013).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   He was also indicted as a subsequent offender under Mississippi Code Annotated section 41-29-147 (Rev. 2013) and as a non-violent habitual offender under Mississippi Code Annotated section 99-19-81 (Rev. 2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. At trial, narcotics officers testified to the amount of marijuana seized. Eric Frazure, a forensic chemist at the Mississippi Crime Lab accepted as an expert in drug analysis, testified that based on his testing, the green leafy substance seized was marijuana. The jury was instructed on both the charged offense and the lesser-included crime of simple possession of marijuana in an amount of more than 250 grams but less than 500 grams. The jury found Jackson guilty as charged, and he was sentenced to ten years in the custody of the MDOC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Additional facts will be discussed as they relate to the issues raised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. On appeal, counsel for Jackson raises six issues. Jackson's pro se brief supplements his appellate counsel's arguments and raises four more separate issues. We shall discuss each in turn, consolidating where issues overlap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Police Department Telephone Calls\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9. Jackson argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress recordings of three telephone calls he made at the Clarksdale Police Department, which were admitted into evidence, because he claims the State's attempts to authenticate the recordings were insufficient. During these telephone calls, Jackson identified the house and the marijuana as his property. Jackson claims there was no evidentiary foundation for the conversation because no one at the police department testified that the machinery was in proper working order while recording, and no one was listening to the conversation to make sure it was accurately recorded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10. The standard of review for the admissibility of evidence is abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Stromas v.

Evidence must be relevant and properly authenticated to be admitted at trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7463400,7463536,7463326,7463447\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/618/116/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 118 (citing M.R.E. 401 &amp; 901 ). \"Authentication of evidence requires the offering party to lay a proper foundation.\"\n   <em>\n    Riley v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004070\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/126/1007/#p1009\">\n    126 So.3d 1007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1009 (\u00b6 7) (Miss. Ct. App. 2013) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11083484\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/775/735/#p740\">\n    775 So.2d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 740 (\u00b6 11) (Miss. Ct. App. 2000) ). The applicable version of Mississippi Rule of Evidence 901(a) provides that authentication is sufficient when it \"support[s] a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\" One means of authenticating evidence \"is through the testimony of a witness with knowledge 'that [an item] is what it is claimed to be.' \"\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004070\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/126/1007/#p1009\">\n    126 So.3d at 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 7) (quoting M.R.E. 901(b)(1) ). Further, the applicable Rule 901(b) gives several examples of evidence that can be\n   used for authentication in different circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (5) Voice Identification. Identification of a voice,\n   <em>\n    whether heard firsthand or through mechanical or electronic transmission or recording, by opinion based upon hearing the voice at any time under circumstances connecting it with the alleged speaker.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (6) Telephone Conversations. Telephone conversations, by evidence that a call was made to the number assigned at the time by the telephone company to a particular person or business, if (A) in the case of a person, circumstances, including self-identification, show the person answering to be the one called\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (9) Process or System. Evidence describing a process or system used to produce a result and showing that the process or system produces an accurate result.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   M.R.E. 901(b)(5)-(6), (9) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 11. The State satisfied the authentication requirement through the testimony of Officer Carl Hinton, who testified he was familiar with Jackson's voice on the recording, and identified it as his. Jackson argues this was insufficient to lay a proper foundation, but we disagree. Officer Hinton transported Jackson to the station and booked him, then Officer Hinton allowed Jackson to make three telephone calls. While Officer Hinton did not overhear the calls, he and Jackson were the only individuals in the area when the calls were made, and he observed Jackson ending a call. Further, Cindy Doss, an administrator with the police department, testified that all incoming and outgoing telephone calls at the police station are recorded. She explained the process for obtaining a copy of the recordings and that she made a copy of Jackson's telephone calls as requested by the investigators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 12. In support of his argument, Jackson cites\n   <em>\n    Conway v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9003926\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/915/521/#p526\">\n    915 So.2d 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 526 (\u00b6 19) (Miss. Ct. App. 2005), where this Court found an edited videotape was admitted without proper authentication because the officer who testified to authenticate the footage never actually witnessed the crime scene. However, the admission of the videotape was deemed harmless error due to the overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9003926\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/915/521/#p526\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 20). We find\n   <em>\n    Conway\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable here because Officer Hinton's identifying testimony was based on information within his knowledge-Jackson's voice-whereas in\n   <em>\n    Conway\n   </em>\n   the video was of the crime scene and never viewed by the authenticating officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 13. We find the State's citation to\n   <em>\n    Broadhead v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8397807\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/981/320/\">\n    981 So.2d 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. Ct. App. 2007) analogous to this situation. There, the defendant argued that the admission of her recorded phone call from jail was improperly admitted because the State's authentication of the recordings was insufficient.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8397807\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/981/320/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8397807\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/981/320/\">\n    at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 24). Similar to this case, the State authenticated the recording through an officer testifying he was familiar with the defendant's voice and identified her voice in the recording.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8397807\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/981/320/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8397807\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/981/320/\">\n    at 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 25). The officer also testified he was familiar with the phone system that recorded the inmates' calls.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8397807\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/981/320/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, Officer Hinton identified Jackson's voice, and Doss testified about the process for obtaining copies of the recorded phone calls. The\n   <em>\n    Broadhead\n   </em>\n   court also cited\n   <em>\n    Conway\n   </em>\n   as inapplicable because an officer was familiar with the defendant's voice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8397807\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/981/320/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 26). Furthermore, we are not persuaded by Jackson's argument that a telephone-call recording system is analogous to an Intoxilyzer machine or a radar device.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 14. Additionally, in his pro se brief, Jackson argues that the recordings should have been suppressed because they\n   were obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. However, this argument is procedurally barred because it was not presented before the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bates v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9217530\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/879/519/#p522\">\n    879 So.2d 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 522 (\u00b6 7) (Miss. Ct. App. 2004). Regardless of the procedural bar, the issue is without merit. A person may only challenge an intrusion to his or her right to privacy where the person \"would objectively and reasonably expect privacy.\"\n   <em>\n    Pierre v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7475025\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/607/43/#p52\">\n    607 So.2d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 52 (Miss. 1992) (citing\n   <em>\n    Katz v.

In\n   <em>\n    Pierre\n   </em>\n   , there was no reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment for a telephone conversation by a defendant in custody, when she confessed to a crime while on the phone with her brother in an open room as police officers sat nearby.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-52. \"The expectations of privacy of an individual taken into police custody\" are necessarily diminished.\n   <em>\n    Maryland v. King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697054\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/435/#p462\">\n    569 U.S. 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 462,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697054\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/435/#p462\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697054\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/435/#p462\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). The same principle would apply here. Jackson did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy for his telephone calls because he was in custody and being monitored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 15. Relatedly, Jackson argues that Mississippi Code Annotated section 41-29-507 (Rev. 2013) was violated. This code section is part of the Interception of Wire or Oral Communications Act, and provides that \"[n]o person, agency ... or political subdivision of the state, other than the Bureau of Narcotics, is authorized ... to own, possess, install, operate or monitor an electronic, mechanical or other device.\" However, the bureau \"may be assisted by an investigative or law enforcement officer in the operation and monitoring of an interception ... [of communication], provided an agent of the Bureau of Narcotics is present at all times.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041-29-509\">\n    Miss.

This specific issue was also not raised below, and accordingly, is procedurally barred.\n   <em>\n    Bates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9217530\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/879/519/#p522\">\n    879 So.2d at 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 7). In spite of the bar, again, Jackson would not have a reasonable expectation of privacy while in custody using a jailhouse telephone. Section 41-29-501 defines the terms of the Act. \" 'Oral communication' means an oral communication uttered by a person exhibiting an expectation that the communication is not subject to interception\n   <em>\n    under circumstances justifying that expectation.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041-29-501\">\n    Miss.

Here, Jackson claims he was not advised that his telephone calls would be recorded; therefore, he might present a question of whether he had a subjective expectation of privacy; however, under\n   <em>\n    Van Poyck\n   </em>\n   , we find that such expectation is not justified under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 17.

At the hearing on his motion to suppress, Jackson argued that the search warrant was invalid because it was based on unreliable facts and circumstances in violation of the Fourth Amendment.

Jackson claims the reliability of the CI was not corroborated by an independent reliable source. We disagree. The documents presented in support of the search warrant contained statements sufficient to show the CI was \"very reliable.\" Further, at the hearing, Captain Bridges testified that he had used the CI for several years, and the information was \"always reliable,\" leading to several arrests. Under the totality of the circumstances, there was sufficient evidence of the CI's veracity, and the trial judge had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 24.

Additionally, Jackson argues pro se that the search warrant was stale because the supporting affidavit did not include the time or date that the CI observed marijuana at the residence, or when the CI related the information to the affiants-Captain Bridges and Sergeant Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 26.

However, it was. While the term \"stale\" was not used at the suppression hearing, defense counsel argued that the warrant was invalid because the time and date the drugs were observed and the information was relayed to the officers was unknown, which is the same argument Jackson raises now on appeal. Although the issue is not barred, we find it without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 27.

During the suppression hearing, defense counsel recounted information from the Clarksdale Police Department Report, which is not in the record, and admitted that this same information was presented to the Clarksdale municipal judge to secure the search warrant. On June 18, 2013, Captain Bridges and Sergeant Smith \"received credible information from a reliable confidential informant that Jackson was in possession of\n   <em>\n    several pounds\n   </em>\n   of marijuana\" that \"was\n   <em>\n    being stored\n   </em>\n   at 343B Bolivar Street, known to be Jackson's residence.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 29. The key inquiry is whether the magistrate had a substantial basis to believe marijuana would be found at the address.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11771768\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/724/427/#p429\">\n    724 So.2d at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 8). We find he did. While we are not privy to the exact facts, if any, the officers related to the magistrate, in addition to those contained in the affidavit, there is no indication that any of the information was stale. We understand the hesitancy of law enforcement to disclose in the affidavit a specific date the CI observed the interior of a certain residence, as that could lead to the possible identification of the CI. Here, the CI had been used numerous times, had been \"in the system\" for over four years, and had been proved reliable. This lends to the affiants' conclusion that marijuana was located in the residence. Further, a \"quantity of marijuana\" had been observed by the CI. The police report as read by defense counsel indicated \"several pounds\" of marijuana was being stored at the residence. Even if the CI had observed the marijuana some days previously, there would be a likelihood that some would still be present, given the quantity observed. As timing is but one factor to establish probable cause,\n   <em>\n    Flake\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8345697\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/948/493/#p496\">\n    948 So.2d at 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 9), we cannot say as a matter of law the affidavit was insufficient or that the magistrate erred in issuing the search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Neutral Magistrate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 30. Finally, Jackson argues pro se that the search warrant was not valid because it was not signed by a neutral and detached magistrate. Jackson claimed that because he had pleaded guilty to a prior misdemeanor possession-of-marijuana charge before the same municipal judge, that judge could not be neutral at a later date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 31. Jackson did not present this argument before the trial court; therefore, he is procedurally barred from raising the issue for the first time here. In addition, the argument is without merit. While \"[i]t is well-settled that an individual issuing a\n   warrant must be a detached and neutral magistrate,\" here there is no evidence in the record indicating the municipal judge was not detached and neutral based on prior dealings with Jackson.\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8416654\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/931/639/#p642\">\n    931 So.2d 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 642 (\u00b6 7) (Miss. Ct. App. 2006). This issue is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Evidence Tampering\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 32. Next, Jackson argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence due to law enforcement allegedly tampering with the marijuana seized from his house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 33. The applicable version of Mississippi Rule of Evidence 901(a) states that in order \"[t]o satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.\" The proponent must also \"show no reasonable inference of material tampering with, or substitution of, the evidence; however, Mississippi law has never required a proponent of evidence to produce every handler of evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Ellis v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8411009\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/934/1000/#p1005\">\n    934 So.2d 1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1005 (\u00b6 21) (Miss. 2006). \"The defendant has the burden of proving tampering or substitution of the evidence, and 'a mere suggestion ...' \" of substitution is insufficient.\n   <em>\n    Deeds v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7059703\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/27/1135/#p1142\">\n    27 So.3d 1135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1142 (\u00b6 20) (Miss. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 34. In Jackson's motion to suppress,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   he claimed there was a discrepancy between the weight of the marijuana that was allegedly recovered from the residence, and the weight submitted to the Mississippi Crime Laboratory. Attached to his motion was Officer Hinton's arrest report and Sergeant Smith's certified report to the crime lab on the amount of marijuana to be submitted for analysis totaling nineteen baggies. The trial court found the motion raised a chain-of-custody issue and held it in abeyance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 35. At trial, defense counsel modified his argument from weight to amount, seeking to show that more marijuana baggies (nineteen) were submitted to the crime lab than were recovered from the house (nine). In support of his argument, defense counsel attempted to prove that only nine baggies of marijuana were shown in photographs taken by Sergeant Smith at the scene. On cross-examination, the following colloquy occurred between defense counsel and Captain Bridges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And Mr. Smith, in your presence, took the photographs of those things that you identified as bags containing a green leafy substance; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   [CAPTAIN BRIDGES]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Q: And he took photographs of every item or every bag that appeared to contain a green leafy substance; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   A: Yes, sir. I think Smith took all the photographs that day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   During the cross-examination of Sergeant Smith, defense counsel had him count every distinct baggie containing the \"green leafy substance\" that he could visibly identify from the photographs presented, which totaled nine baggies. However, Sergeant Smith testified there were \"baggies inside of the bigger baggies,\" and he was only testifying about the number of baggies clearly visible from the individual photographs. Sergeant Smith also confirmed that his report to the crime lab had a total of nineteen baggies submitted for testing. He testified in great detail as to what he submitted to the lab, as documented in his report, which totaled nineteen baggies: exhibit one was two clear plastic baggies; exhibit two was two large and five small baggies; and exhibit three was two large baggies and eight small baggies. Frazure, a forensic chemist at the crime lab, also testified about the submission of the same number of baggies for each exhibit, with a total net weight of 258.3 grams, which lab tests confirmed was marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 36. Despite this testimony, in Jackson's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, a new trial, he continued to argue that the evidence was unlawfully tampered with by members of the Narcotics Division of the Clarksdale Police Department, because more marijuana was submitted to the crime lab \"than was supposedly seized from the home.\" The motion stated that a witness, presumably Sergeant Smith, \"candidly admitted\" seizing nine baggies of marijuana but submitted nineteen baggies to the lab for testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 37. We are not persuaded by Jackson's argument of evidence tampering. There is no \"candid admission\" by any witness that only nine baggies of marijuana were seized from the house, only that nine baggies can be seen in the photographs. Further, Captain Bridges did not indisputably agree that a photograph was taken of every gram and baggie of marijuana, but merely that Sergeant Smith was the photographer that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 38. The fact that all of the baggies could not be seen from the photographs does not mean that nineteen baggies of marijuana were not recovered from the house. The testimony implies that the baggies collected were the same number of baggies tested. The testimony of Officers Bridges, Smith, and Frazier did not support evidence tampering. Rule 901(a) was satisfied; the green leafy substance was proven to be marijuana. Jackson does not meet his burden of proving evidence tampering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 39. Relatedly, Jackson argues that the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict because the statutory weight requirement was not met due to the alleged tampering of the marijuana. He also argues pro se that the State failed to meet its circumstantial-evidence burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 40. The relevant inquiry to the sufficiency of the evidence is whether, \"viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Bush v.

The State is allowed to prove crimes solely by circumstantial evidence,\n   but such evidence must be \"sufficient to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and to the exclusion of every reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence.\"\n   <em>\n    Fleming v.

Since we found Jackson's argument on evidence tampering without merit, this argument is without merit as well. The evidence showed over 250 grams of marijuana was seized from Jackson's residence. This evidence is sufficient to prove the weight requirement element beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 42. There was also sufficient evidence presented to support the jury's finding that Jackson possessed and intended to sell the marijuana. The drug was found throughout the house in various stages of being packaged-divided in multiple and different size baggies. Also seized was a package of sandwich baggies consistent with those used to store the marijuana at the residence, a blue plastic tray with a green leafy substance and residue, fifteen small clear plastic baggies (some with green leafy residue), one cloth bag with residue, a Walmart bag with residue, and a digital scale indicating Jackson was measuring the marijuana for sale. Further, the elaborate surveillance system on the modest house, complete with cameras, a DVR, and a live-feed flat-screen monitor, indicated Jackson was involved in the drug trade. During one of Jackson's recorded telephone calls at the police station played to the jury, Jackson told an individual to \"[g]o to the spot ... under that tub, is a green box. It got some racks in it, man. Get it. Go over there now man. You need to stop doing what you['re] doing now and go over there and get it.\" Possession of a large amount of money-hidden-also indicated Jackson was selling the marijuana. The jury was given the lesser-included offense instruction of simple possession but elected to convict Jackson of the greater crime. There was sufficient evidence for the jury to draw a reasonable inference of possession of marijuana with intent to sell, to the exclusion of every reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 43. Additionally, in his pro se brief, Jackson argues the State failed to prove he lived at the residence or constructively possessed the marijuana because officers did not see him entering or leaving the residence on the day of the search, and he denied having keys to the house. Even so, the State presented evidence to show that several utility bills were addressed to Jackson at the house's address.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, in the telephone calls from the police station, Jackson speaks of the house as his. Even though Jackson pointed to evidence showing he did not live at the residence, \"factual disputes are properly resolved by the jury ....\"\n   <em>\n    Moore v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9051626\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/859/379/#p385\">\n    859 So.2d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 385 (\u00b6 26) (Miss. 2003). A rational trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Jackson resided, and had dominion and control, over the residence at 343-B Bolivar Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Motion for Recusal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 44. Jackson contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for\n   recusal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jackson requested the trial judge recuse himself due to Jackson's involvement in a fight with a Coahoma County Sheriff's Department deputy in a prior case in 2006. Jackson claims he was assaulted by the deputy in front of the judge during his arraignment proceedings. The trial judge denied the motion, claiming he had no recollection of the altercation; therefore, it could not bear on his impartiality during Jackson's trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 45. Canon 3(E)(1)(a) of the Code of Judicial Conduct explains the rule concerning judicial disqualification: \"Judges should disqualify themselves in proceedings in which their impartiality might be questioned by a reasonable person knowing all the circumstances ... including but not limited to instances where ... the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party ....\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   UCRCCC Rule 1.15 (giving procedure for motions for recusal of judges). The decision to recuse is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, as long as the correct legal standards are consistently applied.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8357030\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/962/649/#p663\">\n    962 So.2d 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 663 (\u00b6 29) (Miss. Ct.

The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Jackson's request for recusal. The judge did not even recall the 2006 incident in the courtroom; therefore, a reasonable person would not question the judge's impartiality. Further, Jackson has provided no specific evidence to indicate the trial judge was biased or unqualified, except his own numerous speculative comments. The fact the judge ruled against him on certain motions or jury instructions is insufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8357030\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/962/649/#p663\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 31). The record does not indicate that the trial judge held any bias against Jackson during the trial or in his rulings. This issue is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Cumulative Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 47. Jackson argues that the cumulative effect of various errors deprived him of a fundamentally fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   The cumulative error doctrine stems from the doctrine of harmless error which holds that individual errors, which are not reversible in themselves, may combine with other errors to make up reversible error, where the cumulative effect of all errors deprives the defendant of a fundamentally fair trial. However, where there was no error in part, there can be no reversible error to the whole.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    Harris v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8361191\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/970/151/#p157\">\n    970 So.2d 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 157 (\u00b6 24) (Miss. 2007) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, since there were no errors, harmless or otherwise, there was no cumulative error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 48. Jackson, arguing pro se, claims one of his defense counsel was ineffective because counsel allegedly \"guaranteed\" that Jackson would not have to go to trial since the State would be unable to prove that he possessed marijuana. Additionally, he claims counsel incorrectly told him the marijuana obtained from the search warrant would be excluded, as would be the telephone calls made at the police station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 49. \"When a party raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on\n   direct appeal, the proper resolution is to deny relief without prejudice to the defendant's right to assert the same claim in a post-conviction relief proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Graves v.

Ct. App. 2005). This Court will \"reach the merits on an ineffective assistance of counsel issue on direct appeal only if '(1) the record affirmatively shows ineffectiveness of constitutional dimensions, or (2) the parties stipulate that the record is adequate to allow the appellate court to make the finding without consideration of the findings of fact of the trial judge.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8904305\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/914/788/#p798\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The record does not support Jackson's contentions or affirmatively show ineffectiveness of constitutional dimensions. Further, the parties have not entered any relevant stipulation. Accordingly, this Court denies relief without prejudice to Jackson's right to request permission to pursue the issue in a motion for post-conviction relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 50. Arguing pro se, Jackson claims the State committed prosecutorial misconduct. However, at trial his counsel made no such objections. It is well established that \"the failure to make a contemporaneous objection serves as a waiver of any error\" and is procedurally barred.\n   <em>\n    Washington v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8311734\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/957/426/#p429\">\n    957 So.2d 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 429 (\u00b6 13) (Miss. Ct. App. 2007). To avoid the procedural bar, Jackson argues that the prosecutor's conduct was \"so exceptionally flagrant that it constitute[d] plain error, and [could be] grounds for reversal even if the defendant did not object to it.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Carroll\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516142\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/26/1380/\">\n    26 F.3d 1380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1385 n.6 (6th Cir. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 51. Jackson discusses numerous witnesses he contends were allowed to present \"false testimony\" during various times, including Sergeant Smith at the grand jury proceedings, as well as prosecutorial misstatements made during opening and closing statements at trial, all of which allegedly prejudiced him. He argues against the admission of the State's \"false\" evidence and testimony showing he lived at the house, the nineteen baggies of marijuana, and his outstanding arrest warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 52. Prosecutors are allowed \"wide latitude\" in their arguments, \"limiting them not only to facts, but also to deductions and conclusions which may be drawn therefrom, and to the application of the law to those facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Holly v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11710101\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/716/979/#p988\">\n    716 So.2d 979\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 988 (\u00b6 33) (Miss. 1998). \"Even when a prosecutor has made an impermissible comment ... a showing of prejudice [is required] to warrant reversal.\"\n   <em>\n    Outerbridge v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8332851\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/947/279/#p286\">\n    947 So.2d 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 286 (\u00b6 23) (Miss. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 53. Here, the record does not indicate that the State presented any \"false evidence\"-Jackson's arguments about the residence, baggies of marijuana, and outstanding arrest warrant have all been previously discussed in other issues and found without merit. Moreover, prosecutors are not limited only to the facts, but any reasonable conclusions that can be drawn from them. Finally, the prosecutor's opening or closing statements contained no statements that were impermissible, \"exceptionally flagrant,\" or prejudicial to Jackson. This issue is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    IX. State's Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 54. Before trial, Jackson moved to suppress the evidence obtained by the issuance of the search warrant because it was allegedly issued unlawfully. Now, for the first time on appeal, Jackson argues pro se that the State knowingly used false evidence and \"perjured testimony\" at the pre-trial suppression hearing; therefore, the trial court should have suppressed the evidence. This argument is procedurally barred because it was not presented before\n   the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9217530\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/879/519/#p522\">\n    879 So.2d at 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 7). Moreover, it is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 55. Jackson claims Captain Bridges's testimony at the suppression hearing was false and Bridges later committed perjury at trial because his testimony \"changed\" to mislead the jury into believing Jackson was the only person who had access to the residence. Also, Jackson argues that he was arrested based on an invalid outstanding warrant. However, as previously discussed, the trial court denied Jackson's motion to suppress the evidence because the search was conducted under a valid warrant. Also, Jackson's arguments about false testimony are not supported by the record and are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    X. Confidential Informant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 56. Jackson argues pro se that the trial court erred in denying his request for disclosure of the CI's identity. However, it is well established that \"the disclosure of an informer who is not a material witness to the guilt or innocence of the accused, is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Breckenridge v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7603831\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/472/373/#p377\">\n    472 So.2d 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 377 (Miss. 1985). Here, the CI was not a material witness but alerted law enforcement to the fact that a large quantity of marijuana could be found in Jackson's residence. Therefore, disclosure of the CI's identity was not necessary, and this issue is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    XI. Sentence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 57. Jackson claims that the trial court abused its discretion in declining to reduce Jackson's sentence under Mississippi Code Annotated section 41-29-139(h) (Supp. 2014). This code section gives the trial judge discretion to mitigate a sentence by twenty-five percent or more, if the person is \"convicted of an offense under this section that requires the judge to impose a prison sentence which cannot be suspended or reduced and is ineligible for probation or parole ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7603831\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/472/373/#p377\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b6 58. Jackson was originally indicted as a non-violent habitual offender under section 99-19-81 and as a subsequent drug offender under section 41-29-147. However, the State later moved to amend the indictment, and an order was entered allowing Jackson to be sentenced under either section 99-19-81, or as a violent habitual offender section 99-19-83, meaning he could face a life sentence under the latter statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 59. Moreover, in June 2013, at the time Jackson committed the offense, the maximum sentence he could receive if convicted as a non-violent habitual and subsequent drug offender was sixty years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2041-29-139\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 41-29-139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), 41-29-147 (Rev. 2013). However, in 2014 the Legislature amended the drug-trafficking statute, and the maximum sentence for the same offense would be ten years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2041-29-139\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 41-29-139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)(2) (Supp. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 60. At the sentencing hearing, the State noted that it would agree to Jackson being sentenced under section 99-19-81, relieving him of a life sentence under section 99-19-83. Additionally, the State agreed that Jackson should receive the benefit of being sentenced under the amended sentencing statutes, reducing his potential sentence from sixty to ten years. Because the sentencing recommendations by the State were reasonable, the trial court decided not to reduce Jackson's sentence under section 41-29-139(h). We find no error in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 61.

Jackson requested the evidence be suppressed due to this weight discrepancy, which counsel claimed caused Jackson's initial charge to be elevated from a misdemeanor to a felony. Jackson was ultimately indicted for possession with intent to distribute more than thirty grams but less than one kilogram under section 41-29-139(b)(1), and Jackson's argument related to this issue focused more on the number of baggies, not the weight.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    As the State notes, however, on appeal Jackson is no longer raising a chain-of-custody issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    In his pro se brief, Jackson claims these utility bills, as well as his social-security card, were \"false evidence\" created by the district attorney, and the testimony by Captain Bridges and Sergeant Smith about finding these documents was false as well.
