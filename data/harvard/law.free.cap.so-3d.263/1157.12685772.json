Bilfinger's UM insurer was Starr Indemnity &amp; Liability Insurance Company. Plaintiff submitted a claim to Starr for compensation of his personal injuries and other damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Starr evaluated the claim, and in 2014 tendered two separate UM payments to Plaintiff totaling $45,000.00. Following these two payments, citing what it believed to be legitimate defenses regarding Plaintiff's pre-existing injuries and medical history, Starr refused to make any additional payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Plaintiff, claiming injuries and personal damages as a result of the accident, filed suit on August 27, 2015, against Starr seeking additional UM benefits. Plaintiff alleged his medical expenses alone exceeded the $45,000.00 amount tendered to him by Starr. Believing that Starr was acting in bad faith, Plaintiff supplemented his petition on January 26, 2017. He sought penalties and attorney fees under La.R.S. 22:1973 and La.R.S. 22:1892 for Starr's alleged bad faith refusal to pay his UM claim. Plaintiff's original petition had not included any allegations of bad faith on the part of Starr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In response to Plaintiff's supplemental and amended petition, Starr filed a peremptory exception of prescription. Starr maintained the bad faith claim was barred by the prescriptive period of one year from the time suit was filed seeking damages under the UM policy provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A hearing on the exception of prescription was heard on March 27, 2017. After considering the parties pre-trial briefs and listening to oral argument, the trial court requested further briefing. On April 20, 2017, the trial court ruled in favor of Starr and maintained its exception of prescription as to the bad faith claims asserted in Plaintiff's First Supplemental and Amending Petition. The bad faith claims were dismissed with prejudice and the court\n   designated that ruling as a final, appealable judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff appealed the trial court's judgment maintaining Starr's exception of prescription, asserting the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-12\">\n   1.

The trial court erred in finding that a claim for bad faith damages under an uninsured motorist policy is subject to a one-year statute of limitations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   3.

Unlike the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   case, the amended\n   pleading added new factual allegations of bad faith that were not previously called to Starr's attention. As Starr argued to the trial court, the amending petition elaborated on the factual setting set forth in the original petition. In situations such as that, the jurisprudence has not allowed the amending petition to relate back to the original petition and interrupt the running of prescription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Gunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7628315\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/439/437/\">\n    439 So.2d 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the issue was whether an amended petition that asserted, for the first time, the issue of the dangers of a lack of informed consent, related back to the original petition alleging surgical malpractice. The Louisiana Supreme Court discussed what Article 1153 requires, explaining as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Article 1153 requires only that the amending petition's thrust factually relate to the conduct, transaction or occurrence originally alleged. While the original petition did not mention lack of informed consent, the factual events during June 1976 of the consultations and defendant's advising plaintiff that surgery was necessary were explicitly set forth. The essence of interruption of prescription by suit is notice. Here, defendant had actual notice that judicial relief was being sought arising from that general factual situation of defendant's June 1977 conduct, and he thus was put on notice that his evidence concerning it should be collected and preserved. Both causes of action arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth in the original petition. Plaintiff will not be held to a burden of separating out in his initial pleading the defendant's actions during that month's medical service merely because two theories of recovery are possible out of that factual setting.\n   <strong>\n    The amending petition did not elaborate at all on the factual setting\n   </strong>\n   , and no challenge to its sufficiency was made; the factual allegations made originally met the notice requirement to defendant under art. 1153. The transaction or occurrence giving rise to the demand or object of the suit remained unchanged by the amendment, and, even if the state of facts which constitute the defendant's wrong differ [sic] enough so that two causes of action exist, the facts of the transaction which created both duties is [sic] similar enough to support a relation back of the amending petition under art. 1153.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7628315\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/439/437/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7628315\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/439/437/\">\n    at 440-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted) (emphasis added). In\n   <em>\n    Gunter\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court allowed the amending petition to relate back because it found \"it did not elaborate at all on the factual setting,\" and thus the factual allegations made originally met the notice requirement to defendant under Article 1153.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7628315\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/439/437/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7628315\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/439/437/\">\n    at 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is not the situation in the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In a similar situation, the appellate court in\n   <em>\n    Roba, Inc. v. Courtney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=09-508%20%28La.App.%201%20Cir.%208/10/10%29\">\n    09-508 (La.App. 1 Cir. 8/10/10)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038747\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/500/\">\n    47 So.3d 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , held that the plaintiff's claim for bad faith damages and attorney fees, first set forth in an amended petition, did not relate back to the filing of the original petition. The court in\n   <em>\n    Roba\n   </em>\n   noted \"the absence of any allegation in the [original] petition that the [defendants] intentionally and maliciously failed to perform their obligation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038747\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/500/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038747\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/500/\">\n    at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Roba\n   </em>\n   court determined, in the absence of allegations in the original petition asserting acts of bad faith on the part of the defendants, it was \"unable to find that the allegations of the [original] petition were sufficient to notify\" the defendants of the plaintiff's possible claim for bad faith damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038747\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/500/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038747\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/500/\">\n    at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Roba\n   </em>\n   court reasoned the amended petition could not relate back to the original pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We cannot say the trial court erred in finding the amending petition elaborated on the factual setting, because Plaintiff did not allege in his original petition any facts which would constitute acts of bad faith on\n   Starr's part. Thus, under Louisiana law the amending petition cannot relate back to the original petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As Starr notes, many of the cases cited by Plaintiff involved adding new parties in the amending petition, which is not applicable to this matter, as the parties were the same in both the original and amending petition. Other cases cited by Plaintiff do not address the legal issue of prescription of a bad faith claim. In\n   <em>\n    Guillory v. Lee\n   </em>\n   , 09-75 (La. 6/26/09),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7064335\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/16/1104/\">\n    16 So.3d 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Krygier v.

Applicable Prescriptive Period.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In his second assignment of error, Plaintiff asserts the trial court erred in finding his bad faith claims for penalties and attorney fees were subject to a one-year prescriptive period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   There are two statutes available to an insured to file suit against an insurer for bad faith damages; La.R.S. 22:1892 (penalties) and La.R.S. 22:1973 (attorney fees). Contrary to Plaintiff's arguments, these duties owed by the insurer are established by statute and are not rights derived by contract. As Starr notes, a third-party claimant can assert a bad faith claim against an insurer, even though no contract exists between the claimant and the insurer. Thus, a contract is not necessary to bring a bad faith claim against an insurer under Louisiana's penalty statutes. Accordingly, we find no merit in Plaintiff's argument that a ten-year prescriptive period is applicable here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Zidan v.

In that case, the plaintiff filed a claim against its insurer via a third-party demand, then added bad faith claims through an amending third-party demand. The Louisiana Supreme Court subsequently denied writs on the case.\n   <em>\n    Labarre v.

The opinion in\n   <em>\n    Aspen\n   </em>\n   is contrary to several federal cases, which found claims under La.R.S. 22:1973 are delictual in nature and subject to a liberative prescription of one year.

As Starr notes, neither the Louisiana Supreme Court nor this court have adopted the ruling in\n   <em>\n    Aspen\n   </em>\n   . Further, the Louisiana Supreme Court denied writs on the\n   <em>\n    Labarre\n   </em>\n   case, which applied a one-year prescriptive period to bad faith claims. Therefore, we find the trial court did not\n   err in finding a one-year prescriptive period applied to Plaintiff's bad faith claims against Starr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III. When did the Prescriptive Period Begin to Run?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In his final assignment of error, Plaintiff contends prescription did not begin to run upon the filing of the original petition. Plaintiff now argues Starr was not in bad faith in 2014 or when suit was originally filed in August of 2015; but the acts of bad faith did not occur until 2016. However, the record does not support this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The facts reveal Plaintiff was aware of the UM payments, in the amount of $45,000.00, made to him in 2014, despite the fact that Plaintiff maintained his injuries suffered from the accident (which Starr has always denied) required surgery and medical expenses well in excess of $45,000.00. Plaintiff has acknowledged he was forced to bring his suit in August of 2015, because his \"medical expenses alone exceeded the tenders made by Starr.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Prescription begins when a plaintiff obtains actual or constructive knowledge of facts indicating to a reasonable person that he or she is a victim of a tort.\n   <em>\n    Campo v.

However, as Starr notes the decision to dispute medical causation and cease unconditional payments has remained the same since Plaintiff filed suit in August 2015. By that time (and actually earlier in 2014), Starr had already disputed the full nature and extent of Plaintiff's alleged damages and refused to make additional payments based on the medical causation defense. The trial court stated in its reasons for judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   At some point after September 15, 2014, Starr denied any further liability to Plaintiff, as evidenced by its ceasing of payments. That denial, at the latest, was known to Plaintiff on August 26, 2015 when Plaintiff was required to file suit against Starr. The original suit was timely filed less than a year after the last\n   <em>\n    McDill\n   </em>\n   tender. Therefore, when the original suit was filed, the one-year prescription on the bad faith tort claim had not run. However, as of August 27, 2016, more than a year after Plaintiff was required to file suit, and with no additional payments having been made, the bad faith tort claim prescribed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We find no merit in Plaintiff's contention that the prescriptive period on the bad faith claims did not begin running on the date of the filing of the original petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    DECREE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the lower court granting the exception of prescription is affirmed.

Plaintiff alleged his medical expenses alone exceeded the $45,000.00 amount tendered to him by Starr. Asserting that Starr was acting in bad faith, Plaintiff supplemented his petition on January 26, 2017, to seek penalties and attorney fees pursuant to La.R.S. 22:1973 and La.R.S. 22:1892 for Starr's alleged bad faith refusal to pay his UM claim. Plaintiff's original petition had not included any allegations of bad faith on the part of Starr.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    In response, Starr filed a peremptory exception of prescription, maintaining the bad faith claim was barred by the prescriptive period of one year from the time suit was filed seeking damages under the UM policy provisions. The trial court ruled in favor of Starr and maintained the exception of prescription as to the bad faith claims asserted in Plaintiff's First Supplemental and Amending Petition. The bad faith claims were dismissed with prejudice, and the court designated that ruling as a final, appealable judgment. In our previous opinion, we held the trial court did not err in finding a one-year prescriptive period applied to Plaintiff's bad faith claims against Starr.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      I.

In\n    <em>\n     Zidan\n    </em>\n    the plaintiff, Ali Zidan was a guest passenger in a vehicle driven by Mohammed Rawashdeh and insured by Liberty Lloyds. That vehicle was involved in a collision on September 17, 1990, with a vehicle driven by Richard Bengston and insured by USAA Property and Casualty Insurance Company. Zidan filed suit against Bengston and his insurer, USAA, as well as Rawashdeh and his insurer, Liberty Lloyds. That suit was not filed until September 18, 1991, one year and one day from the date of the injury. Thus, on its face the action had prescribed. Liberty Lloyds filed a peremptory exception of prescription. Zidan contended his action had not prescribed because Liberty Lloyds misrepresented or concealed the fact that coverage existed on Rawashdeh's vehicle in violation of a duty imposed by La.R.S. 22:1220 [now La.R.S. 22:1973 ]. The trial court granted the insurer's exception of prescription.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    On appeal, Zidan again argued the tort claims had not prescribed because the insurer concealed the fact coverage existed in violation of La.R.S. 22:1220. The plaintiff argued this violation triggered the application of\n    <em>\n     contra non valentum\n    </em>\n    , preventing the running of prescription on the underlying tort claim. The first circuit recognized the plaintiff's tort claims and bad faith claims arose separately and were, in fact, two separate claims. The court noted the tort claim could have prescribed even though the bad faith claim could still be viable. The\n    <em>\n     Zidan\n    </em>\n    court did not specifically address the applicable prescriptive period for a bad faith claim, but found only the alleged violation of La.R.S. 22:1220 did not toll prescription of the plaintiff's tort claim. The failure of the plaintiff in\n    <em>\n     Zidan\n    </em>\n    was that he failed to timely file\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      any tort claim\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    against any insurer and was attempting to \"piggy-back\" his underlying tort claim to his bad faith claim.\n    <em>\n     Zidan\n    </em>\n    has since been extended by several federal courts to hold that the one-year prescriptive period applies to all bad faith claims brought under La.R.S. 22:1973 and La.R.S. 22:1892. Other federal courts have distinguished\n    <em>\n     Zidan\n    </em>\n    on the grounds it involved a third-party claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    In 1998, the appellate court in\n    <em>\n     We Sell Used Cars, Inc. v.

In 2015, the federal court in\n    <em>\n     Aspen Specialty Insurance Co. v.

The\n    <em>\n     Aspen Specialty\n    </em>\n    court set forth the following analysis:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n    It is logical that the claim by a third-party to an insurance contract against an insurer would be classified as a tort and subject to the one-year prescriptive period for delictual actions, but it is not logical that a first-party claim, that is, a claim by an insured against its insurer, would be classified as a delictual claim. A first-party claim arises out of the relationship created by the insurance contract and, therefore, is either contractual or quasi-contractual in nature. Indeed, Section 1973 \"recognizes the jurisprudentially established duty of good faith and fair dealing owed to the insured, which is an outgrowth of the contractual and fiduciary relationship between the insured and the insurer.\" Both contractual and quasi-contractual claims are classified, under Louisiana law, as personal actions subject to a liberative prescription of ten years.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Later that same year in\n    <em>\n     Prudhomme v.

To do so would potentially force plaintiff attorneys to file suit in order to protect their client's interests against a UM carrier within the one-year period from the accident or the date the defendant possibly acted in bad faith, even though the two-year prescriptive period on the underlying claim has not run. It would also require a plaintiff to \"pierce the corporate mind\" of the insurer to determine a \"fixed\" date when the bad faith occurred to avoid the short one-year prescriptive period as opposed to relying on the cumulation of acts or failure to act by the insurer over the course of time.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Mentz Construction Services, Inc. v.

The plaintiff in\n    <em>\n     Zidan\n    </em>\n    argued that the claim had not prescribed because an insurer had misrepresented or concealed the fact that coverage existed, in violation of the penalty statute. Thus, the claim asserted was a third-party claim and not a claim by an insured against his own insurer. None of the cases cited by Evanston analyze the basis for the ruling in\n    <em>\n     Zidan\n    </em>\n    or use any reasoning to reach the conclusion that the one-year prescriptive period is equally applicable when an insured asserts a bad faith claim against its insurer.

A first-party claim arises out of the relationship created by the insurance contract and, therefore, is either contractual or quasi-contractual in nature. Indeed, Section 1973 \"recognizes the jurisprudentially established duty of good faith and fair dealing owed to the insured, which is an outgrowth of the contractual and fiduciary relationship between the insured and the insurer.\" Both contractual and quasi-contractual claims are classified, under Louisiana law, as personal actions subject to a liberative prescription of ten years.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n    Second, at least two Louisiana appellate court decisions have applied a ten-year prescriptive period to Section 1892 claims, one of which came out of the same circuit that decided the\n    <em>\n     Zidan\n    </em>\n    case.

However, in this case the bad faith alleged was Starr's unconditional tender of only $45,000.00, a sum not even sufficient to cover Plaintiff's medical expenses. The obligation to insure Plaintiff from the harm suffered in the accident is an outgrowth of the contractual and fiduciary relationship of good faith required of the insurer in its dealings with its insured.

In this case, Plaintiff's \"bad faith\" claims are derived from the obligations Starr assumed by nature of the insurance contract between the two parties--a duty the Louisiana Supreme Court stated \"is an outgrowth of the contractual and fiduciary relationship between the insured and insurer.\"\n    <em>\n     Theriot\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11980851\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/694/184/#p187\">\n     694 So.2d at 187\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Accordingly, the ten-year prescriptive period applies, and the trial court erred in dismissing Plaintiff's bad faith claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, on rehearing we reverse our earlier ruling, affirming the trial court's judgment holding the one-year prescriptive set forth in La.Civ.Code art. 3492 is applicable to Plaintiff's bad faith claims. We find the UM insurer's duty of good faith arises out of the contract of insurance between the two parties; and, thus, is subject to the ten-year prescriptive period of La.Civ.Code art. 3499. Accordingly, the trial court's judgment finding Plaintiff's bad faith claims have prescribed is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    <strong>\n     MOTION FOR REHEARING GRANTED; REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-90\">\n     Several interested parties were granted permission to file amicus briefs, both in support of, and in opposition to, Plaintiff's motion for rehearing.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
