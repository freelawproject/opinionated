State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12353385\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/212/546/\">\n    212 So.3d 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 1st DCA 2017). However, the Florida Supreme Court quashed our decision in this case and remanded for reconsideration in light of its decision in\n   <em>\n    Miller v. State\n   </em>\n   , 43 Fla. L. Weekly S426 (Fla. Oct. 4, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , 43 Fla. L. Weekly S426, the supreme court held that consecutive mandatory minimum sentences for multiple firearm offenses are impermissible where there are not multiple victims or multiple injuries to a single victim and approved the decision of the Fifth District Court of Appeal in\n   <em>\n    Torres-Rios v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12181656\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/205/883/\">\n    205 So.3d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 5th DCA 2016). We, therefore, determine that appellant was illegally sentenced to consecutive mandatory minimum sentences for attempted murder in the second degree and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We quash the consecutive mandatory minimum sentences and instruct the trial court on remand to enter an order imposing the mandatory minimums to run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sentencing QUASHED and REMANDED for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Wolf, Lewis, and Roberts, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
