Hoffman, Jr. The judgment arose following a trial by jury and in accordance with the jury verdict. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 21, 2008, Plaintiff John Mantiply underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee to repair a torn meniscus. The surgery was performed by Defendant Joseph Hoffman, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon working as an independent contractor at the Veterans Administration (VA) Hospital. Days after the surgery, John began experiencing pain, swelling, and drainage in his left knee, causing him to return to the VA Hospital multiple times. John was seen by numerous doctors at the VA Hospital, though Dr. Hoffman remained his primary provider post-surgery until June 9, 2008, when Dr. Hoffman aspirated and cultured the fluid from John's left knee and injected the knee with cortisone on the same day without awaiting the results of the culture. Hospital records from the VA do not show an official diagnosis regarding the cause of John's knee problems. On June 26, 2008, John met with Dr. Michael Brunet, an orthopedic surgeon at Mid-State Orthopedic Clinic, regarding his continuing leg pain and lack of mobility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The sequence of events leading up to the June 9, 2008 aspiration and cortisone injection and the current suit are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 May 21, 2008: John has arthroscopic surgery performed by Dr. Hoffman at the VA Hospital to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 May 26, 2008: John presented to the Emergency Room (ER) at the VA Hospital, reporting redness, swelling, and bleeding from his left knee. The attending ER physician, Dr. Fitzgerald, aspirated 12ml of fluid from the knee and prescribed the antibiotic amoxicillin.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 May 27, 2008: John followed up with Dr. Hoffman, who examined the knee and noted clear drainage from the needle site. No diagnosis was given, though Dr. Hoffman recommended John continue with his prescribed amoxicillin and return for his regularly scheduled follow-up appointment on May 29.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 May 29, 2008: John returns to the orthopedic clinic to see Dr. Hoffman, relating constant pain in his knee, though there was no more fluid drainage at that time. That evening, however, John returned to the ER complaining of drainage from the surgical site and again saw Dr. Fitzgerald, who noted no redness or swelling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 May 30, 2008: John called the ER Department at the VA twice complaining of excess fluid draining from his knee. John did not present to the ER for his symptoms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 June 4, 2008: John returned to the VA for a scheduled appointment but was sent to the ER and seen by Dr. Del Valle due to swelling and continued pain in his left knee. X-Rays were taken that revealed a supra patella effusion and soft tissue swelling. John's knee was wrapped in an ace bandage, and he was discharged with instructions to keep the leg elevated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 June 5, 2008: John again returned to the orthopedic clinic for a follow-up appointment with Dr. Hoffman, where Dr. Hoffman noted continued drainage of clear fluid from John's left knee. Dr. Hoffman ordered a complete blood count (CBC) on this date and his notes state that this was a \"very strange course of events.\" Dr. Hoffman renewed John's prescription for amoxicillin, though no official diagnosis was noted in the records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 June 7, 2008: John presented to the ER complaining of sharp pains and\n   severe burning in his left knee. Dr. Fitzgerald noted no redness or swelling and recommended John follow-up with Dr. Hoffman.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 June 8, 2008: John experienced a syncopal episode where he lost consciousness due to the pain in his knee and was admitted to the VA Hospital. A second CBC was ordered, which showed a higher white blood count (WBC) than the previous test. Dr. Clement, who saw John during this visit, also ordered that his \"Sed rate\" and uric acid level be checked.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 June 9, 2008: While still in the hospital, John was examined by Dr. Hoffman. Dr. Hoffman did an arthrocentesis, in which he aspirated fluid from John's knee, and submitted the fluid for culture. Before the results of that culture were received, Dr. Hoffman also injected cortisone into John's knee to help with pain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 June 10, 2008: Still hospitalized, John reported no complaints of pain in his knee to his internist, Dr. Ganji, who was treating him for the syncopal episode. Dr. Ganji ordered a CBC, which showed a higher WBC than the test done on June 8, and ordered John to be placed on Clindamycin, a potent antibiotic.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 June 11, 2008: John's WBC count was notably lower than the previous day, and he was released from the ER. The culture from June 9 came back showing a small number of staphylococcus aureus organisms, i.e. the results of the synovial fluid culture was positive for trace amounts of staph. John claims it is during this hospital stay that he first noticed the restriction of mobility in his left knee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 June 19, 2008: John reported to the orthopedic clinic to see Dr. Hoffman, stating that his knee had become locked, though he reported no pain in the leg. Dr. Hoffman advised John to continue his prescription of Clindamycin and to return in three weeks. No official diagnosis regarding the ongoing issues with John's knee is ever recorded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The June 19, 2008 appointment is the last encounter John has with Dr. Hoffman. Within a week of that appointment, John met with Dr. Brunet, who urgently advised him to seek additional treatment as the possibility of infection was serious. John returned to Dr. Brunet the next month for continuing knee issues, at which time Dr. Brunet suspected either a chronic infected knee or gouty synovitis. Eventually, Dr. Brunet performed a synovectomy surgery on July 23, 2008 on John's left knee, noting a thickening of the synovial lining. The mobility in John's left leg purportedly did not return, an assertion challenged by the defense at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Trial by jury commenced October 10, 2017. Three medical experts testified at trial. Following deliberations on October 13, 2017, the jury returned a ten-to-two verdict in favor of Dr. Hoffman, finding that Plaintiffs failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Dr. Hoffman deviated from the standard of care of a reasonably prudent orthopedic surgeon in his post-surgical treatment of John, thus awarding Plaintiffs no damages. Specifically, the jury answered \"NO\" to question one of the jury interrogatories: \"Do nine (9) or more of you find by a preponderance of the evidence, that Dr. Joseph Hoffman, Jr. breached the applicable standard of care in his treatment of John Mantiply?\" A formal judgment was signed October 20, 2017. Plaintiffs timely moved for a Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict (JNOV), which was denied. Plaintiffs seek appellate review of the jury's verdict, alleging\n   that it is predicated on manifestly erroneous factual findings because there was no competent evidence in the record to support the jury's interpretation of the facts. Dr. Hoffman answered the appeal asserting that the trial court erred in denying his peremptory exception of prescription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Exception of Prescription\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In answer to this appeal, Dr. Hoffman asserts that the trial court erred in denying his exception of prescription. Therein, Dr. Hoffman declares that the claim against him directly, filed for the first time by an amended complaint in federal court on June 9, 2011, was untimely as not having been filed within a year of the purported malpractice or at the least from one year of discovery of the act. As a finding that the claim at hand has prescribed would render the rest of the appeal moot, we will address Dr. Hoffman's exception of prescription first. In Louisiana, delictual actions shall be brought within one year of the event causing injury. La.Civ.Code art. 3492. A hearing on the exception was held on June 13, 2016, and reasons for judgment were handed down on July 1, 2016, denying the exception. A formal judgment to that effect was signed on July 28, 2016. Dr. Hoffman thereafter applied to this court for a writ of review, which was denied.\n   <em>\n    Mantiply, et al. v.

The events leading to the current suit took place between May 21, 2008 and June 9, 2008. Dr. Hoffman was first named as a defendant in Plaintiffs' amended complaint on June 9, 2011. As noted by Dr. Hoffman, this is clearly outside of the allotted time period for filing such an action. Further, \"in all events such claims shall be filed at the latest within a period of three years from the date of the alleged act, omission, or neglect.\" La.R.S. 9:5628(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs initially began administrative proceedings in March 2010 against the United States of America and the VA and formally filed suit in federal court on December 19, 2010.

Upon being notified that Dr. Hoffman was not qualified under the Louisiana Medical Malpractice Act as he was only licensed in Georgia and New York, John and his wife filed suit against Dr. Hoffman on August 15, 2011. Dr. Hoffman filed an exception of prescription, noting that La.R.S. 9:5628(A) requires that medical malpractice suits be brought within one year, and at no point more than three years, from the date of the acts causing injury. Further, in actions commenced in an incompetent court or improper venue, prescription is only interrupted as to the defendant who is served within the prescriptive period. La.Civ.Code art. 3462.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The trial court denied Dr. Hoffman's exception of prescription, finding the principle of\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem\n   </em>\n   applied. It is important to note that despite the wording of La.R.S. 9:5628(A), both the one-year and three-year time limitations contained in the statute are prescriptive, not preemptive.\n   <em>\n    Borel v.

Plaintiffs argue that their ignorance regarding Dr. Hoffman's employment relationship with the VA was not willful or inexcusably negligent but was reasonable in light of the circumstances, and they introduced exhibits into the record\n   at trial to show this.

Dr. Hoffman,\n   in contrast, consistently testified that he believed John's knee problems to be the result of synovitis caused by gout. Dr. Brunet testified that even if gout was suspected, in cases of differential diagnoses, the potential infection should have been confirmed and/or treated first, as it would be the more serious threat. Dr. Brunet stated that the fluid aspirated from John's knee on his first return to the VA after surgery should have been cultured, and that bloodwork and investigation was required by the standard of care as early as May 29, 2008. He testified that the standard of care mandates that culture results from the aspirate should have been obtained before injecting a potentially infected knee with cortisone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Dr. Foster testified that the standard of care required a recognition of the possibility of infection, motivating an aspiration and culture with at least some form of treatment, such as a washout or debridement. Dr. Foster further stated that an administration of intravenous antibiotics until infection was ruled out by a culture of the knee fluid would have been the applicable standard. However, Dr. Foster agreed that an injection of cortisone and Marcaine, as given to John by Dr. Hoffman, is consistent with a diagnosis of gout and treatment thereof. All three experts agreed that knowingly injecting cortisone into an infected knee is a serious breach of the standard of care required by physicians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Breach\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In order to recover, Plaintiffs must have not only established the standard of care, but they had the burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that said standard was breached by Dr. Hoffman in his treatment of John.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Browning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9292931\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/865/795/\">\n    865 So.2d 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

All three testifying medical experts agreed that injecting an infected knee with cortisone, as Dr. Hoffman did to John's knee on June 9, 2008, would be a significant breach of the requisite standard of care, and both Drs. Brunet and Foster opined that Dr. Hoffman's injection of cortisone without the benefit of a bacterial culture confirming that the knee was not infected was, likewise, a breach.

However, the dates written in this report do not match the dates of treatment on John's medical records. Specifically, the culture of the fluid aspirated from John's knee containing trace amounts of bacteria was not received until after the injection of cortisone. Further, the culture's results do not conclusively prove that John's knee was infected at the time of the injection. Dr. Brunet noted, when he examined John's knee on June 23, 2008, that he was unsure if John's symptoms were caused by a chronic infectious synovitis or gouty synovitis. He did not mention his own potential breach of the standard of care during his treatment of John when he also injected cortisone into John's knee to ease pain before testing for infection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Dr. Foster's testimony regarding Dr. Hoffman's potential breach of the standard of care centered mainly around Dr. Hoffman's failure to diagnose infection of the knee as the cause of John's problems and failure to take measures consistent with that diagnosis. Dr. Foster stated that Dr. Hoffman deviated from the standard of care by not recognizing the signs and symptoms of a possible infection and by injecting cortisone without awaiting the results of the culture taken immediately prior. He testified that it was error to not actively consider infection as the cause of John's issues. He opined that Dr. Hoffman erred by not interpreting John's WBC as a sign of worsening infection, even though those numbers were improving at the time of the cortisone injection. Plaintiffs assert the decreased count was attributable to the in-hospital administration of antibiotics John received, rather than a sign that the knee was not infected; although John did not take any of his prescribed antibiotics while not admitted to the VA and his knee was shown to be free of infection at the time of Dr. Brunet's surgery some six weeks later. Even Dr. Foster testified that it would be highly unlikely that a knee joint infection would have resolved itself on its own before the surgery performed by Dr. Brunet in this time period and further that the dosage of antibiotics given to John at the VA was unlikely to have been an effective dose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Dr. Hoffman, who was also certified as an expert witness by the trial court, maintained throughout trial and this appeal that John was not suffering from an infected knee, but rather from an episode of gout, with which he had a history of problems. Though such a diagnosis cannot be found written in any of John's relevant medical records, Dr. Hoffman's injection of cortisone and Marcaine into John's knee after his continued complaints of pain was consistent with a diagnosis of gout, as confirmed by Dr. Foster. Dr. Foster noted that if John's knee had been infected when it was injected with cortisone, he most likely would have lost his leg at that time, rather than have the improvement in his condition that actually resulted.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   The jurisprudence of this state confirms that a general physician or surgeon is not required to exercise the highest degree of care possible.

We are not to disturb those findings in the absence of clear error, even if other conclusions\n   from the same evidence are equally reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Matthews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7634429\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/467/1238/\">\n    467 So.2d at 1243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The jury heard all of the expert testimony, made determinations based upon the credibility of said expert testimony, and found Dr. Hoffman did not breach the standard of care. Where there is conflicting expert testimony, the jury's decision to credit the testimony of one witness of two or more should not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of manifest error.\n   <em>\n    Bellard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8380108\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/980/654/#p672\">\n    980 So.2d 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on our thorough review of the record, we find that two permissible views of the evidence exist, as shown by the conflicting expert testimony. As such, we cannot say that the jury was manifestly erroneous or clearly wrong in finding that Plaintiffs failed to prove that Dr. Hoffman breached the standard of care, as is required by La.R.S. 9:2794 in order to prevail in such instances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7548305\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/549/840/\">\n    549 So.2d 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Having concluded that the jury was not manifestly erroneous in their finding, we do not consider to what extent Plaintiffs suffered damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    DISPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In accordance with the foregoing, we affirm the ruling of the trial court, dismissing the claims of John and Melissa Mantiply against Dr. Joseph I. Hoffman, Jr. All costs of this appeal are assessed to John and Melissa Mantiply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
