Michael and Vickie Kansler moved to Mississippi from New York for Michael's job and, over the following years, exercised stock options stemming from that employment. The Kanslers took the position that the stock options' income was taxable only in Mississippi, which reduced their tax burden significantly. New York saw things differently and found a substantial portion of the income taxable by it. This liability to another state would have\n   entitled the Kanslers to a credit on their Mississippi taxes worth more than $250,000-but by the time the New York audit was finished, our statute of limitations barred the Kanslers from amending their Mississippi returns. They now argue our statute of limitations unconstitutionally discriminates against interstate commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. Mississippi's treatment of the statute of limitations for amending tax returns is unremarkable and appears to be shared with many other states.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Kanslers' dormant Commerce Clause argument, on the other hand, is novel. And it depends on an unprecedented and erroneous attempt to apply the \"internal consistency test,\" intended to evaluate the apportionment of taxes, to the collateral effects of a statute of limitations. We hold that the challenge is instead governed by the discrimination/\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   balancing test employed by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Bendix Autolite Corp. v.

While\n   <em>\n    Bendix\n   </em>\n   and its ilk offer little guidance-Justice Scalia famously compared the\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   balancing test to trying to decide \"whether a particular line is longer than a particular rock is heavy\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   -the Kanslers' challenge fails because our statute of limitations is facially nondiscriminatory and has only an incidental effect on interstate commerce, one that is justified by the practical difficulties of tax administration and the State's interest in finality. The Kanslers bear the burden of proving otherwise, so any uncertainty must be resolved against their challenge. We affirm the Mississippi Department of Revenue's decision to refuse the refund request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. This case comes up on summary judgment. The facts are not disputed, and the following facts are drawn from the facts stipulated in the chancery court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Michael Kansler worked for Entergy in New York, and he received stock options as part of his compensation. The Kanslers lived in New York until they were relocated to Mississippi in May 2007. During 2008 and 2009, Michael was still employed by Entergy in Mississippi. The Kanslers timely filed their Mississippi tax returns for the 2008 and 2009 tax years and paid taxes on their worldwide income, as required by Mississippi law. Some of that income derived from Michael's stock options. The stock options had been granted over several years before the Kanslers\n   moved to Mississippi. The options vested over multiple years, including after the Kanslers moved to Mississippi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. In 2012, New York began an audit of the Kanslers' taxes related to the exercise of stock options in 2008, 2009, and 2010. On December 29, 2014, New York completed the audit and assessed the Kanslers additional tax and interest. The Kanslers paid the assessment on December 31, 2014. In January 2015, the Kanslers filed amended Mississippi tax returns and requested a refund of $257,140 based on the credit allowed for income taxes paid to other states.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Mississippi Department of Revenue denied the refund request because it was outside of the three-year limitations period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Kanslers appealed to the Department's Board of Review and then to the Mississippi Board of Tax Appeals, both of which affirmed the Department's decision. The Kanslers challenged the constitutionality of the limitations period in both appeals, but each body affirmed the Department's decision based on the text of the statute without considering its constitutionality. The Kanslers then appealed to the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, arguing that the limitations period under Section 27-7-313 violates the Commerce, Due Process, and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution, and that the Department's actions were arbitrary, capricious, and beyond its statutory authority. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The chancellor granted the Department's motion and denied the Kanslers' motion, finding that the refund limitations period does not violate the United States Constitution. The Kanslers appeal from that judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6.

The Kanslers argue Mississippi's three-year statute of limitations for amending a taxpayer's return impermissibly burdens interstate commerce because it does not give taxpayers enough time to amend a Mississippi tax return after an audit by another state, which can take far longer than three years. They contend that this violates the negative or dormant aspect of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution because in-state taxpayers do not suffer the same difficulty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The Kanslers contend that our statute fails the internal consistency test because taxpayers with income from other states will suffer more from our statute of limitations than taxpayers whose income is derived solely from Mississippi. The Kanslers apparently prefer the internal consistency test because, unlike the other\n   <em>\n    Complete Auto\n   </em>\n   prongs or the traditional discrimination/balancing test, it makes no allowance for balancing the state's interest against the impact on interstate commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 26.

Nor does the statute of limitations here categorically deny the Kanslers' eligibility for the tax credit; they could have asked for it in their original tax return, and after that they had three years to amend their returns.
