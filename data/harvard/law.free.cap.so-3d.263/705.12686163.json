(\"the child\"). The parents filed a notice of appeal from a judgment of the Blount Circuit Court (\"the circuit court\"), denying a petition\n   for the writ of habeas corpus filed by the parents, who sought the return of custody of the child. The resolution of this appeal requires a recitation of the procedural history of the actions regarding the custody of the child that were filed in the circuit court and in the Blount Juvenile Court (\"the juvenile court\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Blount County Department of Human Resources (\"DHR\") became involved with the family after receiving a report that the parents were abusing and distributing controlled substances. DHR filed a dependency petition in the juvenile court. The record contains a March 31, 2016, order in case number JU-16-78.01, in which the juvenile court awarded temporary custody of the child to DHR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nearly one year later, the parents filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the circuit court, which, as amended, reads, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"All of the proceedings in [the dependency action in the juvenile court] involving [the child] are void and to no effect. [The child] was a resident of Tennessee at the time [DHR filed the dependency] petition. Neither the Blount County Department of Human Resources nor the Juvenile Court of Blount County, Alabama[,] has any jurisdiction over [the child]. He has never been a resident of Alabama. [Section] 12-15-114, Ala. Code (1975)[,] does not provide such jurisdiction. Subsection (a) applies only to children who are residents or are present in the state at the time the petition is filed. [The child] is not subject to jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of subsection (c)(1).\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The record contains a transcript of a hearing conducted by the circuit court on March 21, 2017, after which the circuit court entered a judgment denying the parent's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The parents filed a notice of appeal of the judgment of the circuit court. \"Although none of the parties has addressed the issue, this court must determine whether it has jurisdiction over this appeal.
