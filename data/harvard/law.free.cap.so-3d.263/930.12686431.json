He was adjudicated a third felony offender and was sentenced to life imprisonment without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. He now appeals his sentence, arguing that he should have been sentenced as a second felony offender under the 2017 changes to La. R.S. 15:529.1, and, in the alternative, that his sentence is excessive. For the reasons that follow, we affirm defendant's habitual offender sentence and remand the matter for correction of the sentencing minute entry and the Uniform Commitment Order as set forth herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 13, 2015, the St. John the Baptist Parish District Attorney filed a bill of information charging defendant, Henri Pierre Lyles, with aggravated battery in violation of La. R.S. 14:34. After a jury trial on November 15-16, 2016, defendant was convicted of aggravated battery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Lyles\n   </em>\n   , 17-405 (La.

On November 18, 2016, the State filed a habitual offender bill of information against defendant, alleging that he was a third felony offender with a 1991\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   predicate conviction of distribution of cocaine and a 2004 predicate conviction of manslaughter. The hearing on defendant's habitual offender bill was held on February 13, 2017. During the course of this hearing, the trial court sentenced defendant for the aggravated battery conviction to eight years imprisonment with the Department of Corrections and imposed a $1,000 fine.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12663981\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/239/1055/#p1056\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After an evidentiary hearing on the habitual offender bill, the trial court found defendant to be a third felony offender and sentenced him to life imprisonment without the benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence in accordance with La. R.S. 15:529.1(A)(3)(b). Defendant filed a motion to reconsider his sentence, which the trial court denied. Defendant's original appeal followed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12663981\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/239/1055/#p1056\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On original appeal, this Court found that the trial court failed to vacate defendant's original sentence for aggravated battery before imposing defendant's habitual offender sentence. As a result, it vacated defendant's habitual offender sentence of life imprisonment without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence as a third felony offender and remanded the matter for resentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Prior to the imposition of defendant's habitual offender sentence, defense counsel argued that defendant should be sentenced under the \"new\" habitual offender statute, which would reduce his sentencing range as a third felony offender. Defense counsel argued that current law was applicable since defendant's previous habitual offender sentence was vacated. The State responded that the Louisiana Supreme Court has held that the habitual offender law in effect at the time of the commission of the charged offense is applicable to a habitual offender. The trial court agreed with the State's position and stated that it would note the defense's\n   objection. The trial court then vacated defendant's original sentence of eight years in the Department of Corrections, recognizing that the State had met its burden of proof during the habitual offender proceeding, and sentenced defendant to life imprisonment without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. On March 28, 2018, defendant filed a timely motion for appeal, which was granted on March 29, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The facts set forth in this Court's published opinion are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant and Imani Wilson met in 1992 and were involved in a relationship off and on for several years. In 2014, Ms. Wilson agreed to allow defendant to stay with her for a limited period of time. In January 2015, Ms. Wilson asked defendant to leave and offered to help him find work and a new residence. On February 1, 2015, defendant, Ms. Wilson, and her two (2) children from another relationship were at Ms. Wilson's home, and defendant informed Ms. Wilson that he would move out that week. That same day, while Ms. Wilson was in the kitchen cooking, defendant began staring at her and continued to do so for an extended period. Eventually, Ms. Wilson asked defendant why he was staring at her, and he did not respond. Because defendant continued to stare at her, she became nervous and warned her children who were home that they should call 9-1-1 if they heard anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   After some time had passed, defendant began to approach Ms. Wilson and grabbed her by the throat with his left hand while simultaneously reaching for a knife with his other hand. Ms. Wilson pried defendant's fingers from her throat and ran from him. She fell and defendant held her down and grabbed her around the throat again. Defendant attempted to stab Ms. Wilson, and she tried to block the knife. She eventually blacked out and could not remember additional details. One of Ms. Wilson's children heard the commotion and called 9-1-1. The police arrived at the house before defendant was able to get away and arrested him for aggravated battery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    State v. Lyles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12663981\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/239/1055/#p1056\">\n    239 So.3d at 1056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER ONE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In his first assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred in sentencing him as a third felony offender. Defendant argues that he should have been sentenced as a second felony offender under the 2017 legislative changes to La. R.S. 15:529.1, the habitual offender statute. According to defendant, the language of 2017 La. Acts No. 282, effective November 1, 2017, applies to him since his conviction did not become final until February 21, 2018, the date this Court rendered its decision in his first appeal. Defendant suggests that under these new provisions, he is a second felony offender since more than five years elapsed between the expiration of correctional supervision of his 1991 predicate conviction of distribution of cocaine and the commission of the underlying offense of aggravated battery. He asserts that the ameliorative provisions of Act 282 applied to his case, and as such, his mandatory sentence of life imprisonment would drastically be reduced as he would thus face a sentencing range of 3.3 to 20 years imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The State responds that despite the language of Act 282, the legislature has recently clarified that the courts should apply the version of the habitual offender statute in effect at the time of the commission of the underlying offense. The State\n   relies on the 2018 amendment to the habitual offender statute, subsection K, in support of this contention and argues that subsection K removes the prior confusion over the applicability of the 2017 amendments to those offenders whose cases were still on direct review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2017, the habitual offender statute, La. R.S. 15:529.1, was amended by 2017 La. Acts No. 257, \u00a7 1 and 2017 La. Acts No. 282, \u00a7 1. Acts 257 and 282 both explicitly provide that their provisions \"shall become effective November 1, 2017, and shall have prospective application only to offenders whose convictions became final on or after November 1, 2017.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20La.%20Acts%20257\">\n    2017 La. Acts 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00a7 2;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20La.%20Acts%20282\">\n    2017 La. Acts 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00a7 2. The relevant 2017 amendments to La. R.S. 15:529.1(A)(3)(b) removed persons with a current or prior felony that was a violation of the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substance Law punishable for ten or more years from the group of persons subject to a life sentence as a third felony offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant asserts that the 2017 version of the Habitual Offender Law should apply to his case. Defendant's underlying felony and one of his prior felonies, aggravated battery and manslaughter, respectively, are both crimes of violence. His 1991 predicate conviction of distribution of cocaine is a violation of the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substance Law punishable by ten or more years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 40:967(B). Under the prior version of La. R.S. 15:529.1(A)(3)(b), defendant was subject to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without benefits. Defendant argues, however, that with the application of 2017 amendments, including the amended cleansing periods set forth in La. R.S. 15:529.1(C)(1), he should have been adjudicated as a second felony offender rather than a third felony offender.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   If adjudicated as a second felony offender, defendant would have faced a sentencing range of 3.3 to 20 years imprisonment under La. R.S. 15:529.1(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the present matter, defendant was convicted of aggravated battery in violation of La. R.S. 14:34, and the State proved at trial that the crime occurred on February 1, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Lyles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12663981\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/239/1055/#p1056\">\n    239 So.3d at 1056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On November 18, 2016, the State filed the habitual offender bill alleging that defendant was a third felony offender. On February 13, 2017, defendant was adjudicated as a third felony offender and was sentenced to life imprisonment without benefits. Also on that date, defendant filed a motion for an appeal, stating no particular grounds, which was granted on February 16, 2017. On appeal, defendant did not challenge his conviction: he only assigned one error-that his habitual offender sentence was constitutionally excessive. This Court rendered its decision on February 21, 2018, finding that the trial court failed to vacate defendant's original sentence and remanded the matter for resentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Lyles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Defendant did not file a writ application with the Louisiana Supreme Court. Thus, defendant's underlying conviction became final under La. C.Cr.P. art. 922\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   fourteen days after February 21, 2018, when the\n   delay for applying for a rehearing expired.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   While La. R.S. 15:529.1 was revised in 2017 by Acts 257 and 282, it is well settled law that habitual offender proceedings do not charge a separate crime, but merely constitute ancillary sentencing proceedings such that the punishment for a new conviction is enhanced, and jurisprudence, including that of this Court, has held that the sentence to be imposed is that in effect at the time of the commission of the offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Parker\n   </em>\n   , 03-924 (La. 4/14/04),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9277351\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/871/317/#p327\">\n    871 So.2d 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 327 (\"the punishment to be imposed on defendant, a habitual offender, is that provided by La.

R.S. 15:529.1 was again amended and now includes subsection K. La. R.S. 15:529.1(K)(1) provides that, except for a condition not applicable to this case, \"notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the court shall apply the provisions of this Section that were in effect on the date that the defendant's instant offense was committed.\" 2018 La. Acts No. 542, \u00a7 1.

On original appeal, the Second Circuit affirmed his underlying conviction on June 27, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Floyd\n   </em>\n   , 51,869 (La.

There, the defendant conceded that his offense occurred before the 2017 amendment, but he nonetheless urged the Second Circuit to lower his sentence. The court upheld the defendant's sentencing, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   This court is sensitive to the reality that Floyd will not benefit from the leniency of the 2017 amendment\n   <strong>\n    because his offense occurred before it took effect\n   </strong>\n   . However, the legislature specified that the amendment would have \"prospective application only,\" and a subsequent amendment further clarified that courts \"shall apply the provisions of this Section that were in effect on the date that the defendant's instant offense was committed.\" In other words, the legislature clearly stated its intent to diminish the penalties for certain habitual offenders, but equally clearly stated its intent not to reopen or relitigate cases that arose before the effective date.

In\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   , which was decided following the effective date of the 2017 amendments, the defendant asserted that the court erred in sentencing him under the habitual offender statute that was in effect at the time the fourth felony was committed and instead should have sentenced him under the 2017 version of the statute, which was over two years after the underlying offense occurred and four months after the defendant's habitual offender adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Fourth Circuit disagreed with the defendant's assertion, finding that a defendant should be sentenced in accordance with the version of La.

It referenced\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , where the Louisiana Supreme Court discussed the public policy behind applying ameliorative changes to the Habitual Offender Law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [I]f we were to find a defendant's status as a second offender was fixed as of any date other than the commission of the offense, \"it would be within the power of the district attorneys and the Attorney General, by delaying the filing of the charges and prosecution of the case, to fix the accused's status as a second offender at practically any time he desired.\" [\n   <em>\n    State v.\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    Dreaux\n   </em>\n   ] [,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3153601,10079015\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/la/205/387/\">\n    205 La. 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ] at 392, 17 So.2d [559] at 560 [ (1944) ].

Further, we find that by enacting subsection K, the legislature clarified its original intent that the date of commission of the underlying offense be used to determine the sentencing provision applicable to a habitual offender, except as otherwise explicitly provided in the statute. Therefore, after review, we find that the Habitual Offender Law in effect at the time of the commission of defendant's underlying offense of aggravated battery should be applied in determining defendant's habitual offender sentence, and the trial court did so correctly when imposing defendant's enhanced sentence of life imprisonment without benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At the time of the instant offense on February 1, 2015, La. R.S. 14:34(B) provided, in pertinent part, that an offender who commits aggravated battery shall be punished by a fine of not more than five thousand dollars, imprisonment with or without hard labor for not more than ten years, or both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Also at that time, La. R.S. 15:529.1(A)(3)(b) provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   If the third felony and the two prior felonies are felonies defined as a crime\n   of violence under R.S. 14:2(B), a sex offense as defined in R.S. 15:540 et seq. when the victim is under the age of eighteen at the time of commission of the offense, or as a violation of the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Law punishable by imprisonment for ten years or more, or any other crimes punishable by imprisonment for twelve years or more, or any combination of such crimes, the person shall be imprisoned for the remainder of his natural life, without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Accordingly, we find that the 2015 version of La. R.S. 15:529.1(A)(3)(b) is the sentencing provision applicable to defendant herein because his third felony (the aggravated battery conviction) and his predicate conviction of manslaughter are crimes of violence under La. R.S. 14:2(B)(5) and La. R.S. 14:2(B)(4), respectively. Additionally, defendant's 1991 conviction for distribution of cocaine in violation of La. R.S. 40:967(A) was a violation of the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substance Law punishable by ten years of imprisonment or more. La. R.S. 40:967(B)(4). Under the habitual offender statute as it existed at the time of the commission of the underlying offense of aggravated battery, defendant was subject to an enhanced mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 15:529.1(A)(3)(b). For the foregoing reasons, we find that the trial court correctly applied the Habitual Offender Law in effect in 2015 in sentencing defendant.

R.S. 15:529.1(A)(3)(b). As previously discussed, upon defendant's adjudication as a third felony offender, with the instant and one predicate conviction being crimes of violence, and one predicate conviction of violating the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substance Law punishable by ten years imprisonment or more, defendant was subject to a mandatory life sentence without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Defendant was sentenced accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Upon review, we find that defendant has failed to meet his burden of rebutting the presumption of constitutionality. Defendant here knew the victim for several decades, and the victim had allowed defendant to stay with her temporarily. Defendant became angry when the victim asked him to leave, after she offered to help the victim find another place to live and a job, and he grabbed the victim by her throat and choked her more than once as she tried to get away from him. Defendant attempted to stab the victim with a knife while her children were in the home, the victim blacked out, and one of her children eventually called 9-1-1 after hearing what was going on. The facts of this case fail to show that defendant showed any remorse, but rather, that the police arrived before defendant was able to get away from the house. Additionally, this Court has found that if the trial judge who imposed the sentence on a defendant's underlying conviction is the same judge who imposes the enhanced sentence in a habitual offender adjudication, that judge is deemed to have been aware of the nature of the crime for the underlying conviction.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381795\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/235/1354/#p1376\">\n    235 So.3d 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1377-78. Here, the same trial judge who presided over defendant's conviction and sentencing on the underlying offense was the same judge who presided over his adjudication and sentencing as a habitual offender, and who was thus aware that defendant committed aggravated battery upon the victim and of defendant's criminal history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Further, defendant has a prior conviction of a crime of violence, manslaughter. Therefore, we find that the record fails to indicate that defendant is the type of offender contemplated by the Louisiana Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Dorthey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , warranting a downward deviation from the mandatory sentence. Defendant has not demonstrated that a reduction from the mandatory sentence was warranted in this case. As such, we find that defendant's mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence as a third felony offender was not excessive, and the trial court did not err in imposing the sentence. Accordingly, we affirm defendant's enhanced sentence.

However, review of the habitual offender exhibits indicate that defendant pled guilty to distribution of cocaine on May 31, 1991 and that the offense occurred in October of 1990.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    According to the original habitual offender hearing, defendant received a sentence of five years of probation for his 1991 conviction for distribution of cocaine, which ended on May 21, 1996. Defendant committed the crime of manslaughter on September 30, 2003. Thus, applying the reduced cleansing period of five years, defendant's conviction of distribution of cocaine could not be used as a predicate offense for his habitual offender adjudication.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    La. C.Cr.P. art. 922(B) provides: \"A judgment rendered by the supreme court or other appellate court becomes final when the delay for applying for a rehearing has expired and no application therefor has been made.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    In defendant's first appeal, this Court did not consider the merits of his assignment of error; its opinion decreed as follows: \"HABITUAL OFFENDER SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.

R.S. 15:529.1. Representative Marino, who handled H.B. 253 on behalf of Representative Connick, indicated that it was brought on behalf of the Louisiana District Attorneys Association (\"LDAA\") to provide clarification to the 2017 changes of the Habitual Offender Law as the prior version did not specifically state when old or new Habitual Offender Law applied as to sentencing or calculation of the cleansing periods. Representative Marino clarified that the intended effect of the 2017 amendment was for the reduced cleansing periods to apply to any habitual offender bills filed on or after November 1, 2017, and habitual offender bills used prior to that date would use the previous cleansing periods. Jerry Fortunato spoke and indicated that this was the intention of the Justice Reinvestment Initiative (\"JRI\") legislation that the LDAA had participated in creating the previous year, and this was the original intention of the 2017 amendment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Video of Hearing on H.B. 253 Before the H.
