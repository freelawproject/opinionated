Farber, seeks review of the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence and conviction and sentence for possession of less than 14 grams of marijuana, a misdemeanor offense. For the reasons that follow, we deny defendant's writ application and affirm his conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant was charged by bill of information filed July 25, 2017, with possession of less than 14 grams of marijuana in violation of La. R.S. 40:966 C, a misdemeanor offense. On December 7, 2017, the trial court simultaneously heard defendant's motion to suppress evidence and trial on the merits of the charged offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the conclusion of the motion hearing and trial on December 8, 2017, the trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress and found him guilty as charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 17, 2018, the trial court sentenced defendant to fifteen days in the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center. The trial court suspended imposition of defendant's sentence and ordered him to be placed on twelve months active probation to commence on July 26, 2018. Defendant filed a written notice of intent to apply for a writ of review, which was granted by the trial court. In this writ application, defendant seeks review of the trial court's December 8, 2017 denial of his motion to suppress evidence and the trial court's finding that he was guilty of the misdemeanor offense of possession of less than 14 grams of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the motion hearing and trial, Detective Blaine Howard of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, Project STAR division, testified that he and his partner, Detective Daniel Lassus, were on pro-active patrol of a high crime area in the 4000 block of Jefferson Highway on March 11, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Approximately 6:40 P.M., he observed defendant standing in front of a library which was closed at the time, using his cell phone. Detective Howard testified that his suspicion was heightened, so they obtained a position of surveillance of defendant, which he believed was \"consistent with someone that could possibly be involved in a criminal activity.\" Detective Howard testified that after approximately five minutes of cell phone use he observed defendant cross Jefferson Highway and enter a Rite Aid. Ten minutes later, defendant exited the Rite Aid with a bag and a bucket in his hand and began walking eastbound on Jefferson Highway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Detective Howard testified that they were dressed in civilian clothes and had service weapons, badges, and ballistic vests bearing the word \"Sheriff,\" which clearly identified them as law enforcement officers when they approached defendant to \"speak\" with him. After identifying themselves as police officers, the detectives asked defendant about his presence at the library. Defendant informed them that he was using the library's Wi-Fi while waiting for a ride from a friend. For officer safety, the detectives inquired as to whether defendant had any weapons or narcotics\n   on his person. Defendant replied that while he did not have any weapons, \"he uses marijuana.\" Detective Howard then asked whether defendant had any marijuana on his person, and defendant responded that he did not have any marijuana on him but he had some in his hotel room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Based upon his admission, defendant was detained, advised of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights, and transported to his hotel, The LaBella, on Jefferson Highway. Detective Howard stated that once they were at the hotel, defendant was presented with, reviewed, and signed a consent to search form providing consent to search his hotel room.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The detectives entered the hotel room with a key provided by defendant and seized 8.8 grams of marijuana from inside a nightstand after defendant informed them of its location.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant was issued a misdemeanor summons for possession of marijuana in lieu of his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defense counsel argued the marijuana should be suppressed because the detectives did not have reasonable suspicion or probable cause to stop defendant, and thus, the evidence seized from his hotel room constituted fruit of the poisonous tree. Defense counsel further argued that if the detectives believed defendant was involved in criminal activity, they should have stopped defendant while he was standing in front of the library.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The State argued that this case was analogous to those cases involving consensual encounters, citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Martin\n   </em>\n   , 11-0082 (La. 10/25/11),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7027548\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/79/951/\">\n    79 So.3d 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because the detectives merely approached defendant to ask him what he was doing outside of a closed library and, for their safety, whether he had any weapons or narcotics on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence and found him guilty as charged. Defendant was sentenced and this writ application followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In his first assignment of error, defendant asserts that Detective Howard lacked sufficient reasonable suspicion for the initial investigatory stop, and therefore everything that occurred after the illegal stop is fruit of the poisonous tree and should have been suppressed. Defendant argues that standing in front of a closed library and using a cell phone is not a \"particularized and objective basis for suspecting that he was committing or had committed a criminal offense,\" and therefore insufficient to support a finding of reasonable suspicion. Defendant further contends the detectives went beyond the scope of a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   stop when they questioned him regarding his possession of weapons and illegal narcotics, and as such, his statement regarding the marijuana in his hotel room was given involuntarily.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A trial court's denial of a motion to suppress is afforded great weight and will not be set aside unless the preponderance of the evidence clearly favors suppression.\n   <em>\n    State v.

They were clearly identified as law enforcement wearing civilian clothes by their service weapons, badges, and ballistic vests with the word \"Sheriff\" written on\n   them. Detective Howard inquired as to defendant's presence at the library and, for officer safety, whether defendant had any weapons or narcotics on his person. In response, defendant provided an incriminating statement regarding marijuana at his hotel room, was advised of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, handcuffed, and transported back to his hotel where the detectives conducted a search of his room pursuant to his written consent. \"The proposition that police officers can approach individuals as to whom they have no reasonable suspicion and ask them potentially incriminating questions ... is by no means novel; it has been endorsed by the Court any number of times.\"\n   <em>\n    Sylvester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11376430\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/826/1106/#p1108\">\n    826 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1108 ; See\n   <em>\n    State v.

While Detective Howard and his partner approached defendant in their vehicle and then exited to speak with him, there was no testimony presented that their guns were drawn, that he was surrounded by police, or that a frisk or pat-down was conducted. There is nothing in the record to indicate that Detective Howard ordered defendant to submit to his authority or ever attempted to assert any official authority over defendant by ordering or signaling him to stop. The encounter between the detectives and defendant was brief and defendant was only physically restrained after he provided a voluntary answer to a potentially incriminating statement. We therefore find defendant was never \"seized\" for purposes of the Fourth Amendment during the initial encounter that occurred in this case. Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress and finding him guilty as charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In his second assignment of error, defendant argues the marijuana found in his hotel room after the alleged unlawful stop and the statements made prior to his arrest constitute \"fruits of the poisonous tree\" and should have been suppressed. He contends that Detective Howard conducted an illegal search of his hotel room where the consent to search form was signed after the search of his hotel room as evidenced by the documentary evidence in this case. Accordingly, defendant argues Detective Howard's contradictory testimony should be disregarded in favor of the documentary evidence in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   It is well settled that a search conducted without a warrant issued upon probable cause is\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unreasonable subject only to a few specifically established and well delineated exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

During a valid stop, defendant, who was not subject to a custodial interrogation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   was asked by Detective Howard regarding his presence at the library, to which defendant stated he was using the library's Wi-Fi while waiting for a ride. Detective Howard testified that for officer safety defendant was asked whether he had any weapons or narcotics on his person. Defendant stated that he used marijuana and had it in his hotel room. Based on defendant's inculpatory statement, Detective Howard read defendant his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. Defendant was presented with, reviewed, and signed a consent to search form to search his hotel room. While the record is unclear as to whether defendant's consent to search was obtained at the scene of the stop or at the scene of the hotel, it is consistent in that consent was obtained\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to a search of the hotel room, which the detectives gained entry to with the key provided by defendant. In explaining the time discrepancies on the consent to search form (7:10 P.M.) and the misdemeanor summons (7:00 P.M.), Detective Howard testified that the time written on the summons was the time of the stop and not the time defendant signed the summons which was issued to him after the search of the hotel room and the seizure of the marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In denying defendant's motion to suppress, the trial court found the time reflected on the summons was the time of the initial stop, not the time the summons was issued/signed. The court further found that defendant was not forced, threatened, or promised anything in exchange for the consent to search. Because a trial court's determination as to the credibility of a witness on a motion to suppress is accorded great weight on appeal unless unsupported by the evidence, we find no error in the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    Errors Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A complete record of this case was not provided.
