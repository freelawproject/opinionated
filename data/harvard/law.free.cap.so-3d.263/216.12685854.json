Stat. (2006) (providing: \"A sentence of imprisonment shall not begin to run before the date it is imposed, but the court imposing a sentence shall allow a defendant credit for all of the time she or he spent in the county jail before sentence. The credit must be for a specified period of time and shall be provided for in the sentence\");\n   <em>\n    Kronz v.

In this latter circumstance, the trial judge should consider the appropriateness of an award of credit for time served when the defendant was incarcerated in another state solely because of the Florida offense for which he or she is being sentenced\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The order on appeal expressly provides that the trial court considered the facts and circumstances surrounding appellant's request, and exercised its discretion in denying same.
