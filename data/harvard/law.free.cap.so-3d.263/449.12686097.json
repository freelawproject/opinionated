Schwarzenberger, M.D. and Clinical Oncology Research Associates, LLC (\"CORA\") (collectively, \"Appellants\") appeal the Amended Judgment rendered by the trial court on May 22, 2018, following a bench trial and a hearing on a motion for partial new trial. For the reasons that follow, we find that the Amended Judgment lacks necessary decretal language, and is, therefore, not a valid appealable judgment. Accordingly, we lift the stay previously issued by this Court on December 10, 2018, dismiss the appeal without prejudice, and remand this matter to the trial court so that a valid appealable judgment can be rendered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In January 2018, a bench trial was conducted regarding claims raised in a reconventional demand filed by Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center-New Orleans and LSU Board of Supervisors (\"LSU\" or \"Appellee\") against Appellants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the trial, the trial court issued a judgment on March 1, 2018, granting LSU's reconventional demand and awarding damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   LSU then filed a motion for partial new trial seeking, in part, additional damages and attorneys' fees. Following a hearing on the motion for partial new trial, the trial court rendered an \"Amended Judgment\" on May 22, 2018. The Amended Judgment reads, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED\n   </strong>\n   that the Reconventional Demand is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and this Court awards Plaintiff-in-Reconvention\n   <strong>\n    FORTY-FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NO CENTS ($44,000.00)\n   </strong>\n   with judicial interest running on this amount from December 9, 2004; and\n   <strong>\n    FORTY-ONE THOUSAND EIGHT-HUNDRED FORTY-TWO DOLLARS AND TWENTY-NINE CENTS ($41,842.29)\n   </strong>\n   with judicial interest running on this amount from date of judicial demand.

In addition, the Amended Judgment fails to express the degree of fault of each party cast in judgment or state whether those parties are\n   jointly or solidarily liable for the damages and attorneys' fees. In the absence of the necessary decretal language, there is no valid appealable judgment. Consequently, we lack appellate jurisdiction to consider the merits of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When confronted with a judgment in an appellate context that is not final and appealable, this Court has the discretionary authority to convert the appeal to an application for supervisory writs.\n   <em>\n    Forstall v.
