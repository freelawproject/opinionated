Without defendant present, defendant's former attorney met with the prosecutor and the presiding judge and reached an agreement whereby the prosecutor would recommend a total sentence on all charges of two years at hard labor, with each sentence running concurrently; the prosecutor agreed not to file a habitual offender bill; and the judge would accept the guilty pleas and explain the penalties for each offense, not exclude the prosecutor's recommended sentence as a possibility, and tell the defendant that he would consider, but not be bound by the sentence recommendation. Defendant subsequently pled guilty to most of the charges. However his former attorney mistakenly believed and wrongly advised the judge that defendant had only one prior felony conviction. The judge advised defendant of his maximum exposure if he pled and was sentenced consecutively on all charges, and although he did not promise to give the two-year sentence the state agreed to recommend, he stated that it was unlikely defendant would get that sentence. At the sentencing the state did not recommend the two-year sentence as previously agreed, and the judge sentenced defendant to serve 50 years at hard labor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A plea bargain is a contract between the state and one accused of a crime.\n   <em>\n    State v.

A contract is formed by the consent of the parties established through offer and acceptance. The offer and acceptance may be verbal unless the law prescribes a requirement of writing. Once there is an offer and acceptance, the agreement is subject to\n   specific performance. The party demanding performance of a contract has the burden of proving its existence. Moreover, the obligation may be dependent upon an uncertain event. A lawful cause is also necessary to the existence of a contract. The cause is the reason why a party obligates himself.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, when a district attorney or assistant district attorney makes a good faith bargain with a person accused of a crime and the defendant, in reliance on that bargain, relinquishes a fundamental right, the state cannot repudiate the bargain.\n   <em>\n    Karey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12426870\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/232/1186/#p1190\">\n    232 So. 3d at 1190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When a defendant enters into such a plea agreement with the government, the government takes on certain obligations. If those obligations are not met, the defendant is entitled to seek a remedy, which might in some cases be rescission of the agreement and in others specific performance (i.e., requiring the government to fully comply with the agreement).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12426870\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/232/1186/#p1190\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12426870\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/232/1186/#p1190\">\n    at 1198-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"A guilty plea is a serious and sobering occasion inasmuch as it constitutes a waiver of the fundamental rights to a jury trial....\"\n   <em>\n    Santobello\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172366\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/257/#p260\">\n    404 U.S. at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172366\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/257/#p260\">\n    92 S.Ct. 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Douglas, J., concurring);\n   <em>\n    Duncan v.

Defendant, relying on the state's agreement, relinquished his fundamental right of trial by jury. This court has consistently permitted a constitutionally infirm guilty plea to be withdrawn after sentencing by way of appeal or post conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Based on what has been presented to this court, it appears defendant pled guilty in reliance on his understanding that the state agreed to recommend a two year sentence. The defendant's guilty plea under\n   these circumstances should not be allowed to stand, and defendant should be allowed to withdraw his plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court dismissed defendant's petition without a hearing. Given the great disparity between the apparent plea agreement and the sentence imposed, and considering the factual issues still in dispute regarding the alleged ineffectiveness of defendant's attorney, I would grant defendant's writ application and remand this case to the district court with an order to conduct a full evidentiary hearing on these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Crichton, J., additionally concurs and assigns reasons:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I agree with the Court's decision to deny this writ application. However, I write separately to point out that, in my view, there is nothing in the record before this Court that suggests there was any violation of an agreement between the State and the defendant. To the contrary, the State agreed to not file a habitual offender bill and the defendant pled guilty as charged. After a thorough\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   examination and considerations of the defendant's criminal history, the trial court sentenced the defendant accordingly.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
