The plaintiffs appealed to this court after the trial court sustained the defendants' exceptions of res judicata and peremption. The plaintiffs further seek review of the trial court's denial of their constitutional challenge of the setting of bond for security for costs pursuant to La.R.S. 13:4522. For the following reasons, we affirm in part; reverse in part; and remand for further limited proceedings as instructed. Upon reversal of the sustaining of the exception of res judicata, we deny that exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The record indicates that Larry Bize, Sr. was arrested following a March 2008 incident at a bar he owned in Avoyelles Parish. Mr. Bize and his wife, Michelle R. Bize, retained Malcom Larvadain (Mr. Larvadain) to represent them in a suit by which they alleged that the Avoyelles Parish Sheriff's deputies involved in the arrest were liable to them for physical and mental damages resulting from the incident. That initial petition was filed in March 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September 2010, a first supplemental and amending petition was filed attempting to plead claims pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court granted a motion for summary judgment in July 2015 as to those latter claims on the basis of prescription and upon a finding that they did not relate to the original petition due to its lack of allegations in support of the \u00a7 1983 claims. The trial court also granted summary judgment on the basis of an absence of genuine issues of material fact, as the plaintiffs \"failed to provide any evidence that they will be able to satisfy their evidentiary burden regarding said claims at trial.\" Thus, the trial court dismissed all \u00a7 1983 claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The remaining issues proceeded to trial before Judge Kerry Spruill. During a recess in the proceedings, Mr. and Mrs. Bize entered into a November 13, 2015 settlement agreement, whereby they would receive $50,000 over a twelve-month period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the matter was not dismissed at that point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In April 2016, with the agreement confected, the defendants in the personal injury suit filed a Motion to Enforce Settlement. While that motion was pending, Mr. Bize discharged Mr. Larvadain and retained Nelson W. Cameron as reflected in a May 2, 2016 Motion to Enroll and Withdraw as Counsel. Mr. Bize thereafter filed a Motion to Recuse,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   asserting that he had lacked capacity to enter into the settlement agreement and that Judge Spruill was a potential witness at the forthcoming hearing on the Motion to Enforce Settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge William J. Bennett was assigned to consider the motion to recuse. Following a hearing, Judge Bennett denied the motion, explaining in his reasons for ruling that Judge Spruill was not a witness to Mr. Bize's alleged deterioration given the latter's testimony that he became distraught during settlement negotiations that occurred during a recess.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Afterwards, on September 8, 2016, Mr. and Mrs. Bize signed a formal Receipt and Release of All Claims. Therein, they acknowledged that, for the sum of $50,000, they released, acquitted, and discharged the officers named as defendants in the suit. In turn, the trial court granted the parties' Joint Motion to Dismiss and ordered, on November 15, 2016, that Mr. and Mrs. Bize's suit be dismissed as to all defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. and Mrs. Bize instituted the present matter, also in November 2016, by filing a Petition for Damages and Trial By Jury in Rapides Parish. The plaintiffs named Mr. Larvadain and his brother, Edward Larvadain, III, as defendants, as well as their purported partnership. The plaintiffs alleged that Mr. Larvadain committed various instances of legal malpractice in his representation of them in the initial matter, including: 1) failing to timely plead claims allegedly arising under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and failing to timely pursue an appeal or writ on a determination that such claims had prescribed; 2) failing to file the matter in federal court; and 3) pleading causes of action against the defendants in their official capacities and not in their individual capacities. The plaintiffs additionally alleged that Mr. Larvadain \"counseled Plaintiffs to enter into a settlement agreement dismissing the named Defendants with prejudice. Due to failures in the pleading as drafted and the filings and subsequent practice, the settlement obtained was woefully inadequate.\" They continued, asserting that Mr. Larvadain \"knew or should have known during the settlement negotiations that Larry Bize was under duress at the time and was not competent to proceed with a settlement.\" The plaintiffs alleged that they had suffered \"loss of damages including but not limited to attorney fees, punitive damages and sufficient compensation for the losses sustained in the case filed in Avoyelles Parish district court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The plaintiffs thereafter filed three amending petitions. By those petitions, the plaintiffs named Edward Larvadain, Jr. as an additional defendant, suggesting that he assisted in Mr. Larvadain's representation of them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among other factual assertions, the plaintiffs alleged legal malpractice in the failure to employ experts in the use of force or arrest and in economics; the failure to conduct sufficient and timely discovery; and in the failure to conduct a prompt prosecution of the matter. And, finally, the plaintiffs alleged that certain instances of purported malpractice were not known to them at the time of the occurrence. Rather, by the second and third amended petitions, the plaintiffs contended that Mr. Larvadain acted with an intent to conceal the purported malpractice, doing so by failing to inform them of, among other things, the summary judgment resulting in the dismissal of the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claims. They alleged that they only became aware of such actions after examination of the Avoyelles Parish Court records in November 2016 and only after receipt of the file from Mr. Larvadain. The plaintiffs further asserted that the delivery of the file was not prompt. Those actions, the plaintiffs contended, reflected concealment and fraud per La.R.S. 9:5605(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Before pleading, Mr. Larvadain and Edward Larvadian, III (\"the defendants\") responded to the initial petition with a Motion to Set Bond For Security For Costs, seeking a bond in the amount of $25,000, pursuant to La.R.S. 13:4522. The trial court granted the motion, ordering the posting of a bond by April 10, 2017. By the ruling, the trial court set for hearing the plaintiffs' motion and rule to show cause by which they prayed that La.R.S. 13:4522 be declared unconstitutional pursuant to La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 2 (Due Process of Law); La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 19 (Right to Judicial Review); and La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 22 (Access to Courts).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following that hearing, the trial court denied the plaintiffs' claim and entered judgment indicating that \"the constitutionality of La.R.S. 13:4522 is hereby upheld.\" The trial court maintained its earlier order that the plaintiffs post a $25,000 bond, but modified the date for the posting to \"two weeks after any ruling by the Louisiana Third Circuit Court of Appeal regarding this Judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendants further filed various proceedings, including an Exception of Peremption, an Exception of Res Judicata, and a Motion for Summary Judgment on Estoppel. Following two hearings on the matters, the trial court denied the motion for summary judgment, but sustained the exception of peremption as well as the exception of res judicata. In sustaining the exception of res judicata, the trial court ordered that \"all claims of plaintiffs Larry Bize, Sr. and Michelle R. Bize concerning the alleged lack of mental capacity of Larry Bize, Sr. when the plaintiffs settled the underlying lawsuit are hereby dismissed with prejudice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The plaintiffs appeal, asserting that the trial court erred in: 1) requiring them to post bond pursuant to La.R.S. 13:4522, as it violates La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 22 and the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution; 2) requiring them to post bond when there was insufficient evidence to support the amount imposed; 3) granting the exception of preemption, as the record indicates that acts of malpractice occurred within the one-year period before the filing of suit, and other acts occurred within one year of discovery and within three years of the filing of suit; 4) not applying prescription upon the demonstration of fraudulent concealment; and in 5) granting the exception of res judicata when the parties to the prior judgment and the case at issue are not the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Louisiana Revised Statutes 13:4522\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The plaintiffs first two assignments of error address the trial court's order that they post a bond for security and its determination \"that the constitutionality of La.R.S. 13:4522 is hereby upheld.\" Titled \"Defendant may demand security for costs[,]\" the subject statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The defendant before pleading in all cases may by motion demand and require the plaintiff or intervenor to give security for the cost in such case, and on failure to do so within the time fixed by the court such suit or intervention, as the case may be, shall be dismissed\n   without prejudice.

And, to the extent it superficially cited Section 19, it did so within its discussion of access to the courts. The plaintiffs did, however, address and further particularize this latter ground, arising under Section 22 and the due process considerations contained therein. We make final note here that, in framing their assignments of error, the plaintiffs also assert that the La.R.S. 13:4522 as applied here violates \"the First Amendment and Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. amend.

The defendants here referenced the complexity and multi-faceted nature of the causes of action lodged by the plaintiffs. By their memorandum, the defendants noted the need for experts related to Mr. Bize's mental state and purported damages in the underlying suit as well as those who could testify as to matters of standards of legal representation. The defendants estimated a $300 hourly rate for those experts. Additionally, the defendants suggested that deposition and subpoena expenses associated with numerous fact witnesses would be incurred. Finally, we note too, that the trial court initially set the $25,000 bond in March\n   2017. The plaintiffs have since amended the petition and included additional allegations of malpractice. Given those circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's order as it related to the necessity of the bond pursuant to La.R.S. 13:4522.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Neither do we find merit in the plaintiffs' suggestion that the setting of bond at $25,000 was excessive. The plaintiffs assert in their brief that \"the Defendants illogically seem to argue that the underlying case which has already been litigated and partially tried would militate in favor [of] imposing a bond on Plaintiffs for court costs, expert trial testimony, fact witness depositions, and fact witness testimony.\" Dismissing the defendants' contention, the plaintiffs instead suggest that due to the presence of \"a complete record of the underlying case, up through and including trial, expenses of the Defendants are therefore minimized, not maximized.\" By way of example, the plaintiffs point out that \"Plaintiff[s'] answers to interrogatories in this case concerning witnesses refers to the underlying case's answers to interrogatories and other case file documents.\" The plaintiffs continue, asserting that \"no one is in a better position to know whether the alleged undue influence was exerted than the accused attorney Defendants and the Plaintiffs.\" And, to the extent Mr. Bize's mental state is at issue, the plaintiffs correspondingly contend that \"no one is [in] a better position to know his mental state than the parties and those experts employed by plaintiffs and defendants in the underlying case. Defendants have possession of deposition transcripts of Mr. Bize's treating physician and expert.\" The plaintiffs suggest that the defendants \"were intimately familiar with [Mr.] Bize's mental state by their representation of him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   This assertion, however, ignores the fact that the plaintiffs have instituted a wholly new cause of action in legal malpractice, one involving entirely different considerations than those encapsulated in the records of the underlying proceeding. The defendants cannot be expected to forego the security envisioned by La.R.S. 13:4522 upon the suggestion of those now adverse to them. This is apparent given the above discussion regarding the role of expert testimony in legal malpractice claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MB Indus.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7031167\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/74/1173/\">\n    74 So.3d 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Clarkston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12347933\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/211/509/\">\n    211 So.3d 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   This assignment lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    Exception of Peremption\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   By their next two assignments of error, the plaintiffs question the trial court's determination that their malpractice claim was perempted. In the defendants' exception of peremption, they noted that the plaintiffs cited various instances of alleged malpractice throughout the defendants' representation of them in the underlying litigation arising from the 2008 altercation. The final act of alleged malpractice occurred in relation to the plaintiffs' settlement of that underlying matter on November 13, 2015. The defendants suggested in their exception, however, that the suit in this matter was not filed until November 16, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the trial court ultimately sustained the exception of peremption, it did so without reference to individual allegations of malpractice and without issuing reasons for ruling. By these assignments, the plaintiffs challenge that ruling\n   and suggest that the record demonstrates that suit was filed within one year of the discovery of the majority of the allegations of malpractice (but within three years of their occurrence). The plaintiffs also allege that suit was filed within one year of the allegation of malpractice regarding the entry of settlement at the time of Mr. Bize's alleged mental incapacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Turning to review of the claim, we first note that the time limitations for filing a legal malpractice claim are set forth in La.R.S. 9:5605, which provides, in pertinent part, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (A) No action for damages against any attorney at law duly admitted to practice in this state, any partnership of such attorneys at law, or any professional corporation, company, organization, association, enterprise, or other commercial business or professional combination authorized by the laws of this state to engage in the practice of law, whether based upon tort, or breach of contract, or otherwise, arising out of an engagement to provide legal services shall be brought unless filed in a court of competent jurisdiction and proper venue within one year from the date of the alleged act, omission, or neglect, or within one year from the date that the alleged act, omission, or neglect is discovered or should have been discovered; however, even as to actions filed within one year from the date of such discovery, in all events such actions shall be filed at the latest within three years from the date of the alleged act, omission, or neglect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Paragraph B further explains that: \"The one-year and three-year periods of limitation provided in Subsection A of this Section are peremptive periods within the meaning of Civil Code Article 3458\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   and, in accordance with Civil Code Article 3461,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   may not be renounced, interrupted, or suspended.\" Significantly, La.R.S. 9:5605(E) provides that: \"The peremptive period provided in Subsection A of this Section shall not apply in cases of fraud, as defined in Civil Code Article 1953.\" On this latter point, La.Civ.Code art. 1953 explains that: \"Fraud is a misrepresentation or a suppression of the truth made with the intention either to obtain an unjust advantage for one party or to cause a loss or inconvenience to the other. Fraud may also result from silence or inaction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Albeit by the final amending petitions, the plaintiff raised allegations of fraud in contending that the defendants made an effort to conceal the alleged acts of malpractice. In particular, the plaintiffs asserted that the defendants failed to inform them of an alleged failure to make federal claims in the underlying litigation, failed to inform them of the dismissal of the federal claims to the extent they were alleged, failed to apprise them of appellate rights associated with that dismissal, and failed to timely deliver the entire contents of the client file upon demand. Given those allegations of concealment, it appears that as a point of starting, the plaintiffs made an initial showing that their claims were timely filed and, thus, the burden of proving peremption was with the defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lomont v. Bennett\n   </em>\n   , 14-2483 (La. 6/30/15),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856952\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/172/620/\">\n    172 So.3d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   On review, we find that the defendants did so with the majority of claims related to the unsuccessful federal claims brought in the underlying level. On this point, Mr. Larvadain testified extensively at the hearing on the exception of peremption, detailing his communications with the plaintiffs regarding the conduct of the underlying litigation. He described the plaintiffs' active involvement in the underlying litigation and further explained that he extensively informed Mr. Bize of decisional points now complained of by the plaintiffs. Mr. Larvadain specifically and repeatedly denied an intent to conceal, mislead, or defraud. Further, and with respect to the delivery of the plaintiffs' client file at the time of demand, Mr. Larvadain both testified as to his attempts to make that file available and submitted documentary evidence indicating an attempt to facilitate that transfer with the plaintiffs' counsel. Certainly, Mr. Bize testified otherwise, denying Mr. Larvadain's communications of litigation developments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Given those starkly opposed accounts, the trial court clearly accepted Mr. Larvadain's account of disclosure. That credibility determination is patent in the trial court's rejection of the plaintiffs' claim of the applicability of the principles of prescription (due to their claim of discovery of the alleged malpractice only after delivery of the client file). That determination of contemporaneous knowledge on the part of the plaintiffs' further undermines the plaintiffs' suggestion that their claim was suspended during a period of continuous representation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lomont\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856952\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/172/620/\">\n    172 So.3d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (wherein the supreme court explained that, although the contra non valentem application of the continuous representation rule may not interrupt or suspend the peremptive periods of La.R.S. 9:5605, such an application may be warranted in the event that the one-year prescriptive period is found applicable).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   On review, we are mindful that when, as here, evidence is introduced at the hearing on an exception of peremption, the trial court is not bound to accept a plaintiff's allegations as true.\n   <em>\n    Lomont\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856952\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/172/620/\">\n    172 So.3d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On this claim, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants encouraged the November 13, 2015 settlement at a time when Mr. Bize's purported mental incapacity should have been apparent. Their allegations of lack of knowledge and allegations of \"fraud\" do not reach that specific allegation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The claims of fraud\n   and applicability of La.R.S. 9:5606(E) instead relate to the earlier aspects of the representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The record, however, indicates that the facsimile filing bears the Clerk of Court's stamp of November 14, 2016, and the regular standard filing bears the Clerk of Court's stamp of November 16, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.Code Civ.P. art. 253 ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   La.R.S. 13:850.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   While even that facsimile filing\n   date ostensibly exceeds the one-year peremptive period related to the purported malpractice of November 13, 2015, the plaintiffs assert that the final day of the peremptive period fell on a weekend and, thus, would not be included in the computation of time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.Code Civ.P. art. 5059.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notwithstanding the fact that the record includes both the facsimile filing and the filing by delivery of the document, the record includes no indication that the trial court considered whether the facsimile filing was effective.

The trial court spoke to Mr. Bize's mental capacity and the allegation of malpractice related thereto in its ruling on the exception of res judicata, a ruling we find it necessary to reverse below. Given that ruling, it is unclear whether the trial court has addressed the exception of peremption as it relates to the allegation of malpractice relating to the entry of settlement and whether it has made a factual finding regarding the date of the filing of the petition. We thus find it necessary to reverse the trial court's judgment sustaining of the exception of peremption on this final, non-fraud based allegation of malpractice, i.e., that related to the entry of settlement in light of the allegation of mental incapacity. We below remand for the trial court's further consideration of the exception of peremption on that single cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8157450\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/6/152/\">\n    6 So.3d 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (wherein the supreme court remanded an unresolved issue of the effectiveness of a facsimile filing when the trial court made no such factual finding).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    Exception of Res Judicata\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Finally, we turn to the plaintiffs' assignment of error addressing the trial court's sustaining of the defendants' exception of res judicata. By the exception, the defendants observed that a portion of the plaintiffs' claim against them involved an allegation that Mr. Bize lacked mental capacity to enter into the settlement during trial of the underlying lawsuit. This issue of mental capacity, the defendants contended, was resolved by the trial court's ruling on a motion to recuse whereby Judge Bennett considered the proceedings below in ultimately determining that Judge Spruill would not be a witness in further proceedings. The defendants noted that, in doing so, Judge Bennett made certain findings regarding Mr. Bize's mental capacity. That determination, the defendants asserted, precluded relitigation of that capacity in pursuit of the plaintiffs' claim that the defendants committed malpractice in facilitating the settlement when Mr. Bize lacked mental capacity to enter into a contract. The trial court found merit in that contention and sustained the exception of res judicata, thereby ordering that \"all claims of plaintiffs ... concerning the alleged lack of mental capacity of Larry Bize Sr. when the plaintiffs settled the underlying lawsuit are hereby dismissed with prejudice.\" The plaintiffs challenge that determination here, pointing out that, although they were parties to the underlying litigation, the defendants were not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Under La.R.S. 13:4231, res judicata is comprised of the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Except as otherwise provided by law, a valid and final judgment is conclusive between the same parties, except on appeal or other direct review, to the following extent:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (1) If the judgment is in favor of the plaintiff, all causes of action existing at the time of final judgment arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the litigation are extinguished and merged in the judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   (2) If the judgment is in favor of the defendant, all causes of action existing at the time of final judgment arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the litigation are extinguished and the judgment bars a subsequent action on those causes of action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   (3) A judgment in favor of either the plaintiff or the defendant is conclusive, in any subsequent action between them, with respect to any issue actually litigated and determined if its determination was essential to that judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Direct reference to La.R.S. 13:4231 reveals merit in the plaintiffs' opposition to the exception. As noted by the plaintiffs, the defendants to the litigation in which the allegedly determinative judgment arose were the Avoyelles Parish Sheriff and certain deputies of that office. But, and although the plaintiffs are the same in the present matter, the defendants are not. By its introductory wording, La.R.S. 13:4231 provides that \"a valid and final judgment is conclusive\n   <em>\n    between the same parties\n   </em>\n   ...[.]\" (Emphasis added.)

I believe the provisions of La.R.S. 13:4522, both on its face and as applied to Plaintiffs, violates Plaintiffs constitutional rights under La.Const. art. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 22, and U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. The Louisiana Constitution \"mandates equal protection of the laws,\"\n   <em>\n    Butler v. Flint Goodrich Hosp. of Dillard Univ.\n   </em>\n   , 92-559 (La. 10/19/92),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7481095\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/607/517/#p518\">\n    607 So.2d 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 518, and La.Const. art. I, Section 3, provides that \"[a]ll courts shall be open, and\n   <em>\n    every person shall have an adequate remedy by due process of law and justice,\n   </em>\n   administered\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   denial,\n   <em>\n    partiality\n   </em>\n   , or unreasonable delay, for injury to him in his person, property, reputation, or other rights.\" La.Const. art. I, \u00a7 22. Under the United States Constitution all persons are guaranteed equal protection of the law, a right made applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution. Louisiana Revised Statute 13:4522 does not treat all litigants the same but instead carves out certain exceptions to its requirement that litigants may be compelled to deposit security for costs before proceeding with their claims in court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   The defendant before pleading in all cases may by motion demand and require the plaintiff or intervenor to give security for the cost in such case, and on failure to do so within the time fixed by the court such suit or intervention, as the case may be, shall be dismissed without prejudice.\n   <strong>\n    This section shall not apply to the Parish of Orleans\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    to cases brought in forma pauperis\n   </strong>\n   , nor\n   <strong>\n    to the state or any political subdivision thereof.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The phrase \"Parish of Orleans\" must refer to the people of the parish because the statute exempts the State and its political subdivisions which would include the Orleans Parish and the City of New Orleans governing bodies. Thus, under the express provisions of this statute, all residents of Orleans Parish are exempt from the requirement to post security in order to proceed with their day in court. Also exempt are those litigants who are so financially challenged that they meet the requirements for pauper status. Additionally, the State and all its political subdivisions cannot be compelled to post bond in order to proceed in court. But the unfortunate litigant, such as Plaintiffs herein, who make up the fast-growing segment of our society sometimes referred to as \"the working poor,\" or in this case the\n   <em>\n    retired\n   </em>\n   poor, are singled out to provide large sums of money, in this case, $25,000, to insure that should their claim against Defendants fail, court costs and other costs that may be recoverable by the party victorious will be paid. The State and Defendants posit that litigants compelled to provide surety for costs can put up\n   <em>\n    unmortgaged\n   </em>\n   property,\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   they own any, or obtain a surety bond from a bonding company,\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   they can financially qualify. But all too often these options are not available to litigants and in this case, Plaintiffs attempted to post a property bond, but it was refused by the trial court. Here, Mr. Bize is a retired postal worker and Mrs. Bize is a retired commissary worker. They assert this surety requirement works an unnecessary, substantial financial hardship on them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   It is easy to discern the basis for exempting the pauper from such a requirement\n   who would otherwise have no access to justice. It is also not difficult to understand the wisdom of exempting the State and its political subdivisions from the requirement to post surety as a prerequisite for proceeding to enforce claims on behalf of the general citizenry. But, any justification for exempting the good people of Orleans Parish from this requirement totally eludes me. Is it because that parish contains a disproportionate number of lower economic citizens or is it just that they had more capable representation in the legislature when this law was enacted? I am also at a loss to reconcile any basis to treat the citizenry different than governmental entities whenever either is a plaintiff in a civil matter. But the reason for such glaring disparate treatment is not for me or these Plaintiffs to figure out, it is the burden of the State to justify such disparity, if they can, once this constitutional challenge is before the court. I do not believe the State met that challenge in this case nor can I imagine how such disparity can be justified. The Louisiana State Supreme Court has rejected such disparate treatment in the past on the basis of both La.Const. art. I \u00a7 3 and \u00a7 22. In\n   <em>\n    Detraz v. Fontana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9593661\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/416/1291/\">\n    416 So.2d 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. 1982) the supreme court found La.R.S. 42:261E, as it read at that time, unconstitutional as violative of both Louisiana's constitutional guarantee of equal protection and equal access to the courts. That statute provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Any party who files suit against any duly elected or appointed public official of this state of or any of its agencies or political subdivisions for any matter arising out of the performance of the duties of his office other than matters pertaining to the collection and payment of taxes and those cases where the plaintiff is seeking to compel the defendant to comply with and apply the laws of this state relative to the registration of voters, and who is unsuccessful in his demands, shall be liable to said public official for all attorneys fees incurred by said public official in the defense of said lawsuit or lawsuits, which attorneys fees shall be fixed by the court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The defendant public official shall have the right, by rule, to require the plaintiff to furnish bond as in the case of bond for costs,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     to cover such attorneys fees before proceeding with the trial of said cause\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9593661\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/416/1291/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9593661\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/416/1291/\">\n    at 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Detraz\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court discussed the ways in which the jurisprudence had developed numerous exceptions to the requirement, but in its final analysis the court determined that even those exceptions could not save the statute. The supreme court held the statute unconstitutional as violative of both state and federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection, and Louisiana's constitutionally mandated equal access to our courts of justice. The supreme court explained its holding based on equal protection as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   The state and federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection mandate that\n   <em>\n    state laws affect alike all persons and interests similarly situated.\n   </em>\n   U.S.Const.Amend. XIV ; La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 3 (1974).\n   <em>\n    The effect of the bond requirement is to create two classes of litigants indistinguishable from each other except that one is a private citizen and the other is an elected or appointed public official.\n   </em>\n   As a result of this distinction the class composed of public officials is entitled to demand that a bond for attorney's fees be furnished before the litigation may proceed; no corresponding privilege is afforded members of the other class. Litigants generally are required to pay their own attorney's fees in Louisiana. Failure to post the bond will result in dismissal of the lawsuit. This statutory scheme creates a\n   classification which substantially burdens the right of some persons to be compensated for injuries suffered by them while not placing such a burden on other individuals. Such classifications are permissible only if they are:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   ... reasonable, not arbitrary, and ... rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike....\n   <em>\n    Royster Guano Co. v.

The court noted that the purpose of the challenged sections was to protect public entities and public employees against unmeritorious litigation. As in this case, decisional law allowed the plaintiff an opportunity to qualify to proceed in forma pauperis. Under the statute, the court reasoned that a taking occurs if the plaintiff refuses to post the bond and thereby relinquishes his property interest in the form of his claim against the public entity or employee. Conversely, should the plaintiff secure his undertaking from a corporate entity, he will forfeit the nonrefundable premium; if money is deposited in court, the plaintiff is deprived of its use during pendency of the suit.

Defendants have made no showing that Plaintiffs' lawsuit for legal malpractice is frivolous or at least that Plaintiffs cannot prevail. Nor has there been any showing by Defendants that Plaintiffs would be unable to pay whatever costs are incurred and ultimately assessed against them should they lose. Further, I am not in the least persuaded by the suggestion that Plaintiffs might have some ability to post this bond because they received $50,000 in settlement of their claim which is now the subject of litigation. It is not hard to imagine, especially given Plaintiff's allegations, that this sum was woefully inadequate to even meet Plaintiff's out-of-pocket medical costs much less to assume that any portion of that amount is readily available for posting bond. And I am inclined to believe the attorneys did not waive their substantial percentage of attorney's fees. The Plaintiffs present a serious claim for legal malpractice which they have already shown appears to have merit and a reasonable chance at success.

That law required \"all tax recipient agencies of ad valorem taxes ... to furnish the legislative auditor the authorizing ordinances or resolutions, the tax rolls, and the tax rate to be applied to the assessed values for ad valorum tax purposes no later than June first of every year.\" La.R.S. 11:1481(1)(a) (ii)(aa). New Orleans asserted it was being treated differently but it failed to provide proof of that allegation. In fact, the supreme court's basis for rejecting the city's challenge to the statute was its finding that the statute had been amended and now provided the same treatment to all governing bodies including the City of New Orleans. Thus, there was no longer a singling out of New Orleans. Implicit in this ruling, and explicit in the court's rationale, is the notion that if the contested law had indeed continued to single out New Orleans for different treatment the statute would not pass constitutional scrutiny. Our courts have also addressed this type of equal protection challenge in the cases concerning the constitutionality of Louisiana's cap on medical malpractice recovery. In that line of cases the courts have engaged in important discussions regarding constitutional notions of equal protection embodied in our state constitution. In\n   <em>\n    Oliver v.

In\n   <em>\n    Oliver\n   </em>\n   we faced the first type of equal protection analysis under Louisiana law, discriminatory treatment based on a suspect classification. Such a challenge places a heavier burden on the state to justify the challenged law. Here, we analyze disparate treatment based on the statute's exempting from its requirement for posting surety the whole of Orleans Parish, the State and all its political subdivisions and paupers. The state must show that it has a compelling interest in denying these Plaintiffs their constitutional right of access to the courts and equal protection of the law. I believe the provision in the statute expressly exempting Orleans Parish, the State and its political subdivisions, and paupers, on its face, demonstrates the law unreasonably and arbitrarily creates classes of Louisiana residents treated differently. I can fathom no state interest that would justify treating all residents the same except those who happen to reside in Orleans Parish. Such a classification appears arbitrary on its face. This blatant disparate treatment embodied in the statute falls far short of Louisiana's constitutional mandate that all \"state laws\n   <em>\n    affect alike all persons and interests similarly situated.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    City of New Orleans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8179896\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/986/1/#p26\">\n    986 So.2d at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This law, on its face, does not affect all Louisiana residents who find themselves plaintiffs in law suits. I can discern no difference between a plaintiff who is a resident of Orleans Parish and one who resides anywhere else in this state. Likewise, the State has advanced no reasonable basis to support its preferential treatment to the State and its political subdivisions. As to the treatment of paupers, I believe the jurisprudence and common sense require no further comment. Clearly, the law as written does not affect all citizens of Louisiana the same and is, for the reasons stated, constitutionally infirm as applied to Plaintiffs. I therefore respectfully dissent from this portion of the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    The agreement, contained within the record, reflects the terms, in part, as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n    Defendant, Sheriff Doug Anderson, in his official capacity, agrees to pay the sum of $50,000.00 in full settlement of any and all claims asserted by Plaintiffs in the above numbered and entitled suit.

During his testimony Bize appeared to be extremely calm and assertive, talking in a normal pattern. It was remarkable to this Court that no emotion appeared from the voice of Bize. Shortly before the break a \"sniffle\" was noticed, however, Bize was still talking in a normal matter. All of a sudden Judge Spruill basically stated \"gentlemen I hate to interrupt but I have to take a brief recess for five minutes.\" There was absolutely no indication that this recess was precipitated by any condition of Bize. It appeared that the recess was taken simply because the Judge had some type of issue that he had to address. This is normal procedure in the Judicial field. If the recess would have been necessitated by the condition of Bize a 5 minute limitation would be unusual.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n    What is also striking to this Court is that Bize was not testifying about any serious issue. The testimony at the time of the recess concerned the retirement of the treating physician of Bize and the new doctor that Bize was being treated by.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n    During the recess the parties continued to discuss settlement of the claim and reached a settlement. The settlement was reduced to writing and filed. The Trial was continued without date.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n    During his testimony during Hearing, Larry Bize, Sr. confirmed that during the settlement negotiations his mental condition deteriorated. Larry Bize, Sr. confirms that Judge Kerry Spruill was not a witness to his condition during the negotiations. Larry Bize, Sr. confirmed that Judge Spruill was a witness to his emotional state during his testimony, which according to Judge Spruill, consisted of crying shortly before the recess. All evidence considered by this Court fails to reflect that the emotional state of Larry Bize, Sr. during his testimony was such that he lacked reason and understanding. Minor crying does not equate to less of a reason or understanding.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n    In their opposition to the defendant's\n    <em>\n     Motion to Enforce Settlement\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Agreement\n    </em>\n    , Larry Bize, Sr. contends that certain events occurred during the settlement negotiations which were witnessed by a Dr. Nolan. At no point does Larry Bize, Sr. allege that Judge Kerry Spruill witnessed any of these matters during the settlement negotiations. Again, it is most important to point out that Judge Kerry Spruill witnessed the testimony of Larry Bize, Sr. and during this testimony, a recess was called. Insufficient proof was submitted to show that this recess was called due to Bize being unable to continue his testimony. However, the evidence confirms that during settlement negotiations Judge Kerry Spruill was not present and was not a witness.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n    The issue pending before the Court is whether or not the settlement agreement entered into on November 13, 2015 and reduced to writing should be enforced. Larry Bize, Sr. contends that due to his severe anxiety, duress and suicidal ideation, he was deprived of reason. This severe anxiety, duress and suicidal ideation did not occur during his testimony. A crying episode occurred as testified to by Judge Kerry Spruill and confirmed by Larry Bize, Sr. Whether or not Larry Bize, Sr. had the mental capability during the negotiation process and at the time of execution of the settlement agreement consists of facts and circumstances which were not witnessed by Judge Kerry Spruill.

Malcolm Larvadain informed the Plaintiffs that the Judge said they had to settle and if no settlement were reached, he would dismiss the case. Due to failures in the pleadings as drafted, amendments and the filings and subsequent practice in not attempting to amend the petition to add claims under 42 USC 1983, or to address these claims with the Court and Defendants during negotiation, or take other action to remove the suit to federal court, the settlement obtained was woefully inadequate.

Larvadain committed violations of the Code of Professional Conduct in so doing. Specifically, he violated Rules 1.4: Communication and 4.1: Truthfulness in Statements to Others. Larvadain stated to Plaintiffs that the presiding Judge said they had to settle and had no choice. This was not true. Larvadain also violated Rule 1.14, Client with Diminished Capacity. Malcolm Larvadain understood that Mr. Bize's reasoning and capacity was diminished and thus he should have provided a continuance or longer recess to further evaluate Mr. Bize's capacity or sought the assistance of Dr. Noland who was present.
