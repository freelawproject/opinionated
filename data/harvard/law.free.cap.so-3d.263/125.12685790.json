We thus withdraw our previously\n   issued opinion and substitute the following.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellant Bluefield Ranch Mitigation Bank Trust (\"Bluefield\") sought to challenge the South Florida Water Management District's (\"District\") issuance of a permit to the Florida Department of Transportation (\"FDOT\") for a road-widening project. The District dismissed Bluefield's petition for a formal administrative proceeding (\"petition\") with prejudice, determining Bluefield lacked standing to challenge the permit. The District's decision was based on its determination that the only injury specifically alleged by Bluefield was economic. We disagree, and conclude that Bluefield has demonstrated standing beyond mere economic injury. We thus reverse the District's dismissal order and remand for a formal administrative proceeding on Bluefield's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The District is a government entity created under Chapter 373, Florida Statutes, which has the responsibility to conserve, protect, manage, and control water resources within its geographic boundaries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 373.016, .036, Fla. Stat. (2016). Bluefield is a privately-owned mitigation bank, established pursuant to section 373.4136, Florida Statutes, for the purpose of operating and managing the Bluefield Ranch Mitigation Bank. Mitigation banking is the practice in which a mitigation bank sells \"credits\" in exchange for conducting environmental enhancement and preservation to offset unavoidable adverse impacts to the wetlands and to other property within its mitigation service area caused by development or construction projects requiring a permit from the District.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 373.403(19), .4136(1), Fla. Stat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the time of receiving a mitigation bank permit, a mitigation bank is granted a certain number of mitigation credits. \u00a7 373.4136(4), Fla. Stat. Each credit is a unit of measure representing the increase in ecological value to offset adverse impacts within the bank's service area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 373.403(20), (21), Fla. Stat. A mitigation bank sells its credits to the permittee of the proposed project, who applies them to meet its mitigation requirements. Bluefield is a permitted mitigation bank, with property situated within the service area and regional watershed of the project at issue. Mitigation service areas can overlap, and mitigation service areas for two or more mitigation banks may be approved for a regional watershed. \u00a7 373.4136(6), Fla. Stat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   FDOT applied for a permit, which the District issued, for its project to widen a section of State Road 710/Beeline Highway. Per the permit, FDOT was required to purchase mitigation credits as a means of offsetting the environmental impact to the wetlands from the road-widening project. FDOT purchased some of the required mitigation credits from Bluefield, but most of the mitigation was to be provided by Dupuis Reserve (\"Dupuis\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In its petition challenging the use of mitigation credits from Dupuis, Bluefield argued that Dupuis did not meet certain statutory criteria to be considered for mitigation on the project. Therefore, FDOT was required to consider Bluefield for the mitigation credits that would otherwise be provided by Dupuis. The petition asserted that Bluefield has standing to challenge FDOT's permit because, as a mitigation bank, it has a substantial interest in the enforcement of statutory compliance for mitigation within its service area and within the same regional watershed as the project. That \"substantial interest,\" the petition contends, is to prevent environmental harm caused by unlawful mitigation. Bluefield further argued that it had standing because, as a landowner in the affected\n   area, it has a substantial interest in the protection of the environment and the continued restoration, enhancement, and preservation of wetlands within its regional watershed and service area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The District dismissed Bluefield's petition with prejudice, concluding that Bluefield failed to (and could not) allege facts demonstrating it had substantial interests (other than purely economic interests) that would be affected by the issuance of the permit. On appeal, Bluefield requests a reversal of the dismissal and an opportunity to present its challenge at an administrative hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In reviewing agency determinations on issues which do not require special agency expertise, such as standing, we accept the allegations in the petition as true, and are not required to give any deference to the agency's legal conclusions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.

Bluefield, like Ybor, is a for-profit company. The purpose of the statute in\n   <em>\n    Ybor\n   </em>\n   was to provide affordable housing through financing affordable housing to low income applicants, provided by private companies that were the recipients of government grants. The purpose of the statute at issue here is the protection of water resources and the ecosystem through the use of mitigation, funded by the sale of mitigation credits. Bluefield's interests are greater than purely economic: mitigation banks were created and are regulated for the very purpose of mitigating the adverse impacts to wetlands caused by construction and development. Bluefield argues that, by choosing an unlawful\n   mitigation option, FDOT and the District are subverting the statutory scheme. Bluefield is a mitigation bank located within the same regional watershed and service area as the project, creating a substantial interest in the enforcement of statutory compliance for mitigation for this project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Another case applicable to the instant situation is\n   <em>\n    Town of Palm Beach v.

There, we reversed an agency determination that certain property owners did not have a substantial interest in an agency's eventual determination that certain landscaping activities on the beach were outside of its jurisdiction, thereby not requiring a permit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7535912\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/577/1383/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7535912\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/577/1383/\">\n    at 1384-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The petitioning parties included the Town of Palm Beach, which owned Phipps Ocean Park within 1000 feet of the condominium and alleged that the Park would suffer damage if the landscaping activity continued, and Dave Darwin, who owned a property within 1000 feet of the condominium and alleged that his property would be damaged by the continued disruption of the dune system.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7535912\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/577/1383/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7535912\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/577/1383/\">\n    at 1385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We found that both of these petitioners had a substantial interest in challenging the agency's determination because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   the statute and administrative proceedings are designed to protect the entire beach/dune system of the state of Florida, and [the petitioners] allege that [the landscaping activities] will harm the dune system in the area of [the condominium's] property. Therefore [the petitioners] have made sufficient allegations to meet the test of standing under\n   <em>\n    Agrico\n   </em>\n   and are entitled to a hearing to present evidence to support their allegations of standing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7535912\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/577/1383/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7535912\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/577/1383/\">\n    at 1388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Town of Palm Beach\n   </em>\n   , the distance from the petitioning party to the point of environmental damage (here, the FDOT road-widening project) was sufficiently close that the harm alleged can be reasonably expected. That is to say, Bluefield, like the petitioners in\n   <em>\n    Town of Palm Beach\n   </em>\n   , are within the \"zone of interest\" of the proposed environmental permit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vill. of Key Biscayne v. Dep't of Envtl. Prot.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193179\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so3d/206/788/#p790\">\n    206 So.3d 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 790 (Fla. 3d DCA 2016) (citing\n   <em>\n    Hamilton Cty.

An argument of potential environmental injury to Bluefield's conservation acreage is reasonable based on Bluefield's location within the same regional watershed and mitigation service area. That is not to say that mitigation banks within a service area will have standing to challenge a permit on that fact alone, but Bluefield is also located in close proximity to the project within the same regional watershed, and it could reasonably be affected by the issuance of a permit to allow Dupuis, without the statutory compliance required, to provide mitigation in the same service area and regional watershed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Rosenzweig\n   </em>\n   , the First District used the\n   <em>\n    Agrico\n   </em>\n   test to determine whether a bicyclist organization had standing to challenge FDOT's interpretation of a statute specifically relating to bicycle lanes.\n   <em>\n    Rosenzweig\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8388479\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/979/1050/#p1053\">\n    979 So.2d at 1053\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The First District noted that the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Agrico\n   </em>\n   test was satisfied because the organization's members \"will not have a delineated path on which to ride their bicycles if bicycle lanes are not constructed pursuant to [FDOT's] standards.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8388479\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/979/1050/#p1053\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8388479\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/979/1050/#p1053\">\n    at 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The second prong was satisfied because: \"Reason dictates that a bicyclist organization ... can demonstrate that a substantial number of its members will be affected by [FDOT's] decisions relating to the construction of bicycle paths.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8388479\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/979/1050/#p1053\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In finding the organization had standing, the\n   First District stated that \"it is clear that if\n   <em>\n    anyone\n   </em>\n   has the ability to challenge [FDOT's] interpretation of section 335.065, which specifically relates to bicycle lanes, it would be those seriously involved in bicycling.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8388479\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/979/1050/#p1053\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Similarly here, should mitigation by Dupuis be unlawful, it subjects the shared service area and regional watershed to harm, including degradation of the mitigation bank that Bluefield is entrusted to protect and manage into perpetuity. Harm to the wetlands is the injury in fact, and Bluefield has a substantial interest in ensuring compliance with the statutory scheme. Here too, it can be reasonably argued that if\n   <em>\n    anyone\n   </em>\n   has the ability to challenge FDOT's compliance with the \"must consider\" provision, it would be those permitted mitigation banks like Bluefield, which seek to challenge a permit that purportedly allows unlawful mitigation within its service area and regional watershed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As set forth above, we reverse the District's dismissal, and find that the four corners of the petition adequately alleged standing because it was reasonably foreseeable that Bluefield's conservation acreage could be adversely affected by the degradation of the regional watershed and ecosystem caused by the selection of a purportedly unlawful mitigation option. We thus remand for a formal administrative proceeding on Bluefield's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and remanded\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Taylor and Klingensmith, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    A third proffered rationale for standing, that Bluefield had \"preferred status,\" is rejected without further discussion or analysis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
