Espinosa appeals a denial of a post-conviction motion to correct an illegal sentence pursuant to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.800. Espinosa raised four issues to the trial court and raises those same four issues, plus an additional one, on appeal. We affirm, and issue an order to show cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Espinosa was convicted and sentenced in two cases involving burglary. In case number F02-13719, he was convicted of burglary of an unoccupied dwelling and sentenced to forty years in prison, with a thirty-year minimum mandatory sentence as a Violent Career Criminal and a fifteen-year minimum mandatory sentence as a Prison Releasee Reoffender. He was also convicted of criminal mischief and petit theft with sentences to run concurrently with the burglary sentence. This Court affirmed his direct appeal in\n   <em>\n    Espinosa v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=905%20So.%202d%20139\">\n    905 So.2d 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 3d DCA 2005) (table).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In case number F02-14356, Espinosa was convicted of burglary and sentenced to forty years in prison, with a thirty-year minimum mandatory sentence as a Violent Career Criminal and a fifteen-year minimum mandatory sentence as a Prison Releasee Reoffender. He was also convicted of grand theft and was sentenced to fifteen years in prison with a ten-year minimum mandatory sentence as a Violent Career Criminal. He was designated a Habitual Offender. This Court affirmed his direct appeal in\n   <em>\n    Espinosa v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=888%20So.%202d%20642\">\n    888 So.2d 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 3d DCA 2004) (table).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the trial court and in the instant appeal, Espinosa makes the following four arguments: (i) he was entitled to a separate hearing to determine whether he met the criteria to be enhanced as a Violent Career Criminal; (ii) he was not afforded sufficient notice prior to enhanced sentencing; (iii) proof of his earlier convictions for enhancement purposes was inadequate; and (iv) the State failed to prove his earlier convictions through fingerprinting. On appeal, Espinosa adds a fifth argument: the trial court's denial of his rule 3.800 motion was error because the trial court failed to attach the necessary record excerpts to its order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We have reviewed Espinosa's arguments and conclude that they are without merit. In addition to Espinosa's two direct appeals, he has filed in this Court twenty-one post-conviction appeals and petitions in the past fourteen years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his first two post-conviction appeals, Espinosa prevailed in having his sentencing either re-examined or adjusted. In\n   <em>\n    Espinosa v. State\n   </em>\n   , 916 So.2d at 48, this Court reversed a post-conviction order and remanded the case to the trial court to examine whether Espinosa was entitled to additional credit for jail time served. In\n   <em>\n    Espinosa v. State\n   </em>\n   , 937 So.2d at 754, this Court partially reversed a post-conviction order, determining, upon State concession, that Espinosa's sentences in case number F02-14356 should run concurrently rather than consecutively. Perhaps emboldened by these early successes, Espinosa subsequently filed multiple petitions and appeals. They have been to no avail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Lastly, Espinosa argues that the trial court erred by failing to attach materials to the order on appeal that refute Espinosa's claim for relief. It was, however, Espinosa's burden, not that of the trial court or the State, to supply record excerpts that demonstrate his entitlement to relief under rule 3.800.\n   <em>\n    Cox v.
