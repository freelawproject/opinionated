Crosby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9676631\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/338/584/\">\n    338 So.2d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. 1976). For the reasons that follow, we affirm defendant's convictions and sentences and remand with instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural History and Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 21, 2016, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney filed a bill of information charging defendant, Rickey Overstreet, with possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of La. R.S. 40:967 A (count one); possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of La. R.S. 14:95.1 (count two); and possession of Tramadol in violation of La. R.S. 40:969 C (count three). At his arraignment, defendant pled not guilty to the charged offenses. On November 16, 2016, the State amended the bill of information charging defendant with the additional offense of possession with intent to distribute marijuana and/or synthetic cannabinoids in violation of La. R.S. 40:966 A (count four). Defendant was re-arraigned on November 28, 2016, on the amended bill and pled not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 22, 2016, defendant filed motions to suppress evidence and statement. On March 16, 2017, the trial court denied defendant's motions to suppress. On the same date, a hearing was held on the State's \"Notice of Intent to Use Other Acts Evidence Pursuant to L.C.E. Article 404 B.\" The trial court granted the State's motion with respect to defendant's prior arrests, but took the State's 404B motion under advisement regarding the text message evidence sought to be used by the State at trial. On April 5, 2017, the trial court granted the State's 404B motion with respect to the text message evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 5, 2017, defendant filed a supervisory writ application with this Court challenging the trial court's March 16, 2017 judgment denying his motions to suppress evidence and statement and the trial court's April 5, 2017 judgment granting the State's 404 B motion. This Court denied defendant's writ application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 11, 2017, defendant withdrew his former pleas of not guilty, and after being advised of his\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights, pled guilty under\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   , to the amended bill of information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment at hard labor on counts one, two, and four and to five years imprisonment at hard labor on count three. The trial court ordered defendant's sentences to be served concurrently with one another and any other sentence defendant may be currently\n   serving. The trial court also recommended defendant for any and all self-help programs available through the Department of Corrections, including substance abuse treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the same date, the State filed a habitual offender bill of information alleging defendant to be a second-felony offender on count one, to which defendant stipulated. The trial court vacated the original sentence on count one and resentenced defendant to fifteen years imprisonment without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence. The trial court ordered defendant's enhanced sentence to be served concurrently with the original sentences imposed on counts two, three, and four.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 16, 2018, defendant filed an application for post-conviction relief seeking an out-of-time appeal, which the trial court granted. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because defendant entered guilty pleas, the underlying facts were not fully developed at trial. However, during the guilty plea colloquy, the State provided the following factual bases for the guilty pleas:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Yes, Your Honor. If this matter had proceeded to trial, the State would prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant violated Louisiana Revised Statute 40:967(A) in that he did knowingly or intentionally possess with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance, to wit cocaine on or about August 17th of 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   For Count 2, the State would prove beyond a reasonable doubt that on or about August 17th of 2016 the Defendant violated Louisiana Revised Statute 14:95.1 in that he did have in his possession a firearm, to wit a Kel-Tec P-11 caliber 9 millimeter Luger handgun having been previously convicted of the crime of possession with intent to distribute marijuana in violation of Louisiana Revised Statute 40:966(A) under Case Number 04-4982 on August 20th, 2007, in Division A of the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   For Count 3, the State would prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant violated Louisiana Revised Statute 40:969(C) in that he did knowingly or intentionally possess a controlled dangerous substance, to wit tramadol on or about August 17th of 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   For Count 4, the State would prove beyond a reasonable doubt that on or about August 17th of 2016 the Defendant did violate Louisiana Revised Statute 40:966(A) in that he did knowingly or intentionally possess with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance, to wit marijuana.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In his counseled assignment of error, defendant argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He contends the officers made an illegal, \"pretext\" stop of his vehicle because they were familiar with him, as it is highly unlikely that Detective Keenan Jackson observed him without a seat belt given the distance, time of day, and window tinting on his vehicle. Even assuming a valid stop, defendant contends the officers had no authority to search or question him or to search his vehicle solely based upon an alleged seat belt violation. He further claims the officers were not authorized to search or detain him for a period of time longer than reasonably necessary to issue\n   a citation for the seat belt violation absent reasonable suspicion of additional criminal activity. Because the officers had no reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, defendant argues the officers' conduct was not reasonably related to the circumstances that justified the stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In defendant's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   assignments of error, defendant additionally argues that Detective Jackson did not have authority to order him from his vehicle once stopped for the alleged seat belt violation. He also contends that the police officers violated La. R.S. 32:295.1 F\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   when they used the seat belt law as a basis for probable cause to stop and search defendant and his vehicle without additional evidence of ongoing criminal activity. Defendant argues that the mere backing up of his vehicle is not a specific articulable fact of ongoing criminal activity; therefore, the property seized was illegally obtained, without his consent, and pursuant to an illegitimate detention in violation of La. C.Cr.P. art. 215.1 D.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The transcript, the waiver of rights form, the sentencing minute entry, and defendant's APCR seeking an out-of-time appeal reflect that defendant's guilty pleas were entered under\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   . While a plea of guilty normally waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings prior to the plea, a plea under\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   allows appellate review if, at the time the plea is entered, the defendant expressly reserves his right to appeal a specific adverse ruling in the case.\n   <em>\n    State v. Turner\n   </em>\n   , 10-995 (La. App. 5 Cir. 9/27/11),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7027600\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/75/491/#p492\">\n    75 So.3d 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 492,\n   <em>\n    writ denied\n   </em>\n   , 11-2379 (La. 4/27/12),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7017280,7017317,7017198,7017375\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/86/625/\">\n    86 So.3d 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The record does not reflect the specific ruling defendant desired to preserve for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A defendant's failure to specify which pre-trial ruling he desires to reserve for appeal as part of a guilty plea entered under\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   may limit the scope of appellate review, but does not preclude review altogether.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Absent a detailed specification of which adverse pre-trial rulings the defendant reserved for appellate review as part of his guilty plea, an appellate court should presume that the\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   reservation preserves review of those evidentiary rulings which \"go to the heart of the prosecution's case,\" such as the denial of a motion to suppress, and not rulings that may affect the conduct of the trial but do not substantially relate to guilt, such as the denial of a continuance or severance.\n   <em>\n    Joseph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9133912\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/847/1196/\">\n    847 So.2d at 1196-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Considering the foregoing, we find that the denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence is properly before this Court on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Upon running the vehicle's license plate, they discovered the driver of the vehicle to be Rickey Overstreet, defendant, whom Officer Frumveller knew from prior narcotics investigations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   While conducting surveillance, they observed a female passenger exit the vehicle, enter the gas station, and return to the vehicle a few moments later. Detective Jackson testified that they again attempted to conduct their traffic stop for the seat belt violation once defendant started to exit the parking lot by following behind defendant's vehicle, which was about to turn onto Airline Highway. Defendant noticed them and immediately drove in reverse through the parking lot and pulled up to one of the gas station pumps. Detective Jackson testified that when he pulled up behind defendant's vehicle, defendant exited the vehicle as if he was going to flee on foot and he instructed defendant to get back into the vehicle. Detective Jackson then approached the vehicle and observed that defendant was \"very nervous, sweating, shaking\" and did not make eye contact. As a result, defendant and his passenger, Joy Franklin, were ordered to exit the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Detective Jackson further testified that once defendant was out of the vehicle, he was \"getting ready\" to conduct a pat-down of defendant's person when defendant informed him that he had a \"blunt\" (marijuana cigar) in his pocket. Detective Jackson recovered the marijuana cigar from defendant's back pocket, placed defendant under arrest, and advised defendant of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights. A search of his person incident to arrest further revealed marijuana and pills later identified as Tramadol.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Detective Jackson asked defendant whether there was anything in the vehicle he should \"be aware of\" and defendant stated that there was a handgun inside the vehicle. The weapon was located inside the vehicle where defendant indicated and was secured. Detective Jackson then verbally asked defendant if they could search his vehicle, to which defendant consented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Pursuant to defendant's consent, Detective Jackson testified that a search of the vehicle was performed and a clear plastic bag containing off-white, rock-like objects was recovered inside a compartment under the steering wheel and defendant's cell phone was seized from the vehicle's dashboard. Defendant was then transported to the Kenner Police Department where he was advised of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights for a second time and executed a waiver of rights form.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   A search warrant was also prepared and executed for the contents of defendant's cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant's passenger, Ms. Franklin, testified that on the evening of August 17, 2016, defendant was wearing his seat belt. Ms. Franklin further testified that before defendant attempted to turn onto Airline Highway, she noticed that \"them people\" were following them. Defendant told her to \"chill out. Just wait a minute; let's see,\" at which time defendant reversed his vehicle back into the parking lot to see if \"they\" were following them. Ms. Franklin denied ownership of the contraband found in defendant's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, defense counsel argued that it would have been impossible for Detective Jackson to have seen the alleged seat belt violation given his location, the time of day, and the position of defendant's vehicle at the time the violation was observed. Thus, without the seat belt violation to justify the stop, defense counsel argued the motion to suppress should be granted. Defense counsel further contended that there was an alleged temporal issue between the observance of the traffic violation and the actual stop. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence and statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In a hearing on a motion to suppress evidence seized without a warrant, the State bears the burden of establishing the admissibility of evidence. La. C.Cr.P. art. 703 D. The trial court's denial of a motion to suppress is afforded great weight and its ruling will not be set aside unless the preponderance of the evidence clearly favors suppression.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In 1999, the legislature removed language prohibiting police officers from stopping a vehicle solely on the basis of a seat belt violation, indicating the legislature's intent to allow police to stop vehicles and issue citations for that violation alone.

We find the initial stop was justified and find no error in the trial court's conclusion that Officer Jackson had a clear and unobstructed view of defendant's seat belt violation. Furthermore, defendant's contention that the police officers made a \"pretext\" stop based upon their familiarity with defendant and not because of an alleged seat belt violation is lacking in merit as the alleged true intent of the officer is not to be considered.\n   <em>\n    Whren v.
