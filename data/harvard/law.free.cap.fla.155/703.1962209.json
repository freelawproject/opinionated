Registration of Voters. The Supervisor of Registration of the County of Pinellas shall be the registration officer for the City of Clearwater. Each person who is a qualified elector of the City of Clearwater, as provided by Section 161 of Chapter 9710, Special Acts of 1923, and who desires to be registered as an elector of the City of Clear-water, shall take the following oath to be administered by the supervisor of registration or his duly authorised deputy:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avb\">\u201c T do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I am a b\u00f3na fide resident of the City of Clearwater, Florida, and possess all of the qualifications of an elector of said City.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-12\">\u201cAny person' taking \u25a0 s\u00fach oath who shall swear falsely shall be deemed guilty of perjury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-13\">It was contended .in the court below,. and that court so held, that this Act violates Sec. 20, Article III of the Constitution of Florida in that it is a special or local Act regulating the jurisdiction and duties of a county officer.1 With this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>conclusion we do not agree. This Act designates the supervisor of registration of Pinellas County as registration officer of the City of Clearwater. This does not result in regulating the jurisdiction or duties of the supervisor of registration of Pinellas County and in no way changes or affects the performance of his duties as such county officer. The effect of the statute is to make him registration officer of the municipality of Clearwater and to define his jurisdiction and duties as such registration officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">, This case is on all-fours with the case of State v. Armstrong, 103 Fla. 121, 137 So. 140, and is ruled by that case and authorities there cited. See also State v. Holbrook, 129 Fla. 241, 176 So. 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Therefore, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded with direction that the petition be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b729-8\">CHAPMAN, C. J., TERRELL, BROWN, THOMAS, ADAMS and SEBRING, J. J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b729-9\">BROWN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ANb_\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">I think the conclusion reached is strengthened when the question involved is considered in connection with our decisions construing Sec. 8, Art. VIII of the Constitution.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
