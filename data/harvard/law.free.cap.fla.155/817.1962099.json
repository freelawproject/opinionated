If the indictment, though inartificially drawn, substantially charges the alleged fugitive from the commission of a crime under the laws of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>the demanding state, it is sufficient. See Pierce v. Creecy, 210 U. S. 387, 28 Sup. Ct. 714, 52 L. Ed. 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The form of indictment as used in this case has been held sufficient to substantially charge a criminal offense under the laws of the State of New York. See People v. Bogandoff, et al., 254 N. Y. 16, 171 N. E. 890, 69 A.L.R. 1378; People v. Farley, 298 N. Y. Sup. 876, affirmed by Court of Appeals, 277 N. Y. 617, 14 N. E. (2nd) 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b843-8\">CHAPMAN, C.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AyV\">concurring specially:</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">The legal sufficiency of an indictment among other questions was involved in the extradition proceedings of Thompson v. Sheriff Baker reported in 154 Fla. 303, 17 So. (2nd) 228. I, therefore, concur in the opinion and judgment as prepared by Mr. Justice BUFORD in the case at bar.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
