This is the second appearance of the cause here.. See 151 Fla. 406, 10 So. (2nd) 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">We think the opinion and judgment rendered upon rehearing granted established the law of the case. In that opinion it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-14\">\u201cThe continued use as the corporate name of \u2018Tatem Surf Club, Inc.\u2019 by the defendant is clearly a violation of the statute; the alleged injury to plaintiff is substantial and peculiar to its statutory rights. The elimination of the word \u2018club\u2019 from defendant\u2019s corporate name does not affect the defendant\u2019s authorized business franchise or rights; and a lawful name may be used. The allegations show justiciable injury to plaintiff having a prior lawful right, and the law affords appropriate remedy by due course of law in order that right and justice may be administered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>There we held that the use of the name \u201cTatem Surf Club, Inc.\u201d by the defendant is a clear violation of the.statute and the rationale of the opinion was that while this alone would not be sufficient ground for granting the relief prayed, yet, that condition existing, taken together with the alleged substantial and peculiar injury to the plaintiff, did state ground for relief. So the only question presented for our consideration at this time is, whether or not the proof supports the allegations showing a justiciable injury of plaintiff having a prior lawful right'to the use of the word \u201cclub\u201d in the name under which it operates.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The special master found, inter alia, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-6\">\u201cThe evidence fails to establish that there is any actual confusion in the minds of persons doing business with plaintiff, or in the minds, of the members of the general public, as to the identities of plaintiff and defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-7\">\u201c11. The evidence fails to establish that defendant has endeavored or is endeavoring to pass off its business as the business of plaintiff. There is no evidence that any of plaintiff\u2019s business has been or is being unfairly diverted to defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-8\">\u201c12. The evidence fails to establish that defendant\u2019s use of the word \u2018Club\u2019 in its name has caused any damage or injury to plaintiff or to the members of plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">And then, in his conclusions of law, found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-10\">\u201cThe evidence fails to show that defendant\u2019s use of the word \u2018club\u2019 in its name has caused any damage or injury to plaintiff or its members. The evidence fails to show that defendant has endeavored or is endeavoring to pass off its business as the business of plaintiff, The evidence fails to show that any of the plaintiff\u2019s business has been or is being diverted to defendant. Consequently said court should enter a decree dismissing said amended bill of complaint and the cause of action therein pleaded out of court with prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AC8\">The Court entered its final decree as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-11\">\u201cIt Is Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that the exceptions to the master\u2019s report herein filed be and the same is herpby .overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>It Is Further Ordered that the master\u2019s report stand confirmed and that the bill of complaint as amended stand dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">We are unable to say that the decree of the court is clearly erroneous or is against the weight of the evidence. Therefore, the decree should be and is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b822-6\">CHAPMAN, C. J., TERRELL and ADAMS, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
