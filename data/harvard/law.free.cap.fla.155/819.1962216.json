I am constrained to say, however, that while the record fails to disclose any facts or circumstances requiring a reversal of the judgment for a new trial or a reversal of the judgment with directions for modification of the judgment and sentence under the provisions of Section 310, Fla. Criminal Procedure Act, there appear in the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>matters which should properly appeal to the consideration of the board of pardons for clemency and upon which the jury might well have based a recommendation for mercy.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">I, therefore, respectfully commend the petitioner to the tender mercy of the board of pardons for the consideration of the petition for commutation from death to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">I base my recommendation in this regard not only on the original record as it appears in this Court but also on exhibits which are attached to and made a part of the petition for leave to apply to the lower court for writ of error coram nobis.</p>\n<judges id=\"b845-6\">CHAPMAN, C.
