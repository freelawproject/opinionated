Incurred in the Exercise of Any of the Powers Granted By This Act; Authorizing Said Authority to Fix, Regulate and Collect Rates and Charges for the Services and Facilities Furnished By Any Project under Its Control, and to Pledge the Revenues of Any Such Project to the Payment of Such Bonds; Providing for the Execution of a Trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>Agreement Securing the Payment of Such Bonds without Mortgaging or Encumbering Any Such Project; and Exempting All Such Bonds and Such Projects from Taxation and Providing for a Referendum Election.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The bill of complaint was dismissed and plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Appellant states the question involved as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-7\">\u201cDid the Court err in dismissing the bill of complaint which alleges the illegal expenditure of public funds under authority granted by an illegal legislative Act, known as House Bill No. 652, and which creates the Greater Miami Port Authority?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">Under this question it is contended that the Act violates Section 1 of Article III, Section 16 of Article III, Section 21 of Article III, Section 6 of Article IX and Section 7 of Article IX of our Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">Neither of these contentions is tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">Section 1 of Article III is not violated because the Act is a complete legislative declaration to become operative upon the happening of a particular event. See State v. Sammons, 62 Fla. 303, 57 So. 196; State v. A.C.L. Ry. Co. 56 Fla. 617, 47 So. 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">Section 16 of Article III is not violated because the Act embraces but one subject and <em>matter properly connected therewith. </em>See Buford, Attorney General, v. Daniel, et al., 87 Fla. 270, 99 So. 804, and cases there cited. State v. Bryan, 50 Fla. 293, 39 So. 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">Section 21 of Article III is not violated because the 1928 Amendment to our Constitution in this regard provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-13\">\u201cProvided, however, no publication or any local or special law is required hereunder when such local or special law contains a provision to the effect that the same shall not become operative or effective until the sam\u00e9 has been ratified or approved by a majority of the qualified electors participating in an election called in the territory affected by said special or local law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">The Act only affected the powers and jurisdiction of the City of Miami to be exercised by the City through the Port <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>Authority. No. property belonging to any other municipality, authority or agency was proposed to be vested in the Port Authority. The Port Authority was given no power of taxation and it is not authorized to acquire any property except in the name of the City of Miami. It is not authorized to pledge the taxing power of the Ctiy of Miami for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Section 6 of Article IX is not violated because this Section as amended in 1930 only applies to bonds sought to be issued which pledge the taxing power or some other property or resource besides the net earnings of a particular utility which is to be benefitted by the fund. See State v. City of Tampa, 148 Fla. 6, 3 So. (2nd) 484, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The Act confers no taxing power on the Port Authority and authorizes it to issue bonds or certificates payable solely from net revenues of the projects for the benefit of which suit bonds or. certificates are issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Section 7 of Article IX is not violated b\u00e9cause there is no authority in the Port Authority to levy or to pledge the proceeds of any tax whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">The Port Authority is merely a functionary (as distinguished from a department) of the City of Miami established to manage and control an important function of the municipal government of that City, with limited powers and with no authority to pledge the taxing power or the general credit of the City. In this regard it is only authorized to pledge the net earnings of the particular facility or utility to be acquired; benefitted, extended or constructed and involved in the transaction. This does not mean that the municipality through its proper officers may not acquire by other means facilities or utilities to be turned over to the management and control of the Port Authority, as to which we express no opinion, because such question is not involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b860-10\">CHAPMAN, C.
