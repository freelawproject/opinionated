See Colson v. State, 70 Fla. 267, 71 So. 277; also see State v. Meysenberg, 171 Mo. 1, 71 S.W. Rep. 229, and 1 Archb. Crim. Prac. &amp; Pleading, page 275, Sec. 88, wherein it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">\u201cIt has already been mentioned that the indictment must state all the facts and circumstances comprised in the definition of the offense, by the rule of the common law or statute on which the indictment is founded. And these must be stated with clearness and certainty, otherwise the indictment will be had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">\u201cThe principal rule, as to the certainty required in an indictment may, I think, be correctly laid down thus: that where the definition of an offense whether by a rule of the common law or by statute, includes generic terms (as it necessarily must) it is not sufficient that the indictment should charge the offense in the same generic terms as in the definition, but it must state the species \u2014 it must descend to particulars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">The information entirely fails to advise the accused as to what charge he is required to defend against.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Therefore, the petitioner is discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b700-11\">CHAPMAN, C.
