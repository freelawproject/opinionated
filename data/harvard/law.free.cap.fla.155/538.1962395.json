Each was paid sixty per cent of commissions on sales negotiated by him, forty per cent going to the employer. There was a rule in the organization, promulgated by the sales manager himself so he testified on the stand, that after a salesman interviewed a prospective purchaser \u201cthat prospect was supposed to be that salesman\u2019s prospect until he was disposed of one way or another.\u201d This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>plan, so we gather from his,testimony, protected the salesman \u201cespecially, through the vacation period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">While the salesman, appellee, was on vacation the sales manager, appellant, sold some property to clients of the former. The commission came to $875, $350 of which was indisputably the corporation\u2019s. There then arose a controversy over the remainder. The president of the corporation precipitated the matter by undertaking to pay the sales manager; who actually negotiated the sale, sixty per cent of the residue of the commission and the salesman, whose clients the prospects or purchasers were, under the sales manager\u2019s rule, forty per cent. The sales manager protested the division and sued for the full amount, whereupon interpleader was instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Clearly the employer owed its employees the definite sum of $525, an obligation it acknowledged when it attempted to divide their share of the commission. It is' a strange commentary that an employer could not decide as between two employees the share each should have in the fixed sum of money and found it necessary to resort to a court to settle what amounted to a squabble in the corporate family. True, it is the function of a court to settle disputes and interpret laws, but a suit in interpleader does not fall strictly within the class of the usual adversary action, and for plaintiff to prevail certain fairly well defined rules must be followed and certain elements must be present. Before remarking upon these in detail it is well to make a few general observations relative to the availability and the object of the remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">A person may maintain such a suit where he is a stakeholder and two or more persons, whose titles are connected because one derives from the other or both have a common origin, claim from him the same thing, debt, or duty and he does not know which should succeed. If the plaintiff has become liable, even for the same demand, to two claimants, he is not entitled to an interpleader. It is the essential fact that he. should actually be liable to only one of the claimants.\u201d Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, Fifth Edition, Vol. IV, page 904. The same writer announced that the remedy was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>intended to prevent the risk of two recoveries but the vexation of two suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Having made certain general observations we specify the four conditions indispensable to successful maintenance of interpleader. The claims must be dependent or have a common origin, Florida East Coast Ry. Co. v. Eno, et al., 99 Fla. 887, 128 So. 622; the same thing, debt (or duty), or stake must be claimed by the defendants; the plaintiff must have no interest in the subject matter \u2014 that is, in strict inter-pleader as distinguished from a suit in the nature of inter-pleader, Lowry, et al., v. Downing Mfg. Co., et al., 80 Fla. 745, 87 So. 65; and the plaintiff must be in a position of indifference, having incurred no independent liability to either claimant (Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, supra; 30 Am. Jur., Interpleader, page :218), and it must appear \u201cthat no act on his part has caused the embarassment of conflicting claims and the peril of double vexation.\u201d Fogg v. Goode, infra.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The only component which may be dismissed at the outset is the common origin of the defendants\u2019 claims. This seems to have been established. It is very doubtful that plaintiff\u2019s status as a \u201cstakeholder,\u201d its ignorance of the manner in which the conflicting claims should be determined, its disinterestedness and indifference, its freedom from independent liability are of the quality contemplated by the lawmakers as the remedy developed. The authorities we have consulted have referred to the plaintiff in a suit of this kind as a \u201cstakeholder,\u201d a \u201cmere stakeholder,\u201d a \u201cmere depositary,\u201d and this Court, in Florida East Coast Ry. Co. v. Eno, supra, used the term \u201cmere innocent stakeholder.\u201d We understand a stakeholder to b\u00e9 a person in possession of a fund with a naked authority to deliver it upon a contingency or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event. The adjective \u201cmere\u201d when so applied probably means \u201conly this and nothing more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Assuming that plaintiff occupied such a position, the stake was its own creation. It was established by the simple mathematical process of subtracting the corporation\u2019s share of a commission earned for it by the defendants. Upon failing to distribute the remainder to the satisfaction of the two claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>ants\u201e sales manager and salesman, the. corporation proclaimed itself in its bill \u201ca mere stakeholder\u201d and prayed for a decree exonerating it \u201cfrom any . . . liability, obligation or responsibility to said defendants . . . respecting said fund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">It is passing strange that the plaintiff should attempt to assume such a perfectly detached attitude when the defendants are its employees, one or both entitled to compensation for the services which fetched the original fee for its benefit. We think the plaintiff was not \u201ca mere stakeholder\u201d but an employer with a direct obligation to its employees, or one of them, which it recognized in its effort to distribute the money. The underlying responsibility sprang from this relationship, and it is difficult to see how the plaintiff, an employer, could disclaim any intelligence of the manner of properly compensating its own employees, particularly in view of its own effort to apportion the agents\u2019 share of the commission. As we have stated, the plaintiff\u2019s position is that it has a fund which two persons claim, although it is actually indebted for an employment, and it wishes to escape further responsibility and difficulty by letting the court decide to what extent each employee shall share, if at all, in the total amount to be distributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">We think there was an independent liability on the part of \u2022the plaintiff, a liability to compensate an employee, and this ingredient is closely allied with the. element of interest. We have given the fourth condition from Pomery. We quote the one in American Jurisprudence which is nearly identical: (4) the plaintiff must have incurred no independent liability to either of the claimants, but <em>must stand indifferent between them merely as a stakeholder \u201d </em>(Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">It seems to us there was a definite obligation from the plaintiff employer to his employees, or one of them, and that it could not \u201cwash its hands\u201d of that, for the \u201ccomplainant cannot cast upon the claimants the burden of settling the question of whether the complainant has obligated himself to one of the parties. <em>The complainant is supposed to know whether or not he has.\u201d </em>\u201cThe remedy ... is based upon the theory that conflicting claimants should litigate their claims among themselves without involving the stakeholder in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>disputes.\u201d (Italics ours.) Jax Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co., et al., v. South Florida Farms Co., 90 Fla. 593, 109 So. 212. 48 A.L.R. 957. See also Fogg v. Goode, 78 Fla. 138, 82 So. 614. But why should the plaintiff be absolved when it was responsible for compensating its own employees and should be sufficiently informed of the amount from' the very nature of the relationship ?</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">From a study of this record we are not convinced that this employer was only a stakeholder, hence should have been spared the annoyance of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Aside from the rule involving identity, which we need not discuss in this case, the court seems to have recognized and applied the principles stated by the authors of American Jurisprudence, Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, and Corpus Juris. Bearing in mind the object and purpose of the remedy and following the way already charted by our own pronouncements, we can only arrive at the conclusion that it was not available to the plaintiff. Plaintiff was not so disinterested, indifferent, or detached as to justify its insulation against the double vexation of suits against it by its own employees for recovery of compensation for services from which it benefited, services for which, so far as we can see, it was liable when the sale was effected, regardless of the accumulation in its hands of the money from the seller to cover the broker\u2019s commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b567-7\">CHAPMAN, C.
