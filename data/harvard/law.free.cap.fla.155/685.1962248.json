That if defendants\u2019 witness M. F. Hardin were present and testified, his evidence would be to the following effect: \u2018That on December 14, 1943, he was employed by the defendants as a hostler in which position it was his duty to operate locomotives between the engine house at New Smyrna, Florida, and the station there and to couple such locomotives to trains from which other locomotives had been detach\u00e9d. That on December 13, 1943, in the performance of such duties he operated the locomotive which was attached at New Smyrna, Florida, to the train involved in this suit, and that there was no rough handling which would cause a viol\u00e9nt jerk or jar to the train.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">\u201c2. That if defendants\u2019 witness F. A. Crawford were present to testify, his evidence would be as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">\u201c \u2018That he .was employed by the defendants as baggage master on the train involved in this suit 'on December 14, 1943, and when the train reached and stopped at New Smyrna, Florida, he was in the baggage car which was the third ear of the train behind the locomotive. That when the locomotive which pulled the train into New Smyrna was detached, there was no rough handling which violently jerked or jarred the train, and that when another locomotive was attached to the train a few minutes later there was no rough handling which violently jerked or j\u00e1rred the train. That at n\u00f3 time while the train was standing in the New Smyrna station after it arrived and before it left that point, was the train jerked or jarred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">\u201cMiami, Florida, July 10, 1944.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">(And then it is signed)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">\u201c \u2018This stipulation shall not constitute any admission by the plaintiff that the said testimony is true.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">Plaintiff had testified that at the time and place mentioned in this stipulation the train was given a sudden jerk which caused'her fall! and injury-and when this stipulation-was introduced the presumption created by Sec. 768.05 Fla. Statutes 1941 (same F.S.A.) disappeared. See A.C.L. Ry. Co. v. Richardson, 117 Fla. 10, 12, 157 So. 17; A.C.L. Ry. Co. v. Crosby, 53 Fla. 400, 43 So. 318; Fla. E. Coast Ry. Co. v. Smith, 61 Fla. 218, 55 So. 871; Fla. E. Coast Ry. Co. v. Davis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>96 Fla. 171, 117 So. 842; Kirch v. A.C.L. R. Co., 38 F. (2nd) 963, 964; A.C.L. Ry. Co. v. Voss, 136 Fla. 32, 186 So. 199; Van Allen v. A.C.L. R. Co., 109 F. (2nd) 780, 781; Powell v. Gary, 146 Fla. 334, 337, 200 So. 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The burden was then on the plaintiff to prove every element of her case by a preponderance of the testimony and without any reference to the presumption created by the statute. See A.C.L. R. Co. v. Britton, 109 Fla. 212, 216, 146 So. 842; S.A.L. Ry. Co. v. Thompson, 57 Fla. 155, 48 So. 750; A.C.L. Ry. Co. v. Webb, 112 Fla. 449, 468, 150 So. 741; A.C.L. R. Co. v. Hamlett, 81 Fla. 872, 877, 89 So. 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">What has been said in regard to question 1 applies with like effect as to question 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Question 3 is based upon the action of the court in sustaining an objection by the defendant to the plaintiff, when a witness, in her own. behalf, testifying to what a doctor said when he looked at an Xray picture of the alleged injured part of plaintiffs\u2019 body. The record showed that plaintiff had been requested by defendant\u2019s attorney to go to this doctor for an examination and that she did so and while she was in his presence some conversation occurred. The doctor was absent and not called as a witness. As to the scope of his authority in regard to the examination and as to how far the defendant railroad company might have been bound by what he said is not at all clear from the record. It is not necessary, however, for us to pass upon this phase of the question because there is nothing in the record to show that the plaintiff was prejudiced, or suffered any harm by reason of the ruling of the court. This is true because there was no proffer of what was propos\u00e9d to be proven as a statement of this doctor when he examined the Xray pictures.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">We think the case was fairly tried and the issues fairly presented as to whether or not the plaintiff, appellant here, was injured by the sudden jerk of the train. She testified that.there was a sudden jerking of the train; the stipulation, supra, was to the effect that there was no sudden jerking of the train. It was the province of the jury to determine which statement was true. They resolved that question in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>We think the record shows no reversible error. Therefore, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b713-6\">CHAPMAN, C. J., TERRELL and ADAMS, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
