The jury evidently believed the testimony of the alleged victim and disbelieved the appellant, which was within its province to do. The testimony of the alleged victim which was in many respects strongly supported by other evidence, was, if believed by the jury, sufficient to establish every element of the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">On the entire record we find reflected no reversible error and, therefore, judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b46-10\">BUFORD, C.
