Also, counsel for appellee, who labored under no such difficult conditions, have ably presented their argument in behalf of the correctness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>the chancellor\u2019s decree. Both briefs are rep\u00edete with citations of authorities and court decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">It would require a long opinion to review the pleadings and evidence and to discuss the various arguments presented by counsel, and we doubt if any good purpose would be sub-served thereby. Suffice it to say that we have carefully considered the record and the briefs and are satisfied that on the merits of the case the conclusion reached by the master and chancellor was correct, and that no reversible error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">But in our opinion it was to the interest of each of the opposing parties that the main questions involved should be settled, and that therefore the costs in this case, including the master\u2019s fee, should have been equally borne, one-half by the unsuccessful plaintiffs and one-half by the defendant City. In all other respects the decree below should be and is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Decree affirmed, and cause remanded with directions to retax the costs as above stated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b754-7\">CHAPMAN, C.
