First, whether the charge may be maintained in the absence of a showing that the commodity was one subject to a tax. Second, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>the act unconstitutional because it imposes excessive fines, cruel and unusual punishment contrary to Section 8, Declaration of Rights, Constitution of Florida ?</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">We might be content to resolve both of these questions adverse to the state upon authority of Brown v. State, 152 Fla. 853, 13 So. (2nd) 458, except for the contention that subsequent to the Brown case the Legislature of Florida, in 1943, enacted Chapter 21839.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The condemnation by law for failure to comply with a tax law necessarily presupposes the sanction of law to pay the tax. We have searched the statute in vain to find authority whereby the accused might have purchased the tax stamp in obedience to our statute. Counsel for the state at the bar of this Court has made no contention that the accused could have obtained the stamps and attached them to the moonshine in compliance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">It is our conclusion that notwithstanding Chapter 21839, Laws of 1943, the judgment here must be affirmed on authority of Brown v. State, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b57-8\">BUFORD, C.
