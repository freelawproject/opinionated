For an injury to be compensable under this Act it must be an injury by <em>accident, </em>arising out of and in the course of the employment. The occurrence of an accident is one prerequsiite to any award of compensation for an injury. The Act defines an accident as: \u201c \u2018Accident\u2019 shall mean only an unexpected or unusual event, happening suddenly.\u201d (Sec. 440.02 [19], F.S. \u201941, F.S.A.) Several times we have construed this Act. See Kress &amp; Co., et al., v. Burkes, 153 Fla. 868, 16 So. (2nd) 106; Travelers Insurance Company, et al., v. Shepard, et al., 155 Fla. 576, 20 So. (2nd) 903; General Properties Co. v. Greening, 154 Fla. 814, 18 So. (2nd) 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">The factual background of this award will appear from the following quotation of claimant\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-9\">\u201cQ. You were employed by the City as fireman last October ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-10\">\u201cA. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-11\">\u201cQ. Will you describe in your own words what happened on October 4, 1943?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-12\">\u201cA. I got an aching in my hip. I went to Dr. Annis on the 4th, that was the day I was off. On the 6th we had a fire alarm and we had to go out. I got up and it made me sick and hurt me pretty bad. I was supposed to get the first truck, Lt. Johnson\u2019s truck, but I didn\u2019t. I got the second truck which was Maige\u2019s truck. I did catch him by him slowing up for me to catch it. There wasn\u2019t anything to the fire much. I was hurting pretty bad. It was in the Northwest end of town. Seems like riding on the truck, the wind keep me from being so sick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>\u201cQ. Were you sleeping in the fire station ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-4\">\u201cA. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-5\">\u201cQ. You jumped out of bed at the sound of the alarm ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-6\">\u201cA. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-7\">\u201cQ. Did you notice any twisting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-8\">\u201cA. No sir, it just felt like something struck me in the center of my back and ranged down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-9\">\u201cQ. Had you, 'noticed in your life before any similar trouble?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-10\">\u201cA. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-11\">\u201cQ. Have you had trouble with your back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-12\">\u201cA. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-13\">\u201cQ. How long had you been employed by the City of Tallahassee as a fireman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-14\">\u201cA. Something like three (3) weeks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-15\">The ailment was diagnosed as a slipping of the vertebra, known medically as spondylolisthesis. The record wholly fails to disclose facts from which it can be said there was an accident that caused, the injury. Nothing unusual occurred when claimant got out of bed to answer the alarm. There was no occurrence of an unusual nature which contributed to or brought about the injury. On the contrary, it is admitted that the first symptoms of the injury appeared about two days before the time when it is claimed the compensable injury occurred. When the admitted facts are considered in the light of the above statute and the above cases, it is clear that the injury is not compensable under this law.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-16\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b841-17\">CHAPMAN, C.
