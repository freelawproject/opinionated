Minnesota law defines \"school zone,\" in pertinent part, as \"(1) any property owned, leased, or controlled by a school district ...

Because the defendant's house fell \"both within the distance measurement of one city block and within the area measurement of a city block,\" our discussion of the distance-versus-area question was limited.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.01\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In a concurrence, Justice Paul Anderson discussed this distance-versus-area question, explaining that it might impact the issue of \"whether a point located on [a kitty-corner block was] within the park zone.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.01\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.01\">\n    at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Anderson, Paul H., J., concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   LaPenotiere reads our analysis in\n   <em>\n    Carufel\n   </em>\n   as limiting the term \"one city block,\" as used in the statutory definition of a park zone, to include blocks with a side facing the park boundary and to exclude kitty-corner blocks. According to LaPenotiere, the same limitation should be placed on the term \"one city block\" in the statutory definition of a school zone because the same term was at issue in\n   <em>\n    Carufel\n   </em>\n   . LaPenotiere therefore argued to the postconviction court that when a drug sale occurs on a block without a side facing the school property (e.g., a kitty-corner block), the State must prove that the sale occurred within 300 feet of the school property. Because the record did not contain any evidence that LaPenotiere's home was within 300 feet of the school property, he claimed that the State had presented insufficient evidence to support his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The postconviction court denied LaPenotiere's petition, explaining that LaPenotiere misread our holding in\n   <em>\n    Carufel\n   </em>\n   . According to the postconviction court, the phrase \"directly adjacent\" actually includes kitty-corner blocks, so the entire area of LaPenotiere's block is included in the school zone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal, LaPenotiere renewed these same arguments.

Such an interpretation creates a clear and obvious buffer zone around school property in all directions, which helps achieve the Legislature's goal of protecting children from the dangers associated with illegal drugs. Moreover, the notion of \"one city block\" as an area is practical; prosecutors and defendants alike need not pull out a measuring tape to determine if a particular location is within \"one city block\" of school property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   By contrast, an interpretation that uses a distance measurement is unreasonable because it limits the school zone to less than, or possibly more than,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   the entire kitty-corner block, creating a quarter-circle area that radiates from the corner of the block that abuts the school property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Applying the distance-based approach, the boundary of the school zone would be an arc that could cut through some of the houses on the block, creating a zone that may cover only one portion of a house while leaving other portions outside the zone. Additionally, interpreting \"one city block\" as a distance, not an area, presents the issue of which side of a rectangular block (the length or the width) is the \"distance of ... one city block,\" an ambiguity that arises under LaPenotiere's preferred interpretation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.01\">\n    Minn.

The words that the Legislature chose to use in section 152.01, subdivision 14a, evince its intent to create as expansive a zone as possible. For example, the statute uses the phrase \"whichever distance\n   <em>\n    is greater\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.01\">\n    Minn.

Stat. \u00a7 152.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 12a ). Relevant dictionary definitions confirm this interpretation.\n   <em>\n    The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\n   </em>\n   197 (5th ed. 2011) (defining \"block\" as \"[a] segment of a street bounded by consecutive cross\n   streets and\n   <em>\n    including its buildings and inhabitants\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   235 (2002) (defining \"block\" as \"an area of land\"). Given our decision in\n   <em>\n    Carufel\n   </em>\n   and these dictionary definitions, any reading of \"one city block\" as encompassing only a distance between two blocks, and not the area within the block, is simply not reasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Because there is only one reasonable interpretation of the statute, it is not ambiguous in my view. Based on the unambiguous language of the statute, I would affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The majority contends that my conclusion \"ignores language in the\n    <em>\n     Carufel\n    </em>\n    opinion plainly stating that a 'block' was both an area and a distance.\" I disagree. The footnote the majority quotes does\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    conclude that the statute is ambiguous even though the statute uses concepts of distance and area.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7088136\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/783/539/\">\n     783 N.W.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    544 n.2. Just as we concluded in\n    <em>\n     Carufel\n    </em>\n    , I conclude that the statute is not ambiguous as applied here.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7088136\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/783/539/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7088136\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/783/539/\">\n     at 545\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
