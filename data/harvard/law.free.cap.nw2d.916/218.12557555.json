FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In our earlier opinion we recited the relevant facts, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 25, 2013, Charles Hendon, Jr. was involved in a motor vehicle accident when his vehicle was allegedly rear-ended by an unidentified hit and run driver, causing bodily injury. Defendant Sentinel Insurance Company is Hendon's insurer. From August 1, 2013, through October 7, 2013, plaintiff VHS Huron Valley-Sinai Hospital, doing business as DMC Surgery Hospital, provided medical services to Hendon for his care, recovery, and rehabilitation related to his injuries sustained in the automobile accident, at a cost totaling $68,569.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 9, 2013, Hendon commenced a cause of action against Sentinel asserting a claim for uninsured motorist benefits under his insurance policy and alleging negligence on the part of the unidentified hit and run driver involved in the accident. Hendon did not assert a claim for no-fault [personal protection insurance (PIP) ] benefits as part of his lawsuit. Thereafter, on July 15, 2014, DMC, plaintiff in the instant case, commenced a cause of action against Sentinel asserting a claim for no-fault PIP benefits for the medical services DMC provided to Hendon for injuries arising out of the accident. On October 21, 2014, Hendon and Sentinel settled Hendon's lawsuit seeking uninsured motorist benefits for $1,500 and, on October 29, 2014, that suit was dismissed, with prejudice, per stipulation of the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   After settling Hendon's case, Sentinel sought summary disposition of DMC's action for PIP benefits under MCR 2.116(C)(7), asserting that it was barred by res judicata. The trial court denied Sentinel's motion, concluding that res judicata did not bar DMC's claim because it could not have been resolved in Hendon's earlier action for uninsured motorist benefits given the dissimilarity in the two claims. The court then entered a stipulated order for dismissal and consent agreement, which closed the case but allowed Sentinel to appeal as of right the court's denial of its motion for summary disposition. Sentinel appeals. [\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    VHS Huron Valley Sinai Hosp. v. Sentinel Ins.

This Court reasoned that because Hendon asserted only a claim for uninsured motorist benefits and plaintiff had no interest or right to those benefits, Hendon and plaintiff \"did not share a substantial identity of interest\" in those benefits, nor did plaintiff have \"a mutual or successive relationship in those benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 4. According to this Court, plaintiff's interest in or right to the recovery of PIP benefits was not represented or protected in the earlier litigation, and Hendon had no motivation in the earlier litigation to protect plaintiff's interest in or right to recover PIP benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, this Court affirmed the trial court's decision.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 9, 2016, this Court denied defendant's motion for reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    VHS Huron Valley Sinai Hosp. v.

On December 20, 2016, defendant filed an application for leave to appeal in the Michigan Supreme Court. On September 12, 2017, the Michigan Supreme Court vacated this Court's judgment and remanded to this Court for reconsideration in light of\n   <em>\n    Covenant\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    VHS Huron Valley Sinai Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=501%20Mich.%20857\">\n    501 Mich. 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=900%20N.W.2d%20628\">\n    900 N.W.2d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). On remand to this Court, defendant moved for peremptory reversal, arguing that\n   <em>\n    Covenant\n   </em>\n   compels the dismissal of plaintiff's claims. In its answer to the motion, plaintiff argued that\n   <em>\n    Covenant\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable because defendant waived the issue of standing by agreeing to the stipulated order for dismissal and consent judgment, which permitted defendant to appeal the issue of res judicata only. On October 26, 2017, this Court denied defendant's motion for peremptory reversal \"for failure to persuade the Court of the existence of manifest error requiring reversal and warranting peremptory relief without argument or formal submission.\"\n   <em>\n    VHS Huron Valley Sinai Hosp. v.

Moreover, while its application for leave was pending in the Michigan Supreme Court, and the day after\n   <em>\n    Covenant\n   </em>\n   was decided, defendant filed supplemental authority in the Michigan Supreme Court challenging plaintiff's standing to pursue this cause of action.

Contrary to\n   <em>\n    Rory\n   </em>\n   and every rule of contract interpretation, the majority has rewritten the parties' release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This is not a hard case, and its resolution should be as simple as the rule set out in\n   <em>\n    Rory\n   </em>\n   . Charles Hendon, Jr., sustained personal injuries in an accident with an uninsured vehicle. Plaintiff, VHS Huron Valley-Sinai Hospital, Inc., provided Hendon with healthcare services related to the accident. Hendon filed a first-party lawsuit against defendant, Sentinel Insurance Company, seeking uninsured motorist (UIM) benefits, but failed to include in his lawsuit a claim for no-fault personal protection insurance (PIP) benefits. Hendon and Sentinel settled Hendon's UIM claim. Huron Valley then sued Sentinel for payment of Hendon's medical expenses. Sentinel contended that its liability for Hendon's medical expenses should have been litigated in Hendon's UIM case and that res judicata barred the suit. The circuit court denied Sentinel's summary disposition motion on this ground. Sentinel and Huron Valley settled their dispute by entering into a release. The parties agreed that Sentinel would pay Huron Valley $61,712.18, plus costs and interest, \"if Sentinel's position regarding\n   <em>\n    res judcata\n   </em>\n   /release [sic] is ultimately rejected by the Michigan Court of Appeals or Supreme Court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   At least two other paragraphs of the release addressed (and repeated) that the sole issue to be presented on appeal was \"regarding\n   <em>\n    res judcata\n   </em>\n   /release.\" The 2015 release made no mention of Huron Valley's standing (or alleged lack thereof). Nor did the release reference a healthcare provider's statutory right to sue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We decided Sentinel's appeal in Huron Valley's favor in October 2016. Not surprisingly, our decision focused exclusively on the doctrine of res judicata; after all, that was the only issue that the parties had agreed to present to us. We held that because Huron Valley and Hendon were not in privity, res judicata did not apply. We did not consider Huron Valley's standing to sue, because the issue was never raised. We did not evaluate whether healthcare providers possess a statutory cause of action against insurers, because consistent with the release it signed, Sentinel argued only that Huron Valley's claim for PIP benefits could have been resolved\n   in Hendon's UIM action, implicating res judicata principles. Displeased with our rejection of this argument, Sentinel applied for leave to appeal in the Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In May 2017, the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Covenant Med. Ctr., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20Mich.%20191\">\n    500 Mich. 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=895%20N.W.2d%20490\">\n    895 N.W.2d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), holding that healthcare providers lack standing to maintain direct causes of action against insurers to recover PIP benefits. Sentinel now contends that despite the plain and unambiguous language of the release, it is not liable to Huron Valley because the hospital had no cause of action in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Sentinel's argument would be compelling if it had made it in the trial court or settled the underlying case with a release reserving that issue for appeal. Instead, Sentinel elected to sign a release that carved out for appeal only a single, specific and narrow question: whether the doctrine of res judicata barred Huron Valley's claim. In other words, Sentinel waived any argument that Huron Valley lacked standing. It deliberately elected to forgo this appellate claim. If Sentinel suspected that a standing argument had legal legs, it should have identified \"standing\" in the release as an issue to be presented to an appellate court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Perhaps the release did not preserve a standing claim because the parties' bargain\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   Sentinel to waive the issue. Perhaps Sentinel's counsel calculated incorrectly that the Supreme Court would decide\n   <em>\n    Covenant\n   </em>\n   differently. We need not speculate because our Supreme Court has forcefully and effectively instructed that if a contract's words are unambiguous, we look no further to ascertain the parties' intent. The words lend themselves to but one interpretation in this case: Sentinel agreed to appeal on res judicata grounds and waived its potential standing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The majority makes much of the fact that Sentinel raised the issue of standing in the trial court by including it as an affirmative defense. This proves my point: Sentinel knew an important legal issue existed that might entirely preclude Huron Valley's claim. Yet Sentinel deliberately decided to forgo asserting a standing challenge when it signed a release plainly limiting its appeal to \"res judicata.\" This is called a waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The majority's reliance on the\n   <strong>\n    absence\n   </strong>\n   of language in the release \"indicating that defendant intended to clearly and unequivocally waive its legal position with respect to plaintiff's standing\" turns the law of contracts-and waiver-upside down. \"[A]n unambiguous contract reflects the parties' intent as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Egbert R.

In other words, the parties to a contract are bound by what they say, not by what they do not say. We do not rewrite unambiguous contracts by intuiting what a party really meant to say or speculating about subjective intent. We do not bail out parties who forget to include a provision or who make a bad prediction and elect to go in one direction rather than another. \"Courts have long held parties to agreements they make, regardless of the harshness of the results.\"\n   <em>\n    Nexteer Auto.

Instead of holding Sentinel to the bargain it made, the majority tosses a lifeline, excusing Sentinel's waiver by hypothesizing that before the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Covenant\n   </em>\n   , Sentinel \"may have reasonably surmised that any challenges to plaintiff's standing would have been rejected by the trial court and the appellate courts.\" This breathtaking and contrived exemption from the words of the contract suggests that because Sentinel reasonably expected that a standing argument would go nowhere, it could nevertheless preserve the claim without including it in the release.\n   <em>\n    Rory\n   </em>\n   forcefully condemns such reasoning: \"When a court abrogates unambiguous contractual provisions based on its own independent assessment of 'reasonableness,' the court undermines the parties' freedom of contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Rory\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1573350\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/473/457/#p468\">\n    473 Mich. at 468-469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=703%20N.W.2d%2023\">\n    703 N.W.2d 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It settled the claims brought by Huron Valley. As part and parcel of that settlement, Sentinel agreed in writing to limit its appeal to an argument regarding res judicata, thereby forgoing any and all other legal claims. Having made its bed, Sentinel must lie in it. Any other result violates bedrock principles of contract law and flies in the face of decades of contract jurisprudence. I would hold that based on the clear and unambiguous language of the release, Sentinel's\n   <em>\n    Covenant\n   </em>\n   argument comes too late, and respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The majority cites\n    <em>\n     Nexteer\n    </em>\n    as authority for its holding that a waiver of a right requires language reflecting a specific intent to waive the right.

One party, Mando, changed its mind about arbitration, and sought to reassert the arbitration agreement. This Court held that the stipulation's language \"that the arbitration provision 'was not applicable' \" constituted an express and binding waiver.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 395,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=886%20N.W.2d%20906\">\n     886 N.W.2d 906\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . We pointed out that\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n    Mando was aware of the arbitration clause in the nondisclosure agreement, and it was aware of Nexteer's general allegations in its complaint. It had the ability to apply the language of the arbitration clause to the complaint in order to decide whether it should pursue arbitration. After stipulating that the arbitration provision did not apply, Mando may not now argue that the arbitration provision does in fact apply.
