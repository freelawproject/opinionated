The juvenile court found the child is deprived, the conditions and causes of the deprivation are likely to continue, and the child is suffering or will probably suffer serious physical, mental, moral, or emotional harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D.C.C. \u00a7 27-20-44(1)(c)(1). The juvenile court also found the child had been in foster care for more than 450 of the previous 660 nights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D.C.C. \u00a7 27-20-44(1)(c)(2). The mother argues clear and convincing evidence does not support a finding that the child was deprived, that the conditions and causes of deprivation are likely to continue, or that by reason thereof the child is suffering or will probably suffer serious physical, mental, moral, or emotional harm. The juvenile court's findings are not clearly erroneous, and we summarily affirm under N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b6 2] Gerald W.
