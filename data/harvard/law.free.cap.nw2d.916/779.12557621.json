Because the district court was without subject matter jurisdiction to review the Minot Regional Child Support Unit's decision to suspend Rose's license, we vacate the orders relating to his suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b6 2] Under an April 2014 district court judgment, Rose was ordered to pay $836 per month in child support. In May 2016, the Minot Regional Child Support Unit notified Rose of its intent to suspend his\n   driver's license, alleging he owed over $31,000 in past due child support. In June 2016, Rose requested a hearing to review the Unit's decision. After two hearings, the district court issued an order suspending Rose's license in February 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 3] In December 2017, Rose moved to reinstate his driver's license. He argued he was laid off in February 2016 and was unable to find a job because he did not have a license. He also argued the district court failed to inquire into his ability to pay child support at an earlier hearing relating to the suspension of his driver's license. The court denied Rose's motion to reinstate his driver's license. Rose now appeals that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 4] Before reaching the merits of Rose's appeal, we must first decide whether the district court had jurisdiction to review the Unit's decision to suspend Rose's license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 5] \"The right to appeal is governed solely by statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Meier v.

Under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 50-09-08.6(2)(b), the child support agency may suspend a license of \"[a]n obligor who is listed on the arrears registry.\" Before suspending an obligor's license, the state agency must notify the obligor:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Before withholding, restricting, or suspending a license under subdivision a or b of subsection 2, the state agency shall send a notice to the licensee by first-class mail to the licensee's last-known address stating that the licensee has thirty days after the date of the notice to comply with the subpoena, satisfy the arrearage in full, or negotiate a payment plan with the state agency under this section.

Upon a showing by the state agency that the licensee has failed to comply with a subpoena, is listed on the arrears registry, or is not in compliance with an existing payment plan between the licensee and the state agency under this section, the licensee has the\n   burden of proving that the delinquency or failure to comply was not willful.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 7] Section 50-09-08.6(5), N.D.C.C., operates in a similar fashion to N.D.C.C. \u00a7 28-32-42, relating to appeals from administrative agency decisions, and N.D.C.C. \u00a7 28-34-01, relating to appeals from local governing body decisions. Under those statutes, a party has an opportunity to appeal a decision of an administrative agency or local governing body to the district court. A party must timely appeal from the decision of an administrative agency or local governing body to vest the district court with subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal.\n   <em>\n    Altru\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338121\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/903/721/\">\n    2017 ND 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338121\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/903/721/\">\n    903 N.W.2d 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Grand Forks Homes, Inc. v.

Rose requested a hearing on June 29, 2016, more than ten days after the date of the notice. To properly seek review under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 50-09-08.6(5), Rose had ten days after the date of the notice to request a hearing. By failing to timely request a hearing, the district court was without jurisdiction to review the Unit's decision to suspend Rose's license and should have dismissed his request. Therefore, we vacate the following orders relating to the suspension of Rose's license: (1) October 7, 2016 findings of fact and order; (2) November 16, 2016 order staying the October 7, 2016 order; (3) February 27, 2017 findings of fact and order; and (4) January 8, 2018 order denying Rose's motion to reinstate driver's license.
