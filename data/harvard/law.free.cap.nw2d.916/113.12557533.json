Riemers argues he was entitled to an automatic recount under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 16.1-16-01(1)(a) because he \"failed to be nominated in a primary election by one percent or less of the highest vote cast for a candidate for the office sought.\" We exercise our original jurisdiction to consider Riemers' petition, and we grant his request for a writ of mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b62] Riemers was the sole Libertarian party candidate for secretary of state in the June 12, 2018 primary election. After the election, the North Dakota canvassing board certified that he received 247 votes for the office. Under N.D.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-11-06(1)(b)(3)(a) and 16.1-11-36, Riemers needed a minimum of 300 votes to be nominated as the Libertarian candidate for the office and to advance to the November general election. In the primary election, Republican candidate Will Gardner received the highest number of votes for the office of secretary of state at 54,563.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b63] In a June 13, 2018 letter to the Secretary of State, Riemers demanded an automatic recount under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 16.1-16-01, asserting he failed to be nominated in the primary election by one percent or less of the highest vote cast for a candidate for the office sought. The Secretary of State's office informed Riemers that the position for which his name appeared on the primary ballot was not eligible for a recount:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"It does not qualify according to N.D.C.C. \u00a7 16.1-16-01 nor under the recount guidelines published by this office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"You were the only candidate for Secretary of State in the Libertarian Party column and received the highest number of votes as well as the only qualifying votes for the contest for your party. The formula to determine whether an automatic recount occurs, or a demand recount may be called is calculated based on the votes cast for at least two or more candidates. Since you were the only candidate for the Libertarian Party Secretary of State contest, it is not possible to have a recount since the respective columns for the political parties on the ballot are to determine the nominees within that party. It is not determined across political party columns as you stated in your letter.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b64] After Riemers was denied a recount by the Secretary of State, he petitioned this Court under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 32-34-01 for a writ of mandamus directing the Secretary of State to follow N.D.C.C. \u00a7 16.1-16-01 and order a recount of the votes in the primary election for secretary of state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b65] Article VI, \u00a7 2, of the North Dakota Constitution authorizes this Court to exercise original jurisdiction and to issue original and remedial writs necessary to properly exercise its jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   N.D.C.C. \u00a7 27-02-04.

The Secretary of State claims those ballot requirements evidence an intent to compare candidates in their own political party for purposes of the primary election nomination. The Secretary of State thus argues Riemers is not entitled to an automatic recount because he was the sole Libertarian candidate for nomination for secretary of state and was not involved in a close contest with a candidate in his party. The Secretary of State contends Riemers is not entitled to an automatic recount by comparing his total votes to the candidate of another party that received the highest number of votes cast, and Riemers is not entitled to an automatic recount even if the total candidate votes are compared across political parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b610] The issue here involves the interpretation of N.D.C.C. \u00a7 16.1-16-01(1)(a), which outlines the criteria for an automatic recount in a primary election and provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"A recount of any primary ... election for nomination or election to a ... state ... office ... must be conducted according to guidelines established by the secretary of state and as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   1.

If, however, the statute is ambiguous or if adherence to the strict letter of the statute would lead to an absurd or ludicrous result, a court may resort to extrinsic aids, such as legislative history, to interpret the statute. A statute is ambiguous if it [is] susceptible to meanings that are different, but rational.
