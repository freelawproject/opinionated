The Wage and Hour Program (WHP) of the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) ruled against him in a\n   determination order, concluding that plaintiff had not been discharged for engaging in any of the protected activities listed in the statute. The circuit court affirmed the decision of the WHP, and plaintiff now appeals in this Court as of right. We affirm the circuit court because we are bound by the precedent of\n   <em>\n    Reo v. Lane Bryant, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1874688\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/211/364/\">\n    211 Mich.App. 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=536%20N.W.2d%20556\">\n    536 N.W.2d 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). Were we not bound by that opinion, we would reverse and remand for a new determination from the WHP based on the scope of the statute as discussed herein. Accordingly, we call for a conflict panel under MCR 7.215(J)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff worked for ICHN for approximately two years. He was discharged from his job on June 26, 2015. At the time of his termination, ICHN informed plaintiff that he was being discharged because he had falsified his time sheet. Plaintiff filed an employment wage complaint with the WHP, asserting that he had a right to be paid his wages under MCL 408.472. He maintained that he had correctly filled out his time sheet and that by accurately filling out the time sheet, he was exercising a right to receive payment of his wages under the wages and fringe benefits act. On the basis of this assertion, plaintiff contended that under MCL 408.483(1), he could not be discharged for correctly filling out his time sheet. He sought reinstatement and back pay under MCL 408.483(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   MCL 408.483(1) prohibits an employer from discharging or discriminating against an employee who engages in certain activities. In particular, the statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   An employer shall not discharge an employee or discriminate against an employee because the employee filed a complaint, instituted or caused to be instituted a proceeding under or regulated by this act, testified or is about to testify in a proceeding, or because of the exercise by the employee on behalf of an employee or others of a right afforded by this act. [ MCL 408.483(1).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The WHP did not make a substantive determination regarding whether plaintiff had falsified his time sheet.

This provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (1) An employer shall not discharge an employee or discriminate against an employee because the employee filed a complaint, instituted or caused to be instituted a proceeding under or regulated by this act, testified or is about to testify in a proceeding, or\n   <em>\n    because of the exercise by the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    employee on behalf of an employee or others of a right afforded by this act\n   </em>\n   . [ MCL 408.483(1) (emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plainly, the statute protects an employee who (1) filed a complaint; (2) instituted or caused a proceeding to be instituted under the wages and fringe benefits act, MCL 408.471\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . ; and (3) testified or is about to testify in a proceeding under the wages and fringe benefits act. Additionally, relevant to the present case, the statute prohibits an employer from discharging or discriminating against an employee \"because of the exercise by the employee on behalf of an employee or others of a right afforded by this act.\" MCL 408.483(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   It is only this last clause that is relevant in this case. That is, plaintiff was not fired for filing a complaint, for instituting or causing a proceeding to be instituted, or for testifying or being about to testify in a proceeding. Instead, plaintiff contends that he personally exercised a right to payment of wages by filling out his timesheet and that defendant violated MCL 408.483(1) by firing him for exercising this right.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, as noted by the majority, this Court previously considered MCL 408.483(1) and held \"that in order to fall within the plain meaning of the above provision an employee must be exercising a right afforded by the act on behalf of\n   <em>\n    another\n   </em>\n   employee or other person.\"\n   <em>\n    Reo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1874688\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/211/364/\">\n    211 Mich.App. at 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=536%20N.W.2d%20556\">\n    536 N.W.2d 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under\n   <em>\n    Reo\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff's exercise of a right, which was not done on behalf of another, is not protected under MCL 408.483(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The majority in this case now contends that\n   <em>\n    Reo\n   </em>\n   inappropriately added the word \"another\" to\n   MCL 408.483(1) and that, because plaintiff is \"an employee,\" he is protected under MCL 408.483(1) when, as \"the employee\" in question, he exercises a right on his own behalf. However, in my judgment, that interpretation ignores the use of the phrase \"on the behalf of\" as it appears in the context of MCL 408.483(1). In particular, as commonly understood, the word \"behalf\" means \"INTEREST,\" \"BENEFIT,\" \"SUPPORT,\" or \"DEFENSE.\"\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (11th ed.). And, the phrase \"on behalf of\" means \" 'in the name of, on the part of, as the agent or representative of.' \"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed.), p. 184.

In other words, while the phrase \"another employee\" does not appear in MCL 408.483(1), the phrase \"on behalf of\" plainly acknowledges the existence of an agency or representative relationship in which the employee acts \"on behalf of\"\n   <em>\n    another\n   </em>\n   , be it an employee or other person. Consequently, unlike the majority, I am persuaded that\n   <em>\n    Reo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1874688\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/211/364/\">\n    211 Mich.App. at 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=536%20N.W.2d%20556\">\n    536 N.W.2d 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , correctly held \"that in order to fall within the plain meaning of the above provision an employee must be exercising a right afforded by the act on behalf of\n   <em>\n    another\n   </em>\n   employee or other person.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Aside from the assertion that\n   <em>\n    Reo\n   </em>\n   was incorrect, the majority also suggests that a conflict panel is appropriate because\n   <em>\n    Reo\n   </em>\n   \"stands alone in its holding.\" In this regard, the majority faults\n   <em>\n    Reo\n   </em>\n   for offering\n   \"little basis\"\n   for rejecting\n   <em>\n    Cockels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   an earlier decision of this Court that considered MCL 408.483(1). However, any reliance on\n   <em>\n    Cockels\n   </em>\n   would be misplaced because\n   <em>\n    Cockels\n   </em>\n   was decided in 1987. Accordingly, unlike\n   <em>\n    Reo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cockels\n   </em>\n   is not binding precedent, and the\n   <em>\n    Reo\n   </em>\n   Court had no obligation to follow\n   <em>\n    Cockels\n   </em>\n   . MCR 7.215(J)(1). Moreover, while the majority attempts to characterize\n   <em>\n    Reo\n   </em>\n   as an incorrectly decided anomaly, I note that\n   <em>\n    Reo\n   </em>\n   was decided in 1995 and that it has constituted the rule of law on this issue for more than 20 years, during which the Legislature has not seen fit to address this Court's interpretation of MCL 408.483(1).

Adhering to\n   <em>\n    Reo\n   </em>\n   , I would simply affirm the circuit court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Defendant paid plaintiff for the hours that he claimed on his time sheet.
