Crabtree has committed professional misconduct warranting public discipline. The allegations of the petition include dishonest, misleading and/or fraudulent conduct in his personal bankruptcy proceeding; willful failure to pay a law-related debt; notarization of his own signature; responding to a scam resulting in the theft of client funds held in his trust account; and failure to obtain written informed consent from clients to a concurrent conflict of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The parties have entered into a stipulation for discipline and have filed a transcript memorializing that stipulation with the court. In it, respondent reaffirms the admissions in his answers to the petitions, makes additional admissions of fact, and admits his conduct has violated Minn. R. Prof. Conduct 1.7(a)(2), 1.7(b)(4), 1.15(a), 1.15(c)(4), 1.15(h) as interpreted by Appendix 1(11), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d). Respondent waives his procedural rights under Rule 14, Rules on Lawyers Professional Responsibility (RLPR). The parties jointly recommend that the appropriate discipline is an indefinite suspension, with no right to petition for reinstatement for at least 9 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The court has independently reviewed the file and approves the jointly recommended disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Based upon all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1.

Crabtree is suspended from the practice of law, effective 14 days from the date of the filing of this order, with no right to petition for reinstatement for 9 months from the effective date of the suspension.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2.
