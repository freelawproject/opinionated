We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While driving a school bus for her employer, appellant Jennifer Rodriguez was injured when a stolen vehicle crashed into the bus. Old Republic Insurance Company, her employer's workers' compensation insurer, paid for 12 weeks of chiropractic treatment that Rodriguez received at ChiroFirst, P.A. Old Republic then notified ChiroFirst that, because additional chiropractic treatment was not indicated under the treatment parameters set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20R.%205221\">\n    Minn. R. 5221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .6200, subp. 3(A) (2017), it would not pay for additional treatment, except as permitted under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20R.%205221\">\n    Minn. R. 5221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .6200, subp. 3(B) (2017). In response, ChiroFirst refused to provide additional treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rodriguez then began receiving chiropractic treatment from Core Health Chiropractic and provided notice of an uninsured-motorist claim to her personal automobile insurer, respondent State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. Because it appeared to State Farm that Rodriguez was in the course and scope of her employment when she was injured, State Farm sought information about Rodriguez's injuries and treatment and about what benefits she was requesting under her automobile policy. Rodriguez responded that she was claiming no-fault benefits for her chiropractic treatment, and she requested an application for benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After State Farm failed to pay Rodriguez's bills for chiropractic treatment, Rodriguez filed a petition for no-fault arbitration. During arbitration, State Farm did not dispute the reasonableness or the necessity of the chiropractic treatment that Rodriguez received, but argued that, under the circumstances of this case, the workers' compensation system is the exclusive source for any health care benefits sought in connection with the accident. The arbitrator ruled for Rodriguez and awarded her the full amount claimed, plus costs and interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   State Farm brought a motion in the district court to vacate the arbitrator's award on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded her authority. The district court concluded that the plain language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20176.83\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 5(c) (2016), precluded no-fault benefits. Based on this conclusion, the district court granted State Farm's motion to vacate.

R. 5221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .6200, subp. 3 (2017). Under these rules, chiropractic treatment is generally limited to 12 weeks of treatment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20R.%205221\">\n    Minn. R. 5221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .6200, subp. 3(A).

R. 5221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .6200, subp. 3(B). There has been no determination whether the conditions for additional treatment of Rodriguez's injury beyond 12 weeks have been met, and Old Republic cited this 12-week limit as the reason why it would not pay for additional chiropractic treatment, except as permitted under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20R.%205221\">\n    Minn. R. 5221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .6200, subp. 3(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The workers' compensation act also provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   If it is determined by the payer that the level, frequency, or cost of a procedure or service of a provider is excessive, unnecessary, or inappropriate according to the standards established by the rules, the provider shall not be paid for the procedure, service, or cost by an insurer, self-insurer, or group self-insurer, and the provider shall not be reimbursed or attempt to collect reimbursement for the procedure, service, or cost from\n   <em>\n    any other source, including\n   </em>\n   the employee,\n   <em>\n    another insurer\n   </em>\n   , the special compensation fund, or any government program\n   <em>\n    unless the commissioner or compensation judge determines at a hearing or administrative conference that the level, frequency, or cost was not excessive under the rules in which case the insurer, self-insurer, or group self-insurer shall make the payment deemed reasonable\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20176.83\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 5(c) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Old Republic determined that additional chiropractic treatment was excessive because, according to the standards established by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20R.%205521\">\n    Minn. R. 5521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .6200, subp. 3(A), treatment beyond 12 weeks was not indicated. Thus, because there has been no hearing or administrative conference at which the commissioner of labor and industry or a compensation judge determined that chiropractic treatment beyond 12 weeks was not excessive under the rules, section 176.83, subdivision 5(c), provides that Core Health Chiropractic shall not be paid by Old Republic for chiropractic treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   But Rodriguez did not seek payment from Old Republic, her employer's workers' compensation insurer; she sought payment from State Farm, her personal automobile insurer. The district court, however, concluded that State Farm is \"another insurer,\" and, therefore, under the plain language of section 176.83, subdivision 5(c), State Farm, like Old Republic, \"cannot be required to pay for\n   chiropractic treatment Old Republic determined to be excessive except as provided within the Workers' Compensation Act.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Although we agree that, when considered in isolation, the plain language of section 176.83, subdivision 5(c), provides that Core Health Chiropractic shall not be reimbursed by any insurer, this case involves the interplay between the workers' compensation act and the Minnesota No-Fault Act, and the district court's plain-language construction of section 176.83, subdivision 5(c), conflicts with provisions of the no-fault act. To resolve the parties' dispute, we must address the conflict between the two acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Under the no-fault act, \"[e]ach plan of reparation security shall provide for payment of economic loss benefits.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 65B.49, subd. 2 (2016). Basic economic loss benefits \"provide reimbursement for all loss suffered through injury arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 65B.44, subd. 1(a) (2016). A person entitled to basic economic loss benefits is entitled to medical expense benefits, which \"shall reimburse all reasonable expenses for necessary ... chiropractic ... services.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 65B.44, subd. 2(a)(1) (2016). Thus, under the no-fault act, because, during arbitration, State Farm did not dispute that the chiropractic services that Rodriguez received were reasonable and necessary, Rodriguez is entitled to reimbursement for the expense of the services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The no-fault act also provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Basic economic loss benefits shall be primary with respect to benefits, except for those paid or payable under a workers' compensation law, which any person receives or is entitled to receive from any other source as a result of injury arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 65B.61, subd. 1 (2016). Under this provision, if Rodriguez is entitled to receive workers' compensation benefits for the chiropractic treatment that she received beyond the 12-week limit, those benefits, rather than her basic economic loss benefits, are the primary source of payment for the treatment. But, at this point, Rodriquez is not entitled to receive additional workers' compensation benefits for chiropractic treatment because there has been no determination by the commissioner of labor and industry or a compensation judge that the treatment she received was not excessive under the workers' compensation rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Another provision of the no-fault act specifically addresses this situation. It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A claim for basic economic loss benefits shall be paid without deduction for the benefits which are to be subtracted pursuant to section 65B.61, if these benefits have not been paid to the claimant before the reparation benefits are overdue\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   or the claim is paid. The obligor is entitled to reimbursement from the person obligated to make the payments or from the claimant who actually receives the payments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 65B.54, subd. 3 (2016). Under this provision, even if Rodriguez is entitled to additional workers' compensation benefits for her chiropractic treatment, her claim for basic economic loss benefits must be paid without a deduction for the workers' compensation benefits because those benefits have not been paid and her basic economic loss benefits are overdue. If it is determined that Rodriguez is entitled to workers' compensation benefits, State Farm is entitled to reimbursement from Old Republic or Rodriguez for the amount that should have been subtracted from Rodriguez's basic economic loss benefits pursuant to section 65B.61. Thus, the district court's conclusion that under section 176.83, subdivision 5(c), State Farm cannot be required to pay Core Health Chiropractic for services that Rodriguez received conflicts with the provisions in the no-fault act that require State Farm to pay for the services without a deduction for workers' compensation benefits that would be primary benefits, subject to State Farm's right of reimbursement from Old Republic or Rodriguez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The legislature has instructed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   When a general provision in a law is in conflict with a special provision in the same or another law, the two shall be construed, if possible, so that effect may be given to both. If the conflict between the two provisions be irreconcilable, the special provision shall prevail and shall be construed as an exception to the general provision, unless the general provision shall be enacted at a later session and it shall be the manifest intention of the legislature that such general provision shall prevail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20645.26\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 645.26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1 (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Because neither the commissioner nor a compensation judge has determined whether the treatment that Core Health Chiropractic provided Rodriguez was not excessive, the conflict between the general provision in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20176.83\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 5(c), that Core Health Chiropractic shall not be reimbursed by an insurer for the treatment it provided is irreconcilable with the special provisions in the no-fault act that require a no-fault insurer to pay basic economic loss benefits when they are due. The general provision states that State Farm shall not reimburse Core Health Chiropractic for the treatment, and the special provisions require State Farm to pay for the treatment, and the provisions cannot be construed to give effect to both. Consequently, under section 645.26, subdivision 1, we must construe the special provisions in the no-fault act as an exception to the general provision in the workers' compensation act, unless the general provision was enacted later than the special provisions and the legislature has manifested its intention that the general provision shall prevail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The no-fault act was enacted in 1974 and included the provisions that are now codified as Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 65B.44, 65B.49, 65B.54, and 65B.61. 1974 Minn. Laws ch. 408, \u00a7\u00a7 4, at 765-67; 9, at 771-74; 14, at 777-78; and 21, at 780-81. Amendments to these statutes after 1974 do not affect our analysis.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20176.83\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   was first enacted in 1983. 1983 Minn. Laws ch. 290, \u00a7 165, at 1395-98. Amendments enacted in 1984 and 1992 included the language in section 176.83, subdivision 5(c), that is at issue in this appeal. 1984 Minn. Laws ch. 432, art. 2, \u00a7 50, at 127-29; 1992 Minn. Laws ch. 510, art. 4, \u00a7 21, at 640-41. Amendments to these statutes after 1992 do not affect our analysis. Thus, the general provision in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20176.83\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 5(c), was enacted later than the special provisions in the no-fault act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   But we have found no basis to conclude that the legislature intended the general\n   provision in the workers' compensation act to prevail over the special provisions of the no-fault act when an insured driver seeks no-fault benefits. Consequently, we must construe the special provisions of the no-fault act as an exception to section 176.83, subdivision 5(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, we note that the special provisions of the no-fault act affect only the time when basic economic loss benefits must be paid; they do not affect the ultimate responsibility for Rodriguez's medical expenses. If State Farm provides economic loss benefits now and it is determined that Rodriguez's chiropractic treatment was not excessive, additional workers' compensation benefits will be payable, and State Farm will be entitled to reimbursement for the benefits it provided that should have been provided by Old Republic. And if it is determined that the treatment was excessive, no benefits will be payable under the workers' compensation law, and State Farm will have paid the basic economic loss benefits that it was obligated to pay when they became due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In either situation, Rodriguez will have received prompt payment of medical benefits to which she was entitled, which is consistent with the legislature's intended purposes of both the no-fault act and the workers' compensation act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 65B.42(1) (2016) (stating that one purpose of no-fault act is to provide automobile insurance policies that \"will provide prompt payment of specified basic economic loss benefits to victims of automobile accidents without regard to whose fault caused the accident\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20176.001\">\n    Minn.

The record does not demonstrate that this issue has been presented to either the commissioner or a compensation judge, and we do not express any opinion about any insurer's ultimate responsibility to provide medical expense benefits for Rodriguez's chiropractic treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Because Rodriguez's basic economic loss benefits are overdue, State Farm must pay the benefits without a deduction for workers' compensation benefits that may become payable, and State Farm is entitled to reimbursement if it is determined that additional workers' compensation benefits are payable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    Reversed\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    This court granted Minnesota Association for Justice leave to file an amicus brief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The no-fault act provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n    Basic economic loss benefits are payable monthly as loss accrues.
