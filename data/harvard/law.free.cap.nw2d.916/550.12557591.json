Under the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines, \"[t]he classification of a prior offense as a ... felony is determined by current Minnesota offense definitions ... and sentencing policies.\" Minn. Sent. Guidelines 2.B.7.a (2015). In other words, this case requires us to decide whether the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines Commission used the word \"current\" in Guidelines 2.B.7.a to mean \"at the time the defendant\n   committed the current offense\" or \"at the time the defendant is sentenced for the current offense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2007, appellant Keith Scovel was convicted of fifth-degree possession of a controlled substance. When Scovel committed the current offense in March 2016, fifth-degree possession of a controlled substance was a felony offense. When he was sentenced in September 2016, however, fifth-degree possession of a controlled substance had been reclassified by the Legislature to a gross misdemeanor offense under certain circumstances. In calculating Scovel's criminal history score, the district court counted the 2007 conviction as a felony. On appeal, Scovel argued that the court had miscalculated his criminal history score, asserting that defendants can receive felony criminal history points only for prior felony convictions that are still classified as felony-level crimes at the time of sentencing. The court of appeals rejected this argument. Because we conclude that the phrase \"current Minnesota offense definitions ... and sentencing policies\" in Guidelines 2.B.7.a means Minnesota offense definitions and sentencing policies in effect when the current Minnesota offense was committed, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although this appeal arises out of Scovel's current offense, the story begins almost a decade earlier when he committed the prior offense. There are four significant dates that are relevant here: 2007 (Scovel commits the prior offense); March 2016 (Scovel commits the current offense); August 1, 2016 (the effective date of the Legislature's reclassification of certain fifth-degree possession offenses from a felony to a gross misdemeanor); and September 2016 (sentencing on the current offense).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2007, Scovel pleaded guilty to fifth-degree possession of a controlled substance (2007 felony conviction),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.025\">\n    Minn.

He initially received a stay of imposition, but after violating probation, the district court resentenced him to 1 year and 1 day in prison. This was, and is, a felony-level sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.02\">\n    Minn.

Guidelines 2.B.7, in particular, describes how to \"determin[e] offense levels for prior offenses.\" It states that \"[t]he classification of a prior offense as a petty misdemeanor, misdemeanor, gross misdemeanor, or felony is determined by current Minnesota offense definitions (see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.02\">\n    Minn.

This reduction is meaningful: If the 2007 felony conviction had been treated as a gross misdemeanor for criminal-history-score purposes, the presumptive range would have been reduced from 58 to 81\n   months to 50 to 69 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court of appeals concluded that Scovel was \"not entitled to a reduction in his criminal history score\" and affirmed in relevant part.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Scovel maintains that \"[t]he Guidelines are clear\" that the district court assigns felony criminal history points only for offenses that are felonies \"at the time of sentencing\" (here, September 2016). The State, on the other hand, argues that the Guidelines \"clearly\" dictate that the controlling date for the prior-offense-classification inquiry is \"the time the current offense was committed\" (here, March 2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Interpreting the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines presents a question of law, which we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

R. Civ. App. P. 128.05 (allowing citation to \"pertinent and significant authorities\" that come to a party's attention after the party's brief is filed). Scovel moved to strike this submission as an improper use of Rule 128.05 because the State offered the supplemental authorities only to respond to arguments made in Scovel's principal and reply briefs. The State's use of Rule 128.05 in this context is debatable, particularly given the timing of the citation and that over 300 pages of material were cited, but we have previously considered the Commission's publicly available materials in construing the Guidelines,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

Sent. Guidelines 2.B.7.a. Scovel argues that \"offense definitions\" refers to the substantive, element-based definitions of crimes (e.g., the definition of fifth-degree possession in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.025\">\n     Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.025\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , subds. 2, 4 ). The State, by contrast, favors an interpretation of \"offense definitions\" that is synonymous with the parenthetical citing to the crime-level definitions in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.02\">\n     Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.02\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , subds. 2-4a (e.g., a \"felony\" is \"any crime for which a sentence of imprisonment for more than one year may be imposed\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    We need not decide which of these competing approaches wins out, because under either interpretation, Scovel properly received a criminal history point.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Navarre v.

Under the first interpretation, his prior offense was still a crime classified as a felony based on the Legislature's definition of fifth-degree possession at the time he committed this current offense (March 2016, several months before the effective date of the DSRA). And under the second interpretation, Scovel's prior offense,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.025\">\n     Minn.
