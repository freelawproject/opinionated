One sibling commenced this action for a partition. Two court-appointed referees issued a report recommending that both parcels be awarded to one sibling, who has leased both parcels for 14 years, and that she make payments to the other two siblings for the value of their respective one-third interests. The district court rejected the referees' report and determined that the two parcels would be physically divided so that each sibling would own an equal amount of property. We conclude that the district court erred by rejecting the referees' report, which is consistent with the information provided to the referees and is consistent with Minnesota law. Therefore, we reverse and remand for confirmation and implementation of the referees' report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This partition action concerns two parcels of rural property in Winona County with a combined area of 260 acres. One parcel, known as the Home Farm, consists of 160 acres, of which 62 acres are tillable farmland, 22 acres are open pasture, 68 acres are woods and ponds, and 8 acres are a road and buildings. The other parcel, known as the Bethany Farm, consists of 100 acres, of which 97 acres are tillable farmland. The two parcels are not contiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Both parcels were owned by Henry Neumann and Alice Neumann until 1995, when they conveyed the property to a revocable trust. Henry and Alice operated a dairy farm using both parcels. They had three adult children: Jack C. Neumann (hereinafter Neumann), Roxann Anderson, and Kimberly Pronschinske.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2004, Pronschinske and her husband purchased Henry and Alice's herd of dairy cattle and began leasing both parcels. Since then, the Pronschinskes have lived in a mobile home on the Home Farm with their children and have operated an organic dairy farm. The Pronschinskes keep their herd of dairy cattle on the Home Farm and grow organic feed on the Bethany Farm. The Pronschinskes have obtained organic certification for their dairy operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Henry died in 2008. The following year, the Pronschinskes and Alice (acting as trustee) entered into a written lease agreement for both parcels. The agreement provided that the value of any capital improvements made by the Pronschinskes would \"be applied to the purchase price of the farm in the future\" or, if the property were \"sold to someone else,\" the Pronschinskes would \"be allowed to remove\" the capital improvements \"or be compensated for them.\" The same language was included in written lease agreements that were executed in 2010 and 2011. The 2011 agreement, which was signed by a bank that had been appointed trustee, provided further that if the Pronschinskes and the trust entered into a purchase agreement, the Pronschinskes' rent payments would \"be applied to the purchase price.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Alice died in 2012. Upon her death, Henry and Alice's three children became the\n   beneficiaries of the trust. The trustee attempted to negotiate an agreement with the three beneficiaries concerning the manner of distribution of the trust's real property. Neumann and the trustee filed petitions for instruction. The district court determined that the trust agreement required the trustee to distribute the property to the three children in equal shares. This court affirmed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re H &amp; A Neumann Revocable Trust\n   </em>\n   , No. A13-1150,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201407951\">\n    2014 WL 1407951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Minn. App. Apr. 14, 2014). Thereafter, the trustee conveyed the two parcels of real property to the three children, as co-tenants with equal undivided interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In July 2015, Neumann and his wife commenced this partition action against Anderson, Pronschinske, and Pronschinske's husband. In their complaint, the Neumanns requested \"a partition of the Property according to the respective rights and interest of the parties, as provided by statute.\" In the alternative, the Neumanns requested a sale of the property. The Neumanns also sought to require the Pronschinskes to make payments to the Neumanns and Anderson to ensure that both co-tenants received one-third of the fair rental value of the property. In their answer to the Neumanns' complaint, the Pronschinskes requested a \"partition of the Property according to the respective rights and interests of the parties, as provided by statute.\" The Pronschinskes also requested reimbursement for their capital improvements to the property and for their rent payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In September 2015, the parties stipulated to the appointment of two referees. The stipulation provided that the two referees \"shall act as disinterested referees and shall submit a report to the parties in a reasonable period of time setting forth their recommendation.\" The district court promptly approved the stipulation and issued an order adopting its terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In August 2016, the referees issued a six-page report. The report states that the referees \"have personally met with the Plaintiffs, Defendants, and their respective attorneys\" and \"have personally viewed the property and inspected all of the buildings as well as the improvements completed by\" the Pronschinskes. The remainder of the report consists of 18 paragraphs of \"findings\" and four paragraphs of \"conclusions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The referees found that the parties agreed to use an appraisal that had been performed in 2012, which valued the Bethany Farm at $610,000 and the Home Farm at $672,000, for a total value of $1,282,000. The referees found that the Pronschinskes wish to remain on the property and that \"partition cannot be had without great prejudice to\" them because their home is located on the property, because they have made substantial capital improvements to the farm, and because they have taken steps to obtain organic certification for their dairy operation. The referees also found that Neumann and Anderson \"have both expressed orally and in writing their belief the property should be sold\" and that, in light of their desires to no longer own the property, \"partition can be had with appropriate compensation or owelty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The referees concluded that the district court should enter an order awarding the Pronschinskes both parcels, with credit for $119,000 of capital improvements, thereby reducing the total value of the parties' combined interests to $1,163,000. The referees concluded that the district court should order the Pronschinskes to pay $387,667 (which is one-third of $1,163,000) to both Neumann and Anderson for their respective interests in the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In December 2016, the Neumanns filed a motion to set aside the referees' report. The Neumanns did not submit any evidence to the district court. In January 2017, the Pronschinskes moved to adopt the referees' report. The Pronschinskes submitted as evidence the prior farm lease agreements, a letter from Anderson and Neumann requesting the immediate public sale of the land with no further appraisal, a letter from a tax professional assessing the value of the Pronschinskes' improvements, and two affidavits. In one affidavit, Pronschinske stated, among other things, that she and her husband had spent $236,079 on capital improvements to the Home Farm. In the other affidavit, the Pronschinskes' farm-business advisor stated that both parcels are critical to the Pronschinskes' dairy operation because it would be prohibitively expensive for them to purchase organic-certified feed if they were not able to grow organic feed on the Bethany Farm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Without resolving the pending motions, the district court issued an interim order referring the matter back to referees for clarification of their finding that a partition would cause \"great prejudice\" to the Pronschinskes. In a supplemental report, the referees clarified various aspects of their initial report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In August 2017, the district court granted the Neumanns' motion to set aside the referees' report and denied the Pronschinskes' motion to confirm the referees' report. The district court stated that the recommendations of the \"referees do not bind the Court but are advisory.\" The district court also stated that, although there is evidence that the Pronschinskes would be prejudiced by a partition in kind, there was no evidence of great prejudice to all owners, and no evidence that a division in kind would reduce the value of the property. The district court \"recognize[d] that the Pronschinskes may experience a business loss if the property is divided\" but stated that the Pronschinskes' \"hardship is not such that would require this Court to favor one co-tenant over the other.\" The district court concluded that Neumann, Anderson, and Pronschinske \"are entitled to judgment awarding them each 1/3 of the property.\" Specifically, the district court stated that each of the three children is \"entitled to own ... 86.666 acres\" of the property. The district court further concluded, \"If the parties have an agreement with regard to the specific shares to be allotted, such agreement shall be submitted to this Court within 30 days from the date of this Order\" but that, \"if there is no such agreement, the parties shall notify the court within 30 days, at which time this matter shall be referred back to the referees for that determination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Pronschinske and her husband appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    <strong>\n     ISSUE\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Did the district court err by granting the Neumanns' motion to set aside the referees' report, by denying the Pronschinskes' motion to confirm the referees' report, and by determining that the two parcels should be partitioned in kind so that each of the three cotenants owns an equal number of acres of the property?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    <strong>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The Pronschinskes argue that the district court erred by setting aside and not confirming the referees' report. Specifically, they argue that the district court erred by not giving deference to the referees' findings and by reasoning that the referees' recommendation is not supported by law. They also argue that, in light of the circumstances of this case, the district court erred in its independent analysis of\n    the parties' arguments by not giving sufficient consideration to equitable principles.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    <strong>\n     A.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    An action to partition real property is governed by chapter 558 of the Minnesota Statutes.

In Minnesota, a written report by the referees is specifically required by section 558.06.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Finally, Freeman explains in detail the deference that is owed to the written report of court-appointed referees:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n    The report of the commission is not final. It may be set aside by the Court. But where the Court is asked to set aside the action of the commissioners, on the ground that they erred in making their allotments, whereby an unequal partition has been made, it will not grant the relief asked except in extreme cases-cases in which the partition is based on wrong principles, or it is shown by a very clear and decided preponderance of evidence that the commissioners\n    have made a grossly unequal allotment. In one case, it was said\n    <em>\n     that the report of the commissioners is to be regarded in the light of a verdict of a jury rendered upon a trial at law\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     and it will be disturbed or interfered with by the Court only upon grounds similar to those on which a verdict would be set aside and a new trial granted. Nay, more: it will be regarded with greater consideration even than a verdict\n    </em>\n    , because, in this particular instance, the commissioners are persons who are selected by the parties themselves on account of their superior judgment and capacity to perform this particular service, and they were authorized to act upon a personal view of the property, and upon their individual knowledge of its value, location, etc., which they were left to acquire at their leisure, and from all the best sources of information in their power, and without regard to rules and forms of judicial proceedings in acquiring their knowledge. In England, it is improper for the Court to interfere with the valuation of the commissioners, unless there be any mistake in it so gross as to induce the Court to think that the commissioners have acted from unjust, corrupt, or fraudulent motives.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Freeman,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , \u00a7 525, at 695-96 (emphasis added) (quotations and citations omitted).

The referees also noted that, under the terms of the written lease between the Pronschinskes and the trust, the Pronschinskes would be contractually entitled to reimbursements in excess of those recommended by the referees if the property were sold pursuant to a purchase agreement, which would make a public sale prejudicial to the Neumanns and Anderson as well as to the Pronschinskes.

This is so because the referees \"are persons who are selected by the parties themselves on account of their superior judgment and capacity to perform this particular service, and they were authorized to act upon a personal view of the property, and upon their individual knowledge of its value, location, etc., which they were left to acquire at their leisure, and from all the best sources of information in their power, and without regard to rules and forms of judicial proceedings in acquiring their knowledge.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Freeman,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , \u00a7 525, at 695.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Thus, the district court did not give proper deference to the referees' finding that an equal division in kind would be prejudicial to all co-tenants.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    <strong>\n     2.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    In paragraph 15 of their report, the referees found that Neumann and Anderson \"have both expressed orally and in writing their belief [that] the property should be sold\" and that, in light of their desires, \"partition can be had with appropriate compensation or owelty.\" In its interim order, the district court stated that the Neumanns \"argue that the ... parcels should be partitioned in kind, with each co-tenant entitled to his or her equal share of the 260 total acres,\" that the Neumanns \"object to what they term a forced 'private sale' of the entire property to the Pronschinskes,\" and that the Neumanns propose in the alternative \"a public sale to the highest bidder with proceeds split equally between the siblings.\" The district court also stated that Anderson \"requests that each sibling receive his or her equal one-third share in the farm's value at a fair price ... or in the alternative that the farm be sold on the public market and proceeds divided by three.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    In their supplemental report, the referees reiterated that Neumann and Anderson had \"stat[ed] a desire to sell the property.\" To demonstrate the basis for this statement, the referees attached to their supplemental report a handwritten letter that was signed by Neumann and Anderson in April 2016. The letter states, \"Put the farm up on public auction.... No further appraisal needed.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    In the order that is challenged on appeal, the district court repeated its statement that the Neumanns \"argue that the property should be partitioned in kind, with each co-tenant entitled to his or her equal share of the 260 total acres,\" and that the Neumanns alternatively propose \"a public sale to the highest bidder with proceeds split equally between the siblings.\" The district court's order accurately reflects the arguments made by the Neumanns' attorney in the memorandum of law supporting their motion to set aside the referees' report. But the arguments of counsel that are made after the referees have issued their report cannot alter the statements that the parties themselves\n    made to the referees before they issued their report. In this particular situation, Neumann's position as of April 2016 was expressed in writing. The referees reasonably relied on Neumann's expressed preference for a public sale, which implies that he does not wish to own the property after a partition. In light of Neumann's expressed preference, the referees reasonably found that the Neumanns would not be prejudiced by a private sale of the property to the Pronschinskes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The district court also repeated its statement that Anderson \"requests that each sibling receive his or her equal one-third share in the farm's value at a fair price ... or in the alternative that the farm be sold on the public market and proceeds divided by three.\" This statement accurately reflects a letter that Anderson submitted to the district court in January 2017, when the other parties were briefing their cross-motions. Anderson's letter also states, \"I am more than happy to sell my share back to [Pronschinske] and be paid in full. I would prefer to keep [Pronschinske] and her family on our family farm.\" Anderson's letter indicates that the referees' report is more closely aligned with her position than is the district court's order.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Thus, the district court did not give proper deference to the referees' findings concerning the positions of the parties when the referees were conducting their investigation and preparing their report.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    <strong>\n     3.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    A district court may not set aside a referees' report in a partition action unless the report \"is based on wrong principles.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Freeman,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , \u00a7 525, at 695. Thus, we proceed to determine whether the referees' report is consistent with Minnesota law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The district court's order quoted the pertinent language of section 558.11, which provides, \"When it appears that partition cannot be made equal between the parties without prejudice to the rights or interests of some, the court may adjudge compensation to be made by one to another for equality of partition....\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20558.11\">\n     Minn. Stat. \u00a7 558.11\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The district court then stated, \"However, '[o]welty should be decreed with caution.' \" (Quoting\n    <em>\n     Hoerr\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8888841\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/140/223/#p226\">\n     140 Minn. at 226\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=165%20N.W.%20472\">\n     165 N.W. at 474\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) The district court did not further consider the possibility of an unequal division in kind with owelty. Nothing in the\n    <em>\n     Hoerr\n    </em>\n    opinion forecloses the referees' recommended remedy of a private sale to Pronschinske in exchange for payments to Neumann and Anderson.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The district court also reasoned, \"The law favors partition of land in kind, as opposed to partition by sale, as partition in kind does not force a person to sell his or her private property.\" (Citing\n    <em>\n     Beebout\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10597058\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/447/465/#p467\">\n     447 N.W.2d at 467\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) This principle of law is accurately stated, but it applies only to the extent that co-tenants wish to retain their property interests. In this case, Neumann and Anderson had expressed their desires to relinquish their interests in the property. They also had agreed on the value of the property, and Neumann urged the district court to adopt the referees' findings concerning the value of the two parcels. Given the parties' respective positions, the district court could have accommodated all parties' positions by ordering a private sale to the co-tenant who had unequivocally expressed a desire to own the entire property.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The district court further reasoned, \"Whatever mode of partition is adopted, it must be capable of execution without advancing the interests of one owner at the expense of the others.\" (Quoting\n    <em>\n     Swogger\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"293223\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/243/458/#p466\">\n     243 Minn. at 467\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20N.W.2d%20376\">\n     68 N.W.2d at 384\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) The district court acknowledged the Pronschinskes' investments in the property and their likely business losses upon an equal\n    division in kind. But the district court stated that the Pronschinskes' \"hardship is not such that would require this Court to favor one co-tenant over the other by delivering the entire inheritance to her with the condition that the other co-tenants are forced to sell their shares to her for compensation.\" The district court added, \"The fact that one co-tenant would benefit more than others or would make better use of the property does not rebut the presumption of partition in kind.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    This part of the district court's order is inconsistent with the supreme court's opinion in\n    <em>\n     Swogger\n    </em>\n    . Even if one co-tenant would benefit from ownership more than the other tenants, there is no indication in the record that such benefit would come\n    <em>\n     at the expense of\n    </em>\n    the Neumanns or Anderson. Rather, the record indicates that the Pronschinskes would derive more utility from the property than the other tenants because the Pronschinskes have improved the property to suit their organic dairy operation. There is no indication in the record that a public sale would yield a higher price than the value that the referees assigned to the property, a value to which both the Neumanns and Anderson agreed and to which the Neumanns stipulated in district court proceedings. In any event, referees \"should, so far as they can do so without injustice to the others, assign each cotenant the part most valuable to him, whether this special value arose from his having made improvements or from any other cause.\" Freeman,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , \u00a7 522, at 692.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Furthermore, the general thrust of the\n    <em>\n     Swogger\n    </em>\n    opinion is that the law of partition is not limited to the statutory remedies prescribed in chapter 558 but, rather, includes equitable principles, which are flexible enough to accommodate any number of particular circumstances.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Swogger\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"293223\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/243/458/#p466\">\n     243 Minn. at 461-68\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20N.W.2d%20376\">\n     68 N.W.2d at 380-85\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The\n    <em>\n     Swogger\n    </em>\n    court stated that a district court's \"equitable determinations ... are not restricted to the specific situations and the methods or plans of partition enumerated in the partition act.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 466,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20N.W.2d%20376\">\n     68 N.W.2d at 383\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Rather, a district court\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n    may exercise its general equitable powers and resort to the most advantageous plans which the nature of the particular case admits in effecting, without great prejudice to any of the owners, a partition of one or more tracts, whether such partition be accomplished by a division in kind, by sale, or by any practical combination of both methods.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 466-67,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20N.W.2d%20376\">\n     68 N.W.2d at 383\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Consistent with those principles, the\n    <em>\n     Swogger\n    </em>\n    court concluded that the trial court erred by not considering one co-tenant's request for an order setting off one part of the property to him and ordering a public sale of the remainder of the property, with the proceeds to be divided among the remaining four co-tenants.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20N.W.2d%20376\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20N.W.2d%20376\">\n     at 468-69\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20N.W.2d%20376\">\n     68 N.W.2d at 384-85\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In this case, it is difficult, if not impossible, to conceive of an equal partition in kind that would allow the Pronschinske to continue to operate their dairy farm on 86.666 acres. The referees determined that such a result would be inequitable.\n    <em>\n     Swogger\n    </em>\n    provides a broad legal basis for the referees' recommendation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Finally, the district court's order for an equal partition in kind conflicts with the referees' specific finding that such a division would be prejudicial to the Pronschinskes. The referees had ample reasons for that finding. As stated in the referees' report and supplemental report, the Pronschinskes have operated a dairy farm on the property since purchasing a herd of dairy cattle from Henry and Alice in 2004, have made significant capital improvements in the property, have taken steps to obtain organic certification for the farm,\n    have an ongoing need to grow grain on the Bethany Farm to ensure the farm's profitability, have established a home on the property, and wish to remain on the property.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Thus, the district court did not have reasons for setting aside the referees' report that would justify a grant of a motion for a new trial.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Robbins\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"166937\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/133/49/#p51\">\n     133 Minn. at 51\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=157%20N.W.%20908\">\n     157 N.W. at 909\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
