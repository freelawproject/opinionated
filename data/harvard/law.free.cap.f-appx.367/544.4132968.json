The district court dismissed Alen\u2019s complaint as frivolous because it was filed more than two years after the applicable limitations period had expired, and Alen was not entitled to equitable tolling. Alen now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-20\">We agree with the district court that Alen\u2019s complaint was filed after the expiration of the two-year limitations period and that his two prior federal lawsuits, dismissed for want of prosecution and improper joinder, did not operate to toll the limitations period. <em>See, e.g., Holmes v. Tex. A &amp; M Univ., </em>145 F.3d 681, 684-85 (5th Cir.1998). As Alen\u2019s appeal is without merit, we dismiss it as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Alen is cautioned that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pau-peris in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-21\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b572-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
