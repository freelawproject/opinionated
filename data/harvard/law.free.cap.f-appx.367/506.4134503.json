The district court dismissed the suit because Munoz violated the court\u2019s discovery order by failing to answer questions during his deposition. The district court also denied Munoz leave to proceed IFP on appeal, finding that the appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Munoz\u2019s failure to cooperate during his deposition was in direct contravention of the district court\u2019s discovery order and prejudiced the opposing party by impeding its ability to gather information regarding his claim. As an attorney, Munoz was aware of his discovery obligations. Moreover, the imposition of a lesser sanction had failed to deter Munoz from disobeying the court\u2019s previous orders. Munoz has, therefore, failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the suit as a sanction for violating its discovery order. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2)(A)(v); <em>FDIC v. Conner, </em>20 F.3d 1376, 1380-81 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">Given the foregoing, Munoz has failed to show that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits.\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, his motion to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 &amp; n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-15\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b535-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
