On appeal, Catalan contends that two encounters with gunmen while he was campaigning for the National Advancement Party (\u201cPAN\u201d) in Guatemala amounted to past persecution, and therefore the BIA erred in denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-22\">When the BIA issues its own decision without expressly adopting the IJ\u2019s find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>ings, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Arboleda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>434 F.3d 1220, 1222 (11th Cir.2006) <em>(citing Al Naj-jar v. Ashcroft, 257 </em>F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001)). We liberally construe briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>aliens. <em>See Lorisme v. INS, </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1444 n. 3 (11th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test and will affirm if the decision \u201cis supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007). Under the substantial evidence test, we can reverse a finding of fact by the BIA \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefe-mi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004). The BIA\u2019s legal determinations are reviewed <em>de novo. Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">An alien cannot apply for asylum unless he demonstrates \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An application filed after one year may nonetheless be considered if the alien demonstrates changed circumstances that materially affect his eligibility for asylum, or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing the asylum application. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Section 1158(a)(3) provides: \u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(3). We have previously held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) divests us of jurisdiction \u201cto review a decision regarding whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary circumstances that would excuse his untimely filing\u201d <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Because the BIA denied Catalan\u2019s asylum claim as time-barred, we lack jurisdiction over this claim and therefore dismiss Catalan\u2019s petition as it pertains to the denial of his asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">We have jurisdiction over Catalan\u2019s claim that he qualified for withholding of removal. In a withholding of removal claim, an alien shall not be removed to a country if his life or freedom would be threatened on account of political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The alien must show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be \u201cpersecuted or tortured upon being returned to h[is] country.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005). This standard is more stringent than the standard for asylum. <em>Id. </em>The alien must show that his fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 1231 (asylum context).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">An alien may make this showing in one of two ways. First, an alien may establish past persecution based on a protected ground, in which case a rebuttable presumption is created that his life or freedom would be threatened if he returned to his country. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). Secondly, an alien may qualify for withholding of removal if he \u201ccan demonstrate a future threat to his life or freedom\u201d based on a protected ground. <em>Id. </em>While the INA does not define persecution, we have held that persecution is an \u201cextreme\u201d concept, that mere harassment is not persecution, and that persecution requires \u201cmore than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s factual findings that Catalan was not per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>secuted, and that he will not suffer from future persecution by returning to Guatemala. Threats received by Catalan do not rise to the extreme concept of persecution, and Catalan failed to establish an objective fear of future persecution because he continued to reside in Guatemala without incident for nearly four years after the last incident. Accordingly, we deny the petition as to withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-15\">. Catalan did not mention his claim for relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d). Accordingly, he has waived any such claims. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that issues not raised on appeal are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
