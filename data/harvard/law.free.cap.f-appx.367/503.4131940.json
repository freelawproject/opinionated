He contends that the sentence was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and was therefore substantively unreasonable. Specifically, Galarza argues that the guidelines range was too severe because United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 was not empirically based and gave excessive weight to his prior robbery conviction. He contends that the guidelines range overstated the seriousness of his nonviolent reentry offense and failed to account for his motive for reentering the United States. Galarza also argues that this court should not afford a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence imposed under \u00a7 2L1.2; however, he recognizes that <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009), forecloses this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">This court reviews the \u201csubstantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">This court has consistently rejected Ga-larza\u2019s \u201cempirical data\u201d argument. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). The district court considered Ga-larza\u2019s request for a downward variance, and it ultimately determined that a sentence at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range was appropriate based on the circumstances of the case and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Galarza\u2019s assertions regarding \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s lack of an empirical basis, the weight given his prior robbery conviction, the nonviolent nature of his offense, and his motive for reentering the United States are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). As Galarza has not demonstrated that the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range was an abuse of discretion, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b531-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
