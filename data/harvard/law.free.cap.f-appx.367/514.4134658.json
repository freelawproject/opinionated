The district court sentenced him to 40 months of imprisonment, which was within the Guidelines range of 33 to 41 months. On appeal, Martin argues the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that the district court inordinately punished him for the seriousness of his crime, and did not account for either his personal history and characteristics or the circumstances surrounding the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-26\">The district court made an individualized sentencing decision based on the facts of the case in light of the factors set out in Section 3553(a). <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court\u2019s conclusion that a sentence within the Guidelines is appropriate is entitled to deference, and we presume that it is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The district court was in a superior position to find facts and assess their import <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>under Section 3553(a). We see no reason to disturb that court\u2019s discretionary decision to impose a sentence within the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b542-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
