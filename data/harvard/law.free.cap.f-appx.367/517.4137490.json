The district court sentenced Gandara to 72 months of imprisonment and to a five-year term of supervised release. On appeal, Gandara argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because: (1) the drug-trafficking guideline (U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2D1.1 (2008)) tends to overstate the sentence necessary in a mine-run case because it is not based upon empirical data; and (2) his personal history and circumstances, particularly his cultural assimilation into the United States, warrant a sentence at the lower end of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-22\">As Gandara did not object to the reasonableness of his sentence in the district court, this court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). His challenge to the drug-trafficking guideline based upon its alleged lack of supporting empirical data lacks merit. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S. ---, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). Accordingly, his within-guideline sentence is afforded a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 367. Gandara has not shown sufficient reason for this court to disturb that presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b545-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
