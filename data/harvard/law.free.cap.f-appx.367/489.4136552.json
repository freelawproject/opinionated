On appeal, he challenges his sentence and his counsel\u2019s effectiveness with regard to his sentence. The government argues that he waived his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-19\">We review the validity of an appeal waiver <em>de novo. United States v. Burns, </em>433 F.3d 442, 445 (5th Cir.2005). Our review of the record shows that Maldonado-Reyes\u2019s waiver of appeal was knowing and voluntary, <em>see United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005), and is therefore valid, so we decline to consider the merits of his claims. The appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b517-20\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
