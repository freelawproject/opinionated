Upon review, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction over the IJ\u2019s denial of discretionary relief and there is no merit to Orellana\u2019s due process claim. Therefore, we dismiss in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>part and deny in part this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Orellana, a native and citizen of Honduras, arrived in the United States in 1995. He obtained temporary protected status in 1998, but lost it in 2006. Thereafter, the Department of Homeland Security charged Orellana with removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), as an alien present without having been admitted or paroled.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Orellana filed an application for cancellation of removal, stating that his removal would result in an exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his daughter, who was a U.S. citizen. The IJ denied relief, concluding that Orellana had not met his burden to show hardship. The IJ further stated that, even if Orellana met his burden, the IJ would deny relief in his discretion. Orellana appealed to the BIA, asserting that the IJ failed to follow precedent as to hardship. Orellana did not address the IJ\u2019s denial of cancellation as a matter of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision that Orellana failed to meet the requirements showing hardship. The BIA also <em>sua sponte </em>addressed the discretionary denial of relief and affirmed on that ground as well. The instant petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">In his petition for review, Orellana argues that the IJ and BIA violated his right to due process by ignoring BIA precedent in finding that: (1) he did not show the requisite level of hardship required for cancellation of removal; and (2) he was not entitled to cancellation of removal as a matter of discretion. The government, in turn, responds that we lack jurisdiction over Orellana\u2019s petition because: (1) Orel-lana failed to exhaust administrative remedies with regard to his challenge of the IJ\u2019s denial of cancellation of removal as a matter of discretion; and (2) we lack jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) to review judgments regarding discretionary relief such as cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">We review jurisdictional questions <em>de novo. Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). We also review <em>de novo </em>constitutional claims and questions of law. <em>Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">A. Denial of Relief as a Matter of Discretion</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">A court may not review a final order of removal unless \u201cthe alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). This requirement is jurisdictional and, absent an excuse or exception, bars review of claims not raised before the BIA. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250. This jurisdictional bar applies even when the BIA has addressed the issue <em>sua sponte. Id. </em>at 1250-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-12\">Here, in his appeal to the BIA, Orellana did not challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of cancellation of removal as a matter of discretion. Therefore, even though the BIA addressed the issue <em>sua sponte, </em>Orellana failed to exhaust the issue and we lack jurisdiction to consider it. Accordingly, we dismiss that part of Orellana\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-13\">B. Denial of Relief on the Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b38-14\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, the Attorney General may cancel the removal of an alien who meets certain requirements, including establishing that \u201cremoval would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien\u2019s [U.S. citizen] spouse, parent, or child.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). We do not have jurisdiction to review any judgment regarding the granting of discretionary relief such as cancellation of removal. 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332-33 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201c[T]he exceptional and extremely unusual hardship determination [for the purpose of cancellation of removal] is a discretionary decision not subject to review.\u201d). We do, however, retain jurisdiction to consider constitutional claims or questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">\u201cIn order to establish a due process violation, an alien must show that he was deprived of liberty without due process of law, and that the asserted error caused him substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Or-opeza, </em>321 F.3d at 1333 (citations omitted). There is \u201cno constitutionally-protected right to discretionary relief from removal,\u201d such as cancellation. <em>Mohammed, </em>261 F.3d at 1251. This is because \u201can alien\u2019s actual chances of receiving such discretionary relief are too speculative, and too far beyond the capability of judicial review, to conclude that the alien has actually suffered prejudice.\u201d <em>Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, </em>178 F.3d 1139, 1148 (11th Cir.1999).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Because Orellana did not have a constitutionally protected right to cancellation of removal, his due process claims fail. Even assuming, however, that an IJ\u2019s failure to follow BIA precedent in denying a petitioner cancellation could amount to a due process violation, Orellana\u2019s challenge is still without merit. Contrary to Orellana\u2019s assertions, the IJ followed BIA precedent. Accordingly, we deny, on the merits, that part of Orellana\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
