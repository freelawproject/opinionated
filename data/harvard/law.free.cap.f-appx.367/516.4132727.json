Holder, </em>No. 08-60150 (5th Cir. Mar. 5, 2008). While his petition for review was pending, Semedo filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition in the district court challenging his continued detention. Semedo now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">We need to say no more about the application of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231, than to say that the Government cannot be faulted for delaying deportation while Semedo is prosecuting a habeas case in federal court. The Government now says the detention will end with his deportation when this case ends. It now ends and the complaint will shortly be moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b544-37\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
