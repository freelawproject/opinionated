He argues that the district court plainly erred in enhancing his sentence based on his prior conviction for aggravated assault of a peace officer because the offense did not fall within the definition of a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-25\">After reviewing the record and the applicable law, we agree that the district court committed plain error by using Maya-Duarte\u2019s Texas aggravated-assault conviction to increase his sentence. <em>See United States v. Fierro-Reyna, </em>466 F.3d 324, 329-30 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Munoz-Ortenza, </em>563 F.3d 112, 116 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, we vacate Maya-Duarte\u2019s sentence and remand for resen-tencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-26\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b540-27\">SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b540-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
