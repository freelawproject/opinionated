He contends the Government failed to provide sufficient evidence of a prior conviction to support the 16-level enhancement to his Sentencing Guidelines offense level, imposed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (prior conviction of crime of violence). Gonzalez also asserts he was denied effective assistance of counsel at sentencing because his attorney failed to object to this enhancement. (Although Gonzalez has completed his term of imprisonment, his appeal is <em>not </em>moot because he has not been deported and is currently serving a term of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Lares-Meraz, </em>452 F.3d 352, 355 (5th Cir.2006).)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-23\">Because Gonzalez did not object to the enhancement in the district court, review is only for plain error \u201cbased on the record before us as supplemented with the state-court documents\u201d related to Gonzalez\u2019 pri- or conviction. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d 477, 480 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 353, 172 L.Ed.2d 138 (2008). Reversible plain error exists where a clear or obvious error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>E.g., United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 962, 173 L.Ed.2d 153 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>(2009); <em>see also Puckett v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Even then, we have discretion to correct such an error and, generally, will do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Baker, </em>538 F.3d at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 provides for a 16-level increase if the defendant has been previously convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d. U.S.S'.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). State-court documents for Gonzalez\u2019 prior conviction, with which the Government has supplemented the record on appeal, show that he pleaded <em>nolo contendere </em>to a violation of Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 21.11(a)(1) (Indecency With a Child-Contact). This constitutes a felony of the second degree. <em>See </em>\u00a7 21.11(d). A conviction under this subsection constitutes a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Najerar-Najera, </em>519 F.3d 509, 512 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 139, 172 L.Ed.2d 105 (2008). By providing the state-court documents, the Government has met its burden of proving by a preponderance of relevant and reliable evidence that Gonzalez was convicted of a crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 524 (5th Cir.2008). Obviously, Gonzalez has failed to show plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">The record is not sufficiently developed to permit consideration of Gonzalez\u2019 ineffective-assistance claim. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1987) (\u201cThe general rule in this circuit is that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be resolved on direct appeal when the claim has not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d). Restated, this is not one of the \u201crare cases\u201d where it is appropriate to resolve such a claim on direct appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 314. Accordingly, we decline to address the merits of the ineffective-assistance claim. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b583-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
