Finfrock, through counsel, appeals the dismissal of his <em>pro se </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus aimed at his ongoing Florida civil commitment proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We granted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>certificate of appealability (COA) on the sole issue of whether the district court erred by abstaining, pursuant to <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), from reaching the merits of Finfrock\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. Fin-frock argues that the district court misapplied <em>Younger </em>by dismissing his petition without first obtaining a response from the state and reviewing the underlying state court records. Appellees now join in Fin-frock\u2019s request for a remand to the district court, so that they can file a response in support of their contention that no <em>Younger </em>exception allows Finfrock\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. We have jurisdiction over Fin-frock\u2019s timely appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 2253.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the availability of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1280 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). We review a district court\u2019s decision to abstain from enjoining pending state court proceedings on <em>Younger </em>grounds for an abuse of discretion. <em>Wexler v. Lepore, </em>385 F.3d 1336, 1338 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam). This Court has remanded where an inadequate factual record accompanied a district court\u2019s decision of a habeas motion. <em>See, e.g., Ferguson v. Culliver, </em>527 F.3d 1144, 1149 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (noting absence of trial record supporting district court decision of \u00a7 2254 petition on waiver-of-counsel claim); <em>Wyzykowski v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>226 F.3d 1213, 1219 (11th Cir.2000) (addressing the state\u2019s failure to file a record of the state court change-of-plea proceedings, to answer a \u00a7 2254 claim of actual innocence). In the light of these cases, a record that is less than fully developed, and the parties\u2019 joint request for a remand, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Finfrock\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition and remand for a determination on the briefs and the record whether <em>Younger </em>abstention applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-29\">. Finfrock filed his petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The magistrate judge however characterized it as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, citing <em>Medberry v. Crosby, </em>351 F.3d 1049, 1060 (11th Cir.2003). (D.l 1:2n. 2.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
