Dean, </em>487 F.3d 840 (11th Cir.2007). Dean argues that the district court erred in affirming the denial of his motion for a judgment for acquittal because: (1) his actions do not fall within the JSSA; (2) he did not knowingly and willfully disclose confidential jury information; and (3) his actions in pursuit of a legitimate claim to defend himself were protected by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">Dean appeals his conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1867(f) for unlawful disclosure of jury selection materials obtained from his original tax-evasion trial. Therefore, it is necessary to start with his original tax-evasion trial to put the present appeal into its proper context.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">On 17 March 2005, Dean was indicted by a grand jury on six counts of tax evasion, all in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201, and one count of endeavoring to obstruct and impede the due administration of the internal revenue laws, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(a). The trial was set for 5 December 2005. <em>See United States v. Dean, </em>487 F.3d 840, 845 (11th Cir.2007). On 24 November 2005, before the commencement of trial, Dean filed a motion to inspect, examine, and copy all jury selection records pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1867(a) and (f) and the Sixth Amendment. On 1 December 2005, the district court granted the motion by instructing Dean to contact Beatrice Spencer of the U.S. District Court in Tallahassee, Florida, but cautioned him to \u201cbe mindful of the constraints of the Privacy Act\u201d pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1867(f). Through his representatives, Dean obtained the relevant jury information on 2 December 2005, which turned out to be incomplete because it only contained the petit jury lists and not the grand jury lists. <em>Dean, </em>487 F.3d at 845-846. Dean received and inspected copies of the grand jury list on the day of the trial. <em>Id. </em>at 846. A jury found Dean guilty on 7 December 2005 and the district court sentenced him to a total of 84 months of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>We affirmed Dean\u2019s convictions and sentences. <em>Id. </em>at 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">During Dean\u2019s resultant incarceration, on 29 January 2007, a grand jury charged him with one count of unlawfully disclosing the contents of a record and paper used by a clerk of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida in connection with the jury selection process, in violation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1867(a)-(c) and (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-14\">A bench trial commenced on 7 May 2007, before a magistrate judge. Exh. Vol. 3, Exh. 77. Rex Blackburn, a police officer, testified that a personal identification number (\u201cPIN\u201d) assigned to Dean to make telephone calls from prison showed that three calls were made in January 2006, two to telephone number (850) 455-1150 and one to telephone number (850) 623-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>3836. <em>Id. </em>at 19-21. Kathy Stinson, a supervisor at the Santa Rosa County Sheriffs Office, testified that two more calls were made on 4 March 2006, to (850) 455-1150. <em>Id. </em>at 23-25. Also, Stinson testified that three calls were made between March and April 2006 to the same numbers above from a PIN that belonged to an inmate named Michael Pair. <em>Id. </em>at 25-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Beatrice Spencer, a jury administrator for the Clerk\u2019s Office of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, testified that she received a court order on 1 December 2005 that instructed her to allow Dean to inspect jury selection records of his impending tax evasion trial. <em>Id. </em>at 35-37, 40. After confirming twice with Dean on the telephone the types of documents sought, Spencer released copies of the jury information forms, letters requesting excuse from summonses, and undeliverable summonses to B.C. Williams and Sharon Branco, to whom had Dean had a limited power of attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 37-39. Next, Spencer explained that the district court\u2019s \u201cjury plan\u201d for selecting jurors involved a master wheel that contained a list of all registered voters who were randomly selected to be placed in the wheel. <em>Id. </em>at 41-42. To be selected into the master wheel, potential jurors were sent a \u201cjuror qualification questionnaire\u201d to determine whether they would be allowed to serve. <em>Id. </em>at 42. Once the potential jurors were included in the master wheel, Spencer would send out separate summonses and \u201cjury information forms\u201d for those selected for actual jury duty. The master wheel used for Dean\u2019s tax evasion trial was still in use at the time of Spencer\u2019s testimony and was scheduled to be emptied in October 2008. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Madeline Griffin, one of the jurors from Dean\u2019s tax evasion trial, testified that she received two letters from a \u2018William Jones\u201d after the trial. <em>Id. </em>at 60-61. Pamela Hardy, a deputy U.S. Marshal, testified that pursuant to an official investigation, she contacted all jurors from Dean\u2019s first trial and discovered other letters from William Jones, similar to those that Griffin had received. <em>Id. </em>at 65-69. Tanya Burgess, an IRS agent, summarized the letters from Jones as generally inquiring as to why the jury convicted Dean. <em>Id. </em>at 70-73. Burgess testified that documents seized from Dean\u2019s prison cell showed that Michael Pair and Dean were \u201cbuddies\u201d in prison. <em>Id. </em>at 75-76. The seized documents also included: (1) contact information for a \u201cBill Jones\u201d; (2) numerous references to and letters from Jones; and (3) the telephone number (850) 455-1150 with the name \u201cSport\u201d beside it; and (4) the number (850) 623-3836 with the name \u201cLeslie\u201d next to it. <em>Id. </em>at 76-79. \u201cSport\u201d was identified by Dean during recorded conversations as Fred Suttles, and \u201cLeslie\u201d as Leslie Watson. <em>Id. </em>at 77-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">The exhibits submitted by the government include transcripts of recorded telephone conversations from Dean while he was in prison. Exh. Folder 5, Gov\u2019t Exhs. T1-T8. The first recorded telephone call, dated 1 January 2006, between Dean, Sut-tles, and John Weber, showed the three participants discussing ways to retrieve the grand jury list from \u201cLarry\u201d so Suttles and Weber could have the list as well. <em>Id., </em>Exh. Tl. Toward the end of the conversation, Weber cautioned that Dean was only authorized to have the grand jury list, but may not be authorized to \u201cdisseminate it further,\u201d to which Dean replied, \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In a subsequent telephone conversation on the same day, Dean reiterated to Suttles and Weber that he was \u201cauthorized\u201d to have the grand jury list, but could not \u201cgo out and disseminate it, and publish it, and put it on [his] website and stuff like that.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Exh. T2. In a conversation between Dean and Watson on 17 January 2006, Dean instructed Watson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>to first find the section of the trial transcript where the jury was polled, and then \u201cgive those names [and] jury questionnaires\u201d to \u201cPat,\u201d so Pat could \u201cstart setting up interviews.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Exh. T3. In a conversation between Dean, Suttles, and Billy Bass on 4 March 2006, Dean instructed Suttles and Bass to \u201cask [Watson] to put together the list of jurors and phone numbers and addresses\u201d so that \u201cLeo\u201d could \u201cstart calling them today.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Exh. T4. In a conversation between Dean, Sut-tles, and \u201cJeff\u2019 on 22 March 2006, Dean stated that \u201cLeslie could only find eleven of the questionnaires\u201d because the questionnaire for the foreperson was missing. <em>Id., </em>Exh. T6. In a conversation between Dean and Watson on 23 March 2006, Dean instructed Watson to conduct a \u201czaba search\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on a grand jury member. <em>Id., </em>Exh. T7. Finally, in a conversation between Dean, Suttles, and Weber on 8 April 2006, Dean stated that \u201cLarry\u201d had a set of juror questionnaires and \u201cLeslie\u201d had another set as well. <em>Id., </em>Exh. T8.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">At the close of the government\u2019s case in chief, Dean moved for a judgment of acquittal on the grounds that the government had failed to prove that Dean or his acquaintances actually disclosed confidential information regarding the jury selection process from the original trial. Exh. Vol. 3, Exh. 77 at 95-99. Specifically, Dean argued that neither he nor his associates actually disclosed confidential information, in that the names of the actual jurors who had served in his first trial were transcribed and became public information at the commencement of trial, or alternatively, at the end of the trial when the jurors were polled. <em>Id. </em>at 95-98, 102-04, 107-08. Dean further argued that a defendant could legally contact jurors after a trial. <em>Id. </em>at 101-02. Also, Dean asserted that he could have gotten the names and addresses of the jurors from other sources instead of the jury information forms. <em>Id. </em>at 101. It is noteworthy that Dean did not argue that the JSSA contained a separate <em>mens rea </em>requirement that the offense be committed \u201cknowingly and willfully,\u201d or that the government failed to prove such element beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See id. </em>at 95-102. Moreover, Dean did not argue that his actions were protected by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">On the next day, the magistrate judge found Dean guilty of the offense charged and denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal. Exh. Vol. 3, Exh. 78 at 2-3. In a written order, the magistrate judge specifically found that Dean, \u201cdirectly or through third parties, willfully and unlawfully disclosed ... Jury Information Forms\u201d by providing such forms to Leslie Watson and allowing them to end up in the possession of William Jones. Exh. Vol. 1, Exh. 60 at 7; Exh. Vol. 3, Exh. 78 at 2-3. The magistrate judge rejected Dean\u2019s contention that once the names of the jurors became public record during the original trial, he could legally disclose all other confidential information concerning the jurors. Exh. Vol. 1, Exh. 60 at 8. The magistrate judge added that Dean\u2019s motive in contacting the jurors was \u201cirrelevant,\u201d since the disclosure of confidential information for any purpose other than filing a motion to challenge the jury pool would be a criminal act. <em>Id. </em>at 10. Dean was sentenced to six months of imprisonment, to be served consecutive to his current tax-evasion sentences. Exh. Vol. 1, Exh. 73; Exh. Vol. 4, Exh. 80 at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Dean appeals, arguing: (1) that he was entitled to acquittal or a finding of not guilty because his conduct with the jury information related to a legitimate legal claim to defend himself; (2) that he was entitled to acquittal or a finding of not guilty because the government failed to prove the relevant <em>mens rea; </em>and (3) that he was entitled to acquittal because his conduct was protected by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of judgment of acquittal.\u201d <em>United States v. Browne, </em>505 F.3d 1229, 1253 (11th Cir.2007). We also review <em>de novo </em>issues of statutory interpretation. <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>130 F.3d 1458,1461 (11th Cir.1997). Nevertheless, we review claims that are raised for the first time on appeal for plain error. <em>United States v. Rahim, </em>431 F.3d 753, 756 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). This includes cases in which a party objects to a trial court\u2019s ruling on a specific ground and subsequently attacks the ruling via a different argument on appeal. <em>See United States v. Puche, </em>350 F.3d 1137, 1148 n. 5 (11th Cir.2003). This also includes cases in which a party fails to object during a trial conducted by a magistrate judge but does so in district court. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>121 F.3d 615, 618 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that the defendant\u2019s failure to raise constitutional issues at a trial conducted by a magistrate judge \u201creduces our review to a search for plain error\u201d). Plain error exists if there is (1) error; (2) that is \u201cclear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute\u201d; (3) that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it would affect the outcome of the trial; and (4) \u201cif the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Dean failed to raise all three arguments on appeal in front of the magistrate judge during his bench trial, we review them for plain error only. <em>Williams, </em>121 F.3d at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">First, Dean argues that his actions are outside the reach of the JSSA because the JSSA does not penalize disclosures pursuant to a legitimate effort to construct a post-trial defense. Dean\u2019s disclosure of confidential jury information satisfied all elements of the JSSA and did not fall under an exception, even if he was pursuing a legitimate argument on appeal of his tax-evasion convictions. As an initial matter, even though Dean correctly contends that a defendant is always entitled to inspect jury records according to <em>Test v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 28, 95 S.Ct. 749, 42 L.Ed.2d 786 (1975), he ignores the fact that <em>Test </em>and the JSSA govern mutually exclusive rights. The plain language of the JSSA imposes restrictions on the purpose and timing of a defendant\u2019s disclosure of confidential jury information after he obtains such information under <em>Test. </em>The JSSA expressly permits disclosure if it is: (1) \u201cpursuant to the district court plan or ... necessary in the preparation ... of a motion\u201d under the previous subsections; or (2) \u201cafter the master jury wheel has been emptied and refilled ... and all persons selected to serve as jurors before the master wheel was emptied have completed such service.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1867(f). None of the exceptions above applies in Dean\u2019s situation, since he failed to use the information for a statutorily permissible pux-pose or during the applicable period.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">Even though the JSSA allows Dean to disseminate confidential information for the purpose of filing a motion to challenge the jury selection procedxires at the earlier of two events \u2014 \u201cbefore the voir dire exami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>nation begins, or within seven days after the defendant discovered or could have discovered ... the grounds therefor\u201d \u2014 the record shows that Dean did not disclose such information in preparation of filing a \u00a7 1867(a) motion or before the expiration of the applicable deadline. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1867(a). Specifically, the record shows the following timeline for Dean\u2019s original tax evasion trial: (1) Dean was indicted by a grand jury on 17 March 2005; (2) Dean filed a motion to inspect jury selection records on 24 November 2005; (3) Dean obtained jury information forms of the pet-it jury on 2 December 2005; (4) Dean inspected and copied grand jury information in the morning of 5 December 2005; (5) Dean\u2019s trial commenced on 5 December 2005; and (6) Dean was convicted by a jury on 7 December 2005. <em>See Dean, </em>487 F.3d at 845-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Accordingly, Dean\u2019s dissemination of confidential jury information over the telephone from January to March 2006 to formulate a post-trial defense happened after all the relevant deadlines set forth to file a \u00a7 1867(a) motion had passed. <em>See </em>Exh. Folder 5, gov\u2019t exhs. T1-T8. Likewise, Dean concedes that the disclosure was pursuant to mounting a post-trial defense rather than filing a pre-trial motion under subsection (a). Finally, Dean fails to satisfy the \u201ctiming\u201d requirement because the record shows that the master wheel in use during Dean\u2019s tax evasion trial had not been emptied at the time of his disclosure. <em>See </em>exh. 3, transcript 5/7/07 at 42. Therefore, there was no error, much less plain error, in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Dean\u2019s disclosure of confidential jury information satisfied all the elements of the JSSA and did not fall under an exception, even if he was pursuing a legitimate post-trial defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Second, Dean submits that the JSSA requires a <em>mens rea </em>of criminal intent, which he lacked because he did not knowingly and willfully disclose the information. We have held that if a criminal statute is silent as to <em>mens rea, </em>such silence is \u201cdispositive\u201d because \u201c[wjhere no specific intent element is apparent on the face of the statute, the crime is one of general intent.\u201d <em>United States v. Campa, </em>529 F.3d 980, 999 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks and citation omitted). A defendant \u201cneed not intend to violate the law to commit a general intent crime, but he must actually intend to do the act that the law proscribes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Because the JSSA is silent as to the requisite <em>mens rea </em>for a criminal conviction, it is a general intent statute that requires only a \u201cknowing\u201d intent to commit the act proscribed by the statute. <em>United States v. Knight, </em>490 F.3d 1268, 1271 (11th Cir.2007). Accordingly, Dean\u2019s conviction under the JSSA is proper because the record shows, and he has also conceded, that he knowingly disclosed confidential information to others outside of the statutory-permissible grounds. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Dean\u2019s arguments on this question are inapposite. He contends that the JSSA resembles a \u201cstrongly disfavored\u201d strict liability statute if we do not fill the missing <em>mens rea </em>requirement with specific intent. Our precedent, however, establishes that the absence of a statutory <em>mens rea </em>creates a general intent crime. <em>See Campa, </em>529 F.3d at 999. Likewise, Dean\u2019s assertion that he lacked even general intent because he did not knowingly cause harm to any juror ignores the fact that \u201cknowing\u201d intent only requires him to intend to commit the statutorily prohibited act of disclosing confidential jury information outside the permissible grounds. <em>See id. </em>Dean\u2019s reliance on <em>Knight </em>to show that we have imputed a <em>mens rea </em>element into an otherwise silent statute to separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>\u201cwrongful from innocent conduct\u201d is misplaced. Contrary to Dean\u2019s contention, <em>Knight </em>stands for the proposition that: (1) a statute with a silent <em>mens rea </em>only requires general intent, and (2) requiring a <em>mens rea </em>of general intent satisfies the goal of properly separating wrongful and innocent conduct. <em>See Knight, </em>490 F.3d at 1270-71 (rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that a silent <em>mens rea </em>requires specific intent instead of general intent to separate properly wrongful and innocent conduct). Finally, because the JSSA is unambiguous, the rule of lenity does not apply. <em>See United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507,128 S.Ct. 2020, 2025, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Third, Dean argues that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments protect his actions with the jury information. We review issues of constitutional law <em>de novo. Gilbert, </em>130 F.3d at 1461. Nevertheless, when the defendant fails to object below, we reverse only for plain error. <em>United States v. Nash, </em>438 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam); <em>Williams, </em>121 F.3d at 618. The district court correctly reviewed Dean\u2019s constitutional claims for plain error because, contrary to his assertions, the record shows that he had failed to raise such objections during the relevant proceedings in front of the magistrate judge. Even though Dean correctly contends that the district court did address his constitutional arguments below, and that he did cite to the Sixth Amendment for support in a motion filed before the commencement of his tax-evasion trial, this does not demonstrate that he had timely preserved the relevant constitutional issues in his motion for a judgment of acquittal in front of the magistrate judge. <em>See Williams, </em>121 F.3d at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The Sixth Amendment provides an accused with myriad trial rights, such as the right to a speedy and public trial, to be tried by an impartial jury, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, to confront witnesses against him, to have compulsory process for obtaining favorable witnesses, and to assistance of counsel. The Fifth Amendment prohibits deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. At a minimum, due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before any governmental deprivation of a liberty interest. <em>Grayden v. Rhodes, </em>345 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir. 2003). Accordingly, when government action deprives a person of liberty, it must do so fairly. <em>United States v. Salerno, </em>481 U.S. 739, 746, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 2101, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Dean cannot show plain error as to his Fifth and Sixth Amendment arguments. Dean asserts that his statutorily prohibited activities are protected by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments because (1) they were part of a legitimate defense effort, and (2) his conviction deprived him of the right to defend himself. Research has revealed no case of ours or from the Supreme Court addressing whether \u00a7 1867(f) violates a defendant\u2019s Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights. Even if the district court erroneously found that there was no constitutional violation, the error would not be \u201cplain\u201d in the absence of binding precedent that the constitutional matters should be resolved in Dean\u2019s favor. <em>See United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Dean argues that constitutional protections trump any statutory impediment to one\u2019s right to defend against criminal charges. In <em>Brooks v. Tennessee, </em>406 U.S. 605, 92 S.Ct. 1891, 32 L.Ed.2d 358 (1972), a state law mandated that a defendant testify before all defense witnesses or be foreclosed from testifying. The Supreme Court held that this violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights against self-incrimination and to due process. <em>Id. </em>at 609-12, 92 S.Ct. at 1893-95. Though the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>defendant in <em>Brooks </em>had his constitutional rights infringed upon by a state statute, Dean does not have an unqualified right to defend himself against criminal charges; the JSSA did not infringe upon a constitutionally-protected right. Dean was afforded a \u201cmeaningful opportunity to defend himself\u2019 and was convicted only after every element of the crime was established beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 313-14, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2786, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Dean appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming a magistrate judge\u2019s denial of his motion for acquittal regarding his conviction under the JSSA. We hold that the district court did not plainly err in finding that Dean\u2019s conduct fell within the ambit of the JSSA and met its general intent <em>mens rea </em>standard, nor in rejecting Dean\u2019s constitutional claims. Based on a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Dean\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-5\">.
