She challenges the condition of her supervised release requiring her to participate in a mental health program.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">At Luna-Muniz\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district court stated that she would be subject to the \u201c[sjtandard terms and conditions of supervision, along with drug treatment, mental health counseling, parenting program, nighttime restriction of 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.\u201d The written judgment, however, orders her to \u201cparticipate in a mental health program as deemed necessary and approved by the probation officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">In <em>United States v. Lopez-Muxtay, </em>344 Fed.Appx. 964, 965-66 (5th Cir.2009) (unpublished), we vacated and remanded a sentence in which the written judgment contained language identical to the language used in Luna-Muniz\u2019s case and in which the district court\u2019s oral judgment was similar to Luna-Muniz\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>We remanded that case for clarification because \u201c[tjhe district court\u2019s written judgment is unclear regarding whether the district court intended to grant Lopez\u2019s probation officer the authority not only to implement the condition but to determine whether Lopez should or should not undergo mental health treatment on supervised release.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Bigelow, </em>462 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2006) (holding that when the sentence imposed orally by the district court conflicts with the written judgment, the oral pronouncement controls). We now vacate the judgment in Luna-Muniz\u2019s case and remand the case for resentencing so that the district court may clarify the condition of supervised release at issue. We express no opinion on the proper resolution of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b567-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
