Crespo\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), acknowledging the existence of an appeal waiver in Crespo\u2019s written plea agreement, but nevertheless arguing that Crespo\u2019s sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-22\">Upon careful review, we conclude that enforcement of the appeal waiver is warranted because Crespo\u2019s appeal falls within the scope of the waiver, Crespo knowingly and voluntarily entered into both the plea agreement and the appeal waiver, and enforcement of the waiver would not result in a miscarriage of justice given that Crespo received a sentence well below the correctly calculated Guidelines range and his mitigating circumstances are not extraordinary. <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-92 (8th Cir.) (en banc) (holding that enforcement of an appeal waiver in a plea agreement is appropriate where the appeal falls within the scope of the waiver, defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered into both the plea agreement and the waiver, and enforcement of the waiver would not result in a miscarriage of justice), cert <em>denied, </em>540 U.S. 997, 124 S.Ct. 501, 157 L.Ed.2d 398 (2003); <em>see also United States v. Estrada-Bahena, </em>201 F.3d 1070, 1071 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (dismissing appeal in an <em>Anders </em>case based on an enforceable appeal waiver).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-23\">Furthermore, we have reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and we have found no non-frivolous issue beyond the scope of the appeal waiver. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-20\">. The Honorable Ann D. Montgomery, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
