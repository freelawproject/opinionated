He now appeals his within-guidelines sentence of 37 months. Martinez contends that his sentence was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and was therefore unreasonable. Specifically, Martinez argues that the guidelines range was too severe because United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 was not empirically based and gave excessive weight to his criminal history and to prior convictions more than 15 years old. He also argues that the guidelines range failed to account for his age and the decrease in recidivism that accompanies aging. He contends that the presumption of reasonableness applicable to within-guidelines sentences should not be applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>\u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). Because Martinez did not object in the district court to the reasonableness of his sentence, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">This court has consistently rejected Martinez\u2019s \u201cempirical data\u201d argument. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). The district court considered Martinez\u2019s request for a downward variance, and it ultimately determined that a sentence at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range was appropriate based on the circumstances of the case and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Martinez\u2019s assertions regarding \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s lack of an empirical basis, the age of his last conviction, the nonviolent nature of his offense, and his age are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338. As Martinez has not demonstrated that the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range was plain error, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b529-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
