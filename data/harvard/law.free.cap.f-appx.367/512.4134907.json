The district court sentenced Samples to a life term of supervised release and concurrent terms of 120 months of imprisonment for possession of child pornography and 240 months of imprisonment for transporting and shipping child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court reviews sentences for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first examine whether the district court committed any procedural errors, \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If the district court\u2019s decision is procedurally sound, we will then \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-15\">Samples first argues that the district court erred as a matter of law in sentencing him based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 because \u00a7 2G2.2 fails, by its very structure and application, to honor the sentencing considerations of \u00a7 3553(a). Samples contends that \u00a7 2G2.2 is flawed because it was formulated based on amendments by Congress directly, without empirical study and institutional support by the Sentencing Commission, and that the guidelines ranges resulting from the application of \u00a7 2G2.2 are inflated relative to the applicable statutory minimum and maximum imprisonment terms. Samples contends that the district court was prohibited from considering \u00a7 2G2.2 in sentencing him and that the district court committed procedural error by failing to discriminate between a recidivist and a first-time offender such as Samples, in that the sentence imposed upon Samples would have been reserved for a recidivist under a properly formulated guideline. Samples concedes that this argument was rejected in <em>United States v. Meuir, </em>344 Fed.Appx. 3, 7-8 (5th Cir.2009) (unpublished). <em>See Ballard v. Burton, </em>444 F.3d 391, 401 &amp; n. 7 (5th Cir.2006). However, he seeks to preserve the argument for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-16\">Because Samples did not raise this argument in the district court, review of this issue is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). Samples has not shown that the district court committed clear or obvious error in considering \u00a7 2G2.2 in sentencing him. <em>See United States v. Salinas, </em>480 F.3d 750, 756 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number><em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.--, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Samples also contends that the district court committed procedural error by considering only the seriousness of the offense, to the exclusion of the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. The record reflects that the district court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525-26 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 616 (2008). Furthermore, deference is afforded to the district court\u2019s sentencing decision, and Samples\u2019s sentence did not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 59-60, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b541-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
