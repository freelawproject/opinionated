Borack, P.A. (the \u201cLaw Office\u201d) appeals from a final judgment awarding Harry L. Danow attorneys\u2019 fees and costs pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. <em>\u00a7\u00a7 </em>1692-1692p, following the jury verdict and final judgment entered in favor of Danow on his claim that the Law Office violated the FDCPA. The Law Office previously appealed the final judgment entered on the merits of Danow\u2019s FDCPA claim, and this Court affirmed. In this appeal, the Law Office argues that the district court erred in granting attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to Danow despite an offer of judgment the Law Office had made to Danow pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 68 (\u201cRule 68\u201d). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-23\">The proper interpretation of Rule 68 is a legal question which we review <em>de novo. Jordan v. Time, Inc., </em>111 F.3d 102, 105 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>The relevant facts are these. On September 26, 2005, Danow filed a one-count lawsuit against the Law Office and David E. Borack alleging multiple violations under the FDCPA. The defendants served Danow with a Rule 68 Offer of Judgment on November 19, 2005. <em>See </em>Exhibit A to [D.E.141], Offer of Judgment. In pertinent part, the Offer of Judgment proposed a settlement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">Claim: This Offer of Judgment is made to all claims made by the Plaintiff against the Defendants in that certain litigation filed in the District Court styled above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">Relevant Condition: The Plaintiff shall dismiss this lawsuit, with prejudice, in its entirety and execute a confidential release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">Total Amount Offered: The total amount of this Offer of Judgment is THREE THOUSAND ($3,000.00) DOLLARS, to be paid to the Plaintiff, HARRY L. DANOW, by or on behalf of the Defendants, DAVID E. BO-RACK and THE LAW OFFICE OF DAVID E. BORACK, P.A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">Attorneys Fees and Costs: Inclusive in the total amount offered herein is an offer of ONE-THOUSAND, SEVEN HUNDRED ($1,700.00) DOLLARS for attorneys fees and THREE HUNDRED ($300.00) DOLLARS as costs, to be paid to the Plaintiff, HARRY L. DANOW, by or on behalf of the Defendants, DAVID E. BORACK and THE LAW OFFICE OF DAVID E. BORACK, P.A.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-10\"><em>Id. </em>In other words, the defendants offered Danow $1,000 in damages and $2,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, in exchange for settlement of the lawsuit and a confidential release. Danow rejected the defendants\u2019 Offer of Judgement. After a trial, the jury entered a verdict in favor of Danow and against the Law Office for the sum of $1,000 in statutory damages under the FDCPA. Both sides subsequently moved for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and the district court denied the Law Office\u2019s motion and awarded Danow attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $62,895.00, and costs in the amount of $715.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">On appeal, the Law Office argues that based on its Offer of Judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 68, Danow is not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states in pertinent part, \u201c[i]f the judgment that the offeree finally obtains is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer, the <em>offeree </em>must pay the costs incurred after the offer was made.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 68(d) (emphasis added). Applying this Rule, the Law Office argues that because it made a Rule 68 Offer of Judgment of $1,000 in damages to Danow, exclusive of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and because Danow was ultimately awarded $1,000 in statutory damages \u2014 the same amount the Law Office had previously offered \u2014 Danow is not entitled to any attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and instead, is obligated to pay the Law Office\u2019s post-offer attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-13\">We are unpersuaded. It is true that the Law Office offered Danow the exact same amount in monetary damages that he ultimately recovered following trial. In these situations, the plain language of Rule 68, as well as that of the Supreme Court, dictates that a plaintiff typically is barred from seeking attorneys\u2019 fees and costs from the defendant. <em>See Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. August, </em>450 U.S. 346, 356,101 S.Ct. 1146, 67 L.Ed.2d 287 (1981) (\u201cIf a plaintiff chooses to reject a reasonable offer, then it is fair that he not be allowed to shift the cost of continuing the litigation to the defendant in the event that his gamble produces an award that is less than or <em>equal to </em>the amount offered.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>However, in this case, the Law Office\u2019s Offer of Judgment also contained a condition \u2014 that Danow sign a confidential release. While it is difficult to assess the value of this condition, it presumably was worth <em>something </em>to the Law Office, signifying that Danow\u2019s ultimate recovery, which did not contain this condition, was \u201cmore favorable\u201d to Danow than that provided in the Offer of Judgment. Indeed, Congress enacted the FDCPA \u201cto eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors, to insure that those debts collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent State action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692(e); <em>see also </em>S. Rep. No. 95-382, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1977 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 1695, 1696 (The FDCPA\u2019s \u201cpurpose is to protect consumers from a host of unfair, harassing, and deceptive debt collection practices without imposing unnecessary restrictions on ethical debt collectors.\u201d). As a result, this is exactly the kind of consumer protection case where there is added value to public exposure to a defendant\u2019s violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">As Wright, Miller and Marcus have opined, \u201c[t]he comparison between Rule 68 offers and judgments is intrinsically more difficult where one or both involves non-monetary relief [but wjhere, for example, the Rule 68 offer included every element of the eventual judgment, a comparison between the offer and the ultimate disposition of these elements should not prove unduly difficult.\u201d Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. \u00a7 3006.1 (citations omitted). Wright, Miller and Marcus have further suggested that \u201cit would be best to view the defendant as having the burden of demonstrating that the offer was superior.\u201d <em>Id; accord King v. Rivas, </em>555 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir.2009) (\u201c[I]t is the defendant\u2019s burden to establish comparability.\u201d); <em>Reiter v. MTA N.Y. City Transit Autk, </em>457 F.3d 224, 231 (2d Cir.2006). Here, the Law Office has failed to show how Danow\u2019s ultimate recovery \u2014 which did not require him to sign a confidential release \u2014 was \u201cnot more favorable than\u201d the Offer of Judgment \u2014 which required Danow to sign a confidential release. As a result, Rule 68(d) does not bar Danow\u2019s recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in this case, and Danow is not obligated to pay the Law Office\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Because the district court did not err in applying Rule 68, and the Law Office does not otherwise challenge the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
