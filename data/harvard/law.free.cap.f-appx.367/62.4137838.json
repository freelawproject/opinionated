California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and moved to withdraw from further representation of the appellant. Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the denial of Goodman\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-19\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
