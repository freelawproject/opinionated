On appeal, the government responds that the district court did not err in dismissing the motion for lack of jurisdiction because Walker\u2019s motion was an unauthorized successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">We review questions concerning jurisdiction <em>de novo. Williams v. Chatman, </em>510 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2007). A federal prisoner may file a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion \u201cupon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). To file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, the movant must first file an application with the appropriate court of appeals for ah order authorizing the district court to consider it. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). \u201cWithout authorization, the district court lacks jurisdiction to consider a second or successive petition.\u201d <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-15\">To determine whether a prisoner\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion is a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, we examine the content of the filing and the relief sought. <em>See United States v. Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1175 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that a <em>pro se </em>prisoner\u2019s writ of <em>audita querela </em>was actually a \u00a7 2255 motion). Despite what a prisoner may entitle his motion, a motion that collaterally attacks a prisoner\u2019s sentence as being unconstitutional is a motion to vacate under \u00a7 2255. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-16\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, a movant must obtain a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal a final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). In <em>Hubbard v. Campbell, </em>379 F.3d 1245 (11th Cir.2004), we held that if the district court\u2019s order is not a final order within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, a COA is not required. <em>Id. </em>at 1247. In <em>Hubbard, </em>a petitioner filed an \u201camended petition\u201d to amend his original habeas petition. <em>Id. </em>at 1246. The district court construed the amended petition as a successive petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>and dismissed it for failure to obtain authorization from us. <em>Id. </em>The petitioner appealed to us for a COA so that he could appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his amended petition, but did not seek leave to file his amended petition as a successive petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). <em>Id. </em>at 1247. We held that the district court\u2019s dismissal of the amended petition was not a final order under the meaning of \u00a7 2253 because the decision was a final order dismissing the amended petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that we had jurisdiction to review the order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Having jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s dismissal of Walker\u2019s motion for default judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm because, although the district court did not construe Walker\u2019s motion as an unauthorized successive motion to vacate and Walker did not seek to treat his motion as such, the district court lacked jurisdiction because Walker\u2019s motion was an unauthorized collateral attack on his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
