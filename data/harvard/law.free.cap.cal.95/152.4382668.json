A temporary order was made, so restraining the sheriff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>pending the hearing and determination of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">It appears now that the decree of foreclosure included a deficiency judgment, and that the undertaking on appeal in this case does not provide for the payment of such deficiency. It was substantially decided in the case of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>King, </em>91 Cal. 307, that in such a case the appellant, whosoever he may be, if he desires a stay of proceedings, must give an undertaking for the deficiency. And that case is not in conflict with either <em>Home Loan Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>64 Cal. 379, or <em>Englund </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>25 Cal. 327, cited by appellant. In the former case an opinion seems to have been first rendered in Department, but a hearing in Bank was ordered, and in the opinion of the court in Bank the point involved here was not determined; while <em>Englund </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>25 Cal. 327, is strictly in accord with <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>King, </em>91 Cal. 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">It is true that in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>King, </em>91 Cal. 307, the appellant was in possession, although he was not the mortgagor, and there was no deficiency judgment against him; but it was held that the provision applies to all appellants. Section 945 of the Code of Civil Procedure is entirely clear upon the subject. It provides that a judgment of foreclosure shall not be stayed unless there be an undertaking \u201c on the part of <em>the appellant,\u201d </em>to the effect, among other things, that \u201c when the judgment is for the sale of mortgaged premises <em>and </em>the payment of a deficiency arising upon the sale, the undertaking must also provide for the payment of such deficiency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The temporary restraining order is discharged, and the application is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
