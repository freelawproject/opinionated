(Pen, Code, sec. 211; <em>Polaek </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>82 Cal. 20; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>6 Car. &amp; P. 521.) The court erred in instructing the jury that if they believed from the evidence that any witness had sworn falsely to any fact in the case they would be at liberty to disregard his testimony. <em>(Pierce </em>v. <em>State, </em>53 Ga. 365, 368; <em>Moresi </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>15 Nev. 231; <em>McLean </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>47 Ga. 24; <em>Fishel </em>V. <em>Lockard, </em>52 Ga. 632; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sprague, </em>53 Cal. 494.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b687-5\"><em>Attorney-General W.H.H. Hart, Deputy Attorney-General Charles H. Jackson, </em>and <em>District Attorney James McLachlan, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b687-6\">The information is in the language of the statute, and is sufficient. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harrold, </em>84 Cal. 570; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rozelle, </em>78 Cal. 84.) It is sufficient if the offense is substantially charged in the language of the code. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mahlman, </em>82 Cal. 585; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rozelle, </em>78 Cal. 84; Pen. Code, secs. 49, 59, 1258, 1404; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tonielli, </em>81 Cal. 279; <em>People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>64 Cal. 53.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b687-7\">Garoutte, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aud\">Appellant was convicted of the crime of robbery, and now asks this court for a reversal of the judgment and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">It is insisted that the information does not state facts sufficient to constitute the crime of robbery, in this, it is charged that the defendant did \u201c steal, take, and carry away from the person of one Tom She Bin,\u201d etc. Robbery is defined to be the \u201cfelonious taking of personal property in the <em>possession of another </em>from his person or immediate presence.\u201d The information alleges that the property was taken by force from the person of Tom She Bin, and against his will, and was his personal property. These facts fairly show a possession of the property in the prosecuting witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">In framing an information, the statute should be carefully followed, and such would have been the better practice in this instance; but we think the present defect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>more technical than substantial, more apparent than real. This court said in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rozelle, </em>78 Cal. 84: \u201c Under the provisions of the Penal Code, the particularity of averment necessary at common law is not required. It is only necessary that the substantial facts constituting the crime shall be alleged with sufficient certainty to enable the court to pronounce a proper judgment, and the party to defend against the charge.....Any defect of form not tending to the prejudice of a substantial right of the defendant must be disregarded</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The evidence is amply sufficient to support the verdict. The definition of robbery given by the court in its charge to the jury was too favorable to the appellant, and he has no cause for complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">It is insisted that the following instruction is erroneous: \u201c If you believe that any witness has sworn falsely as to any fact in this case, then you are at liberty to entirely disregard the testimony of such witness.\u201d The instruction is substantially in the language of the code, and has been approved in many cases. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Treadwell, </em>69 Cal. 226.) Even if appellant\u2019s contention be true, that the false evidence must be as to material matters, then the instruction still comes within such rule, for it refers to <em>\u201cany fact </em>\u201d in the case. The assignments of error based upon the evidence of impeachment of the defendant, and also upon the matter of <em>alibi, </em>are not well taken; neither can we say from the record that the motion for a new trial was improperly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">There appears to be no merit in the appeal. Let the judgment and order be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">Paterson, J., and Harrison, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
