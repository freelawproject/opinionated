Trigg, former District Magistrate Judge of the 10th Judicial District, sitting in Johnson County. The matter was investigated by Panel B of the Kansas Commission on Judicial Qualifications (Commission), following which that panel docketed a notice of formal proceedings and formal complaint on July 10, 2017, against respondent and gave due notice. See Supreme Court Rule 611(b) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 475) (discussing procedure for filing of formal proceedings). The complaint alleged respondent committed various violations of Canons 1 and 2 of the Kansas Code of Judicial Conduct (the Code), as will be discussed below. See Supreme Court Rule 601B (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 425) (containing the Code). Respondent did not file an answer to the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The matter was heard on October 6, 2017, by Panel A of the Commission. Respondent received and acknowledged receipt of proper notice and notified the Panel by email the day before that she would not attend the hearing. At the hearing the Commission's examiner presented evidence and argument in support of the formal complaint. Upon conclusion of the hearing, Panel A made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law, together with its recommended disposition to this court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"FINDINGS OF FACT\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"1.
