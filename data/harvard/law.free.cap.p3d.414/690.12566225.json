Under our criminal code, theft is a unified offense and a defendant's eligibility for a jury trial must therefore be analyzed within that context. Because at least one of the varieties of theft has a common-law antecedent, we hold that a defendant charged\n   with misdemeanor theft has the right to have his or her guilt determined by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 The State charged Deliana Kroll with theft, a class one misdemeanor, alleging she failed to pay the fare for a shuttle ride she took in Lake Havasu City. She was also charged with disorderly conduct for cursing and other offensive conduct directed toward the driver. The State filed a motion requesting a bench trial, asserting in part that Arizona's \"misdemeanor theft statute has never had a common law antecedent and shares no substantially similar elements to common law larceny.\" Kroll disagreed, pointing to case law recognizing larceny as the antecedent of shoplifting, and suggesting the jury eligibility question must be determined by recognizing theft as a single offense that may be committed in a number of ways. The Lake Havasu City Municipal Court denied the State's motion, concluding that \"[h]istorically [,] theft charges have been [j]ury [t]rial eligible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 The State filed a petition for special action in superior court challenging the municipal court's ruling. The superior court accepted jurisdiction but denied relief, reasoning in part that although the State had raised \"credible arguments regarding why the specific theft in this case does not fit the common law definition of larceny ... the bottom line ... is that the State of Arizona has always allowed for jury trials for theft.... Misdemeanor theft requires a jury trial.\" The State then filed a notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 Although neither party questions this court's jurisdiction relating to the State's challenge of the superior court's ruling, we have an independent duty to determine our jurisdiction to consider an appeal.\n   <em>\n    Sorensen v.

The State asserts that appellate jurisdiction exists pursuant to Arizona Rule of Procedure for Special Actions 8(a). This procedural rule alone, however, does not provide a statutory basis for jurisdiction, and it is unclear whether we have appellate jurisdiction over a superior court order denying special action relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

R.P. Spec. Act. 8(a). The State appears to have no \"equally plain, speedy, or adequate remedy by appeal,\" and the issue raised is one of first impression with statewide importance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanchez v.

The court concluded that the right to a jury trial is guaranteed \"for any defendant charged with an offense for which a jury trial was granted prior to statehood.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1357291\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/209/416/#p419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court also noted the longstanding principle that \"when the right to jury trial for an offense existed prior to statehood, it cannot be denied for modern statutory offenses of the same 'character or grade.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 10 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bowden v.

Before statehood, larceny was defined under Arizona's territorial statutes, in part, as \"the felonious stealing, taking, carrying, leading, or driving away the personal property of another,\" Rev. Stat. Ariz. Territory, Penal Code \u00a7 441 (1901), and the same definition was adopted in our first criminal code, Rev. Stat. Ariz., Penal Code \u00a7 481 (1913).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our supreme court stated that the 1913 statutory language was consistent with the common law, describing the essential components of larceny as \"the taking of the thing which is the subject of the crime from the possession of the owner into the possession of the thief; and ... an asportation thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    Pass v.

Code \u00a7 43-5501(1)-(5) (1939) (\"Any law which refers to or mentions larceny, embezzlement, or stealing, shall be interpreted as if the word 'theft' was substituted therefor.\"). Arizona's current theft statute, titled \"Theft; classification; definitions,\" provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A. A person commits theft if, without lawful authority, the person knowingly:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1.

Instead, the State argues common-law larceny is not an antecedent to theft\n   <em>\n    of services\n   </em>\n   because the two offenses lack substantially similar elements. Specifically, it contends services cannot be taken and carried away, and \"asportation\" is a necessary element of larceny. Kroll counters that because theft is a unified offense, she has the right to a jury trial because larceny and theft are \"of the same character.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 10 Arizona law is well established that \"theft as defined in A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1802 is\n   a single unified offense,\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

First, when charging a defendant with theft, the State is not required to specify a subsection of A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1802 within the charging document.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The essence of the charge is that she allegedly obtained transportation services without paying for them. Regardless of the actual theory the State decides to pursue at trial, if she is found guilty, the conviction will be for committing the unified crime of theft in violation of A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1802, or \"stealing,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tramble\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1513963\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/144/48/#p52\">\n    144 Ariz. at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1513963\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/144/48/#p52\">\n    695 P.2d at 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , not theft of services. Whether a person unlawfully acquires tangible property, such as a bicycle, or intangible property, such as a shuttle ride, the character of the crime is the same-stealing property (tangible or intangible) that the person does not have a right to acquire, control, or convert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1801(A)(12), (14) (defining \"property\" as \"any thing of value,\n   <em>\n    tangible or intangible\n   </em>\n   , including trade secrets,\" and \"services\" including\n   \"labor, professional services, transportation, cable television, computer or communication services, gas or electricity services, accommodation in hotels, restaurants or leased premises or elsewhere, admission to exhibitions and use of vehicles or other movable property\") (emphasis added).

Nor does the State argue that theft, as a single crime, cannot be jury-eligible. At oral argument in\n   the superior court, the State acknowledged that \"some\" of the subsections of A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1802 could have substantially similar elements to a common-law crime. Likewise, amicus City of Peoria argues that theft of any\n   <em>\n    service\n   </em>\n   is not jury-eligible but acknowledges that theft of\n   <em>\n    property\n   </em>\n   such as water or electricity would be jury-eligible under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1802(A)(2). Notwithstanding the positions urged by the State and the amicus that theft of services has no common-law antecedent, over more than a century, no Arizona appellate court has held that a person charged with any variety of larceny or theft, in all degrees, is ineligible for a jury trial. And the only authority we have found indicates to the contrary\n   <em>\n    . See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
