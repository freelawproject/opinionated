Hansen appeared at oral argument.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   BEVAN, Justice\n   This is an appeal from the district court's grant of summary judgment against Dea Haight (\"Haight\") and the dismissal of her complaint for damages and declaratory and injunctive relief. Haight alleged that the Idaho Department of Transportation (\"ITD\") was negligent in placing and maintaining construction barrels on Interstate 90 (\"I-90\") in Shoshone County, Idaho. In addition to her negligence claim, Haight alleged portions of Idaho's motorcycle and driver's manuals published by the State misrepresent the law and prescribe standards which present a danger to motorists. The district court concluded that Haight failed to present sufficient evidence to support her negligence claim and that she lacked standing to bring a declaratory judgment action against ITD. Haight now alleges the trial court erred. We affirm the trial court's dismissal of Haight's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   At about 10:00 a.m. on July 11, 2014, Haight and her husband were travelling east on I-90 through Kellogg and Osburn, Idaho. In her complaint, Haight stated that the south lane of the east bound portion of the roadway was closed off by orange construction barrels. The barrels were placed on the broken line separating the south lane and the north lane of travel for the eastbound traffic. At Mile Post 53, Haight alleges that one of the barrels was completely within the lane of travel in the north passing lane for eastbound traffic-the only lane open for eastbound traffic at the time. Haight claims the barrel caught both arms on the awning of her fifth wheel camper trailer, ripping one arm completely away from the body of the camper and partially tearing away the other arm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Haight filed a complaint on August 20, 2015, alleging ITD \"negligently, carelessly and contrary to law placed and maintained construction materials obstructing the public's lane of travel on I-90 in Shoshone County.\" Consequently, Haight asserted ITD's failure to maintain I-90 was negligence, negligence per se, and a breach of ITD's legal duty of care to the public. As a direct and proximate result of ITD's malfeasance or misfeasance, Haight claims damages in the amount of $2,000. Additionally, as a result of the damage, Haight contends the camper is unusable, and the value of the loss is $300 per week starting on July 11, 2014 and continues to accrue until the damage is repaired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Haight's second cause of action is for declaratory relief seeking an injunction restraining ITD from publishing any information which is contrary to law. Haight alleges that portions of the Idaho motorcycle and driver's manuals published by the State misrepresent the law as it pertains to the operation of motor vehicles. Haight seeks a writ mandating ITD correct all licensing manuals and other materials related to qualifications for a vehicle operator's license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 20, 2016, the district court issued its scheduling order, notice of trial setting, and initial pretrial order. The scheduling order states that motions for summary judgment \"shall be timely filed as to be heard not later than ninety-one (91) days (thirteen weeks) before trial.\" ITD served its first set of interrogatories and requests for production on Haight on April 28, 2016. On October 12, 2016, ITD deposed Haight. That same day Haight served her first set of interrogatories and requests for production on ITD, more than a year after filing her claim. ITD filed separate summary judgment motions on Haight's two claims on October 20, 2016, and the motions were noticed for hearing on November 22, 2016 in compliance with the\n   Scheduling Order. ITD responded to Haight's discovery request on November 10, 2016. On November 14, 2016, Haight filed an untimely motion pursuant to Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) (formerly 56(f) (2015)) stating that she was unable to satisfy the district court's order to file affidavits opposing ITD's summary judgment motions and asked for more time to complete discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the summary judgment hearing, the district court heard arguments regarding Haight's untimely motion, but ultimately denied the motion. ITD then presented arguments on the merits of the summary judgment motions, but Haight's counsel declined to argue Haight's negligence claim. On December 20, 2016, the district court issued its Memorandum Decision and Order on ITD's motions for summary judgment, granting both motions. A final judgment was entered on December 30, 2016 and filed with the clerk on January 3, 2017. On February 10, 2017, Haight timely filed her notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The district court did not err when it denied Haight's Rule 56(d) (formerly 56(f)) motion to allow discovery before disposition of the summary judgment motion.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Haight argues that there were circumstances justifying the untimeliness of her request to defer summary judgment under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) because a series of events affected her counsel's ability to devote time to her case. Haight further contends that she was unable to provide affidavits in opposition to ITD's motion because she did not receive ITD's response to her discovery requests until it was too late for her to respond. Without necessary discovery, Haight maintains there was no way to know who was responsible for placement of the barrels, when they were placed there, why they were placed there, what purpose they\n   were intended to serve, what alternative safety or control devices should have been used, who was employed at the job site, what activities they were or were not undertaking, and who knew or should have known that one or more barrels had been in the lane of travel. Therefore, Haight argues additional time for discovery was necessary under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d). Conversely, the State argues the district court properly exercised its discretion in denying the Rule 56(d) motion because (1) the motion was not timely filed, (2) Haight failed to meet her burden to specify what additional discovery would reveal and how it would preclude summary judgment, and (3) Haight failed to diligently pursue discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The district court properly denied Haight's request to defer summary judgment under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) because Haight's request was untimely.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Haight argues the district court abused its discretion under a reasonable view of the facts. Specifically, Haight asserts that her motion under Rule 56(d) should have been granted because a series of unforeseeable events affected her counsel's ability to timely develop her case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d), a motion for an extension of time to file additional affidavits, depositions, and interrogatories in opposition to a motion for summary judgment lies within the discretion of the district court.\n   <em>\n    Carnell v.

The district court need not expressly state that it had discretion to deny the motion if it articulates the reasons for denying the motion and those reasons show that the court knew it had discretion to grant or deny the motion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186497\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/159/628/#p633\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186497\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/159/628/#p633\">\n    at 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186497\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/159/628/#p633\">\n    364 P.3d at 1198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When reviewing the district court's discretionary decision, this Court determines whether the court (1) correctly perceived the issue as one of discretion; (2) acted within the boundaries of such discretion and consistently with applicable legal standards; and (3) reached its decision by an exercise of reason.\n   <em>\n    Rockefeller v. Grabow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9226930\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/139/538/#p545\">\n    139 Idaho 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 545,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9226930\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/139/538/#p545\">\n    82 P.3d 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 457 (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court properly exercised its discretion when it denied Haight's request for additional time to conduct discovery under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d). Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 56(b)(2) provides that any opposing documents must be served at least 14 days before the hearing. Likewise, Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 7(b)(3)(A) provides that motions, affidavits, memoranda, or briefs supporting the motion must be filed and served at least 14 days prior to the hearing. In this case, Haight's motion under Rule 56(d) was due on November 8, 2016, but was served on the State via fax on November 10. Furthermore, the court docket shows it was not filed until November 14. Haight's counsel acknowledged the motion was untimely, and he offered reasons for its untimeliness, particularly lack of resources, doctor's appointments, car trouble, home repairs, computer problems, and other technical difficulties. The district court considered counsel's reasons for requesting an extension of time to complete discovery, and although sympathetic to counsel's issues, ultimately denied the motion. The district court recognized its discretion, acted within the boundaries of that discretion and through an exercise of reason. Thus, the court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Haight's Rule 56(d) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The district court properly denied Haight's request to defer summary judgment under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) because Haight failed to meet her burden justifying an extension.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Haight argues that ITD did not respond to her discovery requests in time to allow her to respond at the hearing.

This Court has held that if a motion under Rule 56(d) fails to provide what relevant information a party needs or fails to provide a \"reasonable basis to believe additional discovery will produce new or relevant information not previously disclosed\" the motion may be denied.\n    <em>\n     Taylor\n    </em>\n    , 151 Idaho at 571,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079631\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/151/552/#p572\">\n     261 P.3d at 848\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotations omitted). Therefore, without stating, even cursorily, what further discovery would reveal that is essential to justify her request to defer summary judgment, Haight failed to meet her burden under Rule 56(d). Consequently, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The district court properly denied Haight's request to defer summary judgment under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) because Haight failed to diligently pursue discovery.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    In addition to Haight's argument that ITD did not respond to her discovery requests in time to allow her to provide a proper response at the summary judgment hearing, Haight's counsel contends he exercised due diligence in performing discovery, but that he lacked staff support, resources, and experienced personal issues that prevented him from pursuing discovery sooner.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The district court properly denied Haight's request to defer summary judgment because she did not conduct discovery to substantiate the facts alleged in her complaint for approximately 14 months. The court docket indicates that this action was filed on August 20, 2015. Haight did not serve ITD with her first set of interrogatories until October 12, 2016. Pursuant to Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 33(b)(2), ITD timely answered Haight's written discovery requests on November 10, 2016. Not only did ITD timely respond, but Haight's counsel admitted at the summary judgment hearing on November 22, 2016 that he did not read them. When the district court ruled on Haight's motion under Rule 56(d), it noted that the motion was untimely and that the motion failed to specify what information would be needed from discovery. However, more important to the district court's decision was Haight's failure to engage in discovery for over a year after the case was filed.

Thus, the district court recognized to grant or deny Haight's Rule 56(d) motion was within its discretion, it articulated its reasons for denying the motion, and it exercised reason in making its decision. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Haight's motion under Rule 56(d) because discovery was not pursued timely or to the extent it should have been.

ITD, on the other hand, argues that it had no actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition on the roadway.

ITD argues that Idaho Code section 67-5278 only provides a mechanism for a person injured or threatened to be injured by a rule to bring a claim. The statute alone, ITD claims, does not automatically provide standing or a justiciable interest. Moreover, ITD asserts that Haight has failed to show an injury caused by ITD's manuals.

This is because Haight's claims are not well grounded in fact, nor are they warranted by existing law. First, Haight's appeal contains little in the way of legal argument or authority. Haight's counsel, by failing to add any new analysis or authority to the issues raised below, simply asks this Court to second-guess the district court's discretionary decision on Rule 56(d) and the court's ruling on summary judgment, which Haight's counsel chose not to oppose during oral argument below. Second, Haight's counsel was less than diligent in the trial court, and then did not bother to appear at oral argument before this Court. Haight's attorney unnecessarily and needlessly increased the costs of the litigation and wasted judicial resources. For all of these reasons, an award of costs and attorney fees is appropriate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    <strong>\n     VI. CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    We affirm the district court's order granting summary judgment in favor of ITD. Additionally, pursuant to Idaho Appellate Rule 11.2, we award sanctions against Haight's counsel, G. W. Haight, for costs and attorney fees incurred by ITD on appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Chief Justice BURDICK, Justices JONES, HORTON and BRODY concur.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-75\">\n     <em>\n      Compare\n     </em>\n     I.R.C.P. 56(f) (2015): \"Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party's opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.\"\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
