He argues that his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel was violated because his trial counsel failed to request an instruction regarding a lesser included offense of criminal trespass. Because a decision not to request such instruction was objectively reasonable in this case, we conclude that Defendant has failed to show that the assistance he received from counsel was constitutionally ineffective. We therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 One morning, Defendant got out of a parked SUV and approached a homeowner (Homeowner) as she walked up to her house. He asked if Homeowner remembered him, introduced himself as Travis, and said he had dated Homeowner's daughter in high school. Defendant inquired after Homeowner's daughter, before asking for a ride to a gas station because he had run out of gas. Homeowner agreed to give him a lift, but stepped inside her house first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 While this conversation was taking place, Homeowner's brother (Brother) had begun unloading supplies from his truck for some remodeling work he was doing inside the house. Homeowner told Brother that she was taking Defendant to the gas station. As she left the house, she picked up a bag of trash from the kitchen trashcan and took it outside to the garbage bin, leaving the empty trashcan in the kitchen. Defendant retrieved a portable gas can from his SUV, and he and Homeowner left for the gas station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Later, after Brother finished unloading his supplies, he drove to the same gas station for breakfast. When Brother arrived, Defendant came to Brother's truck, opened the door, and asked for a ride back to the house where his SUV was parked. Brother drove Defendant to the house and dropped him off. Brother then drove back to the gas station for breakfast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 While driving, Brother remembered that he had left the front door to the house unlocked and became worried. After picking up breakfast, he quickly returned to the house, arriving five to ten minutes after he had dropped off Defendant there. The SUV was still there, now with the motor running, but Defendant was not in it. Brother went up to the house and found the front door locked. He then spotted Defendant in the back yard\n   of the house, walking toward a neighboring property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Brother confronted Defendant by saying to him, \"You've been in the house.\" Defendant responded, \"I wasn't in the house. You never saw me in the house. You can't prove I was in the house.\" Brother said he was going to call the police, and Defendant retreated to his SUV. Defendant drove away in reverse-perhaps to conceal his license plate, which was affixed only to the rear of the SUV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Brother called the police and was able to provide a partial license plate number to them. While he waited for officers to arrive, he checked the back door of the house and found it unlocked. Brother also noticed the kitchen trashcan sitting on the back porch and inspected it. When Homeowner had left the house, the trashcan was empty and in the kitchen. But now it was on the back porch and contained a bag of chocolate covered pretzels, a pack of frozen fish sticks, two pork chops, and an iPad with its charger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Homeowner returned to the house and confirmed that these items had been inside the house when she left. She remembered that the pretzels had been on the kitchen counter, the fish sticks and pork chops had been in the freezer, and the iPad and its charger had been on her dresser. She also noticed that her iPod, which had been next to the iPad, was missing. The iPod was not found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Homeowner called her daughter and asked if the daughter had dated anyone named Travis in high school. Her daughter said she had dated a Travis Hull, and Homeowner reported that name to the police. This information led to Defendant's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 The State charged Defendant with burglary as a second-degree felony and theft as a class B misdemeanor. Burglary is a third-degree felony \"unless it was committed in a dwelling, in which event it is a second degree felony.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-6-202\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-6-202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (LexisNexis 2012). The State's theory was therefore that Defendant had entered the house to steal the items. Defendant's trial counsel argued to the jury that Defendant had never entered the house, noting that no one had seen Defendant enter or exit the house and that no forensic evidence of his presence had been found inside the house. Trial counsel also noted the short time period between Defendant being dropped off at the house and being confronted by Brother and suggested that it was more likely that someone else had entered the house to steal the items while Brother and Defendant were at, or en route to or from, the gas station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 The jury convicted Defendant of burglary but acquitted him of theft.\n   <em>\n    But see infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23 note 4 (noting an apparent error in the minutes). Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 On appeal, Defendant contends that the jury should have been instructed as to criminal trespass as a lesser included offense of burglary.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because Defendant did not raise this contention at trial, he argues he received ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v. Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6858913\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/354/775/\">\n    2015 UT App 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 22-23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6858913\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/354/775/\">\n    354 P.3d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the resolution of unpreserved claims through the lens of ineffective assistance of counsel). Defendant argues that trial counsel's failure to request an instruction regarding criminal trespass deprived him of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. \"When a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised for the first time on appeal, there is no lower court ruling to review and we must decide whether the defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Layton City v.

Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 687,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). Because both deficient performance and resulting prejudice are requisite elements for a claim of ineffective assistance of\n   counsel, failure to prove either element necessarily defeats the claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    at 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant asserts that criminal trespass is a lesser included offense of burglary. An offense is lesser and included when \"[i]t is established by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission\" of the greater offense charged, when it is an inchoate form of the greater offense, or when it is \"specifically designated by a statute as a lesser included offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-1-402\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-1-402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) (LexisNexis 2012). Thus, a lesser included offense exists when the defendant is charged with some greater offense and conviction of that greater offense necessarily requires finding that the defendant committed each and every element of the lesser offense\n   <em>\n    plus\n   </em>\n   at least one other element found in the greater offense.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

He notes that no forensic evidence of his presence (e.g., his fingerprints or his personal items) was found inside the house, that no one testified that he had been inside the house, and that the State conceded in its closing argument that no one had seen him inside the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b619 However, the very weaknesses Defendant identifies in the State's case reinforce the reasonableness of a decision to pursue an \"all or nothing\" defense. While none of the witnesses testified that they had seen Defendant inside the house, Brother did testify that Defendant had been in the back yard of the house and Homeowner confirmed that items she had left inside the house were found in the trashcan on the back porch of the house. As a result, trial counsel could reasonably have anticipated that (1) the absence of direct or forensic evidence that Defendant had been inside the house could very well lead to an acquittal on the burglary charge while (2) Brother's testimony that Defendant had been in the back yard would likely lead to conviction on the lesser included offense of criminal trespass. In other words, trial counsel could reasonably have believed that the jury would readily convict Defendant of criminal trespass even though the case for burglary was weak.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trial counsel could therefore have reasonably decided to focus on the perceived weaknesses of the evidence underlying the burglary charge. Indeed, trial counsel's closing argument focused on the lack of proof that Defendant had been inside the house:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Based upon all the facts that I've mentioned to you, there's reasonable doubt as to the burglary because the State has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Hull entered or remained unlawfully inside the house with intent to commit theft. If either of those elements are lacking, his presence in the house or the intent to commit a theft, then the State's failed to meet its burden, and you are required by our law and our constitution, both of our state and of the United States, to find my client, Mr. Hull, not guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b620 We conclude that it was objectively reasonable for trial counsel to forgo a lesser-included-offense instruction and to instead present an \"all or nothing\" defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b621 Because not requesting a lesser-included-offense instruction was within the \"wide range of professionally competent assistance,\" we conclude that trial counsel's failure to make such a request did not amount to deficient performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

True, if the prosecution has not established beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the offense charged, and if no lesser offense instruction is offered, the jury must, as a theoretical matter, return a verdict of acquittal. But a defendant is entitled to a lesser offense instruction-in this context or any other-precisely because he should not be exposed to the substantial risk that the jury's practice will diverge from theory. Where one of the elements of the offense charged remains in doubt, but the defendant is plainly guilty of some offense, the jury is likely to resolve its doubts in favor of conviction.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    <em>\n     Keeble v.

Nevertheless, \"it is a well-settled rule that circumstantial evidence alone may be sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused and direct evidence is not required to establish guilt.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.

According to the verdict form filled out by the jury's foreperson, the jury convicted Defendant of burglary and acquitted him of theft. The eight-person jury was polled, and each juror confirmed that the verdict form accurately reflected the verdict. At the sentencing hearing, the court rejected a request for restitution for the missing iPod, noting that no theft conviction had been entered. And the State conceded, \"He was acquitted on that charge, and I don't think we can ask for [restitution].\" However, according to the minutes memorializing the sentencing hearing, Defendant was convicted of both charges, Defendant was sentenced for both charges, and the sentences for the two charges were ordered to run concurrently. The minutes further reflect that Defendant was fined $10,000 for each charge, with the bulk of the two fines suspended.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    On appeal, Defendant refers to the minutes in a footnote, stating that they are \"subject to correction pursuant to clerical error.\"\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    Utah R. Crim. P. 30(b). And the State concedes that the minutes \"appear [ ] to be a clerical error.\" Nevertheless, the error has not been corrected; during the pendency of this appeal, new probation documents containing and perpetuating the theft-conviction error have been added to the record.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Defendant does not ask this court to order any relief regarding the apparently erroneous minutes, and we therefore do not do so. We note, however, that Defendant is free to move for such relief in the district court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
