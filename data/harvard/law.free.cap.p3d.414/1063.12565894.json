The staff teaches clients \"adaptive and habilitative skills\" and assists them with daily living activities, such as eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, and ambulating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Chrysalis also provides financial support, which includes helping clients apply for Social Security benefits. Because Chrysalis is the representative payee for approximately \"90 plus percent\" of the clients it serves, the company's representative payee supervisor manages the Social Security funds upon receipt. Initially, clients' funds are deposited into a collective bank account, which the supervisor uses to pay for clients' rent, utilities, and personal needs. If there is a remaining balance, those funds are transferred to a pay card that Chrysalis's associate directors may use to pay for the clients' additional expenses, such as groceries, clothing, and entertainment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 As an associate director, Jack was \"heavily involved\" in managing finances for clients who resided in the eight to ten group homes that he oversaw. Jack's duties included, among other things, purchasing items, requesting funds, allocating expenses, and reviewing monthly statements for clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Each month, Jack would send receipts and a ledger to the area director and the supervisor. The ledger listed the items that he had purchased and allocated those items to the corresponding client. The supervisor then prepared statements to maintain a monthly accounting of each client's balance. Once finalized, the statements were returned to Jack for review. Typically, if there was an error, associate directors notified the area director who, in turn, asked the supervisor to correct the charge and adjust the client's balance. Finalized statements were then distributed to the house managers and the clients' legal guardians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 In January 2014, Jack asked an administrative assistant to send the original statements to him to fix before sending the statements to the house managers and the clients' legal guardians. Believing that \"something was off\" when Jack sent the administrative assistant \"corrected\" statements, she contacted the area director. After learning that Jack had circumvented Chrysalis's procedure for rectifying errors in statements on several prior occasions, the area director became concerned. He reviewed Jack's new statements, identified several discrepancies, and\n   subsequently notified Chrysalis's CEO. During a joint review, the area director and CEO found multiple discrepancies between the statements that the supervisor had produced and the statements that were sent to the house managers of the group homes that Jack oversaw and to the clients' legal guardians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 When confronted with the allegations, Jack eventually admitted that he had submitted altered receipts and changed statements to conceal the fact that he had used client funds for his own personal expenses. Among other things, his unlawful purchases included a trip to Las Vegas, concert tickets, multiple televisions, jewelry, and expensive shoes. Jack was charged with seven counts of exploitation of a vulnerable adult, one count of communications fraud, and one count of theft by deception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Prior to trial, Jack filed a motion to merge the communications fraud charge into the exploitation of a vulnerable adult charges under Utah Code section 76-1-402(3) and the double jeopardy clauses of the United States and Utah constitutions. The trial court denied the motion, reasoning that there were \"elements unique to each of the crimes charged.\" Specifically, exploitation of a vulnerable adult requires two elements that communications fraud does not-(1) a victim that is \"a vulnerable adult based on age and impairment\" and (2) a \"defendant who is in a position of trust or similar relationship.\" The trial court also found that Jack's charged conduct did not \"constitute a single criminal episode.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 After a bench trial, the trial court found Jack guilty of one count of communications fraud and seven counts of exploitation of a vulnerable adult. Jack again moved to merge his communications fraud conviction into his exploitation of a vulnerable adult convictions, arguing that \"communications fraud was the modus operandi by which each exploitation offense was perpetrated.\" At the sentencing hearing, the trial court denied Jack's motion, noting that it was \"critical\" that although there were fourteen victims, \"the State chose to charge only seven on the exploitation, but all 14 were covered in the communications fraud.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 Jack now appeals the trial court's denial of the motion to merge his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 The only issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in denying the motion to merge Jack's convictions for communications fraud and exploitation of a vulnerable adult. \"Merger is a question of law, which we review for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Statutory Merger\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 Jack contends that, under the Utah merger statute, his conviction for communications fraud must merge with his convictions for exploitation of a vulnerable adult because \"both offenses are triggered by the same facts and established by the same proof at trial.\" In response, the State contends that the statutes' \"unique elements\" preclude the conclusion that either statute is a lesser included offense of the other.

Accordingly, we begin our analysis by comparing the statutory elements of communications fraud and exploitation of a vulnerable adult.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b619 To convict Jack of felony communications fraud, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Jack\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [1] devised any scheme or artifice to defraud another or to obtain from another money, property, or anything of value [2] by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, promises, or material omissions, and ...

Instead, Jack contends that communications fraud is a lesser included offense of exploitation of a vulnerable adult. Even assuming that a more serious offense can merge into a lesser offense,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the crimes in the present case do not merge because communications fraud contains at least two distinct statutory elements beyond what is required for exploitation of a vulnerable adult. Unlike exploitation of a vulnerable adult, communications fraud requires a scheme or artifice to defraud and a direct or indirect communication with any person for the purpose of executing or concealing the scheme or artifice. Thus, because exploitation of a vulnerable adult can be committed without necessarily having committed communications fraud, the two crimes do not stand in a relationship of greater and lesser offenses and therefore do not merge under Utah Code section 76-1-402(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Jack's convictions for exploitation of a vulnerable adult were supported by evidence that he made various unauthorized purchases for himself. On the other hand, his conviction for communications fraud was supported by evidence that Jack had altered numerous receipts and statements. Because Jack could have made the unauthorized purchases-thereby satisfying the elements of exploitation of a vulnerable adult-without concealing the unauthorized purchases through communications fraud, the conduct required to commit the two crimes was distinct. Creating false receipts and statements was not inherent in the crime of exploitation of a vulnerable adult. The false communications had independent significance in that those communications made it easier for him to continue exploiting the vulnerable adults without detection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8991644\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/128/1179/\">\n    2006 UT 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 34,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8991644\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/128/1179/\">\n    128 P.3d 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reasoning that aggravated kidnapping carried significance independent of aggravated assault where dragging the victim into an alley substantially lessened the risk of detection).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b627 Even if we accept Jack's argument that the concealment was inherent in exploitation of a vulnerable adult, the communications fraud conviction remains supported by independent evidence. Jack was charged with and convicted of exploiting only seven of the fourteen vulnerable adults. However, the State included all fourteen vulnerable adults in the one count of communications fraud. At trial, the State presented separate evidence relating to the additional seven victims that independently supported Jack's conviction for communications fraud. Because there was some significant factual independence between communications fraud and exploitation of a vulnerable adult, the trial court did not err in denying Jack's motion to merge offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b628 We conclude that communications fraud is not a lesser included offense of exploitation of a vulnerable adult under statutory merger because both offenses contain unique statutory elements. Additionally, the common law merger doctrine does not apply in this case because Jack's conduct in concealing the crime of exploitation of a vulnerable adult by forging receipts and altering statements independently supported the communications fraud conviction. Furthermore, the communications fraud conviction encompassed conduct toward seven additional victims that separately support the communications fraud charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b629 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Jack was also convicted of one count of theft by deception, a class B misdemeanor,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-6-405\">\n     Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-6-405\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (LexisNexis 2012), which is unchallenged on appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    On appeal from a bench trial, we view and recite the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's findings; we present additional evidence only as necessary to understand the issues on appeal.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     State v.
