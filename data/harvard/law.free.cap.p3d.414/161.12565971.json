In 2014, Flubacher filed a petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40, arguing that his sentence was illegal because a judge, not a jury, found a relevant fact used to enhance his sentence in violation of\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v. New Jersey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    530 U.S. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000).

Nevertheless, it was not until after the decision in\n   <em>\n    Cunningham\n   </em>\n   that a majority of the court determined that our scheme was invalid.\n   <em>\n    State v.

As set forth below,\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   plainly stated that a sentencing scheme was invalid when it allowed a judge, rather than a jury, to determine facts that\n   resulted in extended sentences. In concluding that\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   invalidated our sentencing scheme, we note that the State has now conceded that the scheme was unlawful based on\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   , and that accordingly, Flubacher is entitled to relief. While that concession is not binding on us, we conclude, for the reasons set forth below, that it is well founded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thus, we conclude that Flubacher's extended term sentences were imposed in an illegal manner. Accordingly, we vacate the ICA's Judgment on Appeal, and remand this case to circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Flubacher was charged with: Unauthorized Control of Propelled Vehicle (Count I), Driving Without License (Count II), and Theft in the Fourth Degree (Count III) in Cr. No. 01-1-2788; Robbery in the First Degree (Count I), Assault in the First Degree (Count II), Assault in the First Degree (Count III), Assault in the Second Degree (Count IV), and Unauthorized Control of Propelled Vehicle (Count V) in Cr. No. 01-1-2789; and Robbery in the First Degree in Cr. Nos. 02-1-0089, 02-1-0090, and 02-1-0125. Flubacher pled guilty to all counts in each case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State filed a motion for extended term of imprisonment pursuant to Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7\u00a7 706-661\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 706-662(4)(a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as follows: (1) in Cr.

Nos. 02-1-0089, 02-1-0090, and 02-1-0125, from twenty year terms of imprisonment to life with the possibility of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The circuit court\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   granted the State's motion, and sentenced Flubacher to pay restitution, and to serve the following terms of imprisonment concurrently, with credit for time served: (1) in Cr. No. 01-1-2788, as to Count I, ten years' incarceration with a mandatory minimum of one year and eight months; as to Counts II and III, thirty days' incarceration; (2) in Cr. No. 01-1-2789, as to Count I, life incarceration with the possibility of parole, with a mandatory minimum of six years and eight months; as to Counts IV and V, ten years' incarceration with a mandatory minimum of one year and eight months; as to Counts II and III, twenty years' incarceration with a mandatory minimum of three years and four months; (3) in Cr.

The State countered that Flubacher's arguments were waived because he did not raise them on direct appeal, and that\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cunningham\n   </em>\n   may not be retroactively applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Flubacher amended his Petition, alleging three additional grounds for relief, including that the sentencing judge: (1) considered \"false facts,\" i.e., that Flubacher had hit one of his victims in the face with a hammer; (2) demonstrated bias against Flubacher because of Flubacher's prior history with the court; and (3) took judicial notice of his presentence report and other documents in determining his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The circuit court denied Flubacher's Petition, stating in pertinent part in its Conclusions of Law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1.

Pursuant to the guilty pleas, on July 9, 2003, Respondent/Respondent-Appellee State of Hawai'i (the State) filed a motion for extended term of imprisonment because it believed Flubacher to be a \"multiple offender\" within the meaning of Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 706-662(4)(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At Flubacher's sentencing hearing on September 12, 2003, the circuit court granted the State's motion, finding that an extended sentence was necessary to protect the public. Flubacher did not directly appeal his convictions or sentence at that time, and therefore his extended sentence became final on October 13, 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Flubacher now seeks to collaterally challenge his extended term sentence through a Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 petition for post-conviction relief. The Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court) denied his petition, and the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) affirmed the denial. In Flubacher's application for writ of certiorari, he raises two issues. First, Flubacher argues that his extended term sentence was illegal under the United States Supreme Court's (Supreme Court) decisions in\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v. New Jersey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    530 U.S. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), and\n   <em>\n    Ring v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254507\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/584/\">\n    536 U.S. 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254507\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/584/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254507\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/584/\">\n    153 L.Ed.2d 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). He further argues that the Supreme Court's later decision in\n   <em>\n    Cunningham v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553669\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/270/\">\n    549 U.S. 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553669\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/270/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553669\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/270/\">\n    166 L.Ed.2d 856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007), should retroactively\n   apply to his sentence. Second, Flubacher contends that he did not waive his claim that the circuit court erred when it found that he had \"bashed\" a woman with a hammer at sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Majority holds that Flubacher's sentence was illegal under the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   and remands his case to the circuit court for further proceedings. Majority at 142 Hawai'i at 111, 414 P.3d at 163. In doing so, the Majority overrules countless decisions of this court holding the opposite-that at the time that Flubacher's sentence became final, our extended sentence scheme was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   illegal under\n   <em>\n    Apprend\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   . Majority at 142 Hawai'i at 118 n.14, 414 P.3d at 170 n.14. Because I believe that the rule in\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   only became clear after Flubacher's sentence became final, and because the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in imposing Flubacher's sentence, his extended term sentence was not illegal and he has no claim for post-conviction relief. I would therefore affirm the ICA's October 13, 2016 Judgment on Appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

While it is true that the petitioner's sentence would simply be vacated and remanded for another sentencing hearing in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, the re-opening of these cases would, in my opinion, \"seriously undermin[e] the principle of finality which is essential to the operation of our criminal justice system.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032050\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/288/#p301\">\n    489 U.S. at 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032050\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/288/#p301\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mackey v.

Flubacher does not dispute that he pleaded guilty to multiple felonies. As previously discussed, at the time that Flubacher was sentenced, HRS \u00a7 706-662(4)(a) allowed judges to find the facts \"extrinsic\" to the offenses charged in imposing extended sentences, including whether a defendant committed multiple felonies.\n   <em>\n    Kaua\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258486\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/102/1/\">\n    102 Hawai'i at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258486\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/102/1/\">\n    72 P.3d at 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   I acknowledge that if Flubacher received an extended term sentence based on facts found by a judge today, his sentence would be unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maugaotega II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12260620\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/115/432/\">\n    115 Hawai'i at 446-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 168 P.3d at 576-77.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, in 2003, it was not clear that the imposition of an extended sentence on a criminal defendant based upon a judge's finding of a fact \"extrinsic\" to the offense was unconstitutional. To the contrary, this court repeatedly upheld the intrinsic/extrinsic distinction our courts drew in interpreting our extended sentence scheme.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kaua\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258486\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/102/1/\">\n    102 Hawai'i at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258486\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/102/1/\">\n    72 P.3d at 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In my view, the Majority too easily overlooks subsequent Supreme Court decisions clarifying\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   and too quickly abandons our case law upholding the constitutionality of our extended sentence scheme. In moving the line of demarcation separating legal and illegal extended term sentences forward seven years, the Majority also re-opens cases that should be left final.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Instead, the line of demarcation should be drawn at a date in which the\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   rule was clear and fully explicated. I agree with several federal courts of appeal that the date should be placed after the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, I would only hold as unconstitutional any extended term sentence imposed after January 12, 2005 where a judge, and not a jury, found a fact needed to impose that sentence. Here, because Flubacher's sentence was imposed in accordance with our statutory scheme and became final before the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   , his sentence cannot be unconstitutional, and he is not entitled to post-conviction relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   For these reasons, I would affirm the ICA's October 13, 2016 Judgment on Appeal.
