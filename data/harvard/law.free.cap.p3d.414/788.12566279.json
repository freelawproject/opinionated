Four months into the school year, the school district superintendent recommended that the Board prematurely terminate Raap's contract. The Board set a meeting for December 22, 2015, to consider the matter. Raap had previously filed an administrative complaint\n   with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in November 2015 alleging that the school district had unlawfully discriminated against her in the administration of her employment. Upon EEOC referral of the complaint to the Montana Human Rights Bureau (HRB), HRB issued a written notice on December 11, 2015, advising the Board of the\n   complaint and resulting commencement of an HRB investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 On December 22, 2015, Raap and her union president appeared before the Board for hearing on the school district superintendent's recommendation to terminate her employment. In addition to Board members, the only persons present were Raap, her union representative, the superintendent, Raap's supervising school principal, and the Board's lawyer via telephone. No one else appeared or otherwise sought admittance to the meeting at any time. At the outset, the Board chair informed Raap that the meeting would be closed to the public unless she waived her right to privacy. Raap then waived her right to privacy. Despite Raap's waiver, the Board's meeting minutes reflect that the chair closed the meeting to the public \"to protect the rights of individual privacy of statements and information for those not in attendance.\" Raap expressed her intent to electronically record the meeting but the Board chair precluded her from doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 After four hours of testimony, the Board chair re-opened the meeting to the public at which time another trustee made a motion, seconded by yet another, for the Board to terminate Raap's employment. Without discussion or deliberation on the motion, and at the request of another trustee, the chair again closed the meeting to allow the Board to privately discuss unspecified litigation strategy at an \"executive session\" with the Board's lawyer. The Board excluded all from the executive session except for Board members, the school superintendent, and the Board's lawyer. After an 11-minute executive session, the Board allowed Raap and her union representative back into the room. Without deliberation or discussion on the termination motion, the Board promptly voted to terminate Raap's contract. In a subsequent District Court affidavit, the Board's lawyer asserted that the Board did not discuss or deliberate whether to terminate Raap's contract in the executive session, to wit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The litigation strategy executive session was very short and focused solely on litigation strategy related to defense of the EEOC/HRB claim and my explanation of the claim and the process that would be followed. The bulk of the 11 minutes was\n   taken up with my explanations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The affidavit provided no explanation or indication of the Board's need to exclude Raap and her union representative from a discussion purportedly focused solely on an explanation of the substance of her previously received complaint and \"the process that would follow.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 Following the termination of her employment and an unsuccessful union grievance, Raap filed a complaint in the Montana Fifteenth Judicial District Court alleging that the Board terminated her contract in violation of \u00a7 2-3-203, MCA, and Article II, Section 9, of the Montana Constitution. Raap requested that the District Court vacate the Board's decision to terminate her employment and to award her attorney fees and costs incurred in prosecuting the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 Upon the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, and without legal citation or analysis, the District Court summarily granted the Board summary judgment pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56 on the stated grounds that: (1) an asserted violation of the \u00a7 2-3-203, MCA (open meeting law), was the sole legal basis of Raap's claim; (2) the Board allowed Raap to observe and participate in the portion of the meeting pertinent to its the decision to terminate her contract; (3) the Board did not actually exclude anyone from the portion of the meeting pertaining to the termination of Raap's employment; and (4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   the Board properly excluded Raap from the portion of the meeting pertinent to \"another litigation\" matter.

As referenced in Article II, Section 9, the term \"deliberations of ... public bodies or agencies\" includes a \"meeting,\" as defined by \u00a7 2-3-202, MCA. Upon timely petition, a district court may void \"[a]ny decision made in violation\" of \u00a7 2-3-203, MCA. Section 2-3-213, MCA. The sole purpose of public bodies and agencies is \"to aid in the conduct of the peoples' business.\" Section 2-3-201, MCA. Courts must liberally construe Article II, Section 9, and \u00a7 2-3-201, MCA, to the end that all deliberations of public bodies and agencies remain open to the public except as otherwise clearly provided under recognized exceptions to the constitutional right to know and \u00a7 2-3-203, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 9 In analyzing a claimed right to observe deliberations under Article II, Section 9, the pertinent issues are: (1) whether the subject entity is a public body or agency of state government or a state government subdivision; (2) whether the proceeding or decision at issue was a deliberation of that body or agency; and (3) whether the disputed deliberation was nonetheless privileged from disclosure on the grounds of individual privacy or other recognized exception to the right to know.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mont.

In this case, it is undisputed that the Board is a public body or agency of a political subdivision of the State of Montana. It is further undisputed that the subject proceedings of the Board\n   constituted a \"meeting,\" as defined by \u00a7 2-3-202, MCA, and thus a deliberation of a public body or agency as referenced in Article II, Section 9. The dispositive issue is whether the Board lawfully closed the disputed portions of the meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 10\n   <em>\n    Issue 1: Did the District Court erroneously grant summary judgment that the Board lawfully closed its meeting based on unspecified third-party privacy rights?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 11 \"The presiding officer of [a] meeting may close the meeting during the\n   time the discussion relates to a matter of individual privacy ... if and only\" upon \"determin[ing] that the demands of individual privacy clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure.\" Section 2-3-203(3), MCA. Under the express privacy exception to Article II, Section 9, and \u00a7 2-3-203(3), MCA, the threshold question is whether disclosure of the disputed portion of the deliberation or meeting would infringe on an individual's right to privacy under the Montana Constitution, Article II, Section 10. A right to privacy exists under Article II, Section 10, when (1) an individual has an actual or subjective expectation in non-disclosure of the disputed matter and (2) that subjective expectation is objectively reasonable in society under the totality of the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The burden of overcoming the presumption of openness is squarely on the public body or agency, not the public or persons seeking to observe government deliberations.\n   <em>\n    T.L.S.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 28. At the time of closure, the burden is on the public body or\n   agency to articulate a rationale for closure that is sufficiently descriptive to afford reasonable notice to the public of the legal and factual basis for closure without disclosing private information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    T.L.S.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 28 ; \u00a7\u00a7 2-3-203(3) and -212, MCA (burden of overcoming presumption of openness, required \"determination,\" and required meeting minutes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 15 Though the initial burden at the time of closure does not necessarily require the type of formal legal analysis and balancing required of reviewing courts, the law requires something more than cursory reference to undescribed third-party privacy rights and mere recitation of applicable constitutional or statutory language. Moreover, on subsequent district court review, the public body or agency has the greater burden of overcoming the presumption of openness by making a particularized showing of the asserted factual basis for a meeting closure under the legal ground asserted for closure. Thus, on a motion for summary judgment, once the complaining party satisfies its threshold burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact that a public body or agency closed a meeting subject to Article II, Section 9, and \u00a7 2-3-203, MCA, the burden shifts to the public body or agency to show the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that the public body or agency is entitled to judgment as a matter of law that it lawfully closed the meeting under a recognized exception to the right to know and open meeting requirements. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 16 For example, in\n   <em>\n    Moe\n   </em>\n   , a local government chief-executive sought to terminate the employment of a city-county human resource officer upon the advice and consent of the governing council, as authorized under the consolidated city-county government charter.\n   <em>\n    Moe\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 4-6. The chief-executive was acting on the basis of an internal investigation report that referenced various allegations and substantiating witness statements of misconduct and deficient performance made by numerous other city-county employees.\n   <em>\n    Moe\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 4-8. Upon notice that the termination hearing before the council would be closed based on the nature of the allegations against her, the human resource officer waived her right to privacy and requested an open hearing.\n   <em>\n    Moe\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8. However, without identifying the third parties or affording them an opportunity to waive their rights, the presiding officer nonetheless closed the meeting to the public by reference to (1) unidentified city-county employees who had made allegations or witness statements adverse to the subject employee and (2) the officer's determination that the privacy interests of those third parties clearly outweighed the merits of public disclosure.\n   <em>\n    Moe\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9. After a detailed closed-session\n   discussion of the adverse investigation report as a ground for termination of the human resource officer's employment, the presiding officer re-opened the meeting to the public at which time the council voted in open session to approve the recommended termination.\n   <em>\n    Moe\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 17 On appeal of a subsequent district court grant of summary judgment to the local government, the discharged employee asserted that the closed meeting violated Article II, Section 9, and \u00a7 2-3-203, MCA, based on the city-county's failure to: (1) specifically identify the third-party complainants and witnesses; (2) further explain how or on what basis their privacy rights outweighed the merits of public disclosure; and (3) provide notice and opportunity for the third parties to waive their rights.\n   <em>\n    Moe\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16. We affirmed the meeting closure on the grounds that the third-party employees had subjective and reasonable expectations of privacy under the circumstances and that those expectations clearly outweighed the merits of public disclosure, as offset by the public interest in encouraging public employees to\n   report misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Moe\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 21-25.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Contrary to the Board's assertion here, we did not sweepingly hold that the expectations of third-party complainants and witnesses in non-disclosure of their identities or the substance of their statements will clearly outweigh the merits of public exposure in every case and circumstance.\n   <em>\n    Moe\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 21-25. We merely recognized in Moe that such expectations of privacy may be both actual and objectively reasonable under the circumstances at issue.\n   <em>\n    Moe\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 21-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 18 In Moe, unlike here, the presiding government officer publicly\n   stated a rationale at the time of closure that was sufficiently descriptive to afford reasonable notice to the public of the factual and legal basis for the closure without disclosing any private information. As initially stated and subsequently shown on district court review, closure of the meeting in\n   <em>\n    Moe\n   </em>\n   was actually necessary to protect the third-party privacy interests asserted. At the time of closure, without specifically identifying the third parties at issue, the presiding officer in\n   <em>\n    Moe\n   </em>\n   at least generally described their relationship to and their general involvement in the matter,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , city-county employees who had made allegations and adverse statements against the subject employee.\n   <em>\n    Moe\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9. On subsequent judicial review, the local government proved that it had sufficient factual grounds to overcome the presumption of openness by making a particularized evidentiary showing that both substantiated the asserted third-party privacy interests and showed that closure of the meeting was reasonable and necessary to protect those interests in balance with the merits of public disclosure.\n   <em>\n    Moe\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 12, 20-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 19 In contrast here, the Board's stated rationale at the time of closing the meeting to the public was no more than cursory reference to \"statements and information for those not in attendance.\" More significantly, the Board subsequently failed to support its originally stated rationale on district court review. In the District Court, the Board presented no more than the affidavit of counsel stating that the school principal \"presented information supporting the Superintendent's recommendation to terminate\" Raap and that the Board questioned the principal about her testimony. The Board made no showing that any third party testified at the hearing, that the superintendent's recommendation for termination was based in whole or in part on third-party complaints or allegations against Raap, that the superintendent or school principal gave testimony that identified any third party who made complaints or allegations against Raap or otherwise referenced a matter in which a third party had an expectation of privacy. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Moe\n   </em>\n   , the Board failed to make any\n   <em>\n    particularized showing\n   </em>\n   as to the nature of the third-party privacy interests asserted, much less how they balanced out against public disclosure under the circumstances of this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Moe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   the Board\n   failed to overcome the presumption of openness under Article II, Section 9, and \u00a7 2-3-203, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 20 A related matter warrants mention before moving on. The analyses of the Board and the District Court appears to rely, in part, on the express or implied assertion that no open meeting violation occurred because Raap and her union representative were present and there is no evidence that the Board actually prevented any other interested person from observing the hearing portion of the meeting. Tantamount to a standing argument, reliance on this assertion is misplaced. Raap, like the public-at-large, had the right to expect that the Board would comply with Article II, Section 9, and \u00a7 2-3-203, MCA, regardless of whether anyone else was interested in observing the meeting.\n   <em>\n    Schoof v. Nesbit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4042698\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/373/226/\">\n    2014 MT 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 17-18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4042698\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/373/226/\">\n    373 Mont. 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4042698\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/373/226/\">\n    316 P.3d 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On this basis alone, Raap had a \"sufficiently concrete injury\" for standing to assert her alleged violations of Article II, Section 9, and \u00a7 2-3-203, MCA.\n   <em>\n    Schoof\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 23-25. Raap also had a more personal interest in an open meeting-she wanted to electronically record the meeting and the Board precluded her from doing so. At the time, \u00a7 2-3-211, MCA (2015), expressly prohibited a public body or agency from prohibiting \"accredited press representatives\" from photographing or recording open meetings except to the extent the activity \"interfere[s] with the conduct of the meeting.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Though the statute obviously emphasized the right of the \"accredited press\" to photograph and record open meetings, Article II, Section 9, affords the press no greater right to observe, record, or report on open meetings than any member of the public. Accord 38 Mont. A.G. Op. 8 (1979). Thus, in addition to her general standing, Raap also had a specific personal basis upon which to assert her open meeting claims in this case. We hold that the District Court erroneously granted summary judgment that the Board lawfully closed the hearing portion of the meeting based on third-party\n   privacy rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 21\n   <em>\n    Issue 2: Did the District Court erroneously grant summary judgment that the Board lawfully excluded Raap and her union representative from its \"executive session\" under the litigation strategy exception of \u00a7 2-3-203(4), MCA ?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 22 A public body or agency may close a meeting \"to discuss a strategy to be followed with respect to litigation when an open meeting would have a detrimental effect on the litigating position of the public agency.\" Section 2-3-203(4)(a), MCA. Though we have not considered whether this statutory exception comports with Article II, Section 9, when a public body or agency is engaged in litigation with a private party, see\n   <em>\n    Associated Press v.

We therefore confine our review to whether the District Court correctly concluded that the Board complied with \u00a7 2-3-203(4)(a), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 23 Raap asserts that the Board failed to overcome the presumption of openness under Article II, Section 9, and \u00a7 2-3-203, MCA, by showing compliance with \u00a7 2-3-203(4)(a), MCA. Without addressing Raap's threshold challenge to the threshold evidentiary competency of the affidavit of the Board's counsel, there is no genuine issue of material fact on the summary judgment record that the Board discussed anything in its 11-minute executive session other than as described in the affidavit of its counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 24 Nonetheless, other than labeling the executive session as a \"litigation strategy session,\" the Board made no showing on district court review explaining or indicating how its pending decision on whether\n   to terminate Raap's employment at least generally related to its strategy for defending against a previously filed discrimination complaint regarding school district conduct alleged to have occurred prior to the termination hearing. The Board made no showing that it requested or received advice of counsel regarding its ongoing or contemplated defense against the discrimination complaint, the potential effect of terminating Raap's employment on its defense strategy in that matter, or the potential for its termination decision to result in additional litigation with Raap. The Board made no showing that Board members communicated facts to counsel pertinent to the Board's defense strategy in any pending or future litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 25 The summary judgment record is wholly devoid of any factual showing as to how or why concealment of counsel's self-described, non-\n   descript explanation of the substance of Raap's previously filed discrimination complaint, and the process that would follow, was necessary to avoid \"a detrimental effect on the [Board's] litigating position\" in that or any other pending or contemplated litigation. The Board may well have had cause for closing its executive session under \u00a7 2-3-203(4)(a), MCA, but failed to show the reasons for closure on district court review. Therefore, we conclude the Board failed to satisfy its burden of overcoming the presumption of openness under Article II, Section 9, and \u00a7 2-3-203, MCA, by demonstrating that it conducted its 11-minuted executive session in compliance with \u00a7 2-3-203(4)(a), MCA.

We hold further that the District Court erroneously granted summary judgment that the Board lawfully excluded Raap and her union representative from its \"executive session\" under the litigation strategy exception of \u00a7 2-3-203(4), MCA. Raap raised no issue on appeal under \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA (discretionary attorney fees on successful enforcement action under Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 9 ), and we make no comment thereon.
