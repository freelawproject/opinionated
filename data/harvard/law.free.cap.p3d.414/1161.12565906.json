Pursuant to a plea agreement, Appellant entered unconditional \"no contest\" pleas to two counts of sexual abuse of a minor in the first degree.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-2-314\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6-2-314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(ii). The district court imposed concurrent sentences of 14 to 20 years. Appellant filed this appeal to challenge the district court's August 2, 2017, \"Judgment Upon Plea of No Contest\" and its October 26, 2017, \"Sentence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   [\u00b62] On January 23, 2018, Appellant's court-appointed appellate counsel e-filed a \"Motion to Withdraw as Counsel,\" pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Anders v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/#p744\">\n    386 U.S. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 744,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/#p744\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1400,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/#p744\">\n    18 L.Ed.2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967). The next day, this Court entered an \"Order Granting Motion for Extension of Time to File\n   <em>\n    Pro Se\n   </em>\n   Brief.\" This Court ordered that, on or before March 19, 2018, Appellant \"may file with this Court a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief specifying the issues he would like this Court to consider in this appeal.\" This Court also provided notice that, after the time for filing a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief expired, this Court would \"make its ruling on counsel's motion to withdraw and, if appropriate, make a final decision on this appeal.\" This Court notes that Appellant did not file a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief or other pleading in the time allotted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   [\u00b63] Now, following a careful review of the record and the \"\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief\" submitted by appellate counsel, this Court finds that appellate counsel's motion to withdraw should be granted and the district court's judgment and sentence should be affirmed, subject to the following correction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   [\u00b64] This Court finds the district court should correct a discrepancy between the orally pronounced sentence and the written sentence. At sentencing, the district court stated that it \"will impose a $200 assessment as to each of the Crime Victim Compensation Funds....\" (Sentencing Transcript, p. 24) Despite that, the written sentence requires appellant to pay $250 per count \"for the Crime Victim's Compensation Fund Surcharge.\" \"A long-recognized rule of this Court is that where there is conflict between the sentence as articulated at sentencing, and the written sentence, the oral sentence prevails.\"\n   <em>\n    Pinker v.

This Court finds the district court should correct the written sentence to conform to the oral pronouncement.
