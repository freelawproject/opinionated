(mother) appeals the trial court's judgment terminating her parent-child legal relationship with D.B. (the child). We decide\n   whether an expert must expressly opine as to whether the child is likely to suffer serious emotional or physical damage in the parent's care to satisfy a required ICWA statutory finding. Because we conclude that expert testimony does not need to recite the specific statutory language, we affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. The Dependency and Neglect Case\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 In July 2015, the Department of Human Services of the City and County of Denver (Department) initiated a dependency and neglect proceeding and assumed temporary custody of the child after he tested positive for marijuana at birth. Because mother and M.B. (father) each reported that they were members of the Navajo Nation and believed the child was eligible for membership, the Department sent notice of the proceeding to the Navajo Nation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 Less than a month later, the court adjudicated the child dependent and neglected and adopted a treatment plan for mother. It also returned custody of the child to the parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 However, in early September 2015, mother left the child with an acquaintance while she went to a casino. When she returned, she had to be taken to detox and could not remember with whom she had left the child. After the Department located the child, the court again placed the child in the Department's custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Three months later, the Navajo Nation verified that the child was eligible for enrollment and began participating in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 The Department subsequently moved to terminate the parent-child legal relationship between mother and the child. Following a hearing in October 2016, the trial court found, among other things, that continued custody of the child by one of the parents would likely result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child due to the parents' extensive substance abuse, extensive domestic violence, lack of housing, and lack of income to meet the child's needs. Consequently, it terminated mother's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. Termination of Parental Rights\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 Mother contends that the trial court erred in terminating her parental rights in the absence of testimony from a qualified expert witness that continued custody of the child by mother would likely result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201912\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) (2012). We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A. Preservation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 Initially, the Department and guardian ad litem (GAL) assert that we should decline to address this issue because mother failed to raise it in the trial court. Generally in civil cases-including dependency and neglect actions-an appellate court will consider only issues that were raised in the trial court. However, ICWA provides that \"any parent ... may petition any court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate [an action for termination of rights to an Indian child] upon a showing that such action violated any provision of sections 1911, 1912, and 1913 of [ICWA].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201914\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of J.O.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8364658\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/170/840/#p841\">\n    170 P.3d 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 841 (Colo.

The caseworker explained that the child could suffer emotional and possible physical abuse if he was present during a domestic violence incident between mother and father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 25 The record further reveals that mother was homeless and had declined a one-bedroom apartment that was offered to her because she \"didn't like the location of it and would rather be on the street with her group than somewhere that she didn't want to be located.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 26 Mother interacted well with the child during visits, but she struggled to understand the child's special needs. For example, the child had a severe allergy to milk products that had caused his body to stop absorbing nutrients. Yet, mother brought food that contained milk products to visits. She also missed multiple visits and left visits early when she became upset. Consequently, the caseworker opined that mother was unable to parent the child independently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 27 Additionally, the Department presented testimony from a qualified expert witness under ICWA-a social worker with Navajo\n   Children and Family Services. The social worker did not directly opine that the child would suffer damage in mother's care. Rather, when asked to give her opinion regarding whether the child would suffer serious emotional or physical harm if returned to a parent, the social worker indicated that mother had not fulfilled the treatment requirements to address the reasons for the child being placed in the Department's custody. The social worker also testified that the recent domestic violence issues between the parents were concerning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 28 Under these circumstances, the record, as a whole, contains sufficient evidence, including the testimony of a qualified expert witness, to support the trial court's determination that the child would likely suffer serious emotional or physical damage if placed in mother's care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   III. Hearsay Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 29 Mother contends that the trial court erred in relying on inadmissible hearsay statements in the termination report to conclude that she had failed to maintain sobriety, and thus, that the child would likely suffer serious emotional or physical damage if he remained in mother's custody. We conclude that the error, if any, was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 30 To begin, the GAL argues that this issue was not preserved for review. We reject this argument for two reasons. First, mother objected to the admission of the hearsay statements in the termination report. Second, mother challenges the trial court's findings, and a party is not required to object to the trial court's findings in the trial court to preserve a challenge to those findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C.R.C.P. 52. Thus, we conclude that the issue was not forfeited by failure to object to the admission of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 31 Generally, error in a civil case is harmless if it did not affect a substantial right of a party. C.R.C.P. 61 ;\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of R.D.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6983626\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/277/889/\">\n    2012 COA 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6983626\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/277/889/\">\n    277 P.3d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . An error affects a substantial right if it substantially influenced the outcome of the case or impaired the basic fairness of the trial itself.\n   <em>\n    Bly v. Story\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6990469\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/241/529/#p535\">\n    241 P.3d 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 535 (Colo. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 32 Here, the trial court admitted the termination report over mother's objection that the report contained hearsay. In admitting the report, the court explained it would not consider the hearsay statements for the truth of the matter asserted. Rather, it would consider them for the caseworker's \"basis for making her recommendations.\" A statement that is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted is not hearsay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9100075\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/74/396/#p400\">\n    74 P.3d 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 400 (Colo. App. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 33 Indeed, mother does not challenge the trial court's admission of the report for this limited purpose. Instead, she asserts that the court erred in relying on the hearsay statements in the report to find that she had failed to maintain sobriety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 34 To be sure, the termination report includes statements regarding mother's continued substance use. It indicates that a victim advocate reported that mother and father were drunk during a domestic violence incident in August 2016. And, the trial court cited mother's failure to maintain sobriety as a reason for its determination that the child would likely suffer damage if in mother's care. Mother contends that the trial court must have relied on the truth of the statements in the report because the report was \"the only evidence\" in the case that mother did not maintain sobriety after leaving inpatient treatment in June 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 35 However, contrary to mother's contention, other evidence in the record shows that mother did not demonstrate sobriety after leaving inpatient treatment in June 2016. After leaving treatment, mother told the caseworker that she did not want to take urinalyses or participate in substance abuse treatment. The caseworker also testified, without objection, that there were still concerns about mother's substance abuse based on information that mother was intoxicated during a recent domestic violence incident. Thus, the record does not clearly demonstrate that the trial court relied on the statements in the report for the truth of the matter asserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 36 In any event, substance abuse was not the sole basis for the trial court's determination that the child would likely suffer damage in mother's care. The court also relied on, with record support, the extensive domestic violence between the parents and mother's lack of housing and income to meet the child's needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 37 As a result, we discern no reversible error in the trial court's determination that the child would likely suffer serious emotional or physical damage in mother's care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   IV. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 38 The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   JUDGE GRAHAM and JUDGE DUNN concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
