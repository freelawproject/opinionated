Nurse then compounded her mistake by not informing anyone about it, thereby depriving Adams of the opportunity to be administered medicine that would likely have reversed the effects of the overdose. Adams later died due to the physiological effects of the overdose. His heir (Plaintiff) filed suit against Provo Rehab and Nurse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 During the lawsuit, Provo Rehab conceded that Nurse was negligent in giving Adams the wrong medication, and conceded that it was vicariously liable for Nurse's initial mistake. However, Provo Rehab asserted that it was not responsible for Nurse's concealment of her mistake, and that Nurse's knowledge of her mistake could not be imputed to Provo Rehab. Based on these two contentions, Provo Rehab's main defense of the case was its claim that it was Nurse's concealment of her mistake, and not the mistake itself, that proximately caused Adams's death. During pretrial proceedings, the trial court agreed with Provo Rehab that knowledge of Nurse's mistake could not be imputed to Provo Rehab. Based partly on this ruling, the trial court approved a special verdict form that required the jury to decide whether Nurse was acting in the course and scope of her employment when she concealed her mistake, and then potentially to allocate fault as between Nurse's original mistake and her subsequent concealment of the mistake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 After a three-day trial, the jury determined that Nurse was not acting in the course and scope of her employment when she concealed her mistake, and that therefore\n   Provo Rehab was not vicariously liable for her act of concealment. The jury determined that both Nurse's initial error and her subsequent concealment were causes of Adams's death, and allocated 65% of the fault to the initial medication error and 35% of the fault to the subsequent concealment. The jury also determined that Plaintiff's total damages were $1,407,210.68. The trial court later entered judgment against Provo Rehab for 65% of that amount, plus court costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Both parties appeal from this judgment. Plaintiff argues, among other things, that knowledge of Nurse's mistake should have been imputed to Provo Rehab, and that the jury should therefore never have been asked to apportion fault between Nurse's initial mistake and any concealment. Plaintiff asks us to vacate the judgment and remand for entry of judgment for the full amount of damages as determined by the jury. Provo Rehab, for its part, argues that Plaintiff failed to introduce sufficient evidence of causation, and that the trial court should have entered a directed verdict in favor of defendants. Provo Rehab asks us to vacate the judgment and remand for entry of a no-cause judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 For the reasons discussed herein, we conclude that knowledge of Nurse's medication error should have properly been imputed to her employer, Provo Rehab. It follows from this conclusion that there was no \"concealment,\" at least not from Provo Rehab, given that Provo Rehab is deemed to have known about the error from the outset, and that therefore the jury should not have been asked to apportion fault between the medication error and any concealment. It also follows from this conclusion that Plaintiff's evidence of proximate causation-that the initial medication error set in motion an unbroken chain of events that led to Adams's death-was easily sufficient. We therefore vacate the judgment, and remand this case to the trial court for entry of judgment for the full amount of damages as determined by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 On the evening of February 8, 2010, Nurse worked a six-hour swing shift as a licensed practical nurse at Provo Rehab, a residential nursing facility in Provo, Utah. During this time period, Nurse was one of Provo Rehab's many employees, and worked occasional shifts as a nurse there. On one previous occasion, Nurse had been involved in an incident in which one narcotic pill ended up unaccounted for at the end of her shift, and Nurse was informed that if something like that ever happened again, she would be terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 By February 2010, Adams had resided at, and been under the care of, Provo Rehab for approximately eleven months. He was in his early seventies and had been suffering from a number of medical conditions, including congestive heart failure, diabetes, and obesity, and had been having a hard time at home. He and his family had hoped that, during his stay at Provo Rehab, he could \"get stronger\" and \"get his weight under control.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Upon arriving at work on February 8, 2010, Nurse consulted an assignment board and learned that she would spend the evening attending to the residents in the hallway in which Adams resided. Part of her job as a nurse was to \"pass medication\" to the residents in the hall to which she was assigned. These duties included ascertaining which medications were prescribed for which resident, gathering those medications, and administering them timely and in the manner prescribed. If the medication consisted of pills, her duties also included actually counting the pills to make sure that she administered the correct dosages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 On the evening in question, Nurse began a \"medication pass\" at about 8:00 p.m., in which she proceeded down her hallway with a movable cart containing the medications she would need to administer. In the course of this \"medication pass,\" Nurse made a crucial mistake: she mixed up Adams's identity with another resident's. When she arrived at Adams's room, she erroneously assumed that another resident, and not Adams, resided there. Based on that mistaken assumption, she prepared the other resident's medications in a \"cup of pills\" and gave them to Adams, who inquired as to whether his \"as-\n   needed\" pain medications were in the cup. Both Adams and the other resident had been prescribed pain medications to be administered on an as-needed basis, but the prescribed pain medications were not the same. Nurse told Adams that his pain medications were not in the cup, and Adams asked that he be given some. Nurse returned to her cart and retrieved the pain medications-three narcotics of varying dosages for which Adams did not have a prescription-that had been prescribed for the other resident, and added them to the cup. Adams took all of the pills in the cup.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 A few minutes later, as she was completing her \"medication pass\" through the hallway, Nurse noticed that the other resident's name appeared on the door of a different room than the one in which Adams resided. Nurse soon deduced that she had mistakenly provided the other patient's medications to Adams. She also realized that Adams was diabetic, and the other resident was not, so she returned to Adams's room to administer insulin to him. Adams was still awake and lucid at this point, as the narcotics had not yet had time to metabolize. In the course of administering to Adams his diabetes medication, she did not inform him that she had given him the wrong pain medications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 Over the course of the rest of her shift, Nurse decided to conceal her mistake. She proceeded into the other resident's room and administered to him the narcotics that had been prescribed for Adams. She also checked on Adams \"at least twice\" over the course of the rest of her shift, and nothing appeared acutely amiss. Before her shift ended, Nurse falsified the medical records so that they indicated that both Adams and the other resident had been given their proper medications. Nurse testified that, at the time, she did not think administering the incorrect medications would cause harm to either Adams or the other resident. In addition, Nurse testified that, given her past employment history including the previous lost-pill incident, she was concerned that she might be terminated if she informed anyone of her mistake. Nurse's shift ended around midnight, and she informed no one of the Medication Error before completing her shift.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 The three narcotics that Nurse mistakenly administered to Adams were morphine, hydromorphone, and oxycodone, three \"very potent\" opioids. By contrast, the only pain medications for which Adams had a prescription-and which he should have been given-were Neurontin, which is not an opioid, and Norco, a less-potent opioid similar to Lortab. Individuals who are not conditioned to taking strong opioid medications are more prone to suffer acute negative effects, including respiratory depression and cardiac arrest. Because Adams had not been prescribed these three potent opioid medications, both parties' experts agreed that he was not conditioned to them. Indeed, one expert referred to Adams as an \"opiate-na\u00efve\" individual who was more likely than others to suffer negative effects from a mistaken overdose of narcotics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b613 However, even unconditioned individuals who have taken an overdose of narcotics can be administered another medication-known generically as naloxone-which, if timely administered, will almost always reverse even severe physiological effects of a narcotics overdose. Neither side disputes the fact that Nurse's decision to conceal the Medication Error deprived Adams of an opportunity to be saved from the Medication Error through the timely administration of naloxone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b614 At approximately 5:45 a.m. the next morning, Adams was discovered \"not breathing\" and \"unresponsive.\" He had no pulse. At that point, Adams was taken to a hospital but, despite aggressive treatment, he died two days later without ever regaining consciousness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b615 Plaintiff filed suit against Provo Rehab and Nurse,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging that both Provo Rehab and Nurse owed Plaintiff a duty of care and\n   that both defendants breached that duty, causing Adams's death and Plaintiff's damages. Plaintiff also brought claims against Provo Rehab and Nurse under the wrongful death statute and the survival statute. During pretrial proceedings, Provo Rehab conceded that Nurse acted negligently by committing the Medication Error, and further conceded that it was vicariously liable for Nurse's actions in committing the Medication Error, because Nurse was clearly acting in the course and scope of her employment in administering the medications. However, Provo Rehab took the position that Nurse was not acting in the course and scope of her employment when she chose to conceal the Medication Error from Adams and from her superiors, and contended that it was therefore not vicariously liable for Nurse's Concealment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b616 Plaintiff responded to this defense by asking the trial court to determine, as a matter of law, that knowledge of Nurse's Medication Error was imputed to Provo Rehab, because Nurse committed the Medication Error during the course and scope of her employment with Provo Rehab, and therefore Provo Rehab had knowledge of the Medication Error pursuant to principles of agency law. Plaintiff argued that, if knowledge of the Medication Error was imputed to Provo Rehab at the moment it occurred, there could not have been any \"concealment,\" at least not from Provo Rehab. Had the trial court granted this motion, it would have prevented Provo Rehab from pursuing any defense based on Nurse's Concealment. Indeed, at oral argument before this court, Provo Rehab conceded that, if knowledge of the Medication Error is imputed to it, it effectively has no defense to Plaintiff's lawsuit. The trial court denied the motion, however, effectively allowing Provo Rehab's concealment defense to continue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b617 The trial court also approved the use of a special verdict form that contained seven questions. First, the jury was asked to determine whether Nurse was \"acting in the course and scope of her employment ... when she concealed her medication error.\" Next, in two questions, the jury was asked to determine, in turn, whether the Medication Error and the Concealment were \"a cause\" of Adams's death. After that, the jury was asked, in two questions, to apportion fault between the Medication Error and the Concealment. Finally, the jury was asked, in two questions, to fix an amount for Plaintiff's economic and non-economic damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b618 During trial, both parties' medical experts were in general agreement on two main points. First, both agreed that Adams died as a result of receiving the three narcotics from Nurse that were prescribed for the other resident. Second, both experts likewise agreed that had Adams timely been administered naloxone, he likely would not have died. However, Plaintiff's expert had not been asked to consider, and therefore did not offer an opinion on, whether the Medication Error alone, apart from the Concealment, was the proximate cause of Adams's death. Provo Rehab's expert, on the other hand, testified that, while the Medication Error was a \"but-for\" cause of Adams's death, the proximate cause of the death was the Concealment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b619 At the close of evidence, Provo Rehab moved for a directed verdict, asserting that Plaintiff had failed to meet her burden of presenting expert testimony that the Medication Error-as opposed to the Concealment-was the proximate cause of Adams's death. The trial court denied the motion. During closing arguments, Provo Rehab's counsel again argued that Nurse's Concealment, not the Medication Error, caused Adams's death, and pointed out that both experts agreed that Adams would have lived\n   if Nurse had appropriately disclosed the Medication Error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b620 After deliberation, the jury found that Nurse was not acting in the course and scope of her employment when she concealed the Medication Error. The jury found that both the Medication Error and the Concealment were causes of Adams's death, and apportioned 65% of the fault to the Medication Error and 35% to the Concealment. The jury awarded Plaintiff $1,375,000 in loss-of-companionship damages and $32,210.68 in medical and funeral expenses, for a total of $1,407,210.68. The trial court later entered judgment against Provo Rehab for 65% of that amount, plus court costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b621 After trial, Provo Rehab moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or alternatively for a new trial, making the same lack-of-causation arguments it had made in its motion for directed verdict. The trial court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b622 Both parties appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b623 Plaintiff argues, first, that the trial court should have granted her motion to impute Nurse's knowledge to Provo Rehab, thus foreclosing Provo Rehab's defense at trial that Nurse's Concealment of the Medication Error was a cause of Adams's death.

The trial court denied the motion, ruling that because the brokerage \"represented that it did not have knowledge\" of the agent's fraudulent acts at the time it filed suit, the case was not brought in bad faith, and this court affirmed the trial court's decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10-11 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b632 The Utah Supreme Court reversed, ultimately ruling that knowledge of the agent's fraudulent actions could be imputed to the agent's principals at the brokerage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. In reaching this conclusion, the court discussed the distinctions between the concepts of vicarious liability, on the one hand, and imputation of knowledge, on the other hand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19 (referring to the two concepts as \"separate legal questions\"). The court explained that imputation of knowledge is a\n   <em>\n    broader\n   </em>\n   concept than vicarious liability, and that an agent's knowledge is imputed to its principal in many contexts, not just when vicarious liability is at issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20 (stating that \"[i]f we were to impute an agent's knowledge to his principal only when the principal is being sought to account for his agent's acts, imputation of knowledge would be a wholly superfluous legal principle because in each instance in which it might apply, the principal could simply be held\n   responsible by means of vicarious liability\" (emphasis omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b633 Provo Rehab relies heavily on one particular quotation from\n   <em>\n    Wardley\n   </em>\n   in which the court stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Under principles of imputation, a principal is held responsible for his own act\n   </em>\n   , which is deemed to have been committed with the knowledge his agent had at the time of the principal's act, assuming the agent obtained such knowledge while acting within the scope of his authority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19 (emphasis added). Provo Rehab argues that imputation of knowledge must necessarily be limited to only one context: where a litigant is attempting to hold a principal \"responsible for his own act.\" Provo Rehab asserts that there is no \"act\" that was committed by Provo Rehab for which Plaintiff is attempting to hold it liable,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and asserts that Nurse's knowledge may therefore not be imputed to it. We find these arguments unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b634\n   <em>\n    Wardley\n   </em>\n   certainly applied the concept of imputation of knowledge to a set of facts in which a plaintiff was attempting to hold a principal directly liable for its own actions (there, allegedly filing suit in bad faith). But\n   <em>\n    Wardley\n   </em>\n   came nowhere close to limiting the applicability of the concept of imputation of knowledge to that solitary factual setting. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Wardley\n   </em>\n   discussed at least one prior case-\n   <em>\n    Hodges v.

In our view, Provo Rehab's interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Wardley\n   </em>\n   is exactly backwards: rather than\n   <em>\n    limiting\n   </em>\n   the concept of imputation of knowledge, what the court in\n   <em>\n    Wardley\n   </em>\n   was doing was\n   <em>\n    extending\n   </em>\n   the concept to a factual setting-a case alleging direct liability-in which the court had apparently not previously applied it. Nothing in the\n   <em>\n    Wardley\n   </em>\n   opinion can be construed as limiting or overruling the concept's applicability in factual settings in which it had already been applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b635 And those factual settings are quite numerous.

In two of these cases, the court imputed knowledge from agent to principal in a factual setting similar to the one presented here: where a litigant was attempting to impute knowledge to the principal in order to foreclose a principal's claim or affirmative defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Macris v.

Nurse committed the Medication Error within the course and scope of her agency. Knowledge of that error was, as a matter of law, necessarily imputed to Nurse's principal, Provo Rehab, the moment it occurred. Accordingly, the trial court's decision not to impute that knowledge to Provo Rehab was error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b637 The conclusion that Provo Rehab had constructive knowledge, as a matter of law, of the Medication Error the moment it happened means, as a matter of logic, that there cannot have been any concealment of the Medication Error from Provo Rehab. This fact has several important consequences in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b638 First, Provo Rehab's efforts to defend this case on the ground that the Concealment, rather than the Medication Error, proximately caused Adams's death must fail for the simple reason that there was no concealment of the Medication Error from Provo Rehab. While the Medication Error was certainly concealed from Adams and his family, it cannot have legally been concealed from Provo Rehab, because Provo Rehab's agent (Nurse) learned of the Medication Error in the course and scope of her employment, and her knowledge was imputed to Provo Rehab. Because there was no concealment from Provo Rehab, there was no legal or factual basis for allocating fault as between the Medication Error and the Concealment. Accordingly, the trial court's instruction to the jury that it should attempt that allocation was erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b639 Second, Provo Rehab's assertion that Plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence of proximate causation is incorrect. Provo Rehab's arguments in this regard are grounded in the fact that both sides' expert medical witnesses-including Plaintiff's expert-testified that Adams would not have died if he had timely been given naloxone. As Provo Rehab puts it, Plaintiff was unable to present any competent expert testimony that the Medication Error, standing alone and apart from the Concealment, proximately caused Adams's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b640 This argument collapses, however, once it is acknowledged that there was never any \"concealment\" in a legal sense. Without any concealment, the causation question becomes much simpler: did the Medication Error proximately cause Adams's death? And the answer to this question was undoubtedly answered in the affirmative by expert medical witnesses from both sides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b641 In order to prevail on a claim of medical malpractice, Plaintiff must establish \"(1) the standard of care required of health care providers under the circumstances; (2) breach of that standard by the defendant; (3) injury proximately caused by the breach; and (4) damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Morgan v.

Both parties' experts agreed that an overdose of narcotics, such as those mistakenly administered to Adams, sets in motion a chain of events that will, if not halted by the timely administration of naloxone, very likely cause respiratory failure and death. Specifically as to this case, both parties' experts agreed that the Medication Error had precisely these effects upon Adams: that it set in motion a chain of events that shut down Adams's respiratory system and ultimately led to his death. That testimony was easily sufficient to allow the case to go to the jury on the issue of proximate causation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying Provo Rehab's various post-trial motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b645 Finally, we briefly discuss the issue of damages.

In this case, given that neither party takes issue with the damages evidence, a full remand is not necessary. We have determined that the imputation of the knowledge of Nurse's Medication Error to Provo Rehab means that there was no proper basis for the jury to be asked to allocate fault-and thus portions of the total damages award-between the Medication Error and the Concealment. Plaintiff's suggested remedy is simply for us to vacate the judgment (which was entered for approximately 65% of the full damages amount) and remand the case for the limited purpose of entry of judgment in the full, non-allocated amount of damages awarded by the jury, plus appropriate costs. On the facts of this case, we agree that this is the proper remedy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b647 Adams and his family entrusted his care to Provo Rehab.

Presumably, this choice was tactical. Indeed, the related argument that it advanced instead-that the Concealment and not the Medication Error was the true cause of Adams's death-was at least partially successful at trial. However, we note here that we perceive potential substantive deficiencies in any argument Provo Rehab might have made that the failure to administer naloxone to Adams was a superseding cause of Adams's death. The failure to administer naloxone was Provo Rehab's own failure (or the failure of its agents). A defendant \"cannot rely on its own subsequent acts of negligence to break the chain of causation between an earlier act of negligence and the injury\"; indeed, \"[o]nly the unforeseeable acts of\n    <em>\n     another\n    </em>\n    constitute an intervening proximate cause.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Steffensen v.

Here, there is no second actor; thus, Provo Rehab's and/or its agents' failure to administer naloxone cannot have been a superseding cause of Adams's death.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Plaintiff also raises several other arguments on appeal, including (1) that the trial court should have ruled that Provo Rehab ratified Nurse's actions by accepting payment for his care, and (2) that Provo Rehab failed to provide the jury with any rational basis for dividing responsibility for Adams's death between the Medication Error and the Concealment. Given our resolution of the issues discussed herein, we need not address these alternative arguments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
