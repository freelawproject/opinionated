So does \"unh-unh,\" especially when accompanied by a host of other nonverbal cues-such as pushing an assailant away, turning away from him, crying, and curling up in fetal position. When Defendant Michael Aaron Cady ignored Victim's several expressions of nonconsent, he committed object rape. He now challenges a jury's conviction of him for that crime, arguing the evidence was insufficient to support a conclusion (1) that Victim did not consent to the encounter or (2) that he was reckless with regard to her nonconsent. He also argues that because the jury returned inconsistent verdicts, his conviction must be reversed. We disagree and affirm his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Victim was friends with Defendant's wife when she stayed on the couple's couch one evening. Another friend slept, \"passed out\" on the floor nearby. Victim had not yet fallen asleep when Defendant came into the living room, knelt down beside her, and started \"rubbing her midsection over her blanket.\" Victim was turned away from Defendant, facing the back of the couch. Defendant proceeded to touch Victim under the blanket, whisper something in her ear, and kiss her shoulder and neck. Victim's response to these advances was to push his hand off of her and say \"unh-unh.\" Defendant then tried to pull Victim's pants down. Victim shook her head and held onto her pants, curling up her legs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Defendant eventually succeeded in pulling Victim's pants down and \"got behind [Victim] on the couch, where [her] legs were folded towards [her] belly,\" so Victim tried to push him away with her arm and leg. Rather than leave her alone, Defendant twisted Victim's arm behind her, slapped her arm down, and then Victim felt something rubbing against her vagina and buttocks. Defendant next inserted something \"very sharp\" into Victim's vagina, got up, and left the room. While Victim did not testify as to what this sharp object was-only that it did not feel like a penis-Defendant acknowledged in a police interview (which was presented to the jury) that \"he had put his fingers in [Victim's] vagina.\" We thus talk in terms of digital penetration throughout this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 For this incident, the State charged Defendant with object rape. A jury convicted him on that charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Separate from this crime, there were two additional sexual encounters between Defendant and Victim. The circumstances surrounding those encounters are pertinent insofar as they relate to Defendant's claim that Victim's account of the object rape was inherently improbable. One of these encounters occurred five minutes after the object rape. The other had taken place more than a year before.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 After inserting his fingers into Victim's vagina, Defendant left the room for approximately five minutes. When he came back, he had sex with Victim. Victim maintained that the sex was not consensual. She testified that she tried to pull her pants back up, was crying, and remained in fetal position. We refer to this encounter as the April incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 More than a year before the object rape, Defendant and Victim had had sex, which Victim maintained was nonconsensual. During that earlier incident, Victim also had been staying on Defendant's couch. Defendant entered the living room after his wife had gone to bed and curled up on the couch behind Victim. Victim testified that she had closed her eyes and remained quiet. Defendant pulled down Victim's pants, rubbed his penis around her vagina and buttocks, and then inserted his penis into her vagina. During penetration, Victim testified, she had started crying and reached behind her to push Defendant away, \"but it didn't work.\" After Defendant got up, saying something like \"thanks for a great night,\" he returned to the bedroom. Victim pulled her pants back up and remained on the couch crying. We refer to this encounter as the January incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Victim reported all three incidents to the police on the morning after the object rape. Based on her assertion that she had not given her consent to any of the encounters, the State charged Defendant not only with object rape but also with two counts of rape. At trial, the jury acquitted Defendant of the two rape charges. He now appeals his conviction for object rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 The focus of this appeal is consent-whether the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt Victim's lack of consent to digital penetration and Defendant's mental state as to her lack of consent. More particularly, Defendant contends that because the evidence of nonconsent was not credible and thus was insufficient to support a conviction for object rape, that conviction should be overturned. When on appeal a defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his or her conviction,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   we may reverse only when it is apparent that there is not sufficient competent evidence as to each element of the crime charged. Our review of the evidence itself is deferential. We may reverse a verdict only when the evidence, so viewed, is sufficiently inconclusive or inherently improbable such that reasonable minds must have entertained a reasonable doubt that [the] defendant committed the crime for which he or she was convicted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

He specifically argues that the\n   State \"failed to prove [Defendant] acted recklessly as to [Victim's] non-consent to digital penetration, as he did not 'consciously disregard[ ] a substantial and unjustifiable risk that' [Victim] did not consent to the digital penetration.\" (Quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-2-103\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-2-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) (LexisNexis 2012).) We thus first tackle the question whether sufficient evidence supported the jury's finding that Victim did not consent. Because we answer that question in the affirmative, we then consider whether sufficient evidence supported the jury's finding that Defendant acted recklessly with regard to that lack of consent.

Instead, we consider his to be a garden-variety claim of insufficient evidence that he unsuccessfully tries to fit into the inherent-improbability box. At base, he contends that Victim's testimony should be disregarded because there was evidence presented that arguably undercut Victim's credibility. For instance, he highlights that Victim \"came voluntarily to the apartment where she knew she would sleep on the same couch where she later claimed she had been raped\" during the January incident. He also relies on evidence that Victim \"threatened a witness to prevent the jury from hearing credible testimony\" and \"failed to indicate nonconsent at the time,\" along with \"her boyfriend's testimony that he and [Victim] had sexual intercourse during her high-risk pregnancy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   But none of this evidence goes to inherent improbability.

The jury heard the recording of a police interview with Defendant where he acknowledged that Victim initially said no to their encounter. And, as previously mentioned, \"ignoring a victim's 'no,' standing alone, may be\n   sufficient for a conviction for rape, even without the use or threat of force.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Second, even if the jury relied solely on Victim's testimony in finding that she did not consent to digital penetration, it was entitled to do so; Defendant has not shown that any inconsistencies rendered Victim's testimony such that \"reasonable minds must have entertained a reasonable doubt that [Defendant] committed the crime for which he ... was convicted.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

But he also argues, with little analysis, \"In this case, the evidence was inconsistent to prove object rape.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   And he insists \"there is insufficient evidence in light of witness testimony that is internally inconsistent.\" Yet Defendant never spells out what these supposed inconsistencies are. Instead, he establishes the general rule that internal inconsistencies might render testimony unreliable and then simply concludes, based on perceived inconsistencies in the jury's verdicts, that the rule should apply in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b627 Because Defendant has not established what aspects of Victim's testimony were internally inconsistent, we reject his challenge on this basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   II. Recklessness\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b628 Defendant also contends that because there was insufficient, inherently improbable, and internally inconsistent evidence of Victim's nonconsent, the State failed to establish that he was \"aware of but consciously disregard[ed] a substantial and unjustifiable risk that\" Victim did not consent to the digital penetration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-2-103\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-2-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) (LexisNexis 2012). Even if Defendant's argument were not premised on a conclusion we have already rejected, we would not be convinced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b629 In an interview with police-which the jury heard-Defendant acknowledged that Victim \"stopped him at first[,] saying 'unh-unh.' \" He said that her body language was \"back and forth.\" He agreed that when a woman's body language is indecisive, \"logic would be to take that as no.\" He told the police that he had \"fucked up\" and \"felt like the biggest piece of shit in the world.\" And he admitted unconditionally that his fingers had penetrated Victim's vagina. These statements, without reference to any other evidence, demonstrate that Defendant was aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that Victim did not consent to digital penetration, but then he consciously disregarded that risk by nevertheless digitally penetrating her.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-2-103\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b630 Defendant nevertheless offers explanations for his conduct. He told police that, being \"a very persuasive person\" and having \"a gift with people,\" he overcame Victim's initial hesitance; in his defense at trial, he claimed she \"never directly said no.\" He argues that he encouraged Victim to \"tell him to go away\" if she had a problem with his advances. He claims that his statements regarding messing up and feeling guilty related to cheating on his wife, not assaulting Victim. He also professes that he \"thought it was consensual.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b631 Again, the jury has the freedom to believe or not to believe evidence presented\n   to it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v. Garcia-Mejia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12343088\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/402/82/\">\n    2017 UT App 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12343088\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/402/82/\">\n    402 P.3d 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"That it chose not to believe\" Defendant's assertion that he thought his encounter with Victim was consensual \"does not mean that Defendant's conviction is unsupported by the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12343088\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/402/82/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is especially true on the question of mens rea where the jury heard from Defendant directly that he heard Victim say \"unh-unh\" and considered her body language to be \"back and forth.\" And Victim testified that when Defendant asked her if his conduct was okay, she shook her head no. There was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that Defendant was reckless regarding Victim's nonconsent, and thus we will not disturb that finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   III. Inconsistent Jury Verdicts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b632 Finally, Defendant argues that because \"the jury's verdicts are inconsistent,\" we are \"require[d] ... to reverse his object rape conviction.\" \"When considering a defendant's argument that the verdicts are inconsistent,\" we will not reverse unless \"reasonable minds could not rationally have arrived at the verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

And\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   so long as sufficient evidence supports each of the guilty verdicts, state courts generally have upheld the convictions. In other words, a claim of inconsistency alone is not sufficient to overturn the conviction; rather, there must be additional error beyond a showing of inconsistency because appellate courts have always resisted inquiring into the jury's thought processes and deliberations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6902536\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/338/253/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (cleaned up). We have already concluded that sufficient evidence supports Defendant's conviction for object rape. Thus, Defendant must demonstrate some error beyond that of inconsistent verdicts.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6902536\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/338/253/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He has not done so. Indeed, he has failed to demonstrate that the verdicts were even inconsistent. However, in part because Defendant devotes a significant amount of space in his brief arguing that the verdicts are inconsistent, we take the time to address those arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b633 In Defendant's view, we should reverse his conviction for object rape because the jury acquitted him of rape for both the January incident and the April incident; he argues that \"all three counts rested on the jury's determination of [Victim's] credibility.\" He asserts that because nonconsent was an element of each offense, \"if jurors believed her, they would convict on all counts; if they did not believe her, they would acquit on all counts.\" Implicit in this argument is a conflation of the three incidents. This is apparent in Defendant's repeated use of the term \"same incident\" when discussing the object rape and the April incident. Also implicit in this argument is the suggestion that credibility determinations must be all or nothing. We reject both of these premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b634 Defendant was charged with three crimes for three separate encounters. The State was not tasked with proving nonconsent for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   encounters but for\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   encounter. Stated another way, the State's evidence had to separately establish nonconsent for the January incident, nonconsent for the object rape, and nonconsent for the April incident. The jury may have decided that the State did not meet its burden of proving nonconsent for the January incident or for the April incident but that it met its burden of proving nonconsent as to the object rape. There is nothing inconsistent about these verdicts, because the State introduced different evidence to attempt to establish nonconsent for each of the three incidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b635 Regarding the January incident, Victim testified that she had closed her eyes and remained quiet. This is different from the evidence of Victim's \"unh-unh\" before the object rape. Also during the January incident, Victim said she started crying during penetration and reached behind her to push Defendant away, \"but it didn't work.\" This is different from the testimony that Victim, prior to the object rape, cried, attempted to hold her pants up, shook her head no, and actually pushed against Defendant. We do not mean to suggest that there is a checklist of evidence that does or does not prove nonconsent, but by contrasting the evidence of nonconsent for these two encounters, it becomes apparent that the jury could have made separate determinations on these two charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b636 Likewise, evidence of nonconsent for the April incident varied from evidence of nonconsent for the object rape. No verbal expression preceded the April incident. And while Victim testified that during both incidents she cried, tried to pull her pants back up, and remained in fetal position, the jury could have concluded that Victim's \"unh-unh\" or her pushing Defendant away during the object rape-or both-convinced them of her nonconsent beyond a reasonable doubt. Similarly, the lack of those behaviors during the April incident might have left a reasonable doubt in jurors' minds on the issue of nonconsent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b637 On the other hand, it is possible that neither the quantum nor quality of nonconsent evidence alone determined the jury's verdicts. Instead, it could have believed Victim's claim of nonconsent to the object rape while disregarding her claim of nonconsent to both the January and the April incidents. Defendant suggests that this would require \"an improbable and unreasonable conclusion that [Victim] consented to sexual intercourse but not to digital penetration.\" At first blush, such a conclusion might seem improbable or unreasonable. But upon further inspection, it becomes apparent that the jury's conclusion was neither.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b638 A jury's finding that the State did not meet its burden of proof of nonconsent is not a finding of the inverse-that there\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   consent-just as a verdict of \"not guilty\" is not a verdict of innocence. A jury is not tasked with deciding all issues absolutely. Instead, we ask only that it decide whether the State proved all elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. When its answer is no, the jury enters a verdict of not guilty. When its answer is yes, it finds a defendant guilty. In the instant case, the jury answered \"no\" on the rape charges and \"yes\" to the object rape charge. It therefore may have decided only that the State had not proven nonconsent for the rape charges beyond a reasonable doubt, nothing more. It did not find, as Defendant suggests, that Victim \"consented to sexual intercourse but not to digital penetration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b639 But even if it did, we cannot say that such a conclusion was not supported by sufficient evidence. The object rape and the April incident were separate events. Between the two, approximately five minutes passed, and Defendant got up, left the room, and then returned. It is not improbable or unreasonable, in this case, that an individual would refuse her consent to one activity and then, later, provide her consent to a different activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b640 Given the myriad ways the jury might have reasonably reached its separate verdicts, we see no inconsistencies in them.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Neff v.
