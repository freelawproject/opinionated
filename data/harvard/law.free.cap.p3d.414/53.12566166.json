Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case arises from a complaint filed by Respondent Leah Castro (Castro), who had a stillbirth while she was incarcerated. Castro brought suit against Leroy Melchor, Wanna Bhalang, Tomi Bradley (all in their official capacities), the State of Hawai'i, and the Hawai'i Department of Public Safety (HDPS) (together, \"Petitioners\") for negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Castro asserted that Petitioners' failure to provide her with timely and adequate medical care led to the stillbirth of her child, Briandalynne.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After a bench trial, the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ruled in Castro's favor, awarding her $250,000 for negligent infliction of emotional distress and $100,000 for loss of filial consortium, and awarding $250,000 to Briandalynne's estate \"for the loss of life itself and for all of the damages that [Briandalynne] would have been entitled to had she been alive, such as loss of enjoyment of life.\" The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) affirmed the circuit court's decision.\n   <em>\n    Castro v. Melchor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313473\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/179/\">\n    137 Hawai'i 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313473\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/179/\">\n    366 P.3d 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Petitioners' application presents a question of first impression to this court: whether the estate of a viable fetus can recover for loss of enjoyment of life, also known as \"hedonic,\" damages. We conclude that Briandalynne's estate could recover such damages against Petitioners, and that the record supports the amount of the damages awarded. Accordingly, we affirm the ICA's judgment on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Allegations and Circuit Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Castro filed a Complaint in her own capacity, and as personal representative of the Estate of Briandalynne, in circuit court on\n   May 6, 2008, alleging assault and battery, negligence, and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress against the State of Hawai'i, the HDPS, and two correctional officers at O'ahu Community Correctional Center (OCCC) in their official capacities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Complaint alleged that on June 30, 2007, while Castro was an inmate at OCCC, she was forced to the ground, or \"taken down,\" by correctional officers Debra Pimental and Ted Choy Foo. Castro was approximately seven months pregnant at the time. After the incident, Castro was transferred to the Women's Community Correctional Center (WCCC). Castro developed problems with vaginal bleeding, which she reported to staff at both OCCC and WCCC, but \"was not provided with timely or adequate medical care.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Castro alleged that the actions of the correctional officers and the subsequent failure of medical personnel to provide her with treatment caused the stillbirth of her eight-month-old fetus, Briandalynne. Briandalynne was delivered stillborn on August 10, 2007, at the Kapi'olani Medical Center. Available medical records indicated that Briandalynne's death was caused by \"significant fetal stress\" and \"hypoxia.\" Castro contended that the actions of correctional officers Pimental and Choy Foo constituted assault and battery upon her and her unborn fetus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Castro also contended that Pimental, Choy Foo, the State, and HDPS were negligent because they \"knew or should have known\" that Castro was pregnant, and that they \"breached their duty of reasonable care by failing to protect [Castro] and her unborn child from harm.\" Castro additionally asserted that the State and HDPS were liable for \"negligent hiring, training, supervision, and retention\" of the correctional officers who assaulted her. Furthermore, she asserted that Officers Pimental, Choy Foo, and other \"responsible medical personnel\" intentionally inflicted emotional distress on her, and that the State and HDPS negligently inflicted emotional distress on her as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Castro filed a First Amended Complaint on July 30, 2009, withdrawing her claims against the correctional officers. In addition to the State and HDPS, Castro added as defendants Leroy Melchor, Wanna Bhalang, Tomi Bradley, Amy Yasunaga, Roberta Marks, and Keith Wakabayashi, all of whom were nurses in the medical unit at OCCC, as well as Kenneth Zienkiewicz, a physician at the medical unit at OCCC. The individuals named in the First Amended Complaint were each sued in their official capacities. Castro raised claims of negligence against each of the defendants, and claims of intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress against all defendants except the State and HDPS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing, inter alia, that there is no legal authority allowing Castro to make a claim on behalf of the estate of a stillborn fetus. The defendants pointed to Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 663-3 (Supp. 1997),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[d]eath by wrongful act[,]\" to argue that \"there must be injury to a person in order for a tort claim to lie.\" Defendants argued that Briandalynne was not a person, as contemplated by the statute; therefore, Castro could not make a claim on her behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 13, 2011, the circuit court issued its order granting in part and denying in part the motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court granted the motion \"as to all claims against Defendants Yasunaga, Marks, Zienkiewicz[,] and Wakabayashi,\" as well as \"to all claims brought by Plaintiff Leah Castro as Personal Representative of the Estate of Briandalynne Castro.\" The court denied the motion with respect to all other claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   However, on October 14, 2011, the court issued an amended summary judgment order\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , reversing its previous grant of summary judgment \"with respect to all claims of Plaintiff Leah Castro as Personal Representative of the Estate of Briandalynne Castro.\" The court explained that its\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   decision was based upon its belief that its prior analysis was in error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A bench trial began on February 27, 2012. After the evidentiary portion of the trial was completed, Castro filed a memorandum regarding damages with the court. Castro explained that HRS \u00a7 663-3, the wrongful death statute, \"governs recovery by the decedent's survivors[,]\" and that HRS \u00a7 663-7,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the survival statute, \"governs recovery for wrongful death by the estate of a decedent.\" Castro asserted that because \"[t]he amount of recovery for the loss of life for the Estate of Briandalynne Castro is 'determined from the standpoint of the deceased,' \" according to\n   <em>\n    Rohlfing v. Moses Akiona, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1455343\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/45/373/#p381\">\n    45 Haw. 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 381-83,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=369%20P.2d%2096\">\n    369 P.2d 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 101 (1961), \"the value of the life and the loss of enjoyment of life of Briandalynne Castro are of the nature and kind as of any other child born in our community[,]\" regardless of Castro's status as an incarcerated inmate. Castro stated that the Estate of Briandalynne Castro's damages claims include all the damages that Briandalynne would have been entitled to had she been alive, such as loss of enjoyment of life and pain and suffering, before death occurred. With respect to Castro's claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress, Castro asserted that there was \"ample evidence that a normally constituted reasonable person would be unable to adequately cope with the mental stress engendered by Defendants' egregious conduct\" and the resulting stillbirth. Castro further added that the fact that she may not have been able to raise or provide for her daughter while in prison \"is irrelevant with respect to [Castro's] mental and emotional pain\" caused by the stillbirth. Castro requested that the court award her $400,000 for her survivor claims, $250,000 for her emotional distress claims, $600,000 for the Estate of Briandalynne Castro's wrongful death claim, and $800 in special damages for the estate's cremation expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Petitioners also submitted a post-trial memorandum regarding damages. Petitioners first argued that damages should not be awarded because Castro \"has not and cannot prove a causal connection between any alleged negligence of the State Defendants and the stillbirth.\" Petitioners further contended that any award of damages to Castro \"must be minimal\" because her \"conduct at all times prior to the stillbirth was not the conduct of a mother who wanted her baby.\" They additionally contended that Castro's incarceration meant that \"[t]here is absolutely no evidence that [Castro] would have been able to raise her child or have even been able to keep her child.\" Petitioners concluded by arguing that \"an award of $5,000 or less would be an adequate amount to compensate [Castro] for a stillbirth which is not a significant loss to her and for which she has not suffered any emotional distress.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court entered its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Order on May 14, 2012, determining that the Petitioners' negligence was the legal cause of Briandalynne's death. The court made the following Findings of Fact (FOFs)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   relevant to this appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   18. On July 2, 2007, Plaintiff was seen by OCCC nurse practitioner, Amy Yasunaga, for her first pre-natal visit. Ms. Yasunaga was the primary medical provider responsible for treatment and care of pregnant inmates at OCCC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   19. Ms. Yasunaga ordered pre-natal vitamins, took Plaintiff's vital signs, measured the fundus, listened to the fetus's heart tones, and ordered an OBGYN consultation and an ultrasound for Plaintiff at Kapiolani Medical Center (\"KMC\" or \"Kapiolani\"). Ms. Yasunaga noted no abnormalities or concerns with Plaintiff's pregnancy. Ms. Yasunaga noted Plaintiff's last menstrual period was January 31, 2007.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   20. On that same day, July 2, 2007, OCCC physician, Kenneth Zienkiewicz, M.D., reviewed and approved Ms. Yasunaga's orders for Plaintiff's KMC OBGYN consultation and ultrasound.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   22. Both the KMC OBGYN consultation and ultrasound were never done, during the relevant month-long period, from the time Ms. Yasunaga issued the orders on July 2, 2007, until Plaintiff's transfer out of OCCC on August 2, 2007.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   23. Within several days of Plaintiff's July 2, 2007 pre-natal visit with Ms. Yasunaga, Plaintiff began experiencing vaginal bleeding. Plaintiff made four to five reports of her vaginal bleeding to various [Adult Corrections Officers (ACOs) ], including ACO Hattie Reis, ACO Wanda Nunes, and ACO Reyetta Ofilas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   24. All three ACOs informed the OCCC medical unit of Plaintiff's vaginal bleeding and requested medical attention, but no medical care was provided. The medical unit's response, relayed through the Nurse Defendants was, that if Plaintiff's bleeding was not heavy enough to saturate a sanitary pad, and/or not accompanied by cramping, Plaintiff did not need to be sent to the medical unit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   27. Up until Plaintiff's transfer out of OCCC on August 2, 2007, Plaintiff did not receive any medical care for her four to five complaints of vaginal bleeding, and was never sent to the OCCC Medical Unit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   28. During Plaintiff's entire stay at OCCC, Plaintiff was on segregation status, from July 2 to August 2, 2007. The pertinent DPS and OCCC Policies and Procedures for medical care for segregated inmates ... were not followed, and no medical staffer ever checked on, or communicated with Plaintiff, about her bleeding complaints. Nor was Plaintiff ever brought to the OCCC Medical Unit for evaluation of her complaints.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   30. Plaintiff was transferred to WCCC on August 2, 2007. According to WCCC nurse Jennifer Simeona, who conducted Plaintiff's intake on that date, Plaintiff's Interfacility Transfer Form from OCCC, did not contain any information to let Nurse Simeona know, that the KMC OBGYN evaluation and ultrasound ordered on July 2, 2007, were still outstanding and never done. Any outstanding medical orders should have been included on the form.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   34. The WCCC midwife could not detect any fetal heart tones from Plaintiffs fetus. Plaintiff \"broke down\" crying but tried to not lose hope. The midwife ordered that Plaintiff be immediately transported to KMC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   35. Plaintiff was taken to KMC via emergency transport, on that same date, August 10, 2007, where an ultrasound confirmed that the fetus was dead. Labor was induced, and Plaintiff's fetus, Briandalynne Castro ... was delivered stillborn on August 11, 2007.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   36. On August 14, 2007, an autopsy of [Briandalynne] was performed in the usual course by Jeffrey Killeen, M.D. (\"Dr. Killeen\"), KMC Director of Pathology.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   37. Dr. Killeen's autopsy findings and conclusions indicated, inter alia, that the pregnancy was \"term or near-term\", [the stillbirth] appeared to be related to \"intrauterine events occurring at the time of vaginal bleeding\", and that, more likely than not, death was related to a placental abruption. A placental abruption, is a separation of the placenta from the uterus, causing a disconnect between the maternal blood supply and placental nutrition from the maternal circulation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   38. Dr. Killeen's autopsy findings also confirmed that [Briandalynne] had no congenital or developmental abnormalities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   39. On or around October 22, 2008, Dr. Killeen conducted further evaluation and testing to determine the approximate date of [Briandalynne]'s death and supplemented his autopsy report with an Addendum containing his findings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   40. As a result of this further examination of the fetus, placenta, and multiple organs, Dr. Killeen opined that \"the time interval between fetal death and delivery is estimated to be greater than 96 hours, more likely 7 days or more, and less than 14 days.[\"] Dr. Killeen's findings, placed the date of death, within a reasonable degree of medical probability, as between July 29, 2007 and August 4, 2007. Dr. Killeen also indicated that the age of the fetus, was 35 to 37 weeks of gestation\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   56. The evidence established that [Briandalynne had] no congenital or development abnormalities. Despite the incarcerated status of her mother, [Briandalynne's] life and her loss of enjoyment of life, are of the nature and kind of any other infant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   57. An award of damages against Defendant State, in the amount of $250,000.00 to the Estate of Briandalynne Castro, is fair and appropriate, for the State's share of the Estate's total damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The court also made the following relevant Conclusions of Law (COLs):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   74. Under Hawaii's wrongful death statute, a parent of a stillborn viable fetus, such as Plaintiff herein, is entitled to sue for the wrongful death of the fetus.\n   <em>\n    Wade v.

In response, Castro argues that the damages award was appropriate because \"[t]here is no reason why the amount of general damages for the loss of a life and the loss of a person's\n   enjoyment of life in the case of a stillborn child cannot be determined\" using the same factors that courts consider when an infant \"is a victim of wrongful death.\" Castro argues that appellate courts will not disturb the findings of the trial court on damages unless they are clearly erroneous, and that Petitioners' have not adduced any evidence or authority to support such a contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   We conclude that the relevant statutes, applicable case law, and policy considerations, support Castro's contention that the estate of an unborn, viable fetus is able to recover hedonic damages.

In support, Petitioners quote a leading treatise on personal injury, suggesting that hedonic damages are inappropriate in situations in which the decedent was killed instantly: \"[i]n a survival action, a decedent's estate generally may be allowed to recover hedonic damages for the time between injury and death.\" Petitioners also argue that there must be evidence of how a decedent enjoyed life, and a fetus cannot suffer hedonic damages, since the fetus has not had time to develop the ability to have loss of enjoyment of life damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Petitioners' arguments fail for four reasons. First, the legislative history supports a finding that the legislature did not intend to exclude a viable fetus from an HRS \u00a7 663-7 survival action, but rather intended that recovery be as broad as possible. This is consistent with the well-established principle that remedial statutes should be liberally construed.\n   <em>\n    Kalima v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259734\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/111/84/#p100\">\n    111 Hawai'i 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 100,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259734\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/111/84/#p100\">\n    137 P.3d 990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1006 (2006). Second, Hawai'i case law is unique because it does not require the decedent to have actually experienced the loss of enjoyment of life to recover hedonic damages. Third, disallowing hedonic damages in this situation would not adequately compensate the injured party. Fourth, children may recover hedonic damages for injuries sustained in the womb; accordingly, disallowing hedonic damages to viable, unborn fetuses under HRS \u00a7 663-7 would provide perverse incentives to the tortfeasor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In interpreting a statute, we start with our foremost obligation: to ascertain and give\n   effect to the intention of the legislature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan v.

Because it is not clear from the plain language of the statute whether HRS \u00a7 663-7 would apply to a viable, unborn fetus, we must look at the statute's legislative history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259822\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/104/173/#p179\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In reviewing the legislative history of HRS \u00a7 663-7, the survival statute, there is nothing to suggest that the legislature intended to exclude a viable fetus from an HRS \u00a7 663-7 survival action. Rather, the legislature expressly provided that recovery under the survival statute be \"broad\" and endorsed this court's broad judicial interpretation of the wrongful death statute, HRS \u00a7 663-3 which was revised as part of the same bill in which HRS \u00a7 663-7, the survival statute, was implemented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   House Bill 588 of 1955 revised the 1923 wrongful death statute, HRS \u00a7 663-3, and implemented for the first time the survival statute, HRS \u00a7 663-7. In relevant part, the House Judiciary Committee stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   1.

The provisions of this bill are consistent with the theory of the majority of the statutes in the United States. This bill permits recovery for not only pecuniary losses but also for loss of love and affection, including (1) loss of society, companionship, comfort, consortium or protection, (2) loss of marital care, attention, advice or counsel, (3) loss of filial care or attention or, (4) loss of parental care, training, guidance or education.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   4.

In response to\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   , the legislature enacted the wrongful death act of 1923,\n   which provided that any person dependent on the deceased person could maintain an action for damages against the person causing the death.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Gabriel\n   </em>\n   , parents sought to recover for the death of their minor child, and the defendants argued that the 1923 statute had superseded the common law right of recovery for wrongful death, and that only those dependent on the deceased could recover under the statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 572. The\n   <em>\n    Gabriel\n   </em>\n   court held that the statute had not superseded the common law right-and thus that the parents could recover for the death of their minor child.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 582.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Thus, the 1955 revision of HRS \u00a7 663-3 -the wrongful death statute-adopted and codified the Hawai'i Supreme Court's broad remedial interpretation of the statute. The legislature clarified that anyone in specified relationships with the deceased, regardless of dependency, could recover under the statute, and that anyone dependent on the deceased, regardless of relationship, could recover under the statute.

The $250,000 was appropriately based on the evidence at trial that showed, for example, that Briandalynne would have been born a healthy child, and that her loss of enjoyment of life would be similar to that of any other infant.

Additionally, I believe that Justice McKenna should not have addressed the ICA's holding on this point on the merits.

For compelling policy reasons, I believe that the death of an unborn, viable fetus should not give rise to a cause of action under HRS \u00a7 663-3. Thus, I would have held that the estate of an unborn, viable fetus should not be able to recover hedonic damages under HRS \u00a7 663-7 because, in my view, no cause of action arising out of HRS \u00a7 663-3 should survive in favor of the fetus's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Although I agree with Justice McKenna that this court has the discretionary authority to consider the issue despite the fact that the parties did not raise it on certiorari, I do not believe that the circumstances in this case justify exercising such authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

As discussed in section II.A,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , I am constrained in affirming the ICA's holding on this point for procedural reasons. However, had the parties properly challenged the ICA's interpretation of HRS \u00a7 663-3 on certiorari, I would have reversed the ICA's holding on this point, as I believe its decision is unwise for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   First, the ICA's conclusion results in inconsistent standards whereby an unborn fetus is deemed to be a \"person\" under our civil statutes, but is not a \"person\" under our penal code. In my view, whether an unborn fetus may be considered a \"person\" should not vary between statutory frameworks. As this case illustrates, whether an unborn fetus is viewed as a \"person\" in the eyes of the law determines not only the legal rights that the fetus is entitled to, but also the legal duties and responsibilities that all other individuals in society owe to the unborn fetus. Put simply, the legal definition of whether an unborn fetus is a \"person\" structures the basic legal relationships between the unborn fetus and all other persons in our community. A definition with such significant, fundamental consequences should be consistent across the board and should not fluctuate from statute to statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Second, the ICA's holding ventures into uncertain and treacherous territory and may be difficult for courts to apply consistently in the future. Under the ICA's holding, whether\n   the estate of a stillborn fetus may bring a cause of action for wrongful death under HRS \u00a7 663-3 hinges upon whether the fetus was viable before death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313473\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/179/\">\n    137 Hawai'i at 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313473\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/179/\">\n    366 P.3d at 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e hold that a claim may be brought pursuant to HRS \u00a7 663-3 for the death of a\n   <em>\n    viable\n   </em>\n   , unborn fetus.\" (emphasis added) ). However, the concept of a fetus's viability and the determination thereof are both vastly problematic. On this issue, the Supreme Court of the United States has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   [A] physician determines whether or not a fetus is viable after considering a number of variables: the gestational age of the fetus, derived from the reported menstrual history of the woman; fetal weight, based on an inexact estimate of the size and condition of the uterus; the woman's general health and nutrition; the quality of the available medical facilities; and other factors. Because of the number and the imprecision of these variables, the probability of any particular fetus' [s] obtaining meaningful life outside the womb can be determined only with difficulty. Moreover ... even if agreement may be reached on the probability of survival, different physicians equate viability with different probabilities of survival, and some physicians refuse to equate viability with any numerical probability at all. In the face of these uncertainties, it is not unlikely that experts will disagree over whether a particular fetus in the second trimester has advanced to the stage of viability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <em>\n    Colautti v.

In other words:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   [R]ather than being a description of an existing state of facts, the conclusion that a fetus is viable is really more of a medical prediction-often a highly disputable prediction-concerning what might happen to a fetus if you radically change its location.

Different doctors might classify the same fetus as viable or nonviable, perhaps for reasons having nothing to do with the fetus itself, but arising instead from differences in medical skill or treatment philosophy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Randy Beck,\n   <em>\n    State Interests and the Duration of Abortion Rights\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20McGeorge%20L.%20Rev.%2031\">\n    44 McGeorge L. Rev. 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 37 (2013) (footnotes omitted). It follows that under the ICA's holding, a complex medical inquiry fraught with uncertainty determines whether a cause of action may be brought for the death of an unborn fetus under HRS \u00a7 663-3. From my perspective, the existence of a wrongful death claim, which may have significant financial and personal consequences for all parties involved, should not depend on an analysis that has a substantial likelihood of yielding arbitrary results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Accordingly, I believe that the ICA's recognition of a cause of action for the wrongful death of an unborn, viable fetus is ill-advised. Thus, had the issue been properly presented for our consideration on certiorari, I would have held that unborn fetuses should not be included as \"person[s]\" under HRS \u00a7 663-3, and thereby adopt a clear principle of consistent application, which parallels the existing rule in our penal code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Therefore, I would have concluded that a cause of action does not exist for the stillbirth of an unborn, viable fetus under HRS \u00a7 663-3, such that the fetus's estate retains no cause of action arising out of the fetus's stillbirth under HRS \u00a7 663-7.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Greene v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Therefore, for procedural reasons, I agree with the Chief Justice's opinion to the extent that he does not address the issue of whether the stillbirth of a previously viable fetus gives rise to a cause of action under HRS \u00a7 663-3 on the merits, and affirms the ICA's holding on this matter. As I am constrained in affirming the ICA's holding with respect to its interpretation of HRS \u00a7 663-3, I am compelled\n   to join the Chief Justice in affirming the ICA's judgment on appeal. I therefore concur with the result that he reaches, but not the reasoning that he employs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   To be clear, however, had the ICA's interpretation of HRS \u00a7 663-3 been properly raised for our consideration on certiorari, I would have held that an unborn, viable fetus is not a \"person\" within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 663-3, and that no cause of action survives in favor of the fetus's estate under HRS \u00a7 663-7. Accordingly, I would have concluded that the estate of an unborn, viable fetus should not be able to recover hedonic damages under HRS \u00a7 663-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   OPINION OF McKENNA, J., IN WHICH POLLACK, J.

Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   This case arises from the stillbirth of a formerly viable fetus carried by Leah Castro (\"Castro\"), an inmate at a state correctional facility. The Intermediate Court of Appeals (\"ICA\") affirmed the circuit court's damages awards based on the wrongful death\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and survival\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   statutes as well as based on the common law tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress,\n   <em>\n    Castro v.

The remaining defendant state entities and officials\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"the State\") seek certiorari review only of the damages awarded under the survival statute to the estate of the stillborn fetus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The wrongful death\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and survival\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   statutes are interrelated, and provide recovery for \"wrongful act, neglect, or default\" causing death to a \"person.\" The wrongful death statute provides for recovery of damages for those in enumerated relationship categories to the deceased \"person,\" while the survival statute provides for recovery of damages for the estate of the deceased \"person.\" Under the survival statute, HRS \u00a7 663-7, a decedent's\n   legal representative retains only such causes of action as the deceased \"person\" had at the moment of his or her death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greene v.

Thus, damages are not available under the survival statute for a deceased \"person\" unless the deceased qualifies as a \"person\" under the wrongful death statute, HRS \u00a7 663-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   We have held that this court's foremost obligation in construing HRS \u00a7 663-3, Hawai'i's wrongful death statute, is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature.\n   <em>\n    Lealaimatafao v. Woodward-Clyde Consultants\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8831751\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/75/544/#p551\">\n    75 Haw. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 551,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=867%20P.2d%20220\">\n    867 P.2d 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 224 (1994). Although the question of whether a stillborn formerly viable fetus is a \"person\" under Hawaii's wrongful death statute, HRS \u00a7 663-3, was not specifically asserted in the application for writ of certiorari, it is a subsidiary question within the first question on certiorari, \"[w]hether the award of loss of enjoyment of life damages [under the survival statute, HRS \u00a7 663-7 ] for a stillborn fetus was error.\" In our opinion, controlling principles of statutory interpretation clearly indicate that the legislature did not intend to include a stillborn formerly viable fetus in the definition of a \"person\" under the wrongful death and survival statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   For the reasons stated in this opinion, we would therefore conclude that the $250,000 awarded by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (\"circuit court\") to the stillborn fetus's estate as hedonic damages\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   for loss of life and loss of enjoyment of life under the survival statute, which was based on a threshold holding that a stillborn formerly viable fetus qualifies as a \"person\" under Hawaii's wrongful death and survival statutes, was erroneous as a matter of law. Although the $100,000 awarded to Castro for loss of filial consortium under the wrongful death statute also suffers from the same legal defect, the State has not challenged this damages award on certiorari; therefore, we would not set aside that award. In addition, the wrongful death statute is not implicated in the circuit court's award of $250,000 to Castro herself based on the common law tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress. This award was proper and, in any event, was also not challenged on certiorari. Thus, although we would set aside the award of $250,000 for hedonic damages for the estate of the stillborn fetus, we would affirm all other damages awards. We construe Justice Nakayama's opinion as agreeing that a fetus does not qualify as a \"person\" under the wrongful death and survival statutes, but joining with the Chief Justice in a judgment on appeal that also allows the estate of the fetus to recover in this case because the State did not specifically raise the issue on certiorari.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   As noted, this case arises out of the stillbirth of a formerly viable fetus carried by Castro while she was an inmate. The amended complaint filed in the circuit court\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleged wrongful death, survival, and emotional distress claims. Although the wrongful death and survival statutes are not mentioned in the amended complaint, throughout the entire lawsuit, the parties have proceeded on the assumption that this lawsuit is governed by the wrongful death and survival statutes, not based on common law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Castro filed the lawsuit individually and as the personal representative of the estate of the stillborn formerly viable fetus, alleging that the State's failure to provide proper medical care caused the stillbirth. She pled causes of action based on negligence, gross negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   The circuit court denied the State's pre-trial motion to dismiss all survival claims brought on behalf of the estate of the fetus based on the State's argument that a stillborn viable fetus did not qualify as a \"person\" under the wrongful death statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   After a bench trial, the circuit court ruled against the State, and awarded Castro $250,000 based on the common law tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress and $100,000 for loss of filial consortium under the wrongful death statute. The circuit court also awarded $250,000 to the estate of the stillborn formerly viable fetus under the survival statute for loss of life and loss of enjoyment of life. Thus, with respect to damages awarded the estate of the fetus, the circuit court ruled that a stillborn formerly viable fetus is a \"person\" under Hawai'i's wrongful death statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Before the ICA, the State argued (1) that a stillborn fetus is not a \"person\" for purposes of the wrongful death statute; (2) that the circuit court erred in finding negligence; and (3) that even if negligence had been proven, the damages awarded were improper and speculative.\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313473\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/179/\">\n    137 Hawai'i at 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313473\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/179/\">\n    366 P.3d at 1064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Whether the award of loss of enjoyment of life damages for a stillborn fetus was error.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   B. Whether the award of $250,000 damages to the estate of Briandalynne Castro was error when there was no evidence presented to justify that monetary amount.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Thus, the State only challenges the $250,000 in hedonic damages awarded to the estate of the stillborn fetus, and has waived any arguments against the other damages awards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

We believe, however, that it is incumbent on this court to address the issue of whether a stillborn formerly viable fetus qualifies as a person under the wrongful death statute. First, the ICA's published opinion discusses the issue in detail, then holds that a viable fetus is a \"person\" for purposes of the wrongful death statute.\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313473\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/179/\">\n    137 Hawai'i at 186-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313473\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/179/\">\n    366 P.3d at 1065-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Second, the issue is clearly subsumed within the first question on certiorari.

Thus, the issue of whether the ICA erred by including a stillborn formerly viable fetus in the definition of a \"person\" as a decedent under the wrongful death statute is a \"subsidiary question fairly comprised\" within the State's question on certiorari as to whether hedonic damages were properly awarded to the estate of the stillborn fetus under the survival statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   The propriety of addressing subsidiary issues is illustrated by\n   <em>\n    Matter of Lorenzo's Estate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1437790\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/61/236/\">\n    61 Haw. 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=602%20P.2d%20521\">\n    602 P.2d 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979).

Any action brought under this section shall be commenced within two years from the date of death of the injured person, except as otherwise provided.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Applying the first three principles of statutory interpretation, the language of the statute is clear; it allows a wrongful death action to be brought for the death of a \"person.\" The statute does not refer to a \"fetus.\" Second, our sole duty is to give effect to the plain and obvious meaning of \"person,\" which does not include an unborn fetus. Third, we are to give effect to the intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the language contained in the statute itself. Again, the language of the statute does not include a \"fetus.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Even if there is an ambiguity in the statute, there is no legislative intent to include a viable fetus in the definition of \"person\" under the wrongful death statute.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   There is no ambiguity in the wrongful death statute on the issue of whether a \"person\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   includes a stillborn formerly viable fetus. Even if there is an ambiguity, however, the remaining principles of statutory interpretation also require us to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent with respect to the meaning of the wrongful death statute. To do so, we may consider the context within which the ambiguous word appears and examine extrinsic aids, such as legislative history or the reason and spirit of the law. With respect to this analysis, HRS \u00a7 1-15 (1993) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-228\">\n   <strong>\n    Construction of ambiguous context.\n   </strong>\n   Where the words of a law are ambiguous:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-229\">\n   (1) The meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-230\">\n   (2) The reason and spirit of the law, and the cause which induced the legislature to enact it, may be considered to discover its true meaning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-231\">\n   (3) Every construction which leads to an absurdity shall be rejected.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   Applying the rules of statutory construction under HRS \u00a7 1-15 subsections (1) and (3), and examining the context within which the allegedly ambiguous word \"person\" appears, HRS \u00a7 663-3 uses the word \"person\" in three ways. The initial reference to \"person\" signifies the decedent (\"When the death of a\n   <em>\n    person\n   </em>\n   is caused....\"). HRS \u00a7 663-3 (emphasis added). The second reference to \"person\" identifies those who can be held liable for a wrongful death (\"is caused by the wrongful act ... of any\n   <em>\n    person\n   </em>\n   .\"). HRS \u00a7 663-3 (emphasis added). Finally, the word \"person\" is used in the context of defining possible plaintiffs (\"by any\n   <em>\n    person\n   </em>\n   wholly or partly dependent upon the deceased\"). HRS \u00a7 663-3 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Thus, the word \"person\" is used in three contexts within HRS \u00a7 663-3. By opining that a stillborn formerly viable fetus qualifies as a person under the survival statute, the Chief Justice implicitly construes \"person\" in the first context of the wrongful death statute only, as a decedent, to include a fetus. Yet, it would be absurd to construe \"person\" in the second context, as a tortfeasor, or the third context, as one dependent on the deceased, to include a fetus. The legislature, however, uses the same word, \"person,\" in all three contexts. The Chief Justice would thus ascribe a different definition of \"person\" in only one context, that of the decedent, to include a fetus.

Thus, nothing in the legislative history of the original statute indicates the 1923 legislature intended to include\n   a viable fetus in the definition of \"person.\" There is nothing in the subsequent legislative history of the wrongful death statute to suggest any change to this legislative intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   This is because in comparing the 1923 statute with HRS \u00a7 663-3, it is apparent that the original statute has been amended in various ways that do not bear on the issue in this case. The only major change between the 1923 statute and HRS \u00a7 663-3 was to expand the class of possible plaintiffs to include specified categories of persons not financially dependent on the decedent. This conceptual amendment occurred in 1955. 1955 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 205 at 184. The committee report discussing the reasons for this expansion of the class of possible plaintiffs does not indicate any intent to include viable fetuses within the definition of \"person\" as decedent under HRS \u00a7 663-3. In relevant part, the House Judiciary Committee stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-252\">\n   1.

The legislature then passed a wrongful death statute in 1923. In\n   <em>\n    Gabriel\n   </em>\n   , this court held that the legislative enactment did not abrogate the common law wrongful death cause of action, and expanded Hawaii's common law wrongful death cause of action to allow claims by parents for the death of a child.\n   <em>\n    Gabriel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1459971\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/37/571/\">\n    37 Haw. at 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The 1955 legislature's stated intent was merely to follow\n   <em>\n    Gabriel\n   </em>\n   and eliminate the dependency requirement.\n   <em>\n    Gabriel\n   </em>\n   recognized a common law wrongful death cause of action for the parents of a minor child, not a stillborn fetus. It did nothing to affect the definition of \"person\" as a decedent under the wrongful death statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   In addition, as noted earlier, by 1955, when the wrongful death statute was amended to conform with\n   <em>\n    Gabriel\n   </em>\n   and the survival statute was enacted, the Minnesota Supreme Court in the\n   <em>\n    Verkennes\n   </em>\n   case had recognized a wrongful death cause of action for a stillborn viable fetus. However, the legislature made no reference to that case, and cited only to\n   <em>\n    Gabriel\n   </em>\n   . Again,\n   <em>\n    Gabriel\n   </em>\n   merely recognized a common law wrongful death cause of action for the death of a child born alive. Thus, contrary to the Chief Justice's opinion, nothing in the 1955 legislative history indicates that the legislature intended to \"broaden the right of recovery\" to the extent of including a fetus in the definition of \"person\" for purposes of HRS \u00a7 663-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   In addition, when the wrongful death statute was first enacted in 1923, Hawai'i statutory law had a general definition of \"person\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-262\">\n   SECTION 17. The word person, or words importing persons, for instance, another, others, any, any one, anybody, and the like, signify not only persons, but corporations, societies, communities, assemblies, inhabitants of a district, or neighborhood, or persons known or unknown, and the public generally, where it appears, from the subject\n   matter, the sense and the connection in which such words are used, that such construction is intended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   The Civil Code of the Hawaiian Islands 1859, page 8. This statute remains in place, with minor amendments, as HRS \u00a7 1-19 (2009), which reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-264\">\n   <strong>\n    \"Person\", \"others\", \"any\", etc.\n   </strong>\n   The word \"person\", or words importing persons, for instance, \"another\", \"others\", \"any\", \"anyone\", \"anybody\", and the like, signify not only individuals, but corporations, firms, associations, societies, communities, assemblies, inhabitants of a district, or neighborhood, or persons known or unknown, and the public generally, where it appears, from the subject matter, the sense and connection in which such words are used, that such construction is intended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   The legislative change from \"signify not only persons\" to \"signify not only individuals\" also occurred in 1955. Act 57 of 1955, Section 1(e). Webster's defines \"individual\" in relevant part as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-266\">\n   1 a: a particular being or thing as distinguished from a class, species, or collection: as (1): a single human being as contrasted with a social group or institution [sic] (2): a single organism as distinguished from a group\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-267\">\n   b: a particular person [sic]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-268\">\n   2: an indivisible entity ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   <em>\n    Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (1993) at 593.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   Whether a \"person\" signifies a \"person\" or an \"individual,\" applying rules of statutory construction, the plain language of \"person\" or \"individual\" does not include a viable fetus. A fetus is not an \"individual.\" If the term is ambiguous, which it is not, we can examine legislative intent. The Senate and House Judiciary committee reports regarding this change from \"signify not only persons\" to \"signify not only individuals,\" were part of S.B. 751 of 1955, which included technical changes to other statutes governing statutory construction. S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 214, in 1955 Senate Journal, at 751-52; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 551, in 1955 House Journal, at 761. The committee reports merely stated that the change was being made, but gave no reason for the change.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1459971\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/37/571/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There is no indication that the legislature intended that the amendment redefine \"person\" to include a viable fetus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   Common law principles of statutory interpretation also suggest examining the \"spirit and intent of the law\" in order to determine legislative intent. In doing so, we note that Act 245 of 1923, the original wrongful death statute, was introduced as House Bill 395 of 1923. At the time of its introduction, it was entitled \"An Act to prevent homicides.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 519, in 1923 House Journal, at 1079. The index to the Revised Laws of Hawai'i (1915), page 1683\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   includes the term \"homicides,\" and instructs the reader to see \"[m]urder\" and \"[m]anslaughter\" under \"[c]riminal [l]aw.\" The murder and manslaughter statutes at the time, Sections 3862 and 3866 of the Revised Laws of Hawai'i (1915), defined those crimes as the \"killing\" of a \"human being.\" Although \"human being\" was not further statutorily defined at the time, the plain meaning of the word indicates a person already born alive. Thus, the wrongful death statute was introduced as \"An Act to prevent homicides,\" and the homicide statutes did not indicate they applied to fetuses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   Consistent with the 1923 homicide statutes, HRS \u00a7 707-700 (2014) of the Hawai'i Penal Code now clearly defines \"person\" as \"a human being who has been born and is alive.\" Thus, this legislative history also indicates that the legislature did not intend to include a viable fetus in the definition of \"person\" for purposes of the wrongful death statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   Additional evidence of this legislative intent exists. The legislature recognizes the distinction between \"persons\" and \"fetuses\" as well as \"deaths\" and \"fetal deaths.\" The State Public Health Statistics Act, HRS Chapter 338 Part I (2010), distinguishes between \"deaths\" and \"fetal deaths,\" and HRS \u00a7 338-1 (2010) defines \"fetal death,\" as a\n   death of a fetus \"irrespective of the duration of pregnancy.\" \"Death certificates\" and \"fetal death certificates\" are separate terms under HRS \u00a7 338-9 (2010). Nowhere in the Hawaii Revised Statutes is a \"person\" defined to include a \"fetus.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   Therefore, principles of statutory interpretation do not support the Chief Justice's and ICA's opinions. The legislative history and statutory scheme do not indicate any legislative intent to include a stillborn formerly viable fetus in the definition of a \"person\" under HRS \u00a7 663-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Lealaimatafao\n   </em>\n   , this conclusion ends the inquiry. We go on, however, to address additional reasons why it is erroneous to construe the wrongful death statute to include a cause of action for a stillborn fetus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Construing \"person\" under HRS \u00a7 663-3 to include a stillborn formerly viable fetus would subject a woman to potential civil liability if her negligence causes fetal death or if she exercises abortion rights.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   Construing \"person\" under HRS \u00a7 663-3 to include a stillborn viable fetus would, without more, subject to civil liability a woman carrying a fetus whose negligence caused a viable fetus to die in utero or who exercised her rights to terminate a pregnancy under HRS \u00a7 453-16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, a\n   parent representing the estate of the fetus could sue a woman carrying a viable fetus;\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   construing HRS \u00a7 663-3 to include a stillborn formerly viable fetus in the definition of a \"person\" would cause a woman exercising abortion rights under HRS \u00a7 453-16, or whose negligence causes the death of a viable fetus, to be subject to lawsuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   The ICA's holding did not preclude these possibilities. The Chief Justice attempts to exclude such potential liability by indicating he would rule as a matter of law that a pregnant woman does not owe a duty of care to the fetus she carries.

Thus, it appears that unless that court created an exception, a woman could have also been held liable for wrongful death of a viable fetus.

If a stillborn formerly viable fetus is a \"person\" for purposes of HRS \u00a7 663-3, not only a negligent woman, but a woman exercising her rights to terminate a pregnancy under HRS \u00a7 453-16 would be subject to civil liability under HRS \u00a7 663-3.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   footnote 15,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .

Hawai'i courts recognized NIED claims even based on injury to property alone. In Rodrigues v. State of Hawaii,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   distressed owners of a Maui home that flooded as a result of the State's negligent failure to clear a plugged culvert were allowed to recover, even though they had not yet moved in, incurred only property damage, and suffered no physical injury related to the flooding incident. A series of cases followed that put Hawaii in a field of its own in this area of the law, creating a novel and expansive test that seems to still be broadening. Under Hawaii law, plaintiffs may recover even for NIED experienced from post-accident news of the death of a pet,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   making Hawaii one of only a few jurisdictions in the country to recognize this tort.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-314\">\n   Hawaii NIED law continued to be broadly interpreted in subsequent cases like the 1989 Masaki v. General Motors case,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   which allowed recovery by parents who suffered emotional distress upon seeing their adult son in the hospital after a severe accident. The court took another liberal turn in the 1999 case John and Jane Roes v. FHP, Inc.,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   holding that airport baggage handlers who were exposed to, but not ultimately infected by, HIV-tainted blood from a burst package could claim NIED for the period of time during which they had a legitimate fear of AIDS. Without doubt, Hawaii has established itself as the national standard[-]bearer of liberal NIED rulings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   Thus, the availability of Hawaii's independent tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress obviates the \"lack of other remedy\" rationale for the need to recognize a wrongful death cause of action for a stillborn formerly viable fetus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   Finally, even if the common law cause of action of negligent infliction of emotional distress did not exist, the intent of the legislature controls in our interpretation of HRS \u00a7 663-3. For all the reasons stated above, the Hawai'i legislature did not intend to include a stillborn formerly viable fetus within the definition of \"person\" under HRS \u00a7 663-3. It is not for this court to substitute our judgment for the legislature's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the ICA's Judgment on Appeal as to the $250,000 awarded to Castro individually for negligent infliction of emotional distress and the $100,000 awarded to Castro for loss of filial consortium should be affirmed, but the $250,000 awarded to the estate of the fetus for loss of life and loss of enjoyment of life should be set aside. We construe Justice Nakayama's opinion as agreeing that a fetus does not qualify as a \"person\" under the wrongful death and survival statutes, but\n   joining with the Chief Justice in a judgment on appeal that also allows the estate of the fetus to recover in this case because the State did not specifically raise the issue on certiorari.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-321\">\n    HRS \u00a7 663-3 (Supp. 1997) (\"Death by wrongful act\") provides in pertinent part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-322\">\n    (a) When the death of a person is caused by the wrongful act, neglect, or default of any person, the deceased's legal representative, or any of the persons enumerated in subsection (b), may maintain an action against the person causing the death or against the person responsible for the death.

We express no opinion as to whether the 2006 amendment affected the 1970 legislative intent. What is clear at minimum is that under Hawai'i law, a woman has a right to terminate a pregnancy when it is necessary to protect her life or health. This was also true in 1923, when the legislature passed the wrongful death statute. Section 4455 of the Revised Law of Hawai'i (1915), provided a justification defense to an abortion performed to save the life of the woman; this justification defense remained up until 1970, when abortion was decriminalized. It is also relevant that the abortion law from 1923 to 1970 did not actually criminalize the killing of a fetus, but rather, criminalized intentional acts leading to an abortion:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-379\">\n    Section 44162. Abortion; punishment. Whoever maliciously without lawful justification, administers, or causes or procures to be administered any poison or noxious thing to a woman when with child, in order to produce her miscarriage, or maliciously uses any instrument or other means with like intent, shall, if the woman be then quick with child, be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars and imprisonment at hard labor not more than five years; and if she be then not quick with child, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars, and imprisonment at hard labor not more than two years.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-380\">\n    Revised Laws of Hawai'i (1915).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-381\">\n    This phrasing is used because it is possible that the woman bearing the child would not be a \"mother\" under the law, for example, a surrogate carrying a fetus whose parents have been determined to be other persons.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-382\">\n    For example, in deciding to construe \"person\" to include a viable fetus for purposes of that state's wrongful death statute, the Arkansas Supreme Court cited to an amendment to that state's constitution declaring that \"[t]he policy of Arkansas is to protect the life of every unborn child from conception until birth.\"\n    <em>\n     Aka v.
