Hoistad, Larry Vervick, and Richard W. Horton (collectively Investors) appeal the order of the Montana Fourth Judicial District Court staying proceedings and compelling them to submit all asserted claims against FSC Securities Corporation (FSC) and Rocky Mountain Financial Advisors, L.L.C. (f/k/a/ Rocky Mountain Financial, L.L.C.), and Eric D. Rolshoven (collectively RMF) to arbitration. We affirm and restate the dispositive issues as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    1. Did the District Court erroneously conclude that Investors knowingly and voluntarily assented to the subject arbitration agreements and validly waived their rights to full legal redress and jury trial?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    2. Did the District Court correctly conclude that the subject arbitration agreements were not unconscionable?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 FSC is a Delaware-chartered, Georgia-based corporation registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to provide interstate securities brokerage and investment advisory services. RMF is a Montana-registered, limited liability company, that was engaged in the business of providing licensed financial and securities brokerage services as registered\n   representatives of FSC. Eric Rolshoven (Rolshoven) and broker Barry Hartman (Hartman) were agents of RMF, and registered representatives of FSC, doing business in Missoula, Montana. Invizeon was a Missoula-based corporation engaged in raising investment capital, purportedly to support business plans to aid in the marketing of various security-related technology products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Between 2003 and 2014, on the recommendation of RMF brokers and advisors, a number of investors, including Investors, purchased\n   securities in Invizeon Corporation through FSC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2015, Invizeon failed, causing Investors to sustain substantial losses. Investors promptly sued FSC and RMF in the Montana Fourth Judicial District Court, alleging that FSC failed to adequately supervise its registered RMF representatives and that RMF wrongfully induced Investors to invest in Invizeon on various grounds including misrepresentation, fraud, and undisclosed self-dealing. Eight months into the litigation, FSC and RMF separately moved to stay proceedings and compel arbitration before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following briefing and oral argument on the motions, the District Court conducted a supplemental evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Over the course of multiple, day-long hearings, the District Court heard testimony from each Investor regarding his or her recollection of the specific contract documents and related circumstances. All Investors testified that they did not recall reading or receiving a standard-form FSC customer agreement that included a detailed arbitration agreement. Each Investor described his or her educational background and prior investment experience. Though several Investors recalled receiving significant paperwork when they opened their RMF accounts, none recalled reading or receiving the customer agreement form. However, all Investors recalled seeing and reading an arbitration notice printed above the signature block on the separate client application form. The Investors testified that they had no recollection of anyone at RMF advising them of the legal significance of the arbitration agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 FSC's Senior Litigation Counsel Greg Curley (Curley) testified as to the standard FSC protocol followed by FSC representatives in opening brokerage accounts. Each FSC brokerage agreement consisted of a separate client application form, customer agreement form, signature page form, and an account worksheet generated and maintained by FSC's computerized account management system. Whether viewed in electronic or hard-copy form, the transaction documents for each FSC brokerage agreement were readily identifiable by account name, number, and cross-referenced transaction forms\n   identified by version reference. Initiating RMF representatives opened each account through the FSC account management system by selecting the constituent transaction forms from a menu screen which then set up an electronic account record for each client. Upon initiation of each new client account, the system generated a hard copy of all initial transaction documents for client review and signature in the form of a single document print-out. Pursuant to standard FSC policy and procedure, RMF retained each client's signed application signature form and provided a hard-copy of all transaction documents to the client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The three-page customer agreement form contained detailed language explaining the arbitration process relative to litigation, stated the parties' agreement to resolve any and all disputes through binding arbitration, and declared that the agreement effected a waiver of the client's litigation rights, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the right to a jury trial. Though FSC did not require Investors to initial or sign the customer agreement form, the application signature page forms conspicuously referenced the customer agreement form as part of the agreements and conspicuously stated in bold-print directly above one of two customer signature blocks that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The Customer Agreement contains a pre-dispute Arbitration Provision. This Provision is contained in this agreement and appears in bold print.\n   <em>\n    I hereby acknowledge\n   </em>\n   by my signature below,\n   <em>\n    receipt of a copy of this agreement\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Emphasis added.) FSC did not require the initiating RMF representative to further discuss or explain the arbitration agreements with clients beyond the express language of the transaction forms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 Kay Hartman (Kay), wife of RMF broker and registered FSC representative Barry Hartman, assisted with clerical duties, including preparing, printing, and providing account packets to clients upon opening of new accounts at RMF. Kay testified that she assisted with new accounts by obtaining and inputting client information into the FSC system. Kay also printed the various transaction documents for client review, verified social security numbers, and obtained client signatures. Kay testified that, if she had any reason to believe that a client did not receive or leave the office with copies of all transaction documents, it was her practice to mail copies to the client with a note to contact her or Mr. Hartman with any questions. Kay further testified that it was her standard practice to tell clients that the account application documents made them FSC clients and that the referenced customer agreement form provided for mandatory arbitration of any dispute related to the account. There is no evidence\n   that any of the Investors ever questioned, objected to, or stated any concern about the arbitration provisions referenced in any of the FSC account documents. Kay testified that she mailed complete transaction document packets to two of the Investors after signing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 Although the language of the customer agreements forms varied slightly over time, Curley testified that the arbitration agreement language remained substantially similar at all times pertinent.\n   <em>\n    Inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the customer agreement forms included the following arbitration agreement and disclosure in bold type:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Arbitration\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   1. Arbitration Disclosure\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   This agreement contains a pre-dispute arbitration clause. By signing an arbitration agreement the parties agree as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 All parties to this agreement are giving up the right to sue each other in court, including the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by the rules of the arbitration forum in which a claim is filed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party's ability to have a court reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other discovery is generally more limited in arbitration that in court proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 The panel of arbitrators will typically include a minority of arbitrators who were or are affiliated with the securities industry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in arbitration. In some cases, a claim that is ineligible for arbitration may be brought in court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 The rules of the arbitration forum in which the claim is filed, and any amendments thereto, shall be incorporated into this agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   2. Agreement to Arbitrate Controversies\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   You agree that any and all controversies which may arise between you, FSC, Pershing LLC, and/or any of FSC's employees, agents, or officers concerning any account, transaction, dispute or the construction, performance, breach, or termination of this Agreement or any other agreement, whether entered into prior to, on or subsequent to the date hereof, shall be determined and resolved by arbitration. Any arbitration under this Agreement shall be held under and pursuant to and governed by the Federal\n   Arbitration Act, and shall be conducted before an arbitration panel convened by the American Arbitration Association\n   or NASD Dispute Resolution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   You may also select any other national securities exchange's arbitration forum in which FSC is legally bound to arbitrate the controversy, including, where applicable, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. Any arbitration pursuant to this Agreement shall be governed by the rules of the organization convening the arbitration panel. The award of the arbitrators, or a majority of them, shall be final, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. A party's ability to have a court reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The customer agreement forms distinctly set forth the language of the arbitration agreement in bold print, separate from the other terms and conditions in the customer agreement. At hearing, each Investor acknowledged and authenticated his or her signature on at least one FSC account application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After each account opening, FSC mailed periodic account statements to each Investor that,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , included a detailed notice including arbitration agreement language similar to that set forth in the original customer agreement form.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b69 On February 8, 2017, following supplemental post-hearing briefing, the District Court issued extensive findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order compelling Investors to submit their claims to arbitration as provided in the FSC customer agreement forms. Based on the testimony of individual Investors, the court found that each Investor received actual notice of the arbitration agreement. The court further found that all of Investors were highly educated and sophisticated market investors with extraordinary business acumen. The plaintiffs included a lawyer, a certified public accountant, two banking executives, and highly successful business people, all knowledgeable and experienced market investors. The court found that none of the investors were under any duress or \"physical or emotional\n   compulsion\" and that there was no evidence or allegation that FSC or RMF induced Investors to enter into the subject brokerage agreements by duress, fraud, misrepresentation, or other unlawful conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b610 Though the District Court determined that all agreements were non-negotiated contracts on terms dictated by FSC, the court further concluded that the standard-form contracts, including the arbitration agreements, were within the reasonable expectations of each client and were not oppressive, unconscionable, or contrary to public policy. The court found that each of the plaintiffs \"signed at least one, and sometimes more than one, account opening document ... confirm[ing that] 'the Customer Agreement contain[ed] a pre-dispute Arbitration Provision' \" and that each expressly acknowledged receipt of the customer agreement form by signature and through the following signature page advisory:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   THE TRADITIONAL INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT CUSTODIAL ACCOUNT PLAN (\"ACCOUNT PLAN\") THAT ACCOMPANIES THIS ADOPTION AGREEMENT CONTAINS A PREDISPUTE ARBITRATION CLAUSE, WHICH MAY AFFECT RIGHTS UNDER THE PLAN. THE PREDISPUTE ARBITRATION CLAUSE IS LOCATED IN ARTICLE VIII, SECTION 11(i) ON PAGES 7 &amp; 8 OF THE ACCOUNT PLAN. BY SIGNING THIS IRA ADOPTION AGREEMENT, I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE READ THE PREDISPUTE ARBITRATION CLAUSE, UNDERSTAND IT, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY IT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The District Court found and concluded that no fiduciary relationship existed between FSC/RMF and any of the plaintiffs and, thus, FSC/RMF had no duty to further explain the legal significance of the arbitration agreements beyond their express written language. The court further found that all of the FSC transaction forms were \"subject to regulatory approval\" and that there was no evidence or assertion that the forms did not conform with applicable securities regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b611 Though the arbitration language in each account agreement differed slightly depending on the version the forms in use at time of execution, the District Court determined that the arbitration agreement language in each form was substantively similar, clear, and unambiguous. The court ultimately concluded that each Investor had knowingly and voluntarily executed a valid arbitration agreement and\n   associated waiver of their Montana constitutional rights to full legal redress and a jury trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court thus granted the motions of FSC and RMF and compelled the Investors to submit to binding arbitration before FINRA. Upon obtaining an order to stay proceedings pending appeal, six of the original eleven plaintiffs timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b612 We review district court conclusions of law, and resulting orders compelling arbitration, de novo for correctness.\n   <em>\n    Global Client Solutions, LLC v.

With minor variation,\n   the signature page forms conspicuously, clearly, and unambiguously referenced a separate customer agreement form and conspicuously gave notice that the customer agreement form contained an arbitration agreement. Though generated and maintained in separate forms, the FSC system printed-out the application, customer agreement, and signature page forms in a single-document format for client review and signature. In both formats, the transaction documents clearly, conspicuously, and unambiguously stated and explained that the customer agreement form was an essential part of the contract terms to which Investors were assenting, the nature of arbitration in contrast to litigation, that all disputes arising from the agreement were subject to binding arbitration, and that the agreement effected a waiver of the rights to full legal redress and jury trial.

Substantial evidence indicates that the Investors were well aware of, and more than capable of understanding, the nature of arbitration, that all account-related disputes would be subject to arbitration, and that they were waiving their rights to full legal redress and jury trial. No evidence indicates that Investors' assent to the arbitration agreements was the product of non-disclosure, mistake, fraud, misrepresentation, coercion, or duress.

Rather, we have merely found that those considerations\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    be relevant,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , to whether a valid constitutional waiver occurred, and whether adhesive contract terms were unconscionable as a matter of equity, under the totality of the circumstances in a particular case.\n    <em>\n     Woodruff\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 15 ;\n    <em>\n     Kortum\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 25-27 ;\n    <em>\n     Kloss\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 27-28 ;\n    <em>\n     Chor\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4598897\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/261/143/#p153\">\n     261 Mont. at 149-53\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4598897\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/261/143/#p153\">\n     862 P.2d at 30-32\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, by weeding-out the reasonable expectations doctrine and clarifying our generally applicable constitutional waiver and equitable unconscionability analyses, we distinguish the dark cloud of\n    <em>\n     Mortensen\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
