James Courtney and Clifford Courtney sought a declaratory order from the WUTC to determine whether any of their five proposed commercial ferry services on Lake Chelan would require a PCN certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   They contended that none of their proposed services were \"for the public use,\" as contemplated by RCW 81.84.010(1). The WUTC disagreed and concluded that all five of the Courtneys' proposed ferry services were for the public use and would require a PCN certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 On appeal, the Courtneys contend that the WUTC erred in too broadly construing \"for the public use.\" They also contend that the WUTC acted arbitrarily or capriciously because it treats surface transportation carriers differently from commercial ferries and because the WUTC refused to apply the charter service exemption for commercial ferries to one of its proposed ferry services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 We review the legislative intent behind RCW 81.84.010(1), conclude that the phrase \"for the public use\" should be construed broadly to protect regulated commercial ferries, and affirm the WUTC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 Lake Chelan Boat Company has operated a year-round commercial ferry service on Lake Chelan since 1918. The WUTC's predecessor issued a PCN certificate to Lake Chelan Boat Company in 1929 and, since that time, Lake Chelan Boat Company has successfully protected its exclusivity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 The Courtneys are residents of Stehekin, Washington, a small, unincorporated town at the northwest end of Lake Chelan. The Courtneys and their families own several businesses in Stehekin, Washington, including two floating plane companies, Stehekin Valley Ranch, Stehekin Outfitters, Stehekin Log Cabins, and Stehekin Pastry Company. They have attempted to operate their own commercial ferry on Lake Chelan for the past two decades. Stehekin, a popular tourist destination, is accessible only by boat, plane, or foot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 In 2009, Cliff Courtney sent a letter to his state legislators and the governor urging them to eliminate or relax the commercial ferry PCN requirement. The legislature passed, and the governor signed, a bill directing the WUTC to study and report on the appropriateness of the regulations governing ferry service on Lake Chelan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 The WUTC published its report in early 2010. The report reviewed the history of ferry service regulation on Lake Chelan from 1911 to 2009 and the legal framework for regulation and its rationale. The report discussed the then-current ferry service on Lake Chelan and the views of stakeholders as to whether existing laws should be relaxed to allow unregulated commercial ferries to compete with regulated commercial ferries. The report concludes with a discussion and recommendation to the legislature:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [T]he ferry services provided by the Lake Chelan Boat Company provide a lifeline to the communities of Stehekin and Holden Village. Faced with the question posed in 1921-would these communities be adequately served by unregulated passenger ferry operators?-the present Commission could not say with confidence that they would.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   In the short term, it is conceivable, and perhaps likely, that during the busy summer months customer would enjoy the benefits of competition among boat operators, who would lower fares and improve service to make their offerings more attractive to potential customers. During these periods, tourism may even increase as prices fall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   But we agree with our predecessors that ... ferry operators would cease all unprofitable activities. With no legal obligation to serve, they would reduce or eliminate services during the winter months, or during times when fuel prices are high, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   during times when more attractive business opportunities arise for the use of their boats or docking facilities. Even if revenues during the summer months would allow the operators revenue to serve year-round, they would not be expected to so if such activities were unprofitable and they were under no obligation to provide them. In any event, it is not clear that summer operations would subsidize winter service if the operators were to lose market share during those months to seasonal competitors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Moreover, the issue of safety must be considered. Because the purchase, maintenance and operation of ferry service is a\n   costly venture ... we doubt that the opportunity to provide ferry service on Lake Chelan will attract more than a few operators that the Commission would deem \"fit, willing and able\" to provide service under current standards. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   For these reasons, the Commission does not recommend at this time any changes to the state laws dealing with commercial ferry regulation as it pertains to Lake Chelan. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 287.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b68 In 2011, the Courtneys commenced a federal constitutional challenge to the PCN requirement. The federal district court dismissed the Courtneys' claims, but the Ninth Circuit reversed in part. On remand, the federal district court issued an order \"retain[ing] jurisdiction over [the Courtneys'] second constitutional claim pending an authoritative construction of the phrase 'for the public use for hire' by the WUTC or the Washington state courts.\" CP at 252.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b69 In furtherance of that order, the Courtneys filed a petition with the WUTC for it to determine the meaning of \"for the public use for hire.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The WUTC declined to enter an order on the basis that the petition lacked sufficient information and operational details. The Courtneys then filed a second petition setting forth five proposed ferry services so that the WUTC could make its determination as to each proposed service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b610 The services share several features in common. The proposed vessel is a 50- to 64-foot climate-controlled boat, and would operate between Memorial Day and early October of each year. Each service would charge a flat rate of $37 per adult passenger for a one-way ticket, or $74 for a round trip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b611 Each service would be a scheduled run between Stehekin and the federally-owned dock in either Fields Point Landing or Manson Bay Marina. The boat would leave Stehekin at 10:00 a.m., arrive at either destination at noon, depart at 12:30 p.m., and arrive back at Stehekin at 2:30 p.m. The primary difference among the proposed services are the scope of passengers the boat would carry:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Proposal 1 (Lodging Customers of Stehekin Valley Ranch)-Passengers would be limited to persons with confirmed reservations to stay overnight at Stehekin Valley Ranch, owned by Clifford Courtney and his wife. The boat transportation service would be owned by Clifford Courtney, and make no intermediate stops.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Proposal 2 (Lodging Customers and Customers of Other Activities Offered at Stehekin Valley Ranch)-In addition to persons with reservations to stay at the ranch, passengers would include anyone with reservations to participate in any of the activities the ranch offers, including activities provided by Stehekin Outfitters, run in part by Clifford Courtney's son. Again, the boat transportation service would be owned by Clifford Courtney and would make no intermediate stops.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Proposal 3 (Customers of Courtney Family-owned Businesses)-Passengers would be limited to anyone with reservations at any business owned by Clifford or James Courtney or their extended family, including but not limited to the Stehekin Valley Ranch. The boat would make intermediate stops at, or stand-alone trips to, other points on Lake Chelan as necessary to access the businesses. The boat transportation service would be owned by James and Clifford Courtney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Proposal 4 (Customers of Stehekin-Based Businesses)-Passengers could be anyone with reservations at any Stehekin-based businesses that want to use the service, including but not limited to Courtney family-owned businesses. The boat would make intermediate stops at, or stand-alone trips to, other points on Lake Chelan as necessary to access the businesses. The boat transportation service would be owned by James and Clifford Courtney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Proposal 5 (Charter by Stehekin-based Travel Company)-Passengers would be restricted to persons who have purchased a travel package from a Stehekin-based\n   travel agency that is not affiliated with the Courtneys but would charter the boat from the Courtneys. The boat would make intermediate stops at, or stand-alone trips to, other points on Lake Chelan as necessary to access the travel locations. The boat transportation service would be owned by James and Clifford Courtney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   CP at 429-30. In all of the proposed services, the commercial ferry service would be owned independently from the other businesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b612 The WUTC issued notice for all interested persons or entities to submit comments. Lake Chelan Boat Company expressed its opposition to another ferry service on Lake Chelan, claiming its financial viability and ability to operate year-round services for the public would be under threat. Arrow Launch Service, Inc.-a PCN ferry operator not servicing Lake Chelan-also expressed its opinion that the Courtneys' proposed services would create a template for setting up ferries that are public in all but name, which would threaten the viability of all true regulated public ferries in Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b613 The WUTC heard oral argument and issued its declaratory order a few weeks later. The WUTC noted that the only legal issue was whether the proposed services would operate \"for the public use\" within the meaning of RCW 81.84.010(1). The order noted that the legislature did not define the phrase and that neither the WUTC nor any Washington court had interpreted the phrase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b614 The WUTC then looked to the plain language of the statute to derive the legislature's intent. Relying on a dictionary definition, the WUTC construed \"for the public use\" as meaning \" 'accessible to or shared by all members of the community.' \" CP at 432-33. Relying on a dictionary definition once again, the WUTC construed \"community\" as meaning \" 'a body of individuals organized into a unit' \" or \" 'linked by common interests.' \" CP at 433. Combining the dictionary definitions for both terms, the WUTC concluded that a commercial ferry operator must obtain a PCN certificate when the ferry \"is accessible to all persons that are part of a group with common interests.\" CP at 433.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b615 The Courtneys argued to the WUTC that their proposed services were not for the public use because ferry services would be limited to customers of one or more particular Stehekin businesses. The WUTC noted that the United States Supreme Court had rejected a similar argument in\n   <em>\n    Terminal Taxicab Co. v. Kutz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8286908\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/241/252/\">\n    241 U.S. 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8286908\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/241/252/\">\n    36 S.Ct. 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8286908\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/241/252/\">\n    60 L.Ed. 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1916). The WUTC, in rejecting this argument, concluded that limiting services to persons who are demonstrated customers of specific businesses would not remove the services' essential public character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b616 The Courtneys also argued that exemptions applicable to commercial ferries should be as broad as exemptions applicable to surface transportation companies. The WUTC, noting that there are important differences between the commercial ferry statutes and surface transportation statutes, rejected that argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b617 The Courtneys further argued that Proposal 5 was exempt under the ferry charter service exemption. The WUTC disagreed and explained that Proposal 5 was not a true charter service because it would not transport cohesive groups for a single agreed-upon purpose; rather, it would simply be customers of Stehekin businesses aggregated through a third-party booking agency, thus maintaining the public character of the previous proposals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b618 The WUTC issued a declaratory order that stated the Courtneys must first obtain a PCN certificate before operating any of their five proposed ferry services. The Courtneys sought judicial review of the declaratory order in Chelan County Superior Court. That court affirmed the agency's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b619 The Courtneys appealed to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   A. REVIEW OF AN AGENCY ORDER IN GENERAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b620 Our limited review of an agency order is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), chapter 34.05 RCW.\n   <em>\n    Campbell v. Emp't Sec. Dep't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4242148\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/180/566/#p571\">\n    180 Wash.2d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 571,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=326%20P.3d%20713\">\n    326 P.3d 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). We sit in the\n   same position as the superior court and apply the APA standards directly to the administrative record.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=326%20P.3d%20713\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the decision we review is that of the agency, not of the superior court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=326%20P.3d%20713\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b621 RCW 34.05.570(3) sets forth nine bases by which a court may grant relief from an agency order in an adjudicative proceeding. The Courtneys seek review on two bases. The Courtneys claim that the WUTC's order (1) erroneously interpreted or applied the law\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) is arbitrary or capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 34.05.570(3)(d), (i). For both claims, the Courtneys have the burden of proof. RCW 34.05.570(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   B. THE WUTC DID NOT ERR IN DEFINING \" FOR THE PUBLIC USE \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    \"For the public use\" is ambiguous; it can mean the general public or a subset of the public\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b622 RCW 81.84.010(1) provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   A commercial ferry may not operate any vessel or ferry\n   <em>\n    for the public use\n   </em>\n   for hire between fixed termini or over a regular route upon the waters within this state ... without first applying for and obtaining from the commission a certificate declaring that public convenience and necessity require such operation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b623 The WUTC interpreted \"for the public use\" as meaning \"accessible to all persons\n   <em>\n    that are part of a group with common interests\n   </em>\n   .\" CP at 433 (emphasis added). This interpretation allows \"for the public use\" to apply to a subset of the public. For example, it would apply to a subset of the public who wish to patronize one business in Stehekin or a group of businesses in Stehekin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b624 The Courtneys argue that the WUTC's construction is too broad and should not include subsets of the public. They argue that their proposed ferry services are not \"for the public use\" because their ferry services would not be accessible to the general public but instead would be limited to those who wish to patronize one Stehekin business or a group of Stehekin businesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b625 We must determine whether the legislature intended \"for the public use\" to apply to a subset of the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b626 To begin our analysis, we first recite general rules of statutory interpretation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   When interpreting a statute, the court's fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the legislature's intent. We begin with the plain meaning of the statute. In doing so, we consider the text of the provision in question, the context of the statute in which the provision is found, related provisions, amendments to the provision, and the statutory scheme as a whole. If the meaning of the statute is plain on its face, then we must give effect to that meaning as an expression of legislative intent. If, after this inquiry, the statute remains ambiguous or unclear, it is appropriate to resort to aids of construction and legislative history.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Lenander v.

[ RCW 81.84.020 ] More importantly, the Commission may not grant a certificate to operate in an area already served by an existing certificate holder, unless the existing certificate holder has failed or refused to furnish reasonable and adequate service, or the existing certificate holder does not object.

At first blush, their argument is persuasive. How could Proposal 1 or Proposal 2 impact the viability of the current PCN certificate holder and thus the public?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b641 In the context of commercial ferries, an operator must make a sizeable capital investment to purchase a ferry. Also, the daily variable costs of ferry service requires a large stream of revenue sufficient to cover both daily expenses and to provide a reasonable rate of return on the initial capital investment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b642 The Courtneys' proposed vessel is a 50- to 64-foot, climate-controlled boat that would provide service between Memorial Day and early October of each year.

The Courtneys contend that WAC 480-30-011(6),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (8),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (9)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   provide exemptions from the PCN certificate requirement to surface transportation companies that are analogous to one or more of their five proposed ferry services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b647 First, we fail to see the similarity between the noted surface transportation exemptions and any of the Courtneys' proposed commercial ferry services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b648 Second, the statutory treatment of surface transportation companies is different from the statutory treatment of commercial ferries. The different treatment no doubt is due to the differences between the two types of commercial carriers. For instance, taxis and buses are ubiquitous, and ferries are not. If a taxi service in a city suddenly ceases operation, residents will have numerous alternatives to travel. But if the Lake Chelan Boat Company suddenly ceases operation, Stehekin residents would be hard-pressed to leave and return to Stehekin. This leads to the conclusion that surface transportation companies and commercial ferry operators are sufficiently different that the WUTC is not treating similar commercial carriers differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b649 Third, the WUTC did consider the facts and circumstances when declining to apply the surface transportation exemptions to commercial ferry operators. The WUTC noted that hotel buses are expressly exempt by statute, that airline crew transportation between airports and hotels is simply a variation of hotel buses, and that private carriers that transport people incidental to an established business do not fit within the definition of an \"auto transportation company.\" This is because under RCW 81.68.010(3), transporting passengers incidental to an established business is not a transport business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b650 The Courtneys argue that the WUTC \"could have\" exempted their proposed services. However, in making this argument, they ignore the highly deferential standard of our review. In summary, we conclude that the WUTC did not act arbitrarily or capriciously by refusing to apply surface transportation exemptions to commercial ferry operators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The WUTC did not err by refusing to treat Proposal 5 as a private charter service\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b651 The Courtneys next argue that the WUTC arbitrarily or capriciously ignored its own regulation and did not treat Proposal 5 as an exempt charter service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b652 WAC 480-51-020(14) exempts \"charter service\" from the PCN certificate requirements of RCW 81.84.010(1).

The authorization expired in 2001. LAWS OF 1995, ch. 361, \u00a7 4. The WUTC neglected to remove the expired exemption from its rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b653 The WUTC, recognizing the lack of a statutory basis for the exemption, nevertheless analyzed whether Proposal 5 would be a private charter service. The WUTC concluded that it would not. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b654 A true charter does not operate within the meaning of RCW 81.84.010(1) because it represents a one-time private use between a chartering party and an operator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cushing v.
