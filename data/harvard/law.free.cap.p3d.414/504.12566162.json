The district court dismissed Torgerson's complaint as untimely under the 60-day statute of limitations in the Probate Code that applies to \"claims\" filed against an estate. Torgerson appeals, arguing that his complaint was not subject to that particular statute of limitations, and therefore not untimely. We agree with Torgerson that his complaint for declaratory relief was not untimely under the Probate Code, and we reject the Estate's alternative argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate Torgerson's complaint. Accordingly, we reverse the district court's order of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 A landowner, Bret Kouns (Decedent), died on June 10, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Soon thereafter, his sister was appointed personal representative of the Estate, and initiated probate proceedings (the probate action) in district court to manage and distribute his property. On October 7, 2015, Torgerson filed a \"creditor's claim\" with the Estate in which he maintained that he was party to a \"written lease\" between Decedent and himself that he claimed gave him the right to lease the Property\n   through 2017. The Estate determined that Torgerson's putative lease was not legitimate and denied Torgerson's claim on October 9, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 On March 10, 2016, the Estate filed a petition in the probate action asking the court to authorize its representatives to lease the Property to someone other than Torgerson. The Estate served a copy of this petition on Torgerson by regular mail to his last known address. Torgerson did not respond to the Estate's petition. Instead, on March 24, 2016 he filed a separate \"Complaint for Declaratory Relief\" in a new action, seeking a judicial declaration that he had the right to lease the Property pursuant to his putative lease. Torgerson's new declaratory judgment action and the Estate's probate action were filed in the same court and were assigned to the same judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 A few weeks later, noting that Torgerson had not yet responded to its petition in the probate action, the Estate filed a request to submit the petition for decision. Shortly thereafter, the Estate also filed a motion to dismiss Torgerson's separate declaratory judgment complaint. Later, after oral argument, the district court granted the Estate's probate petition, allowing the Estate to take possession of the Property and lease it to someone other than Torgerson. Subsequently, Torgerson moved for relief from the district court's order in the probate action. The court scheduled a hearing for July 11, 2016, at which time it would entertain oral argument on both Torgerson's motion for relief in the probate action and the Estate's motion to dismiss Torgerson's separate declaratory judgment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Following the July 11, 2016 oral argument, the district court issued a combined order containing its rulings in both cases. In that order, the district court declined to alter its previous decision to grant the Estate's petition in the probate action, and also granted the Estate's motion to dismiss Torgerson's declaratory judgment complaint. In dismissing Torgerson's separate complaint, the court relied entirely on a provision of the Utah Probate Code that states, in relevant part, that \"if a claim [against a decedent's estate] is presented ... no proceeding thereon may be commenced more than 60 days after the personal representative [of the estate] has mailed a notice of disallowance....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2075-3-804\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 75-3-804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (LexisNexis 1993). Concluding that Torgerson's claim to have a right to lease the Property was a \"claim against the estate,\" and noting that Torgerson did not commence his declaratory judgment action within sixty days of the Estate's October 9, 2015 denial of Torgerson's initial request, the district court determined that Torgerson's declaratory judgment action was untimely filed and accordingly dismissed it. Torgerson timely appeals the dismissal of his declaratory judgment complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 On appeal, Torgerson contends that the district court erred in determining that his complaint for declaratory relief was untimely. Specifically, Torgerson argues that his complaint for declaratory relief does not present a \"claim,\" as that term is used in the Probate Code's 60-day statute of limitations, and therefore his complaint is not subject to that limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 \"The propriety of a trial court's decision to grant or deny a motion to dismiss under rule 12(b)(6) is a question of law that we review for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    Cruz v.

Because Torgerson's complaint for declaratory relief requested that the Estate specifically perform under the terms of a putative lease for real property, Torgerson argues that his complaint presented a \"claim for specific performance\" and was thus not subject to the Probate Code's short statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sharp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10472402\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/537/1034/\">\n    537 P.2d at 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a petition for an estate to perform under a putative contract to convey real estate was \"a petition for specific performance\").

In support of this argument, the Estate relies on a separate section of the Probate Code that defines a probate court's power and states that a probate court \"has jurisdiction over all subject matter relating to\" estates of decedents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2075-1-302\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 75-1-302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a) (LexisNexis 1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b611 We disagree with the Estate's position, primarily because the statute the Estate relies upon does not indicate that the probate court has\n   <em>\n    exclusive\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over probate-related matters.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2075-1-302\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the absence of specific statutory authority so providing, a grant of jurisdiction over a particular class of cases does not usually amount to a grant of\n   <em>\n    exclusive\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over those cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mueller v.

The legislature made no clear and unequivocal declaration of exclusive jurisdiction\n   here. Instead, the legislature has given the district court (acting as the probate court) jurisdiction over all subject matter relating to Decedent's estate,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2075-1-302\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 75-1-302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a), and has also given the district court \"original jurisdiction in all matters civil and criminal,\" a jurisdictional grant which includes cases based on contracts, leases, and real property,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78A-5-102(1) (LexisNexis 2012). The former grant of jurisdiction does not abrogate the latter. Accordingly, the district court had jurisdiction to consider both the Estate's probate action and Torgerson's separately-filed declaratory judgment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b612 We therefore reverse the district court's order dismissing the separate complaint for declaratory relief. The district court had jurisdiction over the matter, and the complaint was not untimely under the Probate Code.

App. P. 37(a) (setting forth the parties' \"duty\" on appeal to \"inform the court\" in the event that all or part of an appeal has been rendered moot). Accordingly, we are not asked to consider whether Torgerson's complaint for declaratory relief has been rendered moot by either the completion of the probate action or the apparent expiration of his putative lease. We are also not asked to address the potential applicability of res judicata or collateral estoppel, doctrines that may arguably apply here given this court's summary affirmance of the district court's order disposing of the petition in the probate case. Because the parties have not raised or briefed these issues, however, we leave determination of these and other issues to the district court, upon motion, after remand.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
