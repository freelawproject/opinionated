We reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Absent a consideration of whether the minor child's mother was fit, did the District Court err in awarding visitation, pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-228, MCA, to the child's paternal grandparents over mother's objection?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Kristy Brockway (Mother) and Austin Schwarz (Father) are L.R.S.'s parents. Mother and Father divorced when L.R.S. was a baby, and as part of their dissolution proceeding stipulated to a fifty-fifty parenting schedule. After the parties separated, Father lived with his parents, Vicki and Quentin Schwarz (Grandparents), and, accordingly, L.R.S. also lived with Grandparents during\n   Father's parenting time. Father's brother, Tristan Schwarz, lived with Grandparents as well.\n   Both Father and Tristan struggled with chemical dependency and addiction issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 When Father's dependency problems came to light, Mother and Grandparents became concerned with Father's ability to parent L.R.S. Eventually, Father began an out-of-state inpatient treatment program and the District Court ordered that any contact between Father and L.R.S. needed to be approved by L.R.S.'s counselor. Grandparents remained close with L.R.S. and worked with Mother to facilitate visitation. The parties' relationship became strained, however. Mother did not want Tristan around L.R.S. and further requested that Grandparents not discuss Father with L.R.S. Instead, she requested that Grandparents redirect any of L.R.S.'s questions about Father back to her. Mother observed that her instructions were not being followed, as L.R.S. had contact with Tristan and Grandparents discussed Father with L.R.S. Thus, Mother was no longer comfortable with L.R.S.'s contact with Grandparents and stopped allowing visitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Grandparents subsequently filed a petition in District Court, seeking visitation with L.R.S. After a hearing, the District Court issued an order awarding Grandparents visitation pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-228(3), MCA, finding that visitation with Grandparents was in L.R.S.'s best interests as analyzed under \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA. Mother appeals that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 We review a district court's interpretation and application of statutes for correctness.\n   <em>\n    Polasek v.

She contends that the District Court misapplied Montana law by failing to determine her fitness as a parent before granting Grandparents visitation. Grandparents respond, arguing that the District Court did not have to determine whether Mother was a fit parent because they stipulated to the fact that she was. Thus, they contend that the District Court acted appropriately in granting them grandparent visitation with L.R.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 Natural parents have \"a fundamental constitutional right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\"\n   <em>\n    Polasek\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 14-15 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Troxel v.

Given parents' constitutional rights to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children, courts must follow specific statutory guidelines when granting a nonparent's visitation request over a parent's objection.\n   <em>\n    Snyder v.

On one hand, a \"nonparent\" may seek visitation with a child under \u00a7 40-4-228, MCA. On the other hand, and more specifically, a \"grandparent\" may seek visitation with a child under \u00a7 40-9-102, MCA. Under the rules of statutory interpretation as set forth in \u00a7 1-2-102, MCA, courts must apply the more specific provision, \u00a7 40-9-102, MCA, to a grandparent's visitation request. Accordingly, the District Court erred when it applied \u00a7 40-4-228, MCA, to grant Grandparents' visitation request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 Further, the District Court's order failed to give Mother's constitutional right as L.R.S.'s parent proper credence. Normal parenting plan standards do not apply to a grandparent's request for contact with his or her grandchild.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 10, 17-18. When a grandparent petitions for visitation over a parent's objection, a court must first \"make a determination as to whether the objecting parent is a fit parent.\" Section 40-9-102(2), MCA ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Polasek\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15. Fitness is \"determined on the basis of whether the parent adequately cares for the parent's child.\" Section 40-9-102(2), MCA. If a fit parent objects to grandparent contact, the court can grant contact only if it finds, \"based upon clear and convincing evidence, that the contact with the grandparent would be in the best interest of the child and that the presumption in favor of the parent's wishes has been rebutted.\" Section 40-9-102(4), MCA ; accord\n   <em>\n    Polasek\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15 ;\n   <em>\n    In re C.A.G.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b611 Grandparents argue that they stipulated to Mother's fitness by not disputing that she was a fit parent, and therefore the District Court's order is sufficient. However, the record does not contain specific evidence of any such stipulation by Grandparents as to Mother's fitness; not disputing Mother's fitness is not the same as\n   stipulating to her fitness. Even if the parties did stipulate that Mother was a fit parent, the District Court did not contemplate Mother's fitness in granting Grandparent's visitation request, which is required by \u00a7 40-9-102(2), MCA. Furthermore, the District Court still needed to follow the guidelines in \u00a7 40-9-102(4), MCA, for granting grandparent visitation. Accordingly, the District Court could only grant Grandparents visitation with L.R.S. upon finding, based on clear and convincing evidence, that contact with Grandparents was in L.R.S.'s best interests and that the presumption in favor of Mother's wishes was rebutted. See \u00a7 40-9-102(4), MCA. The District Court's findings, citing \u00a7 40-4-228(3), MCA, and applying \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA, best interest factors, are not sufficient. The District Court erred in failing to apply the correct statute and in failing to appropriately protect Mother's constitutional right to parent L.R.S. We therefore reverse and remand this case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b612 When considering whether grandparents are entitled to visitation over a parent's objection, courts must apply \u00a7 40-9-102, MCA. The District Court erred in applying \u00a7 40-4-228, MCA, to this case involving grandparent visitation, where \u00a7 40-9-102, MCA, is the controlling statute. When determining whether to order grandparent visitation, the court must \"make a determination as to whether the objecting parent is a fit parent\" based on \"whether the parent adequately cares for the\" child. Section 40-9-102(2), MCA. Then, visitation may only be granted over a fit parent's objection if the court finds that \"contact with the grandparent would be in the best interest of the child and that the presumption in favor of the parent's wishes has been rebutted.\" Section 40-9-102(4), MCA. In this case, the District Court awarded Grandparents visitation without determining whether Mother was a fit parent and, assuming fitness, without rebutting a presumption in favor of her wishes. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We Concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   MIKE McGRATH, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   DIRK M.

The District Court noted \"both sides in this matter desire a set schedule, should the Court determine that visitation is in the best interests of L.R.S.\" Based on the parties' positions at the hearing and the District Court's Order on Parenting Plan thereafter, the District Court impliedly found Mother to be fit. The District Court then set forth several considerations in concluding visitation with Grandparents was\n   in L.R.S.'s best interests. While the District Court may very well have reached the same conclusion with regard to grandparent-grandchild contact that it did, the District Court erred in not articulating how the specific standard set forth in \u00a7 40-9-102(4), MCA, for granting grandparent-grandchild contact was met. As such, I agree it is appropriate to reverse and remand for specific consideration under \u00a7 40-9-102, MCA.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
