Specifically, we are asked to determine whether that term is broad enough to include any delivery-whether by public or private courier service-that provides proof of mailing and receipt, or whether that term is intended to include only items sent as certified mail through the United States Postal Service. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the narrower interpretation is the correct one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 In this case, the implications of that conclusion are as follows: the Occupational Safety and Health Division of the Utah Labor Commission (the State) did not give John Kuhni &amp; Sons, Inc. (Kuhni) proper statutory notice of the State's citation and proposed assessment for Kuhni's alleged violation of various safety regulations, and therefore Kuhni's efforts to contest the State's citation are not untimely. Accordingly, we set aside the Labor Commission's order declaring untimely Kuhni's efforts to contest the citation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 On February 22, 2016, the State issued a Citation and Notification of Penalty (the Citation) against Kuhni, setting forth its belief that Kuhni had violated various safety regulations. On February 23, 2016, the State sent a copy of the Citation to Kuhni by FedEx, with return receipt requested. There is no dispute that FedEx successfully delivered the Citation to Kuhni; indeed, one of Kuhni's employees signed a receipt acknowledging delivery of the Citation on February 25, 2016, at 11:54 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Under a bolded heading in all capital letters entitled \"The Right to Contest This Citation,\" the Citation contained language informing Kuhni that the Citation could be contested \"within 30 calendar days of receipt of this Citation.\" The Citation also contained an underlined reiteration informing Kuhni that the Citation would become a final order of the Utah Labor Commission if not contested within thirty calendar days of its receipt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The State purported to deliver the Citation pursuant to section 303 of the Utah Occupational Safety and Health Act, which states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1)(a) If the [State] issues a citation ... it shall within a reasonable time after inspection or investigation, notify the employer by certified mail ... that the employer has 30 days to notify the Division of Adjudication that the employer intends to contest the citation ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (b) If, within 30 days from the receipt of the notice ..., the employer fails to notify the Division of Adjudication that the employer intends to contest the citation ..., the citation ... is final and not subject to review by any court or agency.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 34A-6-303(1)(a)-(b) (LexisNexis 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b66 Despite accepting delivery of the Citation on February 25, 2016, Kuhni did not notify the Division of Adjudication (the Division) until June 6, 2016 that it intended to contest the Citation. In response, the State asked the Division to dismiss Kuhni's objection, arguing that the objection was untimely because Kuhni had failed to file it within thirty days of receiving notice of the Citation. Kuhni opposed the State's motion, arguing that the thirty-day clock never started ticking because the State sent the Citation via FedEx rather than by \"certified mail\" through the United States Postal Service. Kuhni asserted that the governing statute, Utah Code section 34A-6-303(1), required that the notice be sent through the United States Postal Service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b67 The Division disagreed, concluding that service through FedEx was sufficient to comply with the statute, and therefore dismissed Kuhni's objection as untimely. Kuhni subsequently appealed the Division's determination to the Appeals Board of the Utah Labor Commission (the Appeals Board), advancing the same arguments. The Appeals Board affirmed the Division's conclusions. Kuhni now seeks review in this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b68 Kuhni contends that the State did not provide it with notice sufficient to trigger the thirty-day statute of limitations set forth in the Utah Occupational Safety and Health Act,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Utah Code section 34A-6-303(1), because the State sent the Citation through FedEx and not through the \"certified mail\" service offered by the United States Postal Service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We review an administrative agency's interpretation of a statute for correctness.\n   <em>\n    Hughes Gen.

While Kuhni's argument is perhaps fairly classified as a technical one, it is not wrong. We are persuaded that Kuhni is correctly interpreting the relevant statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b610 That statute requires, through the use of mandatory language, that the State \"\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   ... notify the employer by certified mail\" of any assessment against it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 34A-6-303(1)(a) (emphasis added).

Kuhni argues that the State does not comply with this mandate when it sends a notice by FedEx, a delivery service that Kuhni maintains is not equivalent to \"certified mail.\" Kuhni asserts that \"certified mail,\" as used in the relevant statute, refers to a specific service offered by the United States Postal Service. Kuhni argues that,\n   because the State did not send Kuhni notice via certified mail, the thirty-day statute of limitations for filing an objection never began to run, and therefore its objection was not untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b611 The State disagrees, and asserts that it met the requirements of the statutory mandate when it sent the Citation to Kuhni via FedEx, because FedEx is a delivery service that provides proof of mailing and receipt. The State asserts that the statutory command is fulfilled if the mailing was sent through any delivery service-public or private-that offers the same basic features as certified mail, such as proof of mailing and receipt. The State maintains that the thirty-day statute of limitations began to run on February 25, 2016, when Kuhni received the Citation through FedEx, and that its objection, filed in June 2016, was too late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b612 In order to determine which party has the better of this argument, we must explore the definition of the statutory term \"certified mail.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 34A-6-303(1)(a). If the relevant statute contained a specific definition of \"certified mail,\" we would be obligated to apply that definition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Hearon v.

The term \"mail\" is itself defined in that same dictionary as \"[o]ne or more items that have been properly addressed, stamped with postage, and deposited for delivery in\n   <em>\n    the postal system\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6945766\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/322/719/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Whatever else FedEx might be, we agree with Kuhni that it is not a part of \"the postal system,\" and that Black's Law Dictionary provides a definition of \"certified mail\" that appears to exclude private delivery services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b614 Other dictionaries provide similar definitions, defining \"certified mail\" as a subset of the mail delivered by a government's official postal system.\n   <em>\n    See Certified Mail\n   </em>\n   , Cambridge Dictionary, https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/certified-mail [https://perma.cc/L4JW-N874];\n   <em>\n    Mail\n   </em>\n   , Cambridge Dictionary https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/mail [https://perma.cc/W6ZT-K923] (defining \"certified mail\" as \"mail for which proof of delivery is obtained\" and \"mail\" as \"the letters and packages that are transported and delivered to your home or the place you work,\n   <em>\n    esp[ecially] those delivered by the government's system\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also Certified Mail\n   </em>\n   , Collins English Dictionary, https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/certified-mail [https://perma.cc/Y8HJ-7LXC];\n   <em>\n    Mail\n   </em>\n   , Collins English Dictionary, https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/mail [https://perma.cc/78RD-ZWKD] (defining \"certified mail\" as \"\n   <em>\n    a postal service\n   </em>\n   for recording the mailing and delivery of a piece of first-class mail\" and \"mail\" as \"\n   <em>\n    the public service or system\n   </em>\n   by which letters and parcels are collected and delivered\") (emphasis added). Thus, applicable dictionary definitions of \"certified mail,\" whether specialized legal dictionaries or more general English dictionaries, do not appear to be broad enough to include within them private delivery services like FedEx.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b615 When the applicable statute contains no definition of a relevant term, we may look to case law to see if courts have provided a definition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In that case, OSHA notified an employer of a citation by hand-delivering the notice of the citation, and the employer moved to dismiss the citation because the notification was not delivered \"by certified mail.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20659\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Noting that \"important public rights are at stake\" in an agency action and that \"personal service is generally recognized as a superior form of process\" to service by mail anyway, the commission held that \"if an employer receives actual notice of a citation, it is immaterial to the exercise of the [c]ommission's jurisdiction that the manner in which the citation was sent was not technically perfect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

Because the goal of \"protecting Utahns from unsafe work places\" implicates important public rights, the State argues we should adopt the reasoning employed by the federal agency in\n   <em>\n    General Dynamics\n   </em>\n   and determine that, because Kuhni received actual notice of the Citation, any defect in that service was immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620 We find the State's argument to be unpersuasive. As noted, the legislature has plainly directed the State to send notice by certified mail, and we do not view it as our role to relieve the State of its burden to comply with that statutory mandate merely because the State's policy goals may be deemed admirable.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Olsen v.

Due to our resolution of Kuhni's main argument-specifically, our conclusion that Kuhni's objection to the Citation was not untimely-we need not consider either of these alternative arguments. Moreover, the second of these alternative arguments is rendered moot for a separate reason: Kuhni received\n    <em>\n     actual\n    </em>\n    notice when FedEx delivered the physical Citation to Kuhni and a representative of Kuhni signed for it. Accordingly, we need not consider whether the State's e-mail, standing alone, would have provided Kuhni with adequate notice of the Citation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    As we note later,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 17 &amp; notes 3-4, our legislature has used the phrase \"certified mail\" many times, and in a wide variety of statutes. Yet only once, to our knowledge-in the Self-Service Storage Facilities statute,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2038-8-1\">\n     Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 38-8-1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1) (LexisNexis Supp. 2017)-has our legislature attempted to define the term. In all other statutes, including the statute at issue here, our legislature has not attempted to define \"certified mail.\" The Self-Service Storage Facilities statute defines \"certified mail\" as postal-service certified mail\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n    as \"a method of mailing that is accompanied by a certificate of mailing executed by the individual who caused the notice to be mailed.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2038-8-1\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 38-8-1(1)(b). This definition includes no requirement for any proof of receipt. In this case, the State does not argue that the definition of \"certified mail\" from the Self-Service Storage Facilities statute should be applied here generally, and certainly makes no specific argument that its delivery by FedEx complied with that definition as a factual matter (e.g., that the FedEx delivery contained a \"certificate of mailing executed by the individual who caused the notice to be mailed\"). Thus, no party gives us any reason to suppose that the legislature intended the statute at issue here \"to be read by reference to\" the definition of \"certified mail\" found in the Self-Service Storage Facilities statute.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     I.M.L. v.
