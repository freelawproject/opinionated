Arechaga was present at that meeting but did not receive written notice of the School District's decision until June 7. Arechaga applied for a writ of mandamus in the Twenty-First Judicial District Court, arguing that because she did not receive the written notice by June 1, the School District was statutorily obligated to renew her contract for the ensuing school year. The District Court denied her application. We reverse and remand for issuance of the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 Arechaga worked as a social studies teacher for the School District from 2014 to 2017. As a non-tenured teacher, Arechaga was subject to the School District's annual decision to renew or not renew her contract. The School District had renewed her employment contract for both the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 school years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 When the School District hired Arechaga in 2014, she lived on Foothills Drive in Missoula. In March 2016, Arechaga moved. She did not notify the School District of her new address. The School District rarely communicated with Arechaga by mail, and it had no policy-in\n   its faculty handbook or otherwise-obligating teachers to inform it of any change to their mailing addresses. The School District typically communicated with Arechaga in person, by telephone, or by e-mail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 Arechaga went on maternity leave on March 31, 2017, through the end of the school year. On May 16, while Arechaga was present at the school to sign up for health insurance, the School District hand-delivered her written notice that the Board was going to discuss her contract at a meeting on May 23. At the meeting-with Arechaga present-the Board voted to not renew Arechaga's contract for the 2017-2018 school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 The next day, the School District drafted a letter to Arechaga notifying her that her employment contract for the ensuing school year had not been renewed. The School District sent this letter via certified U.S. mail to the address it had on file-Arechaga's outdated Foothills Drive address. Arechaga never received the letter; it was returned to the School District as \"unclaimed\" on June 18. Arechaga did not receive written notice of the School District's decision until June 7, when the School District Clerk hand-delivered her a copy while she was present at the school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b66 Arechaga and the Victor Federation of Teachers Local 3494 (Federation)-the collective bargaining unit representing her-filed an application for a writ of mandamus in the District Court. Arechaga and the Federation asserted that because Arechaga had not received the School District's written notice by June 1, the School District was statutorily obligated to renew her contract for the 2017-2018 school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b67 The court held a show cause hearing at which Arechaga testified. Arechaga asserted that she did not \"in any way attempt to avoid receiving the written notice\" and that, given the School District's history of communicating with her in person, by telephone, and by e-mail, it \"didn't even occur\" to her to notify the School District of her updated mailing address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b68 After the hearing, the District Court denied the application. The court agreed with Arechaga that under \u00a7 20-4-206(1), MCA -\n   which obligates a school district to \"provide\" written notice by June 1 of its decision to not renew a teaching contract for the ensuing school year-written notice becomes effective only upon receipt by the teacher. But the court noted that \"constructive receipt and notice are chargeable to one who willfully avoids or frustrates written notice.\" The court found as a matter of fact that Arechaga \"did not take active steps, per se, to avoid notice.\" It concluded nonetheless that \"her\n   neglect and lack of diligence in maintaining a current address on file with the school district were the sole cause of her failure to receive timely notice of the non-renewal of her contract.\" The court held that this excused the School District's \"mandatory duty to provide her with written notice by June 1, 2017.\" The court concluded that the School District was not obligated to renew Arechaga's employment contract for the 2017-2018 school year. Arechaga appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 A district court's decision to issue or deny a writ of mandamus presents a conclusion of law that we review for correctness.\n   <em>\n    City of Deer Lodge ex rel.

She contends that the District Court misapplied the law in determining that Arechaga's failure to update her mailing address with the School District excused the School District's obligation to ensure that she received timely written notice of its decision. Arechaga contends that a writ of mandamus is appropriate in this case because the School District had a clear legal duty to renew her contract and because she has no other speedy and adequate legal remedy available to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 The School District argues that it complied with the requirements of \u00a7 20-4-206(1), MCA, by mailing written notice on May 24, 2017, to the address that it had on file for Arechaga. It emphasizes that Arechaga had actual notice of the School District's decision prior to June 1 because she attended the May 23 meeting at which the Board\n   voted to not renew her contract. The School District argues that Arechaga's failure to update her address-rather than anything the School District did-frustrated delivery of the written notice. The School District contends that Arechaga has not satisfied the requirements for a writ of mandamus because the action she seeks to compel-the renewal of her teaching contract-is not a \"ministerial act,\" and because the appropriate remedy for her was a declaratory judgment action, rather than a writ of mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 A writ of mandamus compels \"the performance of an act that the law specially enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station.\"\n   <em>\n    Citizens for a Better Flathead v.

The School District cites \u00a7 1-1-217, MCA, which provides, \"Each person who has actual notice of circumstances sufficient to put a prudent person upon inquiry as to a particular fact has constructive notice of the fact itself.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 Without doubt, Arechaga's presence at the May 23, 2017 board meeting gave her actual and constructive notice of the School District's decision to not renew her contract.

Under \u00a7 20-4-206(3), MCA, a school district may, \"[s]ubject to the June 1 notice requirements,\" decline to renew a non-tenured teacher's\n   contract \"with or without cause.\" We have held that non-tenured teachers have no \"legally recognized property right in a new contract\" and that \"[n]owhere in ... the statutes ... is [the teacher] given a right to appeal her non-renewal.\"\n   <em>\n    Roos v.

It thus appears that Arechaga has no adequate remedy under her CBA or the relevant statutes to compel the School District to renew her employment contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b627 The School District's contention that Arechaga's appropriate remedy was a declaratory judgment action is not persuasive. A declaratory judgment action \"simply pronounces the duty to be performed;\" mandamus, in contrast, \"commands performance.\"\n   <em>\n    Gallatin Cnty. v.

A declaratory judgment action is not an \"adequate remedy,\" because it does not \"enforce[ ] the performance of the particular duty\" that Arechaga seeks in her application for a writ of mandamus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jefferson Cnty.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 30 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gallatin Cnty\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525830\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/201/409/#p413\">\n    201 Mont. at 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525830\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/201/409/#p413\">\n    654 P.2d at 1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that, when a party seeks to compel a public body to take an action, a writ of mandamus is \"a more adequate remedy than a declaratory judgment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b628 Arechaga has demonstrated that she is entitled to the School District's performance of a \"clear legal duty\" to renew her contract for the 2017-2018 school year and that there is no other \"speedy and adequate remedy\" available to her apart from a writ of mandamus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Citizens for a Better Flathead\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b629 For the reasons discussed, we conclude that the District Court erred when it held that Arechaga did not satisfy the requirements for mandamus. Finally, we are not convinced by the School District's argument that, if we reverse, \"the method of delivering notice to school employees will be altered throughout Montana as school districts will be required to personally deliver every notice to avoid intentional or neglectful frustration of delivery.\" Nothing in this Opinion forecloses a school district from adopting specific policy language that obligates its employees to keep it apprised of their current addresses and designates the employee's listed address as the agreed location for service of written notices. Such a policy in its faculty handbook would give the School District stronger footing from which to argue willful\n   avoidance or refusal to accept written notice. Fundamentally, we are not at liberty to ignore an explicit statutory directive in order to carry out the School District's intended action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b630 The District Court's denial of Arechaga's application is reversed. The case is remanded for issuance of the requested writ of mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We Concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   MIKE McGRATH, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   LAURIE McKINNON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   INGRID GUSTAFSON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA, J.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
