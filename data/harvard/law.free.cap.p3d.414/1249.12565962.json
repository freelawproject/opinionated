Teton Reservoir was incorporated in May 1906, for the purposes of acquiring, developing, and improving the Bynum Reservoir and to complete one or more diversion canals to take water from the Teton River to the reservoir. Teton Reservoir has acquired four water rights. Teton Reservoir filed a Statement of Claim for each of its four water rights in the current water right adjudication process for the Teton River Basin. However, the only water right claim contested from the Water Court's Order is the claim based on the 1902 Notice of Appropriation (1902 Notice) filed by Donald Bradford (Bradford).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 4 Bradford filed a Notice of Appropriation claiming 3,000 cfs from the Teton River on July 3, 1902. The stated purpose of the 1902 Notice was \"for the purpose of irrigating and reclaiming lands lying in said Teton County.\" The 1902 Notice did not identify a reservoir. Shortly thereafter, Bradford commissioned a survey of the project. Engineer Walter Mathews (Mathews) performed the survey and on November 29, 1902, Mathews filed his survey report. Mathews identified a point of diversion, a reservoir with a 69,500 acre feet capacity, and surveyed over twenty-nine miles of distribution canals. Once Mathews's survey was approved by the Government Land Office (GLO), Bradford acquired the rights of way and tried to obtain funding for the project to develop a canal and reservoir system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 5 By 1906, Bradford was unable to obtain funding to develop the reservoir and canal system and conveyed the 1902 Notice and the rights of way to the Wagnild group. The Wagnild group incorporated Teton Reservoir in May 1906. Teton Reservoir obtained the funding to develop the Bynum reservoir and canal system (Bynum System). Between 1906 and 1909 construction on the Bynum System progressed. In 1907, the original diversion point was completed. In 1909, Teton Reservoir began to pursue a potential Carey Act project to acquire more land for irrigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pursuing the Carey Act project led to\n   internal conflict among Teton Reservoir's shareholders. Teton Reservoir's shareholders were in direct conflict with one another until 1914. Despite the internal conflicts, Teton Reservoir continued to make progress on the Bynum System. In 1910 and 1911, several engineers discovered problems with the design and construction of the dam that required resolving before Teton Reservoir could divert any water. By 1915, Teton Reservoir had relocated the diversion point because the original diversion point was in a poor location on the river, and it had resolved the dam's design problems. The 1962 Teton County Water Resource survey indicated that Strabane Gage Station started diverting floodwaters to the Bynum Reservoir in 1918.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 6 In 1919, GLO Commissioner Tillman inspected the reservoir site and questioned the proposed Carey Act project. The Water Court found that the inspection marked a shift by Teton Reservoir to return to the original plan to develop the Bynum System and abandon the Carey Act project. Teton Reservoir's board officially abandoned the Carey Act project in 1925 by resolution. Due to Tillman's inspection, local irrigators began to promote formation of the Bynum Irrigation District (BID). In 1920, BID was established. The BID commissioned an engineer to evaluate the status of the Bynum System. Engineer S.B. Robbins issued his report on November 10, 1920, providing recommendations to improve the Bynum System so that it could divert and store water to its fullest capacity. However, BID could not finish the Bynum System until it received approval to sell bonds. Between 1920 and 1925, Teton Reservoir maintained the Bynum System. In 1925, BID received approval to sell bonds, bought eighty percent of Teton Reservoir's stock, and began implementing Engineer Robbins' recommendations. By 1927, Teton Reservoir's current point of diversion, intake canal, reservoir, and distribution canals were in place. When completed, the Teton Reservoir's diversion canal capacity was 1,000 cfs and the Bynum Reservoir had a capacity between 85,000 and 90,000 acre feet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 7 During that period, Teton Canal developed limited water storage in the Glendora Reservoir under its 1890 Notice of Appropriation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Teton Co-Op.

Beattie\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 371 (Mont. 11th Judicial Dist., March 28, 1908) (hereinafter\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   decree). The\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   decree adjudicated Teton Canal's predecessors' and Farmers' predecessors' water rights. Teton Reservoir was not a party to the\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   decree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Significantly, Teton Reservoir never sought to reopen the\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   decree to establish its water rights in relation to other appropriators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 9 Historically, Teton Reservoir's water rights have been administered by the water commissioner appointed by the District Court to distribute water under the\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   decree. In 1946, the water commissioner refused to turn water into Teton Reservoir's ditch, and Teton Reservoir passed a resolution instructing the directors to take steps to clarify Teton Reservoir's water rights. However, the Water Court found no evidence\n   indicating that effort had been undertaken. In 1952, the water commissioner again shut off Teton Reservoir's water diversion to provide water to Farmers. Teton Reservoir objected but did not file a formal dissatisfied water user complaint. Teton Reservoir, Farmers, and the water commissioner met with the District Court to discuss the administration of water. In 1953, the District Court directed the water commissioner to continue delivering the total decreed right to Farmers before Teton Reservoir. Teton Reservoir did not dispute the District Court's direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 10 In 2006, for the first time, Teton Reservoir filed formal objections to Teton Canal's water right claims. The objection asserted that the Eureka Reservoir use could not relate back to Teton Canal's 1890 Notice. In 2009, Teton Reservoir filed a Dissatisfied Water User Complaint in District Court because Water Commissioner Leonard\n   Blixrud reduced Teton Reservoir's flow to half the available flow in the Teton River. Teton Reservoir alleged that the water commissioner did not have the authority to administer Teton Reservoir's water rights as they were not part of the\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   decree. Teton Reservoir sought injunctive relief to restrain the water commissioner from interfering with its diversions. On September 21, 2009, the District Court resolved Teton Reservoir's Dissatisfied User Complaint, finding that Teton Reservoir had voluntarily participated in the administration of the\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   decree for nearly forty-seven years and it was judicially estopped from asserting otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 11 Specifically, the District Court determined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [Teton Reservoir] has known since the first appointment of a water commissioner over 47 years ago, that is was not a decreed water user under the\n   <em>\n    Perry v. Beattie\n   </em>\n   decree. [Teton Reservoir] has maintained its position of participating with the decree's administration for the past 47 years. Water reports of [Teton Reservoir's] water usage since 1964 have been filed in these legal proceedings; [Teton Reservoir] has paid the water commissioner since 1964 for its water; and [Teton Reservoir] has benefited from consistent management by a water commissioner of [Teton Reservoir's] water for the past 47 years. ... Lastly, to allow [Teton Reservoir] to change its position would disrupt the orderliness and consistency of water distribution along the Teton River. [Teton Reservoir] is the largest off stream reservoir on the Teton. [Teton Reservoir's] reservoir, Bynum, has a holding capacity of 90,000 acre feet of water. [Teton Reservoir] seeks annually to fill Bynum to capacity. Other storage appropriators such as Farmers' and [Teton Canal] store water and rely on distribution of water during the non-irrigation season as well. To allow an unregulated upstream diversion to [Teton Reservoir's] reservoir would be injurious to these other storage rights and decreed users downstream who have come to rely on the water commissioner's control and regulation of [Teton Reservoir's] water usage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   However, the District Court recognized that \"the significance of prior history and usage set forth in the depositions of Judge McPhillips and Commissioner Bud Olson will be for the Montana Water Court and not this Court to decide\" and \"this Court has no authority to decrease a\n   water right in order to avoid a cessation of in-stream flow.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 12 Beginning on December 10, 2012, the Water Court held a four-day hearing to adjudicate Teton Reservoir's water rights. Bud Olson, who served as the water commissioner from 1962 to 2000, testified that he consistently delivered water to Teton Reservoir even though it was not a part of the\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   decree. Olson treated Farmers and Teton Canal as senior to Teton Reservoir for all water deliveries. Olson further testified that he would limit Teton Reservoir's wintertime\n   diversions based on requests of the Department of Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks (the Department) for instream flow. Olson noted that the request by the Department was one he chose to respect and was not dictated by any decreed water right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 13 Subsequent water commissioners followed Olson's policy of treating Teton Reservoir as junior to those rights in the\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   decree. Leonard Blixrud, a former Farmers officer, board member, and water commissioner followed Olson's policy. Blixrud testified that: (1) Teton Reservoir's water was administered as junior to Farmers and Teton Canal, (2) if Teton Reservoir's 1902 Notice had senior priority it would take everything in the river and effectively \"destroy\" Farmers and seriously impact Teton Canal, and (3) Farmers and Teton Canal shareholders rely on Teton Reservoir's water being administered as a junior right to obtain enough irrigation water to stay in business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 14 Teton Canal shareholder Charles Crane also opposed giving Teton Reservoir's 1902 Notice senior priority. Crane testified that stored water in the Eureka Reservoir allows Teton Canal shareholders to irrigate late into the growing season when its priority is out of date, and that without the stored water in the Eureka Reservoir, Teton Canal would be out of water by July 1st most years. He asserted that changing past practice would have a serious impact on the ability of Teton Canal and its shareholders to meet their financial obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 15 BID president and Teton Reservoir board member Mark DeBruycker testified regarding Bynum Reservoir's volume. DeBruycker stated that Teton Reservoir estimates total available volume each year and limits the annual allotment to fifty percent of the\n   available water. DeBruycker testified a full allotment requires diverting 40,000 acre feet. DeBruycker indicated that Teton Reservoir's practice favors carryover water for the next year rather than increasing the allotment to its shareholders because of the uncertainty of available flow from year to year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 16 The Teton River water commissioner records and Teton Reservoir's table of reservoir levels provide limited historical information on Teton Reservoir's diverted volume to the Bynum Reservoir. However, the 1962 Teton County Water Resources Survey stated that the \"average annual storage is 75,000 acre feet with a drawdown of about 35,000 to 40,000 acre feet of water used during the irrigation season.\" Upon examination of these records along with DeBruycker's testimony, the Water Court found that Teton Reservoir diverted as much water as possible when it was available. The Water Court determined that Teton Reservoir had two goals: (1) provide its shareholders full allotment, and (2) store sufficient carryover water for the following year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 17 John Peebles also testified regarding the flow amount Teton Reservoir diverts during wintertime. John Peebles owns property downstream from Teton Reservoir's point of diversion. He testified that Teton Reservoir often takes the entire flow of the river during its wintertime diversions. The Water Court noted the November 1985 water commissioner's record also indicated that Teton Reservoir was getting the entire flow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 18 After the four-day hearing, the Water Court issued an Order on April 27, 2016. The Water Court concluded: (1) Teton Reservoir is barred by laches from claiming senior priority of its 1902 Notice; (2) Teton Reservoir's 1902 Notice complied with the 1885 Montana Appropriation Act; (3) Teton Reservoir is entitled to a 60,000 acre feet volume limit on its 1902 Notice for the Bynum Reservoir; and (4) Teton Reservoir is not restricted to one-half of the available flow in the Teton River during its wintertime diversions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 19 This Court reviews the Water Court's decisions using the same standards applied to district court decisions.\n   <em>\n    Teton Co-op.

The 1902 Notice claimed 3,000 cfs from the Teton River \"for the purposes of irrigation and reclaiming lands by lying in said Teton County.\" The 1902 Notice identified the intended place of use as Teton County. There was no statutory requirement that the intended place of use description had to include a specific land description. The Water Court found that diverting 3,000 cfs would require irrigating a large area and therefore the description of \"Teton County\" was sufficient. The Water Court correctly determined that the 1902 Notice's intended place of use was sufficient. Further, the statutory requirement for a valid notice of appropriation did not require that an appropriator\n   identify a specific reservoir at the time of filing of a water right.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Water Court correctly determined failure to identify a reservoir in the notice of appropriation did not invalidate Teton Reservoir's 1902 Notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 26 Teton Canal also asserts that Bradford's intent at the time of filing was speculative. The record reflects that when Bradford filed the 1902 Notice he intended to develop a large water diversion and storage system for the purpose of \"irrigating and reclaiming lands in Teton County.\" Upon filing the 1902 Notice, Bradford commissioned a survey by Mathews. Mathews filed his report with the GLO on November 29, 1902. The report and survey provided details for the project Bradford intended to develop. Mathews's report included a survey of a reservoir with a capacity of 69,500 acre feet and twenty-nine miles of distribution canals. Additionally, in 1903, Bradford acquired the rights of way for the Bynum System from the GLO. Bradford's acts and surrounding circumstances at the appropriation show his intent to create a large diversion and reservoir system for the purpose of irrigation in Teton County. The Water Court correctly determined that Bradford showed intent to develop a large diversion and reservoir system under the 1902 Notice and planned to put such water to beneficial use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 27 Finally, Teton Canal argues that the Bynum System was not prosecuted with due diligence under the 1902 Notice. Bradford filed his Notice of Appropriation on July 3, 1902. Between July 3, 1902, and 1906, Bradford commissioned a survey, acquired the rights of way, and tried to obtain funding for the project to develop the Bynum System. In 1906, the 1902 Notice and all of the rights of way were conveyed to Teton Reservoir. From 1906 to 1909, Teton Reservoir progressed with the construction of the Bynum System, including completing the original point of diversion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 28 In 1910 and 1911, engineers discovered problems with the design and construction of the Bynum Reservoir's dam, which required repairs before water could be stored. The Water Court found that Teton Reservoir resolved these issues by 1915. Additionally, in 1915, Teton Reservoir relocated the point of diversion. The Water Court found that the Bynum System was sufficiently developed by 1915 to divert some\n   water, store that water, and deliver it to irrigators. In 1918, Teton Reservoir began diverting floodwaters into the Bynum Reservoir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 29 In 1920, an engineer was hired to assess the current status of the Bynum System. The engineer documented Teton Reservoir's ongoing issues with the headgate, intake canal, and dam. He made recommendations to improve the system. Between 1920 and 1925, Teton Reservoir maintained the Bynum System until it could finish the project. By 1925, BID received approval to sell its bonds and began improving the Bynum System. In 1927, Teton Reservoir's current point of diversion, intake canal, reservoir and distribution canals were completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 30 The record reflects that Teton Reservoir made steady on-going efforts to prosecute the construction and development of the Bynum System. The evidence shows that after filing the 1902 Notice, Teton Reservoir's\n   predecessors continued to develop the Bynum System despite construction and design issues and lawsuits until 1927. Although the evidence shows that the Bynum System was sufficiently developed by 1915 to divert some water, any water delivery \"constitute[d] a fraction of the eventual capacity of the [Teton Reservoir's] system.\" The evidence further shows that after 1915, Teton Reservoir continued to develop and improve the Bynum System until the system was completed in 1927. Upon completion, the Bynum System could divert and store water to its fullest capacity as contemplated by the 1902 Notice. Based on the evidence, we conclude that Teton Reservoir sufficiently prosecuted the construction of the Bynum System with due diligence until its completion in 1927. Thus, Teton Reservoir complied with \u00a7 89-811, RCM (1947) (repealed 1973).

This lack of diligence can be traced to 1936, the year that Teton Canal developed the Eureka Reservoir. Teton Reservoir was aware of Teton Canal's development of the Eureka Reservoir and that the Eureka Reservoir would provide additional water storage not previously available to Teton Canal. Teton Canal began storing water in the Eureka Reservoir in 1937. Teton Reservoir was further aware of Teton Canal's expansions of the Eureka Reservoir in 1947 and 1957. However, at no point, until objections were filed in 2006, did Teton Reservoir contend that Teton Canal's storage right in the Eureka Reservoir was junior to its 1902 Notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 36 Moreover, Teton Reservoir knew its 1902 Notice was not adjudicated in the\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   decree in 1908. Teton Reservoir allowed the\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   decree to control the administration of its water rights despite not being a party to the decree. In 1946 and 1952, Teton Reservoir took issue with the water commissioner's administration of its water right, yet remained silent despite passing an internal resolution\n   to clarify its water rights. Teton Reservoir could have filed a petition to reopen the\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   decree to establish its rights regarding the 1902 Notice but\n   decided against it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Teton Reservoir allowed the\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   decree to control its diversions of water from the Teton River since at least 1940 despite knowing that its water rights were not adjudicated in the\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   decree. Thus, Teton Reservoir failed to diligently assert it had a senior priority water right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 37 For nearly seventy years, Teton Reservoir acquiesced in the water commissioners' administration, knowingly allowing Teton Canal to store water with a junior priority water right. The Water Court correctly concluded that Teton Reservoir's delay in bringing a claim for a senior priority right against Teton Canal constituted an unexplainable delay and was of such character as to render enforcement of its newly asserted right inequitable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 38 The Water Court also determined that enforcing Teton Reservoir's senior priority water right would be prejudicial to Teton Canal. The water commissioners administered water based on the\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   decree for nearly seventy years. Finally, in 2009, Teton Reservoir did challenge the authority of the water commissioner to administer water at its headgate. In the 2009 ruling on Teton Reservoir's Dissatisfied Water User Complaint, the District Court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [S]torage appropriators such as Farmers' and [Teton Canal] store water and rely on distribution of water during the non-irrigation season as well. To allow an unregulated upstream diversion to [Teton Reservoir's] reservoir would be injurious to these other storage rights and decreed users downstream who have come to rely on the water commissioner's control and regulation of [Teton Reservoir's] water usage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Water Court determined that Teton Canal would be injured because it has come to rely on the water commissioner's administration of Teton Reservoir's 1902 Notice as junior to the\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   decreed rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 39 Teton Reservoir argues that the Water Court relied on conclusory statements to find prejudice. However, the record supports that allowing Teton Reservoir to assert its senior priority would be injurious to Teton Canal. Teton Reservoir's reservoir, Bynum, is the largest off-stream reservoir of the Teton River. Teton Reservoir has a maximum holding capacity of 90,000 acre feet. In comparison, Teton Canal's Eureka Reservoir has a maximum holding capacity of 5,500 acre feet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Teton Canal I\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14. The testimony of Blixrud and Crane asserted that allowing Teton Reservoir to have senior priority would deplete the water in the river and compromise Teton Canal's ability to store water it has relied on for the past seventy years. Crane testified it would adversely affect Teton Canal shareholders because water stored in the Eureka Reservoir is instrumental in irrigating their crops late in the irrigation season. If Teton Canal is not able to fill the Eureka Reservoir, Teton Canal shareholders' businesses will be significantly impacted. Teton Canal and other storage appropriators under the\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   decree have come to rely on Teton Reservoir's junior priority status. There was significant evidence for the Water Court to determine that allowing Teton Reservoir to enforce a senior priority would prejudice Teton Canal. It has relied on Teton Reservoir's \"junior priority\" for nearly seventy years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 40 The Water Court correctly concluded that Teton Reservoir is barred by laches from asserting senior priority over Teton Canal for its 1902 Notice water right. Teton Reservoir's 1902 Notice and claim will be administered in the future as junior in priority to Teton Canal's 1936 Eureka storage right.

Nevertheless, the totality of the circumstances supported a 20,000 acre feet volume limit for carryover storage. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 45 The record reflects that Teton Reservoir's diversion amounts varied greatly from year to year and it has relied on carryover storage. The Water Court determined that 40,000 acre feet reflected the full allotment to Teton Reservoir shareholders. BID president DeBruycker testified that Teton Reservoir favored carryover water for next year rather than increasing the allotment to its shareholders. The 1962 Teton County Water Resource survey stated the Bynum Reservoir \"average annual storage is 75,000 acre feet with a drawdown of about 35,000 to 40,000 acre feet of water used during the irrigation season.\" The record further supports that Teton Reservoir diverted as much water as it could but rarely filled the reservoir in one year. The Water Court noted the lack of evidence of the amount Teton Reservoir diverted each year for carryover storage stating, \"the amount of carryover is less clear, but an additional 20,000 AF is a reasonable figure representing a high average of [Teton Reservoir's] historical diversions.\" The Water Court relied on what little information was provided by the water commissioner records and Teton Reservoir's table of reservoir levels. The Water Court further recognized there is no evidence indicating that Teton Reservoir's practices in regard to carryover storage have ever resulted in wasting water. Taken together, the record supports the Water Court's determination that Teton Reservoir historically has diverted and relied on carryover storage in\n   the Bynum Reservoir. The Water Court's assignment of 20,000 acre feet of carryover storage in the Bynum Reservoir was supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 46\n   <em>\n    Issue Four: Whether the Water Court erred in refusing to limit Teton Reservoir's wintertime diversions to one-half of the available water in the Teton River.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 47 On cross-appeal, Farmers also argues that the Water Court erred by not limiting Teton Reservoir to one-half available flow during wintertime diversions. Specifically, Farmers contends the Water Court misapprehended the evidence regarding the water commissioners' historical water management practice. Teton Reservoir argues the Water Court did not err because there\n   was substantial evidence to support that Teton Reservoir's wintertime diversions were not limited to one-half of the available flow. Teton Reservoir maintains that the Water Court did not misapprehend the evidence. The Water Court found that \"the evidence at hearing indicates that Water Commissioners Olson and Blixrud did attempt to limit [Teton Reservoir] winter diversions to half the available flow in the Teton River.\" Despite this evidence, the Water Court determined that this water management tool was not administering any decreed water right or applied in any consistent way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 48 Farmers argues that the District Court's 2009 order on Teton Reservoir's Dissatisfied Water User Complaint should control. In the order, the District Court directed the water commissioner to reduce the amount of water being diverted to Teton Reservoir \"to be consistent with the prior practice of allowing half the river to flow downstream.\" District courts are granted the authority to supervise the distribution of water that has already been adjudicated and to enforce such water decrees.\n   <em>\n    Baker Ditch Co.,\n   </em>\n   251 Mont. at 255, 824 P.2d at 260 ; \u00a7 85-2-406(3), MCA.

Therefore, the District Court's order resolving Teton Reservoir's Dissatisfied Water User Complaint did not alter Teton Reservoir's water right and is not controlling in the adjudication of Teton Reservoir's water right by the Water Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 49 The Water Court determined that limiting Teton Reservoir to one-half of the available water from the Teton River during its wintertime diversion was a practice or tool implemented by the court-appointed water commissioners to manage the water rights on the Teton River. The water commissioners limited Teton Reservoir's diversion because the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks requested that it do so. The\n   Department was not a party under the\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   decree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Teton Reservoir's water right does not contain a provision that restricts its water rights from being enforced in order to avoid a cessation of instream flow. Limiting Teton Reservoir's wintertime diversions to conserve water under the authority of the water commissioners is not based on Teton Reservoir's water right. Thus, the Water Court correctly decreed Teton Reservoir's wintertime diversion based on the 1902 Notice rather than on a practice implemented by the water commissioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 50 The Water Court was free to determine based on the evidence available whether Teton Reservoir's water right historically had been limited to one-half of the available flow. Based on the record, the Water Court determined that Teton Reservoir was not limited to one-half of the available flow and there is no indication in the water commissioner records that such a policy was implemented or applied with consistency. The Water Court gave more weight to the testimony of Peebles and the water commissioner records than the testimony of previous water commissioners stating that such policy was implemented. The Water Court's refusal to limit Teton Reservoir's wintertime diversions to one-half of the available flow based on water commissioners' diversion practices was supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 51 The Water Court's determination that Teton Reservoir's 1902 Notice was validly appropriated under the 1885 Act was correct. The Water Court's determination that Teton Reservoir is barred by the equitable doctrine of laches from claiming senior priority to Teton Canal's water right is also affirmed. With respect to Farmers' cross-appeal, the Water Court did not err in assigning the Bynum Reservoir a 60,000 acre feet volume limit, including 20,000 for carryover storage, and refusing to limit Teton Reservoir's wintertime diversions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 52 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   We Concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   JIM RICE, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   DIRK M.
