DPHHS conducts audits through its Surveillance and Utilization Review Section (\"SURS\"), pursuant to its statutory and regulatory authority. In March of 2008, IMS signed a Montana Medicaid Provider Enrollment Agreement (\"Enrollment Agreement\") to provide incontinence supplies to Montana Medicaid patients in Great Falls and the surrounding area. As part of the Enrollment Agreement, IMS agreed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations pertaining to the Montana Medicaid Program, including: Title XIX of the Social Security Act; the Code of Federal Regulations; the Montana Code Annotated; and the Administrative Rules of Montana. IMS agreed to submit to DPHHS audits as necessary and to repay any payment received under the Medicaid program to which IMS was not entitled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 On April 3, 2013, DPHHS sent a letter requesting IMS's records for the period of\n   January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2012 for purposes of a departmental audit. On January 8, 2014, DPHHS sent a letter to IMS with the results of the audit. The audit concluded that DPHHS overpaid IMS and was entitled to reimbursement in the amount of $670,152. DPHHS identified several technical violations in\n   the supply orders IMS submitted. DPHHS determined that many orders were incorrectly coded or incomplete and missing one or more of the following: supply description, quantity, diagnosis, length of need, or a physician's signature. DPHHS's letter also alerted IMS that it could request an administrative review of the audit findings. IMS requested administrative review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 DPHHS then held an Administrative Review Conference. After the first Conference, IMS obtained counsel, and the parties agreed IMS would be allowed time to gather additional information. On September 30, 2014, a second Administrative Review Conference was held, at which IMS submitted 60 affidavits signed by physicians and other health care providers. The affidavits were intended to demonstrate that the supplies provided to patients whose claims were the subject of the audit were medically necessary, and were intended to cure the defects in the orders identified by DPHHS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 On December 9, 2014, DPHHS issued an Administrative Review Determination affirming its prior decision. Citing Admin. R. M. 37.85.414(1)(a), DPHHS wrote: \"This documentation from physicians attesting to appropriate and medically necessary supplies for the clients of [IMS was] received well beyond the 90 days given to complete a medical record from the date the services were billed to Montana Medicaid.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 IMS requested a fair hearing to contest the Administrative Review overpayment determination. IMS moved for summary judgment, contending that the two-year statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 27-2-211(1), MCA, applied to DPHHS's claim for repayment. Because the audit concerned claims submitted between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2012, IMS contended DPHHS's claims were precluded by the two-year statute of limitations. The Hearing Officer denied IMS's motion for summary judgment. He held that an eight-year statute of limitations applied to the present action because the dispute arose from the contractual relationship between DPHHS and IMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 On June 9, 2015, the Hearing Officer conducted an administrative hearing (\"Fair Hearing\"). Over DPHHS's hearsay objection, the Hearing Officer admitted IMS's affidavits into evidence. A DPHHS employee testified, identifying the issues and incompleteness of each individual affidavit. An IMS employee also testified but did not rebut the incompleteness of the supply orders and subsequent attempts to remedy; no physicians testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 On August 11, 2015, the Hearing Officer issued his Proposed Decision. The Hearing Officer determined that IMS did not meet its regulatory requirements in the supply orders submitted to DPHHS. He\n   found that the physician affidavits failed to cure the deficiencies and had no evidentiary value because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [The affidavits] were provided to physicians (years after the fact) with tables created by [IMS personnel] from invoices (which were not reviewed at the hearing) which allegedly establish the type of incontinence supply which was medically necessary for each patient, the quantity of each incontinence supply which the physician would have ordered back in 2010 through 2012, and the approximate length of time each type of incontinence supply was medically necessary for each patient.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Without a \"crystal ball,\" however, which could be used to look back into time to see what each individual patient actually required, it is impossible to fix the defective physician orders which should have included the required information at the time the incontinence supplies were ordered, and allegedly provided to each patient.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 The Hearing Officer upheld DPHHS's Administrative Review Determination that DPHHS, under its regulations promulgated under the authority of \u00a7\u00a7 53-6-101, -113, MCA, and Title XIX of the Social Security Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201396\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et. seq., was entitled\n   to the full repayment of $670,152, with interest. IMS petitioned for judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 The District Court held oral argument on April 21, 2016, and issued an order on September 19, 2016. The District Court conducted its own review of the affidavits, the testimony given about the affidavits, and the Hearing Officer's Proposed Decision. The District Court held that the Hearing Officer did not err by rejecting the affidavits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 The District Court held that the Hearing Officer incorrectly applied the eight-year statute of limitations for contract actions because DPHHS relied upon its statutory right to repayment rather than the contract between DPHHS and IMS. Thus, the District Court held that the two-year statute of limitations found in \u00a7 27-2-211(1)(a), MCA, applied to DPHHS's overpayment claim. The District Court concluded the cause of action accrued once the ninety-day period passed to submit full supply order details for each order because that was the point at which IMS could not supplement information to the orders, so that is when any technical violations occurred. The District Court concluded that the action was commenced on January 8, 2014, when DPHHS notified IMS of the overpayment by letter. The District Court also denied IMS's request for an award of attorney fees under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act (\"UDJA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614 IMS appeals the District Court's Order upholding the Hearing Officer's Proposed Decision that the physician affidavits did not cure the technical violations, and the denial of attorney fees. DPHHS cross appeals the District Court's holding that the two-year statute of limitations applies to its claim for repayment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 A district court reviews an agency decision under \u00a7 2-4-704, MCA.\n   <em>\n    Hohenlohe v.

R. Civ. P. 3 (\"A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.\"). However, the District Court then concluded that DPHHS's January 8, 2014 letter to IMS commenced the cause of action, even though the letter is inarguably not a complaint within the meaning of either \u00a7 27-2-102, MCA, or M. R. Civ. P. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b632 A review of DPHHS's January 8, 2014 letter and the other correspondence between IMS and DPHHS before and after this letter reinforces the conclusion that DPHHS never commenced an action in this case. On April 3, 2013, DPHHS sent a letter to IMS informing IMS that DPHHS was conducting an audit and requested certain records be sent to DPHHS for review. DPHHS's January 8, 2014 letter informed IMS of the audit results and requested that IMS \"[p]lease remit a check to [DPHHS] for $670,152.00 to be received by our office no later\n   than February 8, 2014.\" In a letter dated June 13, 2014, DPHHS extended the administrative review conference date and noted its willingness to compromise, treating its communications with IMS as if the two were engaged in negotiations prior to filing a lawsuit. The DPHHS lawyer specifically stated: \"I appreciate that a judgment in the amount of the overpayment plus accrued interest might put your client into bankruptcy or force it out of business. But, I am not sure why entering into a repayment agreement would put your client out of business.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b633 The attorneys for IMS then requested an administrative review and Fair Hearing. Pursuant to IMS's request, a Fair Hearing was held, and the Hearing Officer ruled that DPHHS was entitled to the full repayment of\n   $670,152, with interest. IMS then filed an action in District Court, seeking judicial review of the Hearing Officer's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b634 DPHHS never commenced an action because DPHHS never filed a complaint. Montana law is explicit about the requirements of commencing an action. Both M. R. Civ. P. 3 and \u00a7 27-2-102(1)(b), MCA, state that an action is commenced when the complaint is filed. No complaint was filed in this case; thus, no action was commenced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b635 Section 53-6-111(2), MCA, sets forth a provider's liability to DPHHS in the event of an overpayment, and the methods by which DPHHS may seek recovery of the overpayment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (2)(a) The department is entitled to collect from a provider, and a provider is liable to the department for:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (i) the amount of a payment under this part to which the provider was not entitled if the incorrect payment was the result of the provider's error ... or if the provider's interpretation of the pertinent rule or billing code is not reasonable; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (ii) the portion of any interim rate payment that exceeds the rate determined retrospectively by the department for the rate period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (d) The department may collect any amount described in subsection (2)(a) by:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (i) withholding current payments to offset the amount due;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   (ii) applying methods and using a schedule mutually agreeable to the department and the provider; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (iii) any other legal means.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Section 53-6-111(2), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b636 In 2017, the Montana Legislature amended \u00a7 53-6-111, MCA. Effective July 1, 2017, Section 2(3) of Senate Bill 82 establishes a three-year lookback period for Medicaid overpayment audits, stating\n   in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (3)(a) For an initial overpayment audit, the department or an auditor may request up to 6 months of records from a provider for claims paid by the medicaid program up to 3 years before the request was made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (b) If the department or an auditor demonstrates a significant error rate, the department or the auditor with the department's approval may request additional records related to the issue under review for purposes of a followup audit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (c) The 3-year limitation in subsection (3)(a) does not apply to a record request by the department or auditor for purposes of a followup audit but does apply to such a request by a recovery audit contractor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (4) The department or an auditor may not request records or perform an overpayment audit regarding services that were provided outside the period of time for which providers are required by applicable law to retain records for purposes of the medicaid program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   S. 82, 2017 Leg. Reg. Sess. \u00a7 2(3)-(4) (Mont. 2017). With these amendments, the Legislature recognized that the statutes in effect at the time of this dispute did not address time limitations applicable to DPHHS's right to conduct an audit of provider records and to seek return of overpayments. The three-year lookback period established by these amendments remedied this situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b637 The issue of which statute of limitations applied to this dispute was presented to the Hearing Officer and the District Court. Thus, we appreciate that the District Court felt obligated to address and resolve the issue. However, the statute of limitations is relevant to this dispute only to the extent that it might determine whether an action has been timely commenced. In this case, DPHHS has never commenced an action to recover the overpayment; \u00a7 53-6-111(2)(d), MCA, in fact, allows DPHHS to recover an overpayment by methods other than commencement of an action. Determining what, if any, statute of limitations may hypothetically apply to an action DPHHS may hypothetically commence would constitute an advisory opinion. This Court has consistently held that we will not render advisory opinions.\n   <em>\n    Arnone v.
