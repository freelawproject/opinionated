In June 2014, after nearly three years in the guardianship of their grandmother, the children returned to Mother's full-time care. The next month, DFS received a report that Mother and her boyfriend were physically abusing the children and forcing them to stay in a bedroom without food, water, or access to a bathroom. DFS visited Mother's residence and observed severe bruising on two of the children and a paddle on which \"A** Beater\" and the children's names were written. On August 1, 2014, the juvenile court placed the three children in custody of DFS and thereafter adjudicated Mother as having neglected the children. In a separate proceeding in district court, Mother was convicted of felony child abuse and, after failing to meet the conditions of her probation, was incarcerated at the Wyoming Women's Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b64] In March 2016, DFS initiated this case by filing in district court a Petition for Termination of Parental Rights against Mother and the fathers of the children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   DFS personally served the petition and summons on Mother at the Wyoming Women's Center on March 22, 2016. Mother did not file a responsive pleading or otherwise defend the petition within 20 days and, upon DFS's application, the clerk of court entered default against Mother on April 12, 2016. The following week, the district court issued an order setting a default hearing. Copies of the application for entry of default, the entry of default,\n   and the order setting the default hearing were served on Mother by mail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b65] Mother first responded to the termination petition approximately four months after it was personally served on her. In July 2016, Mother mailed letters to the district court and to counsel for DFS asking that the case be put \"on hold\" and that she be provided court-appointed counsel. The district court vacated the default hearing and provided to Mother the paperwork necessary to obtain court-appointed counsel. Shortly thereafter, Mother's court-appointed attorney entered her appearance, filed a response to the termination petition, and filed a motion to set aside the entry of default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b66] The district court held a hearing on the motion to set aside the entry of default. Mother testified that, prior to receiving the termination petition, the juvenile court had changed the permanency plan from reunification to adoption. Mother stated that she assumed the termination petition was part of the juvenile case. Further, she believed (incorrectly) that she was still represented by counsel in that case. Regardless, upon receiving the termination petition in March 2016, Mother did not attempt to contact her former attorney until July 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b67] The district court found that Mother did not present good cause to set aside the entry of default and denied Mother's motion. After a default evidentiary hearing, the district court terminated Mother's parental rights. Mother timely perfected this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b68] \"A district court's determination as to whether good cause exists to set aside an entry of default lies within its sound discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    In re HLL\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800227\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/372/185/\">\n    2016 WY 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800227\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/372/185/\">\n    372 P.3d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 192 (Wyo. 2016) (citing\n   <em>\n    In re ARW\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6885125\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/343/407/\">\n    2015 WY 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6885125\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/343/407/\">\n    343 P.3d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 412 (Wyo. 2015) ). \"We will not disturb that decision unless the district court abused its discretion and was clearly wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6885125\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/343/407/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Judicial discretion is made up of many things, including conclusions drawn from objective criteria.

Second, Mother did not assert a meritorious defense to the substantive allegations that she was unfit to care for the children and returning the children to her care would jeopardize their health and safety-nor could she: Mother had a significant history of substance abuse and continued to use methamphetamine throughout the juvenile neglect case; since August 2011, the children had been in Mother's care for only one month, at which time they were removed from Mother's home and placed in the custody of DFS due to her abuse and neglect; Mother had not completed substance abuse treatment, parenting classes, or counseling, or otherwise addressed the issues that led to DFS taking custody of the children; and Mother remained incarcerated on two counts of felony child abuse and one count of felony sale of a controlled substance, with a scheduled release in 2020. Finally, Mother's failure to respond to the petition for approximately four months constituted culpable conduct that led to her default. As the district court noted, \"[i]gnorance of the law or rules of procedure does not justify relief from an entry of default.\" The record reveals no \"genuine emergency\" that would excuse Mother's neglect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re HLL\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800227\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/372/185/\">\n    2016 WY 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 35, 372 P.3d at 192.
