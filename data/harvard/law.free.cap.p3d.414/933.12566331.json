(Father) appeals the district court's award of sole physical custody of their child (Child) to K.P.S. (Mother), contending the district court failed to provide sufficient findings of fact to support its decision and failed to articulate the reasons for its decision not to follow the recommendation of the Guardian ad Litem (the GAL) that Father be awarded primary physical custody of Child. Father also asks this court to remand for a ruling on the remaining issues that were certified for trial but were not ruled upon. We agree with Father and vacate the district court's award of sole physical custody to Mother and remand for further proceedings on this issue, as well as the issues that the district court failed to address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Mother petitioned for a divorce from Father in 2003, after almost two years of marriage. Shortly thereafter, they stipulated to a mutual restraining order, which prohibited communication between them that did not involve Child, and agreed Mother would have temporary legal and physical custody of Child, who was less than two years old at the time. Mother was also permitted to move to Idaho with Child, where she and Child have resided since 2003. Father, who remained in Salt Lake City, Utah, was awarded parent-time. In 2005, the district court entered a bifurcated decree of divorce, leaving the issues of child custody, child support, spousal support, marital debts, and marital property for further adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Since the divorce, Mother and Father's relationship has been hostile. Testimony at trial demonstrated that parent-time exchanges were often tense. And in 2005 and 2007, Mother accused Father of abusing Child and reported the allegations to the Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS). DCFS initiated investigations into the allegations, which led the court to order supervision during Father's parent-time with Child. In 2011, Father successfully petitioned DCFS to review the abuse allegations against him. Thereafter, DCFS changed its findings from \"supported\" to \"unsupported.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2013, Father petitioned the district court to amend the bifurcated decree of divorce to remove the supervised parent-time provision, but that provision was not removed until after a 2015 mediation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 While in Mother's care, Child became severely depressed, sparking a pattern of self-harming behavior, most of which went unnoticed, including at least one of two suicide attempts. And when Mother was apprised of this behavior, her concern did not rise to the level that would be expected. During one of Child's stays with Father, he believed she was having an allergic reaction of some sort and took her to the emergency room for treatment. Because Child did not respond to treatment, the physician directed a social worker to observe Child to determine whether the reaction was \"anxiety related.\" The social worker asked Child if \"she had ever had thoughts of self-harm,\" and Child disclosed that, when she was ten years old, she had taken a bottle of sleeping pills at Mother's house \"because she just wanted to die.\" Mother did not know that Child had attempted suicide until Father informed her of it. Child also told the social worker that she had attempted suicide a second time at the age of twelve, this time by cutting her wrists with knives from Mother's kitchen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The knives were not sharp enough to cause fatal wounds, but they did physically injure her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 At the time of trial, Child had continued to engage in self-harming behavior while in Mother's care, including using razor blades to cut her forearms and hips. When asked if Child engaged in this type of behavior while in Father's care, Father testified it was very unlikely because when she arrived at his house Child gave him the razor blade and discussed with him what had \"bother[ed] her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 At trial, Mother downplayed Child's first suicide attempt. She testified that the pills Child ingested were merely melatonin and that melatonin is \"a natural herbal sleep aid,\" so \"they don't hurt ya.\" When asked about this again, Mother testified, that she did not know exactly what Child ingested in an attempt to end her life but stated, \"I know that if you take one melatonin pill, it won't harm you. I don't know how many she took.... I don't know if [taking a full bottle] would or would not\" have harmed Child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Father, on the other hand, took the news of Child's attempted suicide seriously and found her an Idaho therapist (Therapist) with an office thirty minutes away from Mother's house. Father testified that, even when Child stayed with him in Salt Lake City, he drove her to therapy appointments in Idaho. Father and Child also filled out a \"suicide prevention\" plan that included the names of people to call if Child had suicidal ideations and identified other steps to take to prevent her from harming herself. Father added that he was concerned that Mother continued to not allow Child to take the medication prescribed to treat her depression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 One incident, dubbed by Mother's attorney as \"the ice cream event,\" received the most attention at trial. Mother testified that, before one of Child's therapy appointments, Mother \"could tell [Child] was just dragging that morning. It was hard to get her up and ready for the [appointment].\" Once there, Child told Therapist that she was having suicidal ideations. Mother testified that, based on this, Therapist \"[v]ery strongly\" recommended that Mother immediately take Child to the nearest emergency room, and Therapist had notified the hospital's psychiatric unit that Child would be arriving shortly. Therapist also contacted Father to alert him to Child's suicidal thoughts. Concerned, Father tried contacting Mother, but after numerous unanswered phone calls, spoke directly to Child, who informed him that, rather than going to the emergency room, Mother was taking her and her half-siblings out to swim and get ice cream.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 On cross-examination, Mother was asked whether she took Child's \"threats and attempts to kill herself seriously.\" Mother responded, \"Of course,\" but also stated she \"made a decision\" not to follow through with Therapist's recommendation to take Child to the emergency room on that particular occasion. While Mother and Therapist talked, Child was having fun with her half-siblings in\n   the waiting room. Mother then clarified that she had still planned to take Child to the emergency room and added, \"But surely [I could] take her to get ice cream first, you know, before [going] to the psychiatric center.\" Mother also testified she could not have taken her two younger children to the emergency room with Child and instead decided to take all of them swimming, because \"it just turned out to be a good day for it\" and \"as a family ... we don't get to do it very much.\" Mother testified that Child appeared \"happy\" and \"overjoyed\" after swimming and eating dinner with the family and told Mother she felt much better.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 Father testified that if Child ever expressed suicidal ideations while staying with him, \"There wouldn't even be a hesitation, she would be back up in the emergency room.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 Child's educational needs were also addressed during trial. Both parties agreed that Child is intelligent and had always been \"very articulate\" and independent. Father testified he had communicated with Child's teachers in Idaho and had been informed that \"they really can't challenge Child. She gets bored.\" Father testified he \"has to put pressure on her to pull her grades back up because she gets bored and doesn't [participate].\" The teachers recommended that Father look into an online school \"while she's in Idaho to challenge her.\" Father described Child's academic and career aspirations and the plan Father had helped her create to realize those goals. Father testified that, if Child lived with him, she would be \"guaranteed a seat\" at a public charter school\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   that offered numerous advanced placement courses in languages, history, English, math, science, and more. The charter-school students also had the opportunity to take courses for college credit at the University of Utah. Based on Child's long-term academic and career goals, Father wanted Child to have the opportunity to prepare for college.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 Mother did not testify that she conversed with Child's teachers about her status as a student. When asked about the courses Child would \"be exposed to\" if she continued to attend school in Idaho, Mother responded, \"Generally just whatever is required by law in the public school system. Um, also I have ... some pamphlets on an accelerated program where she can receive college credits and graduate early.\" But Mother could not identify the courses offered or the requirements of the accelerated programs that would allow Child to graduate early.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b613 Each parent was asked to explain why he or she should be awarded custody of Child. Mother testified she should maintain sole physical custody because she loved Child, has had sole custody of Child for the majority of Child's life, and was concerned Father would not facilitate the statutorily required parent-time with her. Mother did not explain the basis for this concern.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Father testified that he should have primary physical custody because he would help make Child's life better. He wanted to ensure that her mental health stabilizes and that she would be given the opportunity to succeed academically and pursue her goals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b614 The GAL made a detailed oral recommendation to the court. She determined it would be in Child's best interest to award Father primary physical custody. She spent a significant amount of time addressing her concerns about Mother's responses, or lack thereof, to Child's mental health issues and repeatedly stated that it was not in Child's best interest for Mother to maintain sole physical custody. She emphasized her concerns about Mother's pattern of \"minimiz[ing] the seriousness\" of Child's health, suicide attempts, suicidal ideations, and self-\n   harming behavior. She noted that Mother's refusal to allow Child to take prescribed medication and her refusal to take Child to the emergency room after Therapist told her that Child was suicidal not only minimized the seriousness of Child's mental health condition but was also an attempt to distance herself from acknowledging that she contributed to Child's condition. The GAL concluded that Mother's behavior was \"dangerous for [Child].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b615 The GAL also highlighted Mother's initial retort that the bottle of sleeping pills Child took in her first suicide attempt \"was 'only melatonin' and 'couldn't have hurt her,' \" but then later forgot exactly what substance Child took in an attempt to end her life. The GAL also recounted the \"ice cream event\" and discussed her concern that Mother would allow Child, who was thirteen at the time, to dictate whether Mother should follow Therapist's recommendation to go to the emergency room. Child told the GAL that she feels \"ignored and not taken seriously\" by Mother. The GAL noted that, \"concerning the medical issues ... and her depression alone,\" she could \"understand where [Child] doesn't feel that her needs are being taken seriously\" by Mother. The GAL commented that \"sometimes we might all identify as being [a] lazy [parent]. We didn't bathe the kids one night [or] help them pick up their rooms,\" but noted that there is a difference between \"a lazy parent and one who ... minimizes the care their child needs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b616 In contrast, the GAL stated that Father immediately responded to Child's medical needs. The GAL said that Child felt \"she can approach [Father] with anything,\" she feels \"loved and cared for\" by Father, and that they both followed the suicide prevention plan she and Father established for her ideations, which \"gives her a sense of security.\" The GAL recommended that Father be awarded primary physical custody of Child because Father took appropriate actions to address her needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b617 The district court asked the GAL to \"be more specific\" about why the recommendation was in Child's best interest because, as the court explained, \"[W]e don't let children make decisions. They're not capable of making decisions.... We don't do what children want, because it's not in their best interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b618 The GAL responded, \"I agree. We don't let children make decisions ... of this significance,\" and continued, \"But we also don't let children override what a therapist has recommended to a mother so that she could just ... have fun. Which [is what] Mother said.\" The GAL reiterated her concerns about Mother not providing the medical care that Child needed to treat her depression, suicidal ideations, and self-harm. She also reiterated that Father had \"taken steps to address [Child's] issues\" and had done so \"in an appropriate way.\" The GAL stressed that Child needed \"a parent who opens his or her eyes as to how significant these issues are\" and \"who takes the appropriate steps to address these issues.\" In addition, the GAL determined it would be \"very beneficial\" for Child to attend the charter school because Mother, Father, and Therapist recognize she is \"very intelligent for her age.\" For all of those reasons, the GAL concluded it was \"in Child's best interest\" to live with Father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b619 Although the district court acknowledged that \"[i]t is troubling ... that [Mother] has not done more than she has to address [the issues] with [Child],\" the court nevertheless awarded Mother sole physical custody. It ordered her \"to follow through with the recommendations of [Therapist] ... to obtain an evaluation of [Child] and abide[ ] by those recommendations, including, that if medication is prescribed, then medication needs to be given to [Child]. Therapy is to continue and the recommendations given by [Therapist] are to be followed.\" The court later emphasized \"that therapy for [Child] is to continue as long as [Therapist] believes it to be wise and appropriate and that [Mother] is to comply with any treatment or counseling program provided for [Child].\" The court also commented that it \"does not minimize [Mother's] failure to follow through with [the] medical needs of [Child].\" And \"although [Mother] did not take [Child] to the [emergency room], she is still attending consistent and ongoing therapy, which is a minimum standard of care.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b620 In explaining its reason for disregarding the GAL's recommendation, the district court said,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court finds the Guardian ad Litem has done a very wonderful, competent, professional job in providing her recommendation to the Court. However, based on the Court's experience, both in criminal court in dealing with child victims and in this Court with hundreds of domestic actions dealing with minors, the Court is not persuaded that a thirteen (13) year old is capable of having meaningful input to have her expressed interest given much creditability and much weight by this Court. The Legislature has recently changed that age from sixteen (16) to fourteen (14), but thirteen (13) is still not fourteen (14).\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The court did not find that it was in Child's best interest for Father to be awarded primary physical custody because Father was \"strong willed,\" had poor temperament, did not exercise enough parent-time \"over the length of this matter,\" and required supervised parent-time. The district court also stated that it would not consider Child's education as a factor \"unless everything else was equal ... especially in consideration of [Mother's] statement that they do have an advanced placement program in the Idaho schools.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b621 In awarding Mother sole physical custody, the district court determined it \"[was] not going to equalize parent time, due to the distance between households\" and awarded Father only \"minimum statutory parent time\" of \"110 overnights.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b622 Numerous issues were certified for trial, including legal and physical custody, parent-time, a parenting plan, child support, arrears on medical expenses, and reallocation of the custody evaluator's fees. Although most of the testimony focused on custody, the parties provided evidence, either through testimony or exhibits, that related to the parties' respective income, Child's medical expenses, orders by the court to award Father reasonable attorney fees, and allocation of the custody evaluator's fees. The court did not address any of these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b623 Father appeals the district court's order awarding Mother sole physical custody of Child and the court's failure to rule on all issues certified for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b624 First, Father contends the district court \"did not make sufficient findings of fact\" related to the custody issue when it failed to \"disclose the steps by which the ultimate conclusion on each factual issue was reached\" and failed to explain its departure from the GAL's recommendation that Father be awarded primary physical custody of Child.

And \"the basis for the custody award [is not] clear from the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. The court based its custody award, in part,\n   on three factual determinations it made against Father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b631 First, the court found Father did not exercise enough parent-time, but it did not discuss the number of times Father failed to exercise parent-time or explain why the number of times he did exercise parent-time was deficient. The court ignored the many obstacles Father encountered in exercising parent-time. For example, Mother lived three hours away from Father and withheld parent-time on several occasions. The court also appears to have ignored the significant efforts Father made. For example, Father not only paid for gas and hotel rooms for his parent-time in Idaho but also paid for Mother and her other children to participate in activities with Father, Child, and Father's family. Much like the\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n   court, we deem the district court's failure to provide subsidiary facts supporting this finding to be a \"striking omission.\" This is especially so, given that the district court stated in its findings of fact that it questioned the accuracy of Mother's testimony that she made up the parent-time that she initially precluded Father from exercising.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b632 Second, the district court stated that Father was \"strong willed\" and that it was \"troubled in part by that characteristic,\" but it did not provide subsidiary facts to support its finding. Moreover, the court did not explain what it meant by \"strong-willed\" or why this characteristic should be treated as adversely impacting Child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relatedly, the court took issue with Father's temperament but made only one vague reference to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b633 Third, the district court found that, because Father was required to have his parent-time supervised for a number of years during the course of the proceedings, it was not in Child's best interest to live with Father. The court failed to discuss the nature of the conduct that prompted the imposition of supervised parent-time, or the important fact that Father successfully petitioned DCFS to review the allegations and change its findings to \"unsupported.\" This change made by DCFS meant that there was \"insufficient evidence to conclude\" that the alleged abuse occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 62A-4a-101(45) (LexisNexis Supp. 2017). Indeed, Father's parent-time would not have been supervised if DCFS had made the correct determination in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b634 The district court also rejected the GAL's recommendation. Although it is not bound to accept such a recommendation if it is not well-founded, the court failed to articulate a legitimate reason for its rejection that was comparable to the GAL's substantial, factually supported concerns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.B. v.

She focused heavily on Mother's minimization of Child's medical needs. Specifically, she was concerned that Mother had a pattern of \"minimizing ... the seriousness\" of Child's suicide attempts, ideations, and self-harming behavior. She supported this by describing Mother's dismissal of Child's first suicide attempt. The GAL also discussed the \"ice cream event\" and said that she saw this as Mother not only minimizing the medical attention Child needed but also disregarding the \"seriousness of [Therapist's] direction and recommendation of what Mother should do\" when Child has a suicidal ideation. And the GAL was concerned that Mother does not allow Child to take the medication prescribed for her depression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b637 The GAL also provided numerous reasons supporting her determination that it was in Child's best interest for the court to award Father primary physical custody. She explained that, when it comes to Child's needs, she has seen \"that Father has taken steps to address the issues that Child brings to him ... in an appropriate way.\" She recounted that: (1) Father took Child to the emergency room immediately after discovering she was having a suicidal ideation; (2) Father looked for a therapist near Mother's house and found Therapist; (3) Father has taken Child to her therapy appointments in Idaho during his parent-time in Salt Lake City; (4) Father helped Child fill out the \"suicide prevention\" plan and discusses it with her during his parent-time and that this \"gives her a sense of security\"; and (5) Father showed at trial that he understands Child's academic and career goals and has a plan for helping her to realize those goals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b638 And, as required by the Utah Code, the GAL informed the court of Child's desire to live with Father. She explained that her observations of Child, and discussions with Child's relatives and Therapist, led her to conclude that Child \"is intelligent,\" \"conversant,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   and \"articulate.\" This information offered the district court a basis for determining how much weight Child's desires should be given in conjunction with other evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Larson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10349392\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/888/719/\">\n    888 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   725 n.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b639 The district court was \"not bound to accept\" the GAL's recommendation, but, as with its duty regarding the findings of fact, \"the court [was] expected to articulate some reason for rejecting that recommendation.\"\n   <em>\n    R.B. v.

Here, the court failed to address all of the GAL's statements supporting her recommendation that were distinct from Child's wishes and rejected the recommendation because Child was only thirteen years old and, in the court's view, incapable of having any meaningful input that would allow it to give weight to her desires.

A guardian ad litem is not required to conform its recommendation with the \"minor's wishes,\" and if \"the minor's wishes differ from the [guardian ad litem's] determination of the minor's best interest,\" the guardian ad litem is required to communicate the minor's wishes to the court as well as its own determination of the child's best interest.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-3-10\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 78A-6-902(8)(b). The only time that a guardian ad litem is not required to communicate the child's wishes to the court is where the child instructs the guardian ad litem not to do so or if the child \"has not expressed any wishes.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-3-10\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 78A-6-902(8)(d).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Father also contends the district court abused its discretion in awarding Mother sole physical custody because the award was against the \"manifest weight of the evidence presented at trial.\" \"But because we rule that the findings of fact inadequately disclose the steps by which the [district] court came to its conclusion, we need not reach this contention.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bartlett v.
