Hall underwent another knee surgery, approved by the State of Wyoming Workers' Compensation Division (the Division). The Division denied Mr. Hall's application for temporary total disability (TTD) benefits, alleging that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-14-605\">\n    Wyo.

On summary judgment, the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) did not uphold the Division's determination, concluding that \u00a7 27-14-605 did not govern Mr. Hall's claim and Mr. Hall was entitled to TTD benefits as a matter of law. The district court affirmed the OAH's judgment, and the Division now appeals. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b62] The Division raises one issue in this appeal, rephrased as: Does\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-14-605\">\n    Wyo.

In 2007, Mr. Hall suffered a work-related injury to his right knee, for which the Division paid medical and TTD benefits. Mr. Hall underwent arthroscopic surgeries in 2007 and 2008 and filed no further claims for benefits until 2014, when the Division \"reopened\" Mr. Hall's claim for medical benefits and preapproved a total knee arthroplasty. After the surgery, Mr. Hall's physician certified him as temporarily totally disabled as a result of the arthroplasty, but the Division\n   denied Mr. Hall's application for TTD benefits. The Division stated that it could reopen Mr. Hall's case only for medical benefits pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-14-605\">\n    Wyo.

The Division agreed that the total knee arthroplasty was reasonable, necessary, and related to Mr. Hall's 2007 work injury. The Division also agreed that Mr. Hall met the causation requirements of either \u00a7 27-14-605(c) or the second compensable injury rule. The sole issue was whether Mr. Hall was entitled to TTD benefits related to the total knee arthroplasty after not seeking benefits on his original injury for over four years. On summary judgment, the OAH concluded that Mr. Hall suffered a second compensable injury that \u00a7 27-14-605 did not control, thus entitling Mr. Hall to TTD benefits. The district court affirmed the OAH's decision. The Division timely filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b65] The parties ask us to interpret \u00a7 27-14-605 and its applicability to second compensable injuries, which are questions of law that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.,Wyo.

The Division misplaces its reliance on those subsections, as the purview of \u00a7 27-14-605 is defined by subsection (a). This is best illustrated by working backward through the section. Subsection (c) determines eligibility only for medical benefits, \"which would otherwise be terminated under subsection (b).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-14-605\">\n    Wyo.
