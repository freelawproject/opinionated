The police report indicated the crash occurred at ten miles per hour and \"no injury\" occurred. However, Gonzalez contended the accident was more severe, causing extensive injuries requiring surgery and physical rehabilitation and forcing him to retire from the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Dysart Hotel notified its insurance claims administrator, Precision Risk Management, about the accident. A claims adjuster (Bill Sim) instructed Gonzalez's attorneys to direct communications to him. Gonzalez filed this negligence action against Nguyen and Dysart Hotel (collectively \"Dysart\") seeking compensatory damages. Gonzalez later sent\n   Sim a detailed demand letter seeking $716,242.50, including $600,000 for pain and suffering, and offering to settle for $695,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Despite repeated inquiries by Gonzalez's lawyers, Dysart did not file a responsive pleading to the complaint. On February 20, 2015, Gonzalez applied for an entry of default, again served Dysart, and also sent copies to Sim and Companion Commercial Insurance (\"Companion\"), Dysart's insurer. After a hearing on June 23, 2015, at which Gonzalez presented evidence and Defendants failed to appear, the trial court entered a default judgment in the amount of $667,279.56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 On August 11, 2015, Defendants filed a Rule 60(c) motion to vacate the judgment's damage award, and Companion moved to intervene. At oral argument on the motions, Dysart's attorney told the court Dysart would admit liability and only contest damages if the motion was granted. The trial court denied Companion's intervention motion because no coverage issues existed, but it granted the motion to vacate the default judgment. The court observed that although it seemed unfair for the insurance company \"to have handled the claim in such a casual or indifferent manner ... and then plead the injustice after the fact,\" it acknowledged it had \"doubts about the fairness of the amount of the judgment,\" which seemed \"too large.\" The proper course \"in such a 'tie,' \" the court concluded, \"is to allow the case to be decided on the merits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 The court of appeals reversed and reinstated the default damages judgment.\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez v.

We have noted that application of Rule 60(c) should serve two different objectives.

We do not find any such requirement in the language or purpose of the rule. Such a requirement elevates form over the relevant substance, which is to determine if there is a justifiable basis to set aside the default judgment. Rather, if the motion relies on evidence of a meritorious defense that appears in the record, the rule plainly vests authority in the trial court to grant relief, and we disavow language in prior decisions that suggests evidence outside the extant record is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 Citing\n   <em>\n    United Imports\n   </em>\n   , the court of appeals focused on the adequacy of the affidavit by Companion's claims manager in support of the motion, concluding it was legally insufficient because it \"said nothing about potential defenses.\"\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   , 1 CA-CV 16-0141, at *3 \u00b6\u00b6 17-18. However, the record provided a basis for Dysart's assertion-and the trial court's conclusion-that the amount of damages might be excessive when tested at trial. The police reports (which were also appended to Dysart's motion) stated that the collision occurred at ten\n   miles per hour and that either no injury or possible injury occurred; nothing suggested serious injuries. Dysart also presented an affidavit from Gonzalez's counsel attesting that Gonzalez incurred $68,683.58 in medical bills and $42,558.92 in lost wages, far less than the default judgment amount. When it entered the default judgment, the trial court expressed concerns about the amount of damages, and the motion to vacate the judgment provided an opportunity for the court to revisit the issue by ordering resolution of the judgment amount on the merits. Although a possibly excessive judgment does not automatically entitle a defendant to vacate a default judgment, the trial court here acted within its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 The court of appeals further found that the absence of excusable neglect by Dysart \"also cuts against granting relief to Defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"713768\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/136/18/#p19\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *5 \u00b6 23.
