Ms. Diaz primarily argues that the trial court erred in admitting the personal injury protection (PIP) application to her insurer. She argues that the PIP application was hearsay and confidential work product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 We hold that the PIP application was not hearsay because it was an admission by a party opponent under ER 801(d)(2)(iv). However, we hold that the trial court erred when it failed to extend work product protection to the PIP application and that this error was prejudicial. We therefore reverse the jury's verdict and grant Ms. Diaz a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 On October 30, 2013, Ms. Prieto was driving her minivan southbound on North Cedar Avenue in Pasco, Washington. Her teenage daughter, Melissa Guzman, was riding in the front passenger seat. There were vehicles, including an orange pickup, parked on the right side of the road. As Ms. Prieto passed the orange pickup, she heard a noise on the passenger side of her van and felt her van jump a little. She stopped, got out, and saw eight-year-old Brayan Martinez lying near the pickup and next to his bicycle. It was evident that Brayan's lower right leg had been run over by one of the minivan's tires. Melissa called 911. Brayan was taken to the hospital and treated for his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 A police officer arrived at the scene to investigate and prepare a report. The officer spoke to a few people, including Ms. Prieto and her daughter. No one the officer spoke to actually\n   <em>\n    saw\n   </em>\n   what happened. Nevertheless, the officer's report indicated that Brayan had ridden his bike from between two parked cars and into the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Ms. Diaz, a monolingual Spanish speaker, contacted a law firm and sought its assistance in making a claim under her insurance policy to pay for medical expenses. On November\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   21, 2013, Ms. Diaz met with an employee of the law firm who spoke Spanish. Following this meeting, a legal assistant asked Ms. Diaz to sign a blank form that the assistant later completed. The form was an application for PIP benefits. Although PIP benefits are available regardless of fault, the form had a line that required the applicant to provide a brief description of the accident. The legal assistant used a copy of the police report to complete the form. The legal assistant wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Vehicle was traveling on North Cedar when child on a bike rode into road. There were 2 parked cars on the road creating a blinde [sic] spot for the driver. Child was struck and had right leg ran over.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ex. 101 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 Ms. Diaz, on behalf of her son, brought suit against Ms. Prieto. Ms. Diaz hired an accident reconstruction expert to assist in establishing liability. The expert, Patrick Stadler, met with Brayan at the accident scene to determine how the accident happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 Brayan explained that prior to the accident, he rode his bicycle from the sidewalk into the roadway in front of the orange pickup to make U-turn type maneuvers. Defense counsel later deposed Brayan. Brayan's statements during the deposition varied enough that Mr. Stadler determined he should meet with Brayan again. Brayan's second explanation to Mr. Stadler was that his shoelace became tangled in his bike chain and that the bike came to rest near the front\n   of the orange pickup. He was stopped and leaning over his bike with his right leg extended out in the road when the minivan ran over his leg. Brayan did not mention the shoelace becoming stuck during his initial interview with Mr. Stadler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 The case proceeded to trial. During opening statements, Ms. Prieto referred to the PIP application. After opening, Ms. Diaz orally requested that the PIP application be excluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Your Honor, ... in defendant's opening [defense counsel] brought up some piece of evidence that I think he might try to bring up again.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [The] Personal Injury Protection application. The personal injury protection application is ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ... a first-party application and privilege is not waived when you submit something to first-party insurance. And, in fact, first-party insurance is not supposed to share the PIP file with defense without permission of plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   In this case, [defense counsel] somehow got a copy of the PIP application. This raises a number of concerns. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   So even though [defense counsel] already referenced it in his opening, and I objected to it then, I would move to exclude any further reference to this Personal Injury Protection application.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   RP at 119-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b69 In response, defense counsel argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   First of all, this document is not privileged. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The PIP insurance coverage is, in essence, a no fault benefit provided on the insurance policy insuring Ms. Prieto. Okay?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   So it's her insurance company that's providing this benefit of medical coverage to Brayan.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   RP at 121-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b610 The trial court then heard voir dire testimony from Ms. Diaz. Ms. Diaz explained that her attorney's legal assistant directed her to sign the blank PIP application. The trial court determined that the form was prepared by plaintiff's agent, constituted an admission against interest, and therefore denied Ms. Diaz's request to exclude it. The trial court stated that the document was not privileged but provided no analysis in making its conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b611 During trial, Mr. Stadler opined that Brayan could not have been struck while riding his bike. His opinion was based on the fact that the frame of the bike was not damaged and that Brayan's injuries did not include any impact or sliding on the pavement. It was his opinion that Brayan had been stationary and adjacent to the orange pickup when Ms. Prieto's minivan ran over his extended right leg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b612 Ms. Diaz asked one of her medical experts how Brayan had described the accident. On cross-examination, Ms. Prieto asked the expert about statements in the medical records that indicated Brayan had ridden his bike out into the road. Ms. Diaz objected on the basis of speculation and hearsay. The trial court noted that the expert had reviewed and relied on the medical record, and overruled the objection on the basis that Ms. Diaz had opened the door during her questions to her expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b613 Defendant's accident reconstruction expert, Eric Hunter, testified that it would have taken Ms. Prieto 1.6 seconds or less to stop once she saw an object in the roadway. He also testified that accident reconstruction experts rely on police reports when forming opinions and that he relied on the police\n   report for this accident. Ms. Prieto began reading the police report into evidence, and Ms. Diaz objected. The trial court overruled the objection but qualified its ruling by saying the jury would be instructed that the police report was admitted only for a limited purpose and could not be considered as substantive evidence. Ms. Prieto did not continue reading the police report. Rather, she then focused on the description of the accident contained in the PIP application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b614 After both sides presented their evidence and closing arguments, the case was submitted to the jury. The jury returned a verdict finding Ms. Prieto not negligent. Ms. Diaz moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and the trial court denied her motion. Ms. Diaz appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   THE PIP APPLICATION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b615 Ms. Diaz argues that the trial court erred when it admitted the PIP application. She argues that the PIP application was hearsay and was confidential. We review these two claims independently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    1. The PIP application was not hearsay\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b616 The trial court's factual determination regarding whether a statement falls within a hearsay exception will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Statev.Strauss,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1370261\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/119/401/#p417\">\n    119 Wash.2d 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 417,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=832%20P.2d%2078\">\n    832 P.2d 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b617 The unrefuted evidence established that a legal assistant for Ms. Diaz's attorney prepared the PIP application based on the police report, and the police report was not based on eye-witness evidence. Ms. Diaz argues that the PIP application has multiple levels of hearsay, is speculative and, for these reasons, the trial court erred in admitting it. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b618 ER 801(d) defines certain statements that are not hearsay. That rule provides in relevant part: \"A statement is not hearsay if ... [t]he statement is offered against a party and is ... a statement by the party's agent or servant acting within the scope of the authority to make the statement for the party.\" ER 801(d)(2)(iv).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b619 Ms. Diaz hired an attorney to assist her in making a PIP claim. A legal assistant for the attorney completed the PIP application. During oral argument, Ms. Diaz conceded that a legal assistant could speak for a law firm by virtue of being part of that firm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is dispositive. We conclude that the legal assistant was a speaking agent for Ms. Diaz and that the statement contained in the PIP application was made within the legal assistant's scope of authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b620 Ms. Diaz implies that because the legal assistant's statement was derived from the police report instead of from Ms. Diaz, the statement was not admissible. She offers no authority for this.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ER 801(d)(2)(iv) does not explicitly require that the agent or servant have firsthand knowledge or direct knowledge from the party. Nor does the rule explicitly require the agent's statement to be nonspeculative. The vast majority of jurisdictions and the Federal Rules of Evidence do not require firsthand knowledge as a requirement for the admissibility of an admission. 2 MCCORMICK ON EVIDENCE \u00a7 255, at 139-40 (John W. Strong ed., 5th ed. 1999). Washington courts have relaxed the rules regarding personal knowledge with respect to admissions by an agent of a party because a strict rule totally excluding the admission would be worse than allowing the trier of fact to hear the admission. 5B KARL B. TEGLAND, WASH. PRACTICE: EVIDENCE LAW AND PRACTICE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00a7 801.38, at 406-07 (6th ed. 2016). Here, the trial court properly found that the legal assistant was an agent of Ms. Diaz and that her statement was within the scope of her agency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the trial court did not err in concluding that the PIP application was not hearsay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Harris prevailed, and Drake appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b624 In affirming the trial court, the court noted that an insured was contractually required to cooperate with his insurer or risk losing coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 488,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20P.3d%20872\">\n    99 P.3d 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court determined that this contractual obligation creates a reasonable expectation in the insured that his statements to his insurer would be kept confidential.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20P.3d%20872\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court concluded that the trial court properly gave work product protections to the IME report and properly excluded the PIP IME doctor from testifying.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 488-89,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20P.3d%20872\">\n    99 P.3d 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b625 Like\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   in the present case, Ms. Diaz had a contractual obligation to cooperate with her insurer, which included an obligation to complete the PIP application. She therefore had a reasonable expectation that her PIP application would be kept confidential and not be shared with opposing counsel. It would work an injustice to permit Ms. Prieto to surreptitiously obtain Ms. Diaz's PIP application and use it against Ms. Diaz simply because the two shared the same insurance company. The injustice is more pronounced given that the description of the accident in the PIP application was taken from a police officer's speculation, unsupported by any eyewitness, and inconsistent with the physical evidence. We hold that the trial court erred when it declined to give work product protections to the PIP application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    3.

Here, Ms. Prieto repeatedly claimed throughout trial that Brayan was hit after he rode his bicycle between two parked cars and into the road. She repeated this claim in her opening statement, during the examination of several witnesses, and throughout her closing argument. Her claim was based almost entirely on the PIP application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b627 An argument can be made that the error in admitting the PIP application was not prejudicial because the same evidence was admitted from the police report and at least one medical record.

Second, the police report was not read into the record or admitted into evidence. Third, Ms. Prieto focused almost entirely on the PIP application, not the police report or the medical records.

Dissenting opinion at 597-98. Although excluding work product sometimes interferes with the search for the truth, that is not the case here. Ms. Diaz signed a blank PIP application. That application was later completed by a legal assistant, who merely wrote down what a police officer had written in his accident report. The officer spoke to three people, none of whom saw what happened. Had the officer testified, his belief that Brayan rode his bike out into the road would have been stricken as hearsay and speculative.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-61\">\n   Korsmo, J. (dissenting)\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b630 Although I agree with the majority's analysis of the hearsay issue and its conclusion that the personal injury protection (PIP) application was not hearsay, I disagree with the decision to consider and resolve a case on a theory barely raised by the appellant in the trial court and not argued on appeal. Moreover, it would perpetrate a fraud on the court to exclude the PIP application and allow the appellant to testify without fear of self-contradiction. The judgment should be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b631 As to the procedural matter, the majority clearly errs in making up its own theory that the PIP application constitutes privileged work product of the insured. The factual basis for that theory was not established in the trial court. Indeed, the majority makes its own fact-finding concerning the PIP application when it \"infers\" that the respondent received the document from the shared insurance company. Majority opinion at 592 n.1. Appellate courts have rejected appellate fact-finding since the Eisenhower administration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thorndike v.

Having not attempted to establish the facts in the trial court, the appellant understandably did not pursue the issue in this court. There is simply no factual basis for the majority's speculative analysis that the document was privileged and was obtained in an improper manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b632 There were plenty of opportunities to pursue this issue in the trial court. As noted by the majority, appellant raised a privilege objection and the respondent denied there was any privilege. Appellant did not attempt to explain further how the document ended up with the respondent or why it was privileged. Since the issue was not explored more thoroughly in the trial court-and since this court does not make factual determinations-there simply are not sufficient facts in the record to address this issue. In addition, the failure to develop the record at trial means that we also cannot decide who holds the privilege and whether it was waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b633 Appellant also had plenty of opportunity to make that record. In addition to the original objection in the trial court, the plaintiff sought a new trial due to alleged violations of a pretrial ruling. The failure to exclude the supposedly privileged document was not raised in that motion. When the case was appealed to this court, the appellant likewise did not pursue the privilege argument. There was no assignment of error to the trial court's ruling on the privilege claim. Appellant did not brief or argue the issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   That should have been the end of the matter in this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Such an extension of the Weeks doctrine would be a perversion of the Fourth Amendment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299308\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/347/62/\">\n    74 S.Ct. 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . I would presume the civil justice system is at least as concerned with truth finding as the criminal justice system. I can think of no policy reason why the majority's new privilege should be stronger than the protections of our constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b641 Most privileges exist to promote honest reporting of facts.\n   <em>\n    Coburn v.

It is a perversion of that purpose to authorize perjury by excluding a party's contrary report of events and let the\n   jury hear only the current version. The privilege should be honored at the discovery level but, once the information has been disclosed, even if wrongly so, the purpose of the privilege is not furthered by allowing it to abuse the truth-seeking function of trial. Even assuming that the PIP application statement was privileged, it was properly admitted here to rebut the contrary version of events that plaintiff was asserting at trial. She was able to explain why that initial version was incorrect, and the jury was able to listen to the explanation and give the statement any weight it deserved. This issue was handled fairly for both sides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b642 Even if the issue is properly before us and even if the statement is privileged, the evidence was properly put before the jury to contradict the version of events presented at trial. I dissent from the decision to exclude the initial report and grant a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Appellant mentions the privilege theory and its application to the PIP application in the briefing only in conjunction with her claim that the trial court wrongly found that a hearsay exception applied.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Br. of Appellant at 17-18. Appellant did not argue that the application form itself should have been excluded as an allegedly privileged document.
