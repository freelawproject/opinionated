The next year, a jury found Miles guilty of first degree felony murder, kidnapping, and armed robbery. The trial court sentenced Miles to death. (Arizona juries were not authorized to impose the death penalty until 2002.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-751, -752.) After conducting an independent review, this Court affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

In doing so, we found that Miles was death-eligible under\n   <em>\n    Tison\n   </em>\n   because he was a major participant in the crimes and had shown a reckless indifference toward human life.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 16-17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1505942\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/186/10/#p12\">\n    918 P.2d at 1034-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court denied Miles's subsequent request for postconviction relief (\"PCR\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 In 2014, after unsuccessfully pursuing habeas corpus relief in federal court, see\n   <em>\n    Miles v. Ryan (Miles II)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558363\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/477/#p479\">\n    713 F.3d 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 479 (9th Cir. 2013), Miles initiated his second PCR proceeding. He asserted that relief was warranted under Arizona Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1(h) because newly discovered mitigation evidence demonstrated that the sentencing court would not have imposed the death sentence had the evidence been known.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 Following an evidentiary hearing, the PCR court granted Miles relief by commuting his death sentence to a life sentence. The court found that at the time of the murder, Miles suffered from \"neurochemical, neurocognitive, and neurobehavioral impairments\" caused by the combined effects of cocaine withdrawal syndrome and alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder (\"ARND\"), which resulted from in utero alcohol exposure. As a result, although Miles was concededly a major participant in the crimes, the court found he was ineligible for the death penalty under\n   <em>\n    Tison\n   </em>\n   because reasonable doubt existed whether he acted with the requisite reckless mental state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 Alternately, the court ruled that if Miles were death-eligible under\n   <em>\n    Tison\n   </em>\n   , he would nevertheless be entitled to \"a resentencing to allow the factfinder to re-weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors\" because he sufficiently demonstrated that the sentencing court would not have imposed the death penalty had it known of Miles's mental-health deficiencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 We granted review of two issues raised by the State, both of which are matters of statewide importance: (1) Did the PCR court err by admitting diminished-capacity and voluntary-intoxication evidence in the\n   <em>\n    Tison\n   </em>\n   inquiry? (2) Can newly proffered mitigation ever constitute clear and convincing evidence under Rule 32.1(h) that a sentencer would not have imposed the death penalty? We have jurisdiction pursuant to article 6, section 5(3), of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. \u00a7 12-102(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 We review a court's ruling on a PCR petition for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

But an abuse of discretion occurs if the court makes an error of law, and we review legal conclusions de novo.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Rule 32.1(h)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 8 When Miles filed the PCR petition in 2014, Rule 32.1(h) (2000) authorized relief if \"[t]he defendant demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish that no reasonable fact-finder would have found defendant guilty of the underlying offense beyond a reasonable doubt, or that the court would not have imposed the death penalty.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Miles challenged only the imposition of the death penalty and not his murder conviction, he was required to prove that \"the court would not have imposed the death penalty.\" Ariz. R. Crim. P. 32.1(h) (2000). \"The court\" necessarily refers to the sentencing court as it \"imposed the death penalty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 9 The State urges us to narrowly construe Rule 32.1(h) consistent with the \"actual innocence\" exception to barring successive, abusive, or defaulted federal habeas claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sawyer v.

Under that exception, relief is permitted only when a defendant shows by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found him\n   <em>\n    eligible\n   </em>\n   for the death penalty.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 336,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480767\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/333/#p335\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Miles and amicus Arizona Capital Representation Project assert that Rule 32.1(h) is more expansive, also authorizing relief if the defendant shows by clear and convincing evidence that he is not deserving of the death penalty in light of newly developed mitigation evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 10 We need not resolve this interpretation dispute. As explained hereafter, we affirm the PCR court's ruling that Miles is ineligible for the death penalty under\n   <em>\n    Tison\n   </em>\n   and therefore do not address the court's alternate basis for its ruling. Even under the State's narrow reading of Rule 32.1(h), a defendant can be granted relief under Rule 32.1(h) for a\n   <em>\n    Tison\n   </em>\n   error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 11 In his concurrence, Justice Pelander describes the version of Rule 32.1(h) in effect in 2014 as \"perplexing\" as it required the PCR court to speculate about how the sentencing judge, now deceased, would have sentenced Miles had the judge known of the new mitigation evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-30. But Rule 32.1(h) does not refer to the sentencing judge (or since 2002, a jury), and construing the rule as imposing a subjective standard would require a PCR court to speculate about a particular sentencer's ruling-an unmanageable, if not impossible, standard. The better reading is that Rule 32.1(h)'s reference to \"the court\" means a reasonable sentencer, whether a judge or a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Admissibility of evidence in\n    <em>\n     Tison\n    </em>\n    inquiry\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 12 The State argues that Miles did not satisfy his Rule 32.1(h) burden because evidence he suffered from cocaine withdrawal syndrome and ARND was inadmissible to refute the mental state required for a\n   <em>\n    Tison\n   </em>\n   death-eligibility finding. Contrary to Miles's assertion, the State adequately preserved this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 13 The Eighth Amendment prohibits \"all punishments which by their excessive length or severity are greatly disproportioned to the offenses charged.\"\n   <em>\n    Tison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211931\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/137/#p158\">\n    481 U.S. at 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211931\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/137/#p158\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).

This argument again ignores the distinction between the elements of a crime, which the legislature has authority to define, and the elements of the\n   <em>\n    Tison\n   </em>\n   inquiry, which are directed by the Eighth Amendment. The legislature's choice to preclude a diminished-capacity defense to a felony murder charge cannot restrict application of the Eighth Amendment in sentencing a defendant convicted of that charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20 The State also argues that permitting a diminished-capacity defense in the\n   <em>\n    Tison\n   </em>\n   inquiry could be illogical if the predicate felony underlying the murder conviction required proof of a greater mental state, like knowingly or intentionally (as did the kidnapping and armed robbery charges of which Miles was convicted). But the legislature's decision to reject a diminished-capacity defense in the guilt-phase does not logically\n   require the courts to ignore diminished-capacity evidence when deciding whether a defendant subjectively appreciated that his acts were likely to result in a victim's death, making him eligible for the death penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 21 We are also unpersuaded that we should reach a different conclusion because consideration of diminished-capacity evidence in the\n   <em>\n    Tison\n   </em>\n   inquiry could result in a de facto penalty phase, confuse a jury, and hinge death eligibility on inexact mental-health evidence. None of these concerns supports categorically precluding mental-health evidence that bears on an inquiry necessary to protect against an Eighth Amendment violation. Notably, trial courts can exclude mental-health evidence that is not relevant or reliable or that would result in juror confusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R.

As the State expressly acknowledged at oral argument here, it does not challenge the sufficiency of this and other evidence to support the PCR court's finding, and we therefore do not address that issue. Likewise, and because the State did not raise an objection under Arizona Rule of Evidence 702 before the trial court or this Court, we do not address Judge Swann's concurring opinion. Finally, because we affirm the PCR court's\n   <em>\n    Tison\n   </em>\n   ruling, we need not address either the efficacy of the court's alternative ruling that the trial court would not have imposed the death penalty had it known of Miles's mental-health deficiencies or the State's argument that newly proffered mitigation evidence can never constitute clear and convincing evidence under Rule 32.1(h) that a sentencer would not have imposed the death penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 25 We affirm the PCR court's order commuting Miles's death sentence to a life sentence.

I also agree that the PCR court did not abuse its discretion in overturning Miles's death sentence,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b67, 24, assuming the evidence on which that ruling was based was admissible and sufficient (points the State does not now contest), and assuming the law authorized (or required) the PCR court to grant such relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-4231(1) (authorizing post-conviction relief when \"the sentence was in violation of the Constitution of the United States\"); Ariz. R. Crim. P. 32.1(a) (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 27 I write separately because I find problematic the rule under which the PCR court granted relief, Arizona Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1(h). That rule, which has no constitutional or statutory counterpart, was added by this Court in 2000. As then adopted, and as applicable to the PCR proceeding here, the rule allows a petitioner to obtain post-conviction relief if he demonstrates by \"clear and convincing evidence that the facts ... would be sufficient to establish that no reasonable fact-finder would have found the defendant guilty of the underlying offense beyond a reasonable doubt, or that the court would not have imposed the death penalty.\" Ariz. R. Crim. P. 32.1(h). Thus, this rule essentially permits a new claim of \"actual innocence\" or, if a death sentence is challenged, a claim of \"actual innocence of the death penalty.\" The Rule 32 committee's petition (R-97-0006) that prompted this rule change did not include or propose the final phrase, \"or that the court would not have imposed the death penalty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nonetheless, that language was added by this Court without circulation for comment and without explanation of its meaning or practical application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 28 Miles never argued that \"no reasonable fact-finder would have found [him] guilty of the underlying offense beyond a reasonable doubt,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , let alone that the 1993 jury would not have found him guilty. Thus, the PCR court's alternative rulings,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b64-5, are supportable, if at all, only under the rule's last phrase, that on considering the new facts \"the court would not have imposed the death penalty.\" Ariz. R. Crim. P. 32.1(h). Two points regarding that text are noteworthy and raise serious concerns about the standard for relief under the rule. First, \"the court\" referred to in Rule 32.1(h) apparently means the sentencing court that imposed the death penalty, here the late Judge William Tinney in 1993.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   My colleagues seemingly agree.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 29 Second, the rule requires a capital defendant to show, and the PCR court to find, by clear and convincing evidence that the sentencing court \"\n   <em>\n    would not have\n   </em>\n   imposed the death penalty.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Ariz. R. Crim. P. 32.1(h) (emphasis added). Thus, the rule's text does not authorize relief based merely on a PCR court's finding that the sentencing judge\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   not have, or\n   <em>\n    probably\n   </em>\n   would not have, imposed the death sentence had the new evidence been available and considered by him.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Crim. P. 32.1(e) (authorizing post-conviction relief when \"newly discovered material facts ...\n   <em>\n    probably would have changed\n   </em>\n   the verdict or sentence\" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 30 This formulation is perplexing on several levels. Based strictly on the rule's text, its application is impractical and necessitates sheer speculation. As applied here, Rule 32.1(h) on its face compelled the PCR court, a judge who was not involved in the underlying trial or sentencing process, to speculate as to the decision that the trial court (a different, and now deceased, judge) would have made decades earlier, and to embrace that speculation on a clear-and-convincing standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regardless of the persuasive force of the new evidence on which the PCR court's ruling was based, any determination that the sentencing court, based on that evidence, \"would not have imposed the death penalty,\" Ariz. R. Crim. P. 32.1(h), is purely conjectural.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 31 Though not disagreeing that Rule 32.1(h)'s wording lends itself to such an \"unmanageable, if not impossible, standard,\" the Court concludes that \"[t]he better reading is that Rule 32.1(h)'s reference to 'the court' means a reasonable sentencer, whether a judge or a jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b611. But even if that objective standard can reasonably be inferred from the rule's text, it does not alleviate all concerns-to some extent the relief granted by the PCR court here depended on its subjective view of the new evidence presented in the Rule 32 hearing, with no way of knowing whether the sentencing judge, had he been presented with the same evidence and arguments in 1993, would have viewed that evidence the same way and found\n   <em>\n    Tison\n   </em>\n   's\"reckless indifference\" requirement lacking. Because the State did not present these issues,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b66, and does not specifically challenge the PCR court's ruling on this particular ground, however, I join the Court's resolution of the other issues raised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 32 The current, restyled version of the rule (effective Jan. 1, 2018) allows relief when the petitioner demonstrates that \"no reasonable factfinder would find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, or that the death penalty would not have been imposed.\" Ariz. R. Crim. P. 32.1(h). This new version might be read to impose a more objective, workable standard of review that requires the PCR court to determine whether any reasonable fact-finder would have imposed the death penalty, rather than whether a specific individual would have done so in the past. The new version implicitly acknowledges permissible variations in results among different fact-finders and confines the inquiry to the objective limits of those variations, while the old version, read literally, arguably required the PCR court to imagine subjectively the decision that a specific judge supposedly would have made had the new scientific evidence been available and presented to that judge at sentencing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 33 However problematic the former standard, the State has not raised the issue and we must resolve any ambiguities in favor of lenity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

As the Court observes, Miles sought relief under Rule 32.1(h) based on \"newly discovered mitigation evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.

But Rule 702 now demands that the court fulfill a gatekeeping role, and this Court has affirmed that \"the rule by its terms forecloses the approach of leaving challenges to an expert's application of a methodology exclusively to the jury.

To be sure, the PCR court, not a jury, acted as the factfinder in this case. But the Rules of Evidence apply equally to such proceedings, and without evidence of a reliable methodology that could bear on the\n   <em>\n    Tison\n   </em>\n   inquiry, on the facts of this case the evidence should not have been admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 43 The record amply supports findings that (1) cocaine withdrawal syndrome exists, (2) Miles has ARND and was addicted to cocaine, (3) Miles may have suffered from the absence of cocaine in his system at the time of the murder, and (4) a known neurochemical mechanism confirms that cocaine withdrawal\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   affect an individual's perceptions and understanding of his actions, particularly if he has ARND. Yet the\n   <em>\n    Tison\n   </em>\n   question is not whether chemical dependence interfered with Miles's dopamine system in a way that could have altered his perceptions and judgment; the question is whether Miles\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   failed to appreciate that his acts were likely to result in the taking of innocent life at the relevant time. Nothing in the expert reports or testimony identified a methodology by which an understanding of the mechanism by which cocaine affects the brain can answer the\n   <em>\n    Tison\n   </em>\n   question on these facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 44 By calling attention to this concern, I do not suggest that the court should intrude upon the factfinder's role in weighing admissible evidence. My observations relate only to the bare admissibility of the evidence under Rule 702(d). That rule laudably demands that the forensic use of scientific evidence comport with scientific principles. A body of cutting-edge science that describes a phenomenon is alluring fodder in a legal proceeding. But even a thorough and reliable scientific understanding of a phenomenon does not always translate to admissibility under\n   Rule 702(d), because an abstract science sometimes lacks a method that permits its application to the facts of a case in a manner that allows a scientifically valid conclusion about the issue that a court is required to decide. In this case, no method was identified that would allow an expert or a factfinder to answer the single question posed by\n   <em>\n    Tison\n   </em>\n   -instead, the scientific evidence only offered an informed basis for speculation about the issue before the court. This is exactly what Rule 702(d) is designed to prevent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 45 To reach the conclusion that Miles is entitled to relief under\n   <em>\n    Tison\n   </em>\n   , as the PCR court did, one must either accept the proposition that every person who has ARND, is addicted to cocaine, and experiences a withdrawal is unable to appreciate the consequences of his actions; or rely on a witness's \"experience\" as a means of translating the abstract science into a conclusion about the defendant's state of mind. The former view is not supported by the evidence in this case-no expert testified that cocaine withdrawal syndrome affects all individuals, or even all individuals with ARND, in a uniformly debilitating way. (Of course, if such a proposition were accepted, then cocaine withdrawal would automatically preclude the death penalty in every case in which a defendant with ARND acts while withdrawing from the drug.) And the latter view does not satisfy the requirements of Rule 702(d). While experience is sufficient to qualify the\n   <em>\n    expert\n   </em>\n   , it is not sufficient to qualify the\n   <em>\n    opinion\n   </em>\n   without a reliable methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 46 Because the State waived its challenge to the admissibility of the evidence, this Court is constrained to accept the PCR court's finding that under\n   <em>\n    Tison\n   </em>\n   the court would not have imposed the death penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 47 For the foregoing reasons, I concur in the opinion and the result.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Unless otherwise noted, we cite the current versions of statutes and rules.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Effective January 1, 2018, Rule 32.1(h) authorizes postconviction relief if \"the defendant demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish that no reasonable fact-finder would find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, or that the death penalty would not have been imposed.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The PCR court found that \"the court\" in Rule 32.1(h) means either the sentencing court or this Court because in this case, we independently reviewed the aggravation and mitigation findings and the propriety of the death sentence on direct appeal.\n    <em>\n     State v.
