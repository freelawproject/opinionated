Loren\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeals these awards, contending the district court abused its discretion by (1) imputing income to him in the amount of $6,662 per month; (2) awarding Lynessa alimony in excess of her actual needs; (3) awarding child support to Lynessa based on the improperly imputed income; and (4) awarding Lynessa attorney fees without \"appropriate consideration of the relevant attorney fees factors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 We agree with Loren that the court abused its discretion in awarding Lynessa alimony in the amount of $1,900 per month, but only to the extent that it erroneously considered retirement fund contributions in Lynessa's monthly expenses, because they were not enjoyed during the marriage, and we remand solely for removal of that amount from the alimony award. But we conclude there was no abuse of discretion when the district court included anticipated car loan payments and health insurance in Lynessa's monthly expenses, because alimony need not be based solely on current expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 We decline to address Loren's claims of error with respect to his imputed income and the award of child support based on his imputed income because he failed to support his argument with reasoned analysis using legal precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees to Lynessa based on her need and Loren's ability to pay them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Loren and Lynessa were married from 1989 to 2008. During their marriage, Lynessa stayed home to raise their four children while Loren worked as a contractor installing carpet and countertops. According to Lynessa, during the marriage Loren was \"a workaholic,\" \"always looking for the next job,\" and was a great provider for the family. Indeed, there was money for extras: two of their sons, Tyler and Steele, were on hockey teams that traveled for games, which could cost more than $7,000 in fees and other expenses per year, which the family was able to pay. Loren also \"sometimes [paid] for other kids' hockey tuition fees because their families couldn't afford it themselves.\" Tyler recounted that while his parents were married, \"we never went without.... We had everything we needed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 After working for different companies for a few years early on in the marriage, Loren started his own contracting business. He primarily submitted subcontracting bids to Action Target, a construction company that provided installations for military, law enforcement, and commercial gun ranges. The money he earned was deposited into a checking account separate from Lynessa's checking account, and whenever Lynessa needed to pay bills or required funds for the children, Loren gave her cash. Lynessa was never privy to what Loren earned for each project and was rarely made aware of the identity of the contractor. But Tyler, Steele, and Lynessa each observed Loren carrying a great deal of cash. After a project's completion, Loren paid cash to his workers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 In 2006, the Andersons' marriage started to break down. Loren admitted he was \"having some troubles at that time\" and began using drugs. By Lynessa's account, Loren was no longer \"in his right mind set\" and he became \"very promiscuous\" and she \"didn't want him around anymore.\" Loren's drug use rendered him incapable of earning an income for a time and it ultimately led to their divorce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 In 2008, the district court entered a default decree of divorce after Loren failed to respond to Lynessa's petition. Because Loren did not respond and failed to assist the court with financial documents, the court relied on his 1099 Form from 2007 showing an annual income of $219,246 \"or $18,271 per month\" to determine his ability to pay child support and alimony. The court imputed income to Lynessa in the amount of $1,014 per month. Ultimately, Loren was ordered to pay $2,945 per month for child support and $2,719 per month for alimony. The child support obligation was to be reduced as each child reached the age of eighteen, and the alimony obligation was to continue for a period equal to the length of the marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Beginning around the time of the divorce, Loren pleaded guilty to drug and fraud related crimes and was in and out of jail for three years. Though he was obligated to pay Lynessa a total of $5,664 each month for alimony and child support, he rarely paid and never in the full amount. When he did pay, it was always in cash, until the Office of Recovery Services (ORS) became involved. Lynessa testified, \"We would go long periods of time without anything from [Loren]. For the longest time he was paying 200 a month, and he just recently changed it to paying [550].\" Even after ORS became involved, Lynessa received only $600 per month for combined child support and alimony. This required Lynessa to receive financial assistance from her church, friends, and family. She also sold some of her gold, jewelry, and other items to provide for herself and the children. But even with this help, she was always behind on bills, and neither she nor the children lived a lifestyle similar to what they enjoyed during the marriage. Tyler testified that their living conditions changed after the divorce, that Lynessa could not fix things around the house, that they relied on\n   their church for food, and that without the money for alimony or child support, Lynessa worked as often as she could \"even if it meant not seeing [the children] as often.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 In 2011, Loren filed a petition to modify child support and alimony (the Petition) based on a substantial change in circumstances that resulted in a decrease in income from the time the divorce decree was entered. He alleged that he could not afford to pay child support or alimony because the amount he was ordered to pay was \"in excess of [his] income.\" Loren claimed he had no income during his incarceration and a decreased ability to earn an income similar to what he had earned during the marriage because he could no longer maintain his own construction business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 Lynessa and Loren each filed financial declarations and other documents related to their respective incomes and expenses. Lynessa provided her 2014 tax return and pay stubs from 2015, which supported her net monthly income of $2,572.01 as purported in her financial declaration, and claimed monthly expenses in the amount of $5,496.21. Loren provided incomplete tax returns for the years he had actually filed them and monthly pay stubs from one employer with hourly rates that varied from about $20 per hour to $33 per hour. But Loren claimed he was earning only $11 per hour, or $2000 per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 The district court held a bench trial in 2015 to resolve the issues Loren raised in the Petition. At trial, most of the testimony related to Loren's ability to earn income, whether he was actually earning only $2,000 per month, and whether he or his new wife (New Wife) owned a construction company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b613 Around the time Loren filed the Petition, he had initiated a romantic relationship with New Wife and helped her to register a construction company, Steelcoat. New Wife had never owned a business before, let alone a construction company, and both New Wife and Loren admitted that she relied on Loren to operate Steelcoat. Loren claimed he was only an employee of Steelcoat and made just $11 per hour, or $2,000 per month, but also admitted at trial that he was the \"face [of Steelcoat] to a lot of people at Action Target\"-the construction company that subcontracts most of Steelcoat's work and with which Loren has had a long professional relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b614 Loren's claimed income and whether New Wife was indeed the sole proprietor of Steelcoat were called into question when New Wife admitted that Loren helped create all of the bids Steelcoat sent to different companies and that she was not sure whether the bids needed to be signed before submission. In addition, a representative from Action Target testified that submitting bids is \"pretty specific\" and \"detailed\" work that requires a bidder to have \"at least done some [installation] work before, or be guided in what it takes to do it.\" The representative also testified that Action Target works closely with its subcontractors during projects and that when it accepts Steelcoat's bids the company communicates with Loren and not with New Wife. Further, Loren admitted that Action Target has hired him, personally, to complete certain of its projects, but he did not provide any information related to the payments he received for those projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b615 In addition to Loren's failure to provide the court with a complete tax return, other than a 2004 tax return, to support his claimed monthly income of $2,000 per month, Lynessa's attorney elicited testimony from Steele that further negated Loren's claim about his income. Steele testified that when he asked Loren for financial help for hockey fees just before the trial, Loren responded that if Lynessa \"would stop coming after him [for] money\" that \"it would be easier for him to not have to hide what he's doing.\" And when the court asked about his ability to earn a better income, Loren admitted he had not applied for employment that would pay more than $11 per hour \"in the last three or four years\" prior to the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b616 After trial, the district court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law. It found that there had been a \"material and substantial change in circumstance\" with respect to the incomes of both parties that allowed for modification of the divorce decree. Because Loren failed to provide complete financial documents or tax returns, the\n   court had to determine an appropriate amount of income to impute to him. It found incredible the testimony regarding Loren's income and New Wife's sole ownership of Steelcoat. Loren admitted that Action Target employed him personally for specific projects, yet provided the court with no documentation to show what he was paid or invoice records \"from his prior relationship with Action Target\" to give the court a general idea of the income Loren was making and could continue to make. The court also found that Steele's testimony that Loren was \"hid[ing] things\" from Lynessa was a \"refer[ence] to unreported income.\" The court therefore relied on Loren's 2004 tax return, which represented a period when Loren owned and operated a company similar to Steelcoat, to impute income to him. In 2004, Loren's adjusted gross income was $41,317. The court added $20,000 to this amount based on what Loren paid for his sons' hockey expenses and his ability to pay for other team members' fees. The court also considered inflation rates and ultimately imputed income to him in the amount of $79,948 annually, or $6,662 monthly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b617 When determining the amount of alimony to award Lynessa, the court addressed her claimed monthly expenses. These amounted to $5,496.21, but the court removed \"the amount spent on adult children, school fees which can be waived[,] and pet care\" and found that her reasonable monthly expenses were $4,400. Based on these expenses and her monthly income of $2,513, the court awarded $1,900 per month for alimony. This amount was to be applied retroactively, subsuming the original $2,954 monthly award, starting from the time the divorce decree was entered and lasting for a period equal to the length of the marriage. The court also reduced the award of child support to $714.64 per month for the parties' remaining minor child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b618 Loren timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b619 Loren raises four issues on appeal. First, he contends the district court abused its discretion in imputing his monthly income at $6,662. In a divorce action, the district court \" 'is permitted considerable discretion in adjusting the financial and property interests of the parties, and its actions are entitled to a presumption of validity.' \"\n   <em>\n    Rayner v.

It necessarily follows that if the court determines the receiving spouse's actual and anticipated needs are reasonable, that they are consistent with the standard of living enjoyed during the marriage, and that the paying spouse can afford to cover the shortfall of those needs, then the alimony award should be in an amount to accommodate that shortfall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b632 Here, the anticipated expenses of the car loan and health insurance were reasonable anticipated expenses for basic needs that were established as standard during the marriage. Loren, Lynessa, and Tyler each testified at trial that Lynessa had a car during the marriage, but that it broke down and she was without a car for two years leading up to the trial. Lynessa testified that she would have purchased a car to replace the old one if she had been receiving the alimony she was entitled to. Therefore, it was reasonable for the court to include the car loan in Lynessa's monthly expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b633 The district court likewise did not abuse its discretion by including health insurance costs in Lynessa's monthly expenses. Lynessa testified that she suffered from medical conditions both during and after the marriage for which she took medication and was under medical care. There was no suggestion at trial that her medical needs were not provided for during the marriage, and the original divorce decree indicated that Loren was providing some medical insurance at the time the marriage dissolved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   And although Lynessa was not asked at trial whether the parties had health insurance during the marriage, Loren was aware, prior to trial, that Lynessa identified health insurance as an expense in her financial declaration. He therefore left the issue for the district court to determine, using its broad discretion based on the evidence before it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woolums\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6972649\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/312/939/\">\n    2013 UT App 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6972649\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/312/939/\">\n    312 P.3d 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding \"[t]he district court's evaluation of and reliance on Wife's testimony, along with its own determinations of the reasonableness of the claimed expenses, fell squarely within its broad discretion to determine an appropriate alimony award\"). Given the medical conditions Lynessa testified she suffered from both during and after the marriage, and that health insurance was at least provided for the children during the marriage, as well as Loren's failure to contest whether health insurance for Lynessa was established during the marriage, we conclude there was no abuse of discretion in considering anticipated health insurance costs in her monthly expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b634 As to Loren's challenge regarding the retirement account, we agree that the district court exceeded the scope of its discretion when it included among Lynessa's necessary monthly expenses $200 per month for retirement account contributions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b635 Utah Code section 30-3-5 allows the district court to address the needs of a spouse that did not exist during the marriage or at the time the divorce decree was entered only if \"the court finds extenuating circumstances that justify that action.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-3-5\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 30-3-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(ii) (LexisNexis Supp. 2017).

First, it is unclear who the prevailing party is in this situation. Although Loren was unable to persuade the court that he was making only $11 per hour, he successfully petitioned it to reduce his obligations of alimony and child support. Second, because of this success, we cannot agree that the action was without merit or brought in bad faith. Though we do not condone Loren's failure to provide adequate financial documents to support his alleged income, we do not agree with the court that Lynessa deserves attorney fees under the bad faith provision of the attorney fees statute.
