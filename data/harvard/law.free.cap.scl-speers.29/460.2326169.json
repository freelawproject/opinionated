Gyles vs. Jacob </em>R. <em>Valk.</em></parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b468-4\">1. The defendant purchased from the plaintiffs\u2019s testatrix, who resided in London, her interest in the residuary personal estate of W., of Charleston, of which, in his will, he had made no disposition, and to a distributive share of which, as one of his next of kin, it was supposed she was entitled; but there being adverse claims, the executors had, before this purchase, filed a bill to have the estate of W. settled under the order of the Court of Chancery. PlaintifFs\u2019s testatrix executed to defendant a deed of assignment, whereby she transferred to him, her \u201cshare and proportion, right, estate, title and interest\u201d in W\u2019s. estate, with a power to act for her and receive her share. Defendant, at the same time, executed a bond for the sum agreed to be given for her interest. In the treaty for the purchase,- as recited in the bond, her right is spoken of as a <em>\u201csupposed share or </em>interest\u201d in said estate, <em>\u201cif she should be decreed </em>to be entitled to a distributive share therein,\u201d and the condition of the bond was, in case she <em>\u201cshall be decreed and declared by any competent tribunal to be entitled to a distributive share,\u201d </em>then that defendant do pay the price stipulated within three months next after he <em>\u201cshall receive or be put in possession of the said share f (\u201cif any\u201d)</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b468-5\">2. In an action upon defendant\u2019s bond, it was adjudged that by the true construction of the condition, his liability accrued when the court decreed that the contingent right which he had purchased was vested in plaintiffs\u2019s testatrix, and that by the power and control which from that time defendant exercised in the right, it was put in his possession.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b468-6\">3.

F. Purse and others, his executors ; the settlement of the estate was committed by the will to Purse, who had a legacy of $2,000 a year, for three years. Wightman owed at the time of his death about $1.40,000, and by his will he gave legacies to be paid in money of about $96,000. The debts and legacies were charged upon his whole estate, and his executors were authorized to sell all the es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>tate to pay; there was no residuary legatee, and as the estate was large, it was thought there would be a considerable surplus to descend to bis heirs at law, and distributees. The testator had two nieces, the plaintiffs\u2019s testatrix, Mrs. Valk, and a nephew, Mr. Gyles, who was dead, leaving children ; these were his nearest relations, and claimed to have the residue of Wightman\u2019s estate. A claim was also set up by a woman, who claimed as his wife. Among these claimants the executors did not choose to decide, and filed a bill in equity, to have the estate settled under the order of the Court of Chancery ; soon after the bill was filed, the defendant, Valk, went to England, where the plaintiffs\u2019s testatrix, Mary Ann Gyles, resided. He there purchased from her, her interest in Wightman\u2019s estate, for the sum of 1,990 pounds sterling, and took from her an as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>signment, with a power to act for her, and to receive her share ; at the same time, he gave- her the bond on which this action was brought. The'condition of the bond, (after reciting the assignment) was that Valk should pay the sum of \u00a31,990, within two months after the receipt of her share of the estate, <em>if any, </em>or words to that effect. This was in the fall of 1837, and before there had been any proceedings on the bill in equity. Before Valk went to England, he applied to the executors to know the probable amount of the estate. By the appraisement, the estate in South-Carolina amounted to $467,940, besides a large real estate, mostly in houses and lots, in Charleston. Included in the inventory and appraisement, was a very large amount in desperate and doubtful debts, and claims. There was besides, a plantation in Georgia, and about 168 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>negroes; the land was appraised at $72,000, and the negroes and other personal estate, at $79,129, of which the negroes were set down at $63,000. The executors proceeded with despatch, to settle the estate, and acting, as Mr. Purse the executor said, by the sole advice of his attorney, without regard to the wishes or advice of Mr. Valk or any of the claimants. In the course of 1836, they sold the whole estate in Carolina, without raising enough to pay the debts and legacies. The amount of the real, estate sold, was about $59,000. In January, 1837, they offered the Geogia estate for sale; the land and negroes were set up together, but there was no bid. The negroes might readily have been sold at a full price; about ten were sold at $450 each. The reason assigned for the endeavor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>to effect a sale of the whole together, was that there was no immediate prospect of effecting the sale of the land, and if the negroes were sold off, the mills and plantation would be left exposed, and the value would be greatly diminished. A further attempt was made to effect the sale in the same way, in March 1837; first the whole was offered, then the land separately, and no bid made. Then the whole was offered again, and bid off by Valk the defendant, at the price of $100,000. A certain portion of the purchase money was required to be paid in cash. This Valk could not raise, except by a sale of the property, or a part of it; he accordingly contracted with one Williamson, to sell the plantation for 28,000, but Williamson could not pay the money, and in consequence thereof, this sale failed, as did also the sale to Valk. Things remained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>this condition until December, when an offer was made by John Fraser <em>&amp; </em>Co. to give $100,000. Notice was immediately given to those interested, and their consent asked, as the executors were unwilling to effect the sale without. The defendant, Valk, objected. To remove this objection, Fraser agreed to give him $6,000 over and above his offer for the land and negroes. The objection was then withdrawn, and the sale effected. At about the time this sale was effected, the executors signed a paper purporting that in the sale the land was valued at $40,000, and the negroes $60,000. In the summer of 1837, Mrs, Gyles arrived in Charleston, and imSeptember published a notice in the newspapers revoking her power of attorney. She died not long after, and the present plaintiff gave notice to the executors, not to pay the money coming to her, to Valk, the defendant.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>BOND.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-5\"><em>Knoiv all men by these </em>presents, I, Jacob Roberts Valk, of Charleston South Carolina, in the United States of America, but now residing at Hims Hotel, Salisbury Square, Fleet Street, in the City of London, Esquire, am held and firmly bound to Mary Ann Gyles, of No. 13 Chatham place, Walworth, New Town, in the county of Surry, widow, in the penal sum of three thousand nine hundred and eighty pounds, of lawful money of Great Britain, to be paid to the said Mary Ann Gyles, or her certain attorney, executors, administrators or assigns, for which payment to be well and truly made, I bind myself, my heirs, executors and administrators, firmly by these presents.

By the decree, Mrs. Gyles and Mrs. Valk were declared to be entitled to the estate as next of kin, but as Mrs. Gyles was an alien, she was excluded from the inheritance of the real estate, which was decreed to be the exclusive property of Mrs. Valk. The decree also directed the debts and legacies to be paid out of the personal estate; if this fund should prove deficient, then the decree directed the sale of the real estate, and after payment of the debts and legacies, the executors were ordered to hand over the balance to the defendant in right of his wife. This decree was acquiesced in, and confirmed by the Appeal Court in January 1838; the remaing funds of the estate were ordered to be paid to the commissioner, he to pay debts and legacies, if any. In June 1838, the funds remaining in the commissioner\u2019s hands were ordered to be paid to Valk, and at a subsequent period, the matters of account were finally settled by a confirmation of the commissioner\u2019s reports.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-5\">Under the various orders made in the case, the commissioner paid over to Valk, in bonds and other valuable securities arising from the sale of the estate and debts collected by the executors, about $80,000, on account of the real estate, besides a iarge amount of judgments and other evidences of debts due Wightman in his lifetime, of which only a small sum had been, or ever could be, collected. By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Wightman\u2019s will, certain slaves were given to the executors, with a request that they should be allowed the control of their own time, and some provision was made in the will for their maintenance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-4\">This action was brought on the bond hereinbefore mentioned. The defendant pleaded specially that he had never received any thing from the personal estate of Wight-man, and therefore there was no forfeiture of his bond, as the condition was, that he was not to pay until two months after he was put into possession of her part of the estate of Wightman, <em>if any. </em>To this there was replication and issue, that the debts and legacies did not exceed the personal estate of Wightman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-5\">The foregoing are the material facts necessary to be understood as applicable to the grounds of the appeal. The presiding Judge was of opinion, and so charged the jury, that if, on the final settlement of Wightman\u2019s estate, there was no personal estate to divide, the defendant was not liable to pay the price he had agreed to give according to the condition of his bond. If the land sold to Fraser was estimated at 40,000 dollars, then about 21,000 had been taken from the real estate to pay debts and legacies, and until this was reimbursed to Valk, out of the personal estate, he was not liable on his bond. The various grounds growing out of the facts-were submitted to the jury, and they found for the defendant \u2014the foreman of the j ury stating that the j ury were of opinion that Valk had received in the over estimate of the value of the land sold to Fraser from the extra sum of $6,000 which he received from Fraser and other sources,. $16,00. The court was also of opinion, that the gift of the negroes mentioned in the last ground of appeal, was a legal bequest and could not be estimated as any part of the personal estate to which the plaintiffs\u2019s testatrix had any right. In relation to the other grounds, it is only necessary to say, there was no evidence that Valk influenced the conduct of the executors in the settlement of the estate, and although there was a large amount of outstanding debts, they were of very little or no value, from which nothing had been realized; they were placed in the hands of an attorney, but nothing was likely to be realized from them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-6\">Plaintiffs appealed, on the following grounds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>1. Because, it is submitted, his Honor erred in charging the jury that in order to incur a forfeiture of the bond, the defendant must have realized money on the right which he purchased from the plaintiffs\u2019s testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-4\">2. Because, the defendant purchased a right pending in equity ; and the decree of the Court of Equity was virtually the possession of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\">3. Because, even conceding the construction of the bond as contended for by the defendant, and as charged by the court to be correct, the right purchased had, on the facts of the case, an actual money value at the time of the defendant\u2019s purchase, and its subsequent depreciation was attributable to causes which are chargeable on the defendant, the purchaser of the right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\">4. Because the defendant assumed the character of a purchaser, and acted as such, in place of assuming the character of an agent, and acting as such \u2014 -and in this way the money value of the right was depreciated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-7\">5.

Because it is submitted that the principle of the decree in equity, in the case of <em>North vs. Wightman </em>and others, was violated with the assent of the defendant in this, that the debts incurred by the executors after the death of the testator, were charged on the personal estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-9\">7.

It is only necessary for the decision of the case, to notice the two first, which relate to the true construction of the condition of the bond. It may be proper to remark that these grounds, though made in the argument of the case in the circuit court, were not urged on the attention of the presiding Judge. Mere elementary principles of law, in the construction of contracts, are sufficient for the decision o\u00ed this case. They are, in general, the same at law and in equity; nor are they varied by the circumstance of the contract being under seal. Whether the instrument be submitted to the judgment of a Common Law Court or a Court of Equity, and whether it be under seal or not, there can be no substantial reason for any difference in the rules, by which the intention of the parties is to be ascertained from the terms they have used. The object of them is to do justice between the parties, by enforcing a performance of their agreement according to the sense in which they mutually understood it at the time it was made. Chitty on contracts, 73. The whole context should be considered in endeavoring to collect the intention of the parties. In the case of a bond with condition, the latter may be read and taken into consideration in order to explain the obligatory part of the instrument \u2014 Chitty on contracts 76 \u2014 so the recital may be used to qualify the general words of a subsequent distinct clause or stipulation. In <em>Payler vs. </em>Homershaw, 4 Maule <em>&amp; </em>Sel. 423, it was recited in a composition deed that the defendant was indebted to his creditors in the several sums set to their respective names, and that they had agreed to take fifteen shillings in-the pound, and the creditors in consideration of the fifteen shillings paid to them, released the defendant from <em>all </em>manner of actions, debts, claims, <em>&amp;c. </em>which they had against him, or <em>thereafter </em>could or might have, by reason of any thing from the beginning of the world to the date of the release. It was held that the release did not extend to any thing but the <em>respective debts </em>recited, and all actions concerning them, for the general words of the release had reference to the particular recital and were governed by it. And the case of <em>Simons vs. </em>Johnson, 3 Barn. &amp; Ald. 175, is an authority that, in cases of this kind, parol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>evidence may be received to shew and explain the nature of the matter recited. Matter put only by way of recital in an instrument, may amount to an agreement, when the recital is called into action, to discover and give effect to the meaning of the parties. Thus, in <em>Sampson vs. Easter</em>by, 9 Barn. <em>&amp; </em>Cres. 505, when a lease of an undivided third part of certain mines contained a <em>recital of an agreement made </em>by the lessee with the lessor, for pulling down an old smelting mill, and <em>building </em>another of larger dimensions, and the lease contained a covenant to keep such new mill in repair, and so leave it at the expiration of the term, but did not contain a covenant to <em>build it, </em>it was held that such covenant was to be implied. Lord Tenterdon, delivering the judgment of the court says, \u201clooking at this instrument and considering the nature of the subject matter, we think there is that which amounts to a covenant, which has been correctly stated in the declaration.\u201d The bond in this case, was given in payment of the right and interest which the defendant had purchased of the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix. The obvious and honest intention of the bond would be, that the defendant should pay the price when he had received the subject of his bargain. The first inquiry then, to be determined from the consideration of the condition and recital of the bond is, what did the defendant purchase from the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix <em>1 </em>Was it merely the right to a distributive share of the residuary estate of the testator, without any reference to the uncertain value of the right when it might be established; or was the sale of the right accompanied with a stipulation or guaranty that it should, when recovered, be attended with substantial pecuniary advantages; on the receipt and enjoyment of which, the defendant\u2019s obligation to pay should accrue 1'</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">There is no circumstance or expression in the treaty for an execution of the bargain between the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix and the defendant, to indicate that the defendant meant to purchase, or did actually purchase, any thing else than her contingent right, whatever it might be worth ; or to shew that the value or actual enjoyment in possession, of which that right might secure, entered into the consideration of the price which the defendant was to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>for it. The recital in the deed of assignment, which set forth the subject matter of the contract, with the incidents affecting its value, makes no allusion to the amount of the estate of the testator, nor of the debts and legacies chargeable upon it. The uncertainty of the right depending on the existence of adverse claims which might entirely defeat it, is fully set out; and with this contingency alone in view, as affecting the value of the subject of the bargain, the price was stipulated. In the treaty for the purchase, as recited in the bond, it was spoken of as a <em>\u201csupposed share </em>or interestand the particular in which it was regarded as contingent, or a merely \u201csupposed\u201d share', is indicated by the explanation immediately following, \u201cif she should be <em>decreed </em>to be entitled to a share therein.\u201d The condition of the bond is that, \u201cin case the said Mary Ann Gyles shall be <em>decreed </em>and declared by any competent tribunal to be <em>entitled </em>to a distributive share,\u201d then \u201cthe defendant do pay to Mary Ann Gyles, the sum of nineteen hundred and ninety pounds.\u201d So far, no ambiguity arises respecting the condition on which the price shall be paid. It is <em>when, and in case, </em>Mary Ann Gyles, shall be <em>decreed </em>to be <em>entitled </em>to a distributive share. This construction is consistent with all the parts of the bond referred to, and also with the deed of assignment from the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix to the defendant, whereby she transfers merely her \u201cshare, proportion, right, estate, title and interest,\u201d without any engagement that it should produce any substantial or pecuniary benefit to the defendant. The terms of the condition, briefly stated in connection with each other are, in case the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix be decreed to be entitled to a distributive share, then the defendant do pay the price stipulated, \u201cwhen he shall receive or be put in possession of said share.\u201d On this last of the terms of the condition is rested the objection of the defendant, that he is not liable to pay his bond until he receives a substantial share in money or property of the residuary estate, and that if, on the final settlement of the estate of Wightman, there is no personal estate to divide, he is not liable to pay the price he had agreed to give. The effect of this construction is, to superadd a covenant to that effect to the deed of assignment, for if the defendant is not bound to pay other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>wise, it must be because the right to a distributive share was assigned to him with that stipulation. The word \u201cshare,\u201d in this part of the condition, may be construed as synonymous with \u201cright.\u201d The use of these words in the bond will justify this signification. The objection of the defendant must then proceed on the assumption that possession cannot be affirmed of a right as separate from that in which it inheres. In the sense of the condition of the bond, the defendant may, without force, be considered to have been put in possession of the contingent right he .purchased when it wras established and decreed. This construction is not without analogy in the law; a husband is entitled to the choses in action of his wife when they are reduced into his possession, The delivery of a bond or note to the husband, though it only transfers to him a right to recover and receive the amount, is a reduction into possesssion of the chose in action ; so a judgment recovered on the wife\u2019s chose vests the possession in the husband ; and yet in these cases, he has only established a right to demand payment from the debtor. A constructive possession attends the right, and in this sense the defendant may be considered to have been put in possession of the share when the contingent right to it, which he had purchased, was decreed and vested in him. He could not have manual possession of a right. The only possession of which it was capable, was the control, power and benefit which resulted from the decree of the court vesting it in him. The words <em>\u201cif any\u201d </em>according to this construction of the bond, would mean if any share were decreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">This construction of the condition of the bond, is less exceptionable on account of any supposed violence to the expression of the deed, than that which would determine the liability of the defendant to pay the stipulated price by the substantial receipt of the share. This last condition would be almost illusory \u2014 would the' receipt of less than the whole incur the liability \u2014 to pay less than the entire share, would not satisfy the words of the condition. The defendant might refuse to receive the last inconsiderable payment on the share. This is an extreme supposition. But the defendant, by the purchase of Mrs. Gyles\u2019s share, was entitled to the whole residuary estate. The execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>tors were accountable only to him, and in such circumstances collusion might be between a purchaser and executors to delay a final settlement of the estate indefinitely. If the defendant be not liable till he has received the entire share, how long might he, with the large amount of bad and doubtful debts, protract the payment of his bond, when it is considered that the defendant, entitled in right of his wife, to the real estate, had in the administration of the personal estate,, a direct interest, adverse to hers, to increase the real estate, at, the expense of the personal. This construction of the bond would be fraught with injustice. It is impossible to suppose that such could have been her understanding of the contract, and it must be adjudged in this case as in <em>Paylor vs. </em>Homershaw, that the words in the condition had reference to the agreement recited, and must be governed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The next enquiry is, was the defendant, put in possession of the share, right or interest which he purchased. From the time that the decree vested the right in him, he has enjoyed the whole power, benefit and control of it, in a manner that secured him the most important advantages, not the less valuable because they cannot be measured in pecuniary value. He was enabled to control the rights and claims of Mrs. Gyles, which were adverse to his, in the administration of the estate. The claim to have the real estate distributed as personal, was prevented, and he was enabled to revive that equity in the decision of the case in Equity. He has quietly received the sum of eighty thousand dollars from the proceeds of the sale of the real estate. The sale of the real and personal estate in Georgia was arranged in respect of time, so as to be made subservient to the value of the real estate. The administration of the Georgia property might have been transferred to the courts of Georgia ; all the uncertainties of a foreign jurisdiction on his rights and claim to the residuary estate, have been avoided. The influence which might have attended the sole proprietorship, in the general administration of the estate, to direct it so as to advance his own interests, has been possessed without interference or contest. He was not delayed, injured or disquieted in the prosecution and enjoyment of his interests; all these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>benefits accrued to the defendant from the purchase of the right or share of the plaintiffs\u2019s testatrix in the residuary estate, from the time that, by the decree of the court, that right was established. The court is of opinion that by the true construction of the condition, the liability of the defendant to pay the sum stipulated in his bond, accrued when the court decreed that the contingent right, which he had purchased, was vested in Mrs. Gyles, and that by the power and control which from that time the defendant exercised in the right, it has been put in his possession. A new trial is therefore ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b481-4\">Richardson, O\u2019Neall, Butler and Wardlaw, JJ. concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
