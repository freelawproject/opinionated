She argues that her motion to reopen should have been granted by the immigration judge because she is entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period based on the following factors: (1) she made a <em>prima facie </em>showing of eligibility for adjustment of status, and (2) she exercised due diligence in seeking relief. She also argues that the foregoing factors support the exercise of the BIA\u2019s power to reopen the proceedings <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Carmona-Flores\u2019s argument that her motion to reopen was subject to equitable tolling is aimed at the denial of her motion to reopen, not at the denial of her motion for reconsideration. However, Carmona-Flores did not file a separate petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision dismissing her appeal of the denial of the motion to reopen. Accordingly, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the arguments raised in Carmona-Flores\u2019s appeal brief regarding the motion to reopen. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394-95, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Guevara v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 173, 176 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The BIA determined that Carmona-Flores\u2019s motion for reconsideration should be denied as untimely. Carmona-Flores does not make any arguments in her brief that relate to the BIA\u2019s determination that her motion was untimely. She has therefore abandoned that issue. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Carmona-Flores\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision denying her motion for reconsideration is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">To the extent that Carmona-Flores challenges the BIA\u2019s refusal to reopen the proceedings <em>sua sponte, </em>this court lacks jurisdiction to consider her argument. <em>See Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 249-50 (5th Cir.2004). Accordingly, Carmona-Flores\u2019s petition for review is DENIED IN PART and DISMISSED IN PART for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
