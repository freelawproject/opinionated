He was sentenced to 84 months in prison, above the advisory range of 46 to 57 months. The district court justified the sentence as a variance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) or a departure from the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Ramirez-Maldonado argues that his 84-month sentence is substantively unreasonable because his convictions for aggravated robbery and murder were used to calculate both his offense level and criminal history. With respect to his specific double-counting argument, Ramirez-Maldonado has not shown any error, as courts may consider factors already accounted for by the Guidelines in determining a sentence outside the recommended range. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349-50 (5th Cir.2008). We defer to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify the extent of the upward variance. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Ramirez-Maldonado\u2019s arguments amount to a mere disagreement with the district court and do not warrant reversal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-13\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-10\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
