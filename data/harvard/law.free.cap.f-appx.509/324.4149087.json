He was represented by a Federal Public Defender and was sentenced to a term of 24 months imprisonment followed by a three year supervised release term. He made no objection to the sentence in the trial court. On appeal, he challenges only the term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-21\">We review his appeal under the plain error standard. Fed. R.Crim. Pro. 52(b); <em>United States v. Hernandez-Guevara, </em>162 F.3d 863, 870 (5th Cir.1998). His issues, centered on the proposition that imposing supervised release on a deportable alien constitutes an upward departure, are now foreclosed by this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 329 (5th Cir.2012). The court committed no error, much less plain error, in failing to treat the supervised release term as an upward departure in light of the new guideline \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) (stating that a term of supervised release should not \u201cordinarily\u201d be imposed on a removable alien). <em>Id. </em>The final sentence, imposed within the guidelines range, is presumptively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-22\">There remains only the question whether the district court\u2019s failure to explain reasons for imposing supervised release merits the relief of resentencing under the plain error standard. We hold it does not. The sentencing hearing here was perfunctory, punctuated mainly by the government\u2019s reminder that Garcia-Lemus has a criminal record including 11 prior convictions and 2 prior illegal reentries at times when he was already serving supervised release terms. Garcia-Lemus sought mercy as to the term of imprisonment only. Garcia-Lemus make no attempt to demonstrate why this technical omission, if error at all, affected his substantial rights or, if left uncorrected, would seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). No plain error is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
