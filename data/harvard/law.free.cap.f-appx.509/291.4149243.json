The district court sentenced him within the Sentencing Guidelines to 21 months of imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release. The sentence was ordered to run consecutively to the 12-month sentence imposed, at the same sentencing hearing, upon revocation of Orozco\u2019s supervised release from a prior illegal reentry conviction and sentence. Orozco does not challenge the 12-month revocation sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">As of November 1, 2011, \u00a7 5Dl.l(e) of the Guidelines provides that \u201cordinarily,\u201d the district court \u201cshould not impose a term of supervised release in a case in which supervised release is not required by statute and the defendant is a deporta-ble alien who likely will be deported after imprisonment.\u201d The commentary explains that the court \u201cshould ... consider imposing a term of supervised release on such a defendant if the court determines it would provide an added measure of deterrence and protection based on the facts and circumstances of a particular case.\u201d \u00a7 5D1.1, comment, (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Orozco argues that the district court erred in imposing a term of supervised release given that he is likely to be removed to Guatemala upon his release from imprisonment. Instead of simply relying on \u201cthe guidelines,\u201d as he did in the district court when he objected, Orozco cites on appeal the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a), his inability to benefit from the rehabilitation aspect of supervised release, and the district court\u2019s alleged intent to punish him for a subsequent illegal reentry if he returns. The record does not reflect that the district court was alerted to those arguments or that it was able to respond specifically to those arguments. <em>See United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 327-28 (5th Cir.2012). Plain error review is therefore applicable. <em>See id. </em>However, even if it was not applicable, Orozco still could not prevail under the less stringent reasonableness review. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-14\">To show plain error, Orozco must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id. </em>Under the reasonableness standard, this court first reviews the procedural reasonableness of the sentence. Absent procedural errors, this court reviews the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>At the sentencing hearing, the district court noted that Orozco\u2019s criminal history began in 1992 with theft and revealed almost 20 years of being a thief. The district court noted further that the United States had been unable to prevent Orozco from coming back. In overruling defense counsel\u2019s objection to the supervised release term, the district court stated, \u201cThis is a classic case as to why supervised release needs to be maintained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The district court\u2019s statements at sentencing adequately explained why supervised release would provide \u201can added measure of deterrence and protection.\u201d <em>See Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 330. Accordingly, Orozco has not shown error, plain or otherwise. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
