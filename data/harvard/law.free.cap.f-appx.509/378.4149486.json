He previously sought and was denied relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Following the denial of his motion for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) by this court, he filed a postjudgment motion that the district court denied. The district court also dismissed without prejudice any successive Section 2254 claims because Figueroa had not obtained authorization from this court to raise them. Figueroa has filed in this court a motion for appointment of counsel and a document styled as a motion for a COA and a brief in support. His motion for a COA refers to the district court\u2019s denial of his post-judgment motion. Affording Figueroa\u2019s COA brief the requisite liberal construction, it appears that he is requesting authorization to file a successive Section 2254 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-20\">Figueroa refers to the denial of his post-judgment motion in his motion for a COA but does not address the substance of that ruling in either his motion or brief. Accordingly, Figueroa has abandoned any challenge to the denial of his postjudgment motion, and his motion for a COA is denied. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-21\">Figueroa has failed to make the requisite <em>prima facie </em>showing for authorization to file a successive Section 2254 application. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C). Figueroa faults counsel for failing to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>expert analysis of the victims\u2019 physical injuries in light of his penile impairment. Because he was aware of his penile impairment prior to abusing the victims, he has not established that he could not have discovered the factual predicate of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel previously through the exercise of due diligence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)\u00a9.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Figueroa also faults counsel for failing to discover the results of one victim\u2019s medical examination and the fact that the victims claimed to be living at the wrong address when he abused them. He does not explain how the results of the medical examination would have undermined that victim\u2019s credibility. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>evidence that the victims gave the wrong address would have undermined their credibility, Figueroa has not demonstrated that no reasonable factfinder would have found him guilty but for counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii). Accordingly, Figueroa\u2019s alternative motion for authorization to file a successive Section 2254 application is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Figueroa\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied as the interests of justice would not be served by an appointment. <em>See Schwander v. Blackburn, </em>750 F.2d 494, 502-03 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">MOTION FOR A COA DENIED; MOTION FOR AUTHORIZATION TO FILE A SUCCESSIVE \u00a7 2254 APPLICATION DENIED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
