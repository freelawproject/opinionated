He, however, does not address the merits of the motion to reconsider or its denial in his initial appellate brief: his brief to us instead focuses on the BIA\u2019s 19 August 2011 order dismissing his appeal of the immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Because Eja did not timely petition for review of the denial-of-asylum order, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review it. We dismiss the present petition insofar as it pertains to the underlying BIA order denying asylum and so on. Furthermore, by failing to raise in his Blue Brief any argument on the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider, Eja has abandoned his challenge to that denial. So, we deny Eja\u2019s petition on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">PETITION DENIED IN PART and DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
