Cray argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because it considered the pre-sentenc-ing factors pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), but failed to consider his post-sentencing rehabilitation efforts. Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-21\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of motion to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Smith, 568 F.3d 923, 926 </em>(11th Cir.2009). Section 3582(c)(2) provides that \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... [a district court] <em>may </em>reduce the term of imprisonment.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis supplied). A modification is permitted only \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-22\">In deciding a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, \u201cthe court must recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines, first determining a new base level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). The court must then decide, in its discretion and after analyzing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, whether to impose the amended sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781. We have expressly rejected the suggestion that a district court is required to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c). <em>See United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-23\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide that, where a defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range has been lowered after the defendant\u2019s sentencing, \u201cthe court <em>may </em>reduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) (emphasis added). The application notes to that provision state that \u201cthe court shall consider the [\u00a7 3553(a) factors] in determining: (I) whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is warranted; and (II) the extent of such reduction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1 (B)(i). We have held that a district court \u201ccommits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>568 F.3d at 927 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[N]othing ... requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d). The guideline application notes further explain that \u201c[t]he court <em>may </em>consider post-sentencing conduct of the defendant that occurred after imposition of the original term of imprisonment in determining\u201d whether a reduction is warranted or the extent of any such reduction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1 (B)(iii). Nothing, however, <em>requires </em>the court to consider post-sentencing conduct. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Turning to the case at hand, we discern no error in the district court\u2019s denial of Cray\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Section 3582(c)(2) and its accompanying guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l), make quite clear that the district court wields discretion to decide whether to lower a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where the guideline range is subsequently lowered as the result of an amendment to the guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). The record reflects that district court properly considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors in denying Cray\u2019s motion. Indeed, the court <em>explicitly </em>stated that \u201cpursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), ... [Cray\u2019s sentence] should remain at 118 months.\u201d And while the court did not specifically enumerate the factors upon which it relied, the district judge discussed the nature and circumstances of Cray\u2019s offense when he remarked that Cray\u2019s offense involved a substantial quantity of crack cocaine. Further, the district judge considered the history and circumstances of the offender, because he remarked that Cray had been given several opportunities to change his life when he had been sentenced to probation rather than incarceration for two prior felony drug convictions. Finally, and with regard to the argument that the district court did not adequately consider Cray\u2019s post-conviction conduct, we simply note that nothing requires it to. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (explaining that the district must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and <em>may </em>consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct, in ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion). The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
