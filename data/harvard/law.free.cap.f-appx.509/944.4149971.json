In his complaint, which Drummond had removed to federal court pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B), McCay challenged Drum-mond\u2019s denial of his application for a disability retirement pension, alleging that he subsequently received a favorable award of Social Security benefits, and that Drummond was under a continuing duty to consider this new evidence of disability. The first time this case was before the district court, the court, in its discretion, granted McCay\u2019s Motion to Remand to the Plan Administrator, so that McCay could present to the Pension Committee additional evidence in support of his disability claim. After Drummond\u2019s Pension Committee upheld its previous denial on remand, the district court granted McCay\u2019s Motion to Reinstate Claim and reopened the case. This time, the district court granted Drummond\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment for two independent reasons \u2014 because McCay had failed to exhaust administrative remedies, and because Drummond\u2019s denial of McCay\u2019s benefits was reasonable. On appeal, McCay argues that: (1) the District Court erred in concluding that McCay\u2019s claim for disability pension benefits was barred based upon his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies; and (2) the District Court erred in upholding the Pension Committee\u2019s decision that McCay was not disabled under the Pension Plan. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">\u201cThe decision of a district court to apply or not apply the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement for ERISA claims is a highly discretionary decision which we review only for a <em>clear </em>abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Perrino v. BellSouth, </em>209 F.3d 1309, 1315 (11th Cir.2000). Where, as here, an ERISA plan endows the plan administrator with discretion to determine eligibility for plan benefits, we review the administrator\u2019s decision under a deferential standard. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 111, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">The ERISA statute mandates that employee benefit plans subject to its coverage \u201cshall ... afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133(2). We generally require exhaustion of administrative remedies as a precondition to filing an ERISA action. <em>See Perrino, </em>209 F.3d at 1315 (quoting <em>Counts v. Amer. Gen. Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>111 F.3d 105, 108 (11th Cir.1997)); <em>Mason v. Continental Group, Inc., </em>763 F.2d 1219, 1225-27 (11th Cir.1985) (\u201c[T]he district court did not err in holding that plaintiffs must exhaust their remedies under the pension plan agreement before they may bring their ERISA claims in federal court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">However, we recognize an exception to the exhaustion requirement where \u201cresort to the administrative route is futile or the remedy inadequate.\u201d <em>Curry v. Contract Fabricators, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan, 891 </em>F.2d 842, 846 (11th Cir.1990) (quotation omitted), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Murphy v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>247 F.3d 1313, 1314 (11th Cir.2001). We have found another exception to exhaustion when the plaintiffs failure to exhaust administrative remedies resulted from certain language in the plan\u2019s summary description that the plaintiff \u201creasonably interpreted as meaning that she could go straight to court with her claim.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number><em>Watts v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., </em>316 F.3d 1203, 1204 (11th Cir.2003). Where a valid exception applies, the district court has wide discretion to excuse the exhaustion requirement. <em>Perrino, </em>209 F.3d at 1315.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">We have expressed a disinclination toward expansion of the exceptions to exhaustion. In <em>Perrino, </em>for example, we rejected a proposed \u201cnew exception to our exhaustion requirement; namely, that an employer\u2019s noncompliance with ERISA\u2019s technical requirements (for example, creating a summary plan description, or delineating a formal claims procedure) should excuse a plaintiffs duty to exhaust administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1316. In declining to further expand the exceptions to ERISA exhaustion, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-6\">This approach conforms with the logic of our exhaustion doctrine in which we apply the exhaustion requirement strictly and recognize narrow exceptions only based on exceptional circumstances. Our exceptions to this doctrine where resort to an administrative scheme is unavailable or would be \u201cfutile,\u201d or where the remedy would be \u201cinadequate\u201d simply recognize that there are situations where an ERISA claim cannot be redressed effectively through an administrative scheme. In these circumstances, requiring a plaintiff to exhaust an administrative scheme would be an empty exercise in legal formalism. That said, it makes little sense to excuse plaintiffs from the exhaustion requirement where an employer is technically noncompliant with ERISA\u2019s procedural requirements but, as the district court determined in this case, the plaintiffs still had a fair and reasonable opportunity to pursue a claim through an administrative scheme prior to filing suit in federal court. Therefore, if a reasonable administrative scheme is available to a plaintiff and offers the potential for an adequate legal remedy, then a plaintiff must first exhaust the administrative scheme before filing a federal suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b969-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 1318 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">To begin with, McCay, who appealed Drummond\u2019s benefits decision <em>nineteen months </em>after it was issued, concedes his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies in this case by admitting his failure to appeal Drummond\u2019s initial denial of pension benefits within the set 180-day time frame. Instead, McCay suggests that he should be excused from the exhaustion requirement altogether. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that none of the existing exceptions apply to McCay\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-11\">First, McCay argues that deficiencies contained in Drummond\u2019s notice of denial of benefits excused McCay\u2019s failure to appeal within the designated 180-day time period. Specifically, he says that the denial notice failed to include \u201cwhat evidence was needed to obtain a favorable decision.\u201d Yet as the record shows, the notice communicated to McCay that he needed to show that he was totally disabled, and that his treating physicians said that he was not. It further explained that he could submit \u201cwritten comments, documents, records, and other information relating to [his] claim.\u201d Moreover, even if this notice weren\u2019t sufficient, the type of \u201cnoncompliance with ERISA\u2019s technical requirements\u201d that McCay alleges is of the type that <em>Perrino </em>concluded was insufficient to excuse ERISA\u2019s administrative exhaustion requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 1317 (\u201c[T]he exhaustion requirement for ERISA claims should not be excused for technical violations of ERISA regulations that do not deny plaintiffs meaningful access to an administrative remedy procedure through which they may receive an adequate remedy.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>Thus, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to find that any deficiencies in the notice excused McCay from appealing in timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">We are also unpersuaded by McCay\u2019s claim that depression interfered with his ability to timely appeal Drum-mond\u2019s denial of his disability pension application. For starters, McCay does not cite to any Eleventh Circuit case in which ERISA exhaustion requirements were excused based on a theory of mental incapacity. The only binding case law he cites to is <em>Branch v. G. Bernd Company, </em>955 F.2d 1574, 1582 (11th Cir.1992), in which we allowed equitable tolling of the sixty-day election period for continued health coverage under a <em>different </em>federal statute, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, because the beneficiary died during the election period. There is no discussion of mental incapacity or the standard of proof necessary to establish such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">But, if we were to accept McCay\u2019s argument \u2014 that equitable tolling applies here \u2014 McCay would bear the heavy burden, under the equitable tolling doctrine, of showing that \u201cextraordinary circumstances exist[ed]\u201d to prevent him from appealing on time. <em>Arce v. Garcia, </em>434 F.3d 1254, 1261 (11th Cir.2006). As the district court found, McCay failed to do so. Among other things, the district court noted an irreconcilable tension between the pre-litigation position advocated by McCay\u2019s attorney \u2014 informing Drummond by letter dated March 10, 2008, letter that \u201cMr. McCay delayed filing an appeal of the disability pension because he was waiting on the Social Security decision\u201d \u2014 and his post-litigation position that the delay was based on his depression. The court also observed an unexplained discrepancy in the time frame within which McCay asserts that he was unable to pursue Drum-mond\u2019s appeals process due to depression, which is the same general time frame within which McCay apparently hired an attorney and successfully appealed his unfavorable Social Security benefits determination. <em>See, e.g., Barnhart v. United States, </em>884 F.2d 295, 299 (7th Cir.1989) (rejecting equitable tolling argument in holding plaintiff was sufficiently aware to pursue a lawsuit against a different party related to his injury and, therefore, his participation in other proceedings put to rest any argument that he was legally incapable of proceeding with his lawsuit). In short, the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting McCay\u2019s argument that he was mentally incapable of pursuing his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">Next, McCay urges us to excuse the exhaustion requirement based on futility. We have said that the futility exception does not apply simply because the same parties who made the initial benefits determination were also the decision makers in the administrative appeal process. <em>Lanfear v. Home Depot, Inc., </em>536 F.3d 1217, 1224 (11th Cir.2008). Rather, \u201cthe futility exception protects participants who are denied meaningful access to administrative procedures, not those whose claims would be heard by an interested party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For instance, in <em>Curry, </em>we found that the futility exception applied where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>plan administrators had denied a participant meaningful access to administrative proceedings by repeatedly ignoring requests for documents supporting the denial of benefits. 891 F.2d at 846. Conversely, in <em>Springer v. Wal-Mart </em>Assoc. <em>Group Health Plan, </em>908 F.2d 897 (11th Cir.1990), we reversed the district court\u2019s application of the futility exception where the plan participant invoked the exception on the basis that the initial internal decision maker and the decision maker on appeal shared \u201can interest in holding costs down.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 901 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">In arguing futility to us, McCay merely makes vague claims that the appeal would have been futile because \u201cDrummond was determined to cling to its position that McCay\u2019s appeal was too late and Dr. Romeo\u2019s opinion was enough reasonable cause to support a denial of benefits.\u201d McCay has provided no evidence that Drummond\u2019s Pension Committee exercised any control to deny McCay a meaningful review of his claim denial. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to find futility.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Finally, we find no merit to McCay\u2019s argument that he has an unlimited right to submit additional evidence of disability. He relies on <em>Kappos v. Hyatt, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1690, 182 L.Ed.2d 704 (2012), which allowed for the submission of new evidence to the district court under Section 145 of the Patent Act of 1952. However, <em>Kappos </em>does not apply here. Most notably, the Supreme Court expressly limited its holding to the confines of a limited circumstance: \u201cwe are concerned only with \u00a7 145 proceedings in which new evidence has been presented to the District Court-\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1699. The Supreme Court also noted that the review standard for Section 145 is entirely different from an action under Section 146 of the same Act. Further, there is no \u201cbroad brush\u201d language in the opinion that would support McCay\u2019s conelusory assertion that the right to submit additional evidence in an ERISA disability determination, nor that the right goes on for forever.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">McCay also cites to <em>Shannon v. Jack Eckerd Corp., </em>113 F.3d 208 (11th Cir.1997), to support his assertion that a Plan Administrator has a continuing duty to consider any new evidence of disability that a plaintiff might be able to gather. McCay claims there is a continuing duty, regardless of whether the final determination has been reached on his claim, regardless of whether the plaintiff made an effort to exhaust the administrative remedies available to him, and regardless of whether the plaintiff is even employed or still a participant in the Plan. We have long said, however, that a \u201cdistrict court should limit its review to consideration of the material available to [a decisionmaker] at the time it made its decision.\u201d <em>Jett v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Ala., </em>890 F.2d 1137 (11th Cir.1989); <em>see also Levinson v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>245 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir.2001) (when a plan grants its administrator discretionary authority to interpret it the parties may not generally introduce new evidence of disability in the district court, so that the ease must be decided on the administrative record).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">Furthermore, <em>Shannon </em>is distinguishable. There, the decision to remand the case to the Plan Administrator for consideration of additional evidence was made only <em>after </em>we concluded that the Plan Administrator\u2019s initial determination was arbitrary and capricious. Thus, in <em>Levinson, </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-14\">[T]he facts in <em>Shannon </em>are distinguishable from the facts in the instant case. In <em>Shannon, </em>the plan administrator relied only upon a conelusory recommendation of denial from its medical consultant and the denials of other insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>companies in deciding that a pancreas transplant was investigational. The district court ruled that the decision was arbitrary and capricious and ordered a remand so the plan administrator could consider additional evidence that the beneficiary wanted to present. <em>See id. </em>In Levinson\u2019s case, Reliance \u2014 not the beneficiary \u2014 wanted a remand to consider evidence that would tend to show Levinson was not disabled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-4\">We find persuasive the Eighth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Davidson v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </em>958 F.2d 1093 (8th Cir.1992). In that case, Davidson contended that the district court erred in refusing to remand the case to the plan administrator to consider a vocational report and a psychiatrist\u2019s report prepared after litigation had commenced. <em>See id. </em>at 1095. The district court refused to remand, because <em>\u201cif </em>Davidson believed the evidence he now offers was necessary for Prudential to make a proper benefits determination, Davidson should have obtained this evidence and submitted it to Prudential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We find that this reasoning should apply with equal force to the insurance company as to the beneficiary. Reliance had more than adequate opportunities to establish an administrative record containing evidence contradicting Levinson\u2019s evidence pointing to disability on two occasions: when it first considered Levinson\u2019s claim and upon Levinson\u2019s administrative appeal. Reliance did not do this. It was not until after litigation commenced that Reliance obtained evidence contradicting Levinson\u2019s evidence that he was disabled under the policy. Therefore, the district court\u2019s refusal to remand the issue of Levinson\u2019s eligibility for benefits to Reliance should be upheld.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-5\"><em>Levinson, </em>245 F.3d at 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">Here, the evidence McCay seeks to submit was obtained not only post-litigation but post-remand. The district court found no indication that the information obtained post-remand could not have been obtained and submitted earlier, and McCay has not shown us otherwise. We, therefore, again conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting McCay\u2019s argument that he had \u201cthe right to submit new evidence in support of a failed disability application ... [in]to infinity.\u201d As a result, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the exhaustion doctrine barred review of McCay\u2019s disability determination, and we need not address his argument on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-7\">. As for McCay\u2019s claim that <em>Perrino </em>has been superseded by new administrative regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>tions, there is no Eleventh Circuit case law to this effect. Furthermore, the \"new\u201d administrative regulations allow a claimant to avoid exhaustion if \"the plan has failed to provide a reasonable claims procedure that would yield a decision on the merits of the claim.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-l(Z). But, we cannot say that the notice failed to provide a \"reasonable claims procedure\u201d in this case since, as the record shows, McCay eventually was able to follow the appeals procedures, albeit thirteen months after the deadline to appeal had run. <em>See Tindell v. Tree of Life, </em>672 F.Supp.2d 1300, 1312 (M.D.Fla.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
