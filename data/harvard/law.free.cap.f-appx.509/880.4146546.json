Robert E. O\u2019Neill, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Tampa, FL, Robert Edward Bodnar, Jr., Daniel C. Iriek, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Orlando, FL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b902-11\">Andrew Joseph Chmelir, Jacobson, McCelan, Chmelir &amp; Ferwerda, Winter Springs, FL, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b902-13\">Before BARKETT, MARTIN and EDMONDSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b902-14\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b902-15\">Milton Paulk appeals his 180-month sentence, imposed after he pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-16\">Before Paulk\u2019s change-of-plea hearing, the government filed a \u201cNotice of Essential Elements, Maximum Penalties and Factual Basis\u201d that said, among other things, that Paulk\u2019s offense carried a statutory maximum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. During Paulk\u2019s change-of-plea hearing, the magistrate judge also told Paulk that he was subject to a maximum prison sentence of ten years. Paulk pleaded guilty without a written plea agreement, and the magistrate judge recommended that Paulk\u2019s plea be accepted. The district court accepted Paulk\u2019s plea and adjudged him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-18\">In preparing Paulk\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report, the probation officer discovered that Paulk had additional convictions \u2014 of which the government had been unaware \u2014 for violent felonies and serious drug offenses. Based on these convictions, the probation officer determined that Paulk qualified as an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) and, thus, was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-19\">Paulk filed an unopposed motion to withdraw his guilty plea, arguing that the magistrate judge had advised him incorrectly about the potential penalties he faced.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-20\">At a hearing on his motion, the district court agreed that Paulk could withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-21\">But Paulk declined to do so. The court told Paulk that the magistrate judge had been incorrect about the ten-year maximum sentence. The court explained that \u2014 because Paulk qualified as an armed career criminal \u2014 he was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. Paulk said that he understood but that he did not want to withdraw his plea. Paulk also preserved the right to object during his sentencing hearing to a sentence greater than ten years\u2019 imprisonment. Because Paulk withdrew his motion to withdraw his plea, the court denied the motion as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-22\">Later, at the sentencing hearing, Paulk \u2014 conceding that he had no legal authority to support his position \u2014 sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>specific performance of his \u201cplea agreement\u201d which he alleged included a ten-year maximum sentence. The court overruled the objection and sentenced Paulk to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">On appeal, Paulk contends that the government breached its plea agreement by seeking a sentence that exceeded ten years\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We review <em>de novo </em>whether the government has breached a plea agreement. <em>United States v. De La Garza, </em>516 F.3d 1266, 1269 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">The government is bound by promises it makes to a defendant to induce the defendant to plead guilty. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>132 F.3d 628, 630 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cTo determine whether the government breached the plea agreement, we must first determine the scope of the government\u2019s promises.\u201d <em>Raulerson v. United States, </em>901 F.2d 1009, 1011 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">As a threshold matter, we see no binding plea agreement between Paulk and the government. That no written plea agreement exists is clear. And nothing evidences that Paulk pleaded guilty pursuant to an oral plea agreement. During the change-of-plea hearing, the magistrate judge asked Paulk whether anyone had promised him anything in exchange for his guilty plea. Paulk replied only that, before his plea, his lawyer had told him that he did not qualify for an ACCA enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">Although the government\u2019s \u201cNotice of Essential Elements, Maximum Penalties and Factual Basis\u201d said that Paulk\u2019s offense was \u201cpunishable by a term of not more than 10 years,\u201d the government made no promises about the length of sentence it would request or about whether it would seek an enhancement under the ACCA. Because Paulk fails to show that</p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">the government promised to avoid seeking a sentence exceeding ten years, he cannot show a breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">In addition, when a defendant qualifies as an armed career criminal, the ACCA requires district courts to impose an enhanced sentence \u201cregardless of whether the Government affirmatively seeks such enhancement.\u201d <em>See United States v. Co-bia, </em>41 F.3d 1473, 1475-76 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b903-9\"> Paulk does not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that he qualifies as an \"armed career offender\u201d under the ACCA. He also does not contend that his guilty plea was unknowing or involuntary or that the district court violated Fed.R.Civ.P. 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
