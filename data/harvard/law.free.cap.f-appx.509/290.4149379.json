Contesting only his sentence, Hooker contends: the district court\u2019s applying Guideline \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) (leadership or supervisory role) to enhance his sentence was erroneous because it was based solely on a buyer-seller arrangement between himself and a co-defendant; and that Guideline cannot be based on a single straw-purchase of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-23\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005). Assuming <em>arguendo </em>the specific contentions raised here were preserved in district court, they fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Regarding the Guideline \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement, Hooker contends his sworn factual basis established his role as a mere buyer, rather than a leader or supervisor; in the alternative, he contends that Guideline was erroneously applied due to the district court\u2019s mistaken view of the facts. \u201cA factual finding that a defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor under [] Guideline \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) is reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 560, 584 (5th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). Such findings are \u201cnot clearly erroneous as long as [they are] plausible in [the] light of the record\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The record shows Hooker: recruited codefendant Smith to purchase the firearm for him; picked Smith up and drove him to a gun show; selected the firearm; provided money for the purchase; and paid Smith $40 to conduct the transaction. The court\u2019s finding Hooker to be a leader or supervisor of another participant in the offense under Guideline \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Hooker\u2019s alternative contention \u2014 that the district court mistakenly relied on his directing codefendant Hollins to purchase ammunition \u2014 is unsupported by the record. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>the court\u2019s relying on that fact was erroneous, Hooker\u2019s directing Smith to purchase the firearm renders such error harmless. <em>E.g., United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 753 (5th Cir.2009) (error harmless when ultimate sentence otherwise proper).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Regarding single straw-purchases of a firearm, Hooker contends the factors listed in Guideline \u00a7 3Bl.l\u2019s Application Note 4, as applied by case law, militate against applying the leadership-role enhancement to his sentence. Application Note 4 is irrelevant here: it lists factors distinguishing a defendant who has a leadership or organizational role in an offense from one who is merely a manager or supervisor for purposes of determining whether a four-or three-level adjustment is warranted under Guideline \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) or (b). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n.4. Instead, Hooker received a two-level increase under Guideline \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), which makes no distinction among leaders, organizers, managers, and supervisors. \u2018 For that reason, the cases Hooker cites for the proposition that a buyer-seller relationship is insufficient to support that enhancement are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b312-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
