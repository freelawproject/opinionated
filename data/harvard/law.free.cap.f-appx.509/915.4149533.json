We find application of the enhancement was not erroneous and, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-22\">Along with seven others, Dancer was charged with producing, using, and trafficking in counterfeit credit and debit cards, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 1029(a)(1) and (c), and conspiracy to do the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>same, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 1029(a)(1) and (c). Dancer pleaded guilty to both charges. The basic facts of the offense are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">One of Dancer\u2019s co-conspirators, Frederick Williams, bought stolen credit card numbers online from overseas. Dancer and the other co-conspirators gave Williams legitimate credit and debit cards in their own names, Williams used a specialized device to encode the fraudulent numbers onto those cards, and then the conspirators traveled up and down the interstate in crews to retailers to purchase gift cards and receive cash back. When inside stores, the conspirators would send to one another the checkout line numbers each intended to use via text message, so that each conspirator would know to use a different line. If a card was declined, the conspirator would return it to Williams, who waited outside with a laptop and an encoder, and Williams would re-encode the card with a different number. Afterwards, the conspirators would deliver fraudulently purchased gift cards to Williams, who would resell them online at a discount from face value.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">In total, there were more than 700 victims of the conspiracy, $3,899 million of attempted loss, and more than $400,000 of actual loss. Dancer was held responsible for more than 150 victims, $84,627.54 of attempted loss, and $36,950.34 of actual loss. Dancer does not challenge those findings on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">At sentencing, Dancer objected, among other things, to the 2-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C) for use of a sophisticated means that the presentence investigation report included in calculating his Sentencing Guidelines offense level. He contended the facts upon which the enhancement was based, encoding the cards and the repetitious nature of the scheme, were already accounted for in the enhancements he received for number of victims, loss amount, and the use of device-making equipment, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(ll), respectively. And, in part because he never used the equipment, he argued his guidelines calculation with the enhancement included overstated his culpability. The district court, however, overruled Dancer\u2019s objections and sentenced Dancer to concurrent terms of 46 months\u2019 imprisonment, the bottom end of his guidelines range with the enhancement. This is Dancer\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">A district court\u2019s finding that an offense involved sophisticated means- is a factfind-ing we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1199 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1066, 181 L.Ed.2d 781 (2012). We review <em>de novo </em>a defendant\u2019s claim that an enhancement included in calculating his guidelines range constituted impermissible double counting. <em>United States v. Webb, </em>665 F.3d 1380, 1382 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 292, 184 L.Ed.2d 172 (2012). \u201cImpermissible double counting occurs only when one part of the Guidelines is applied to increase a defendant\u2019s punishment on account of a kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by application of another part of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1226-27 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cDouble counting a factor during sentencing is permitted if the Sentencing Commission ... intended that result and each guideline section in question concerns conceptually separate notions relating to sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1227 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cAbsent a specific direction to the contrary, we presume that the Sentencing Commission intended to apply separate sections cumulatively, and, as a result, a defendant asserting a double counting claim has a tough task.\u201d <em>Webb, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>665 F.3d at 1382 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">We have little trouble concluding that the district court did not clearly err in finding the sophisticated-means enhancement was appropriate in this case. As the district court recognized, no particular action in a scheme needs to be especially complicated for the enhancement to be appropriate. <em>Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1179. Repetitive, coordinated steps can be sophisticated, even if no single step is particularly complex. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThere is no requirement that each of a defendant\u2019s individual actions be sophisticated in order to impose the enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1267 (11th Cir.2010). Repeatedly purchasing stolen credit card numbers from abroad, encoding those numbers onto legitimate credit cards, re-encoding cards on the fly, and buying otherwise legitimate gift cards for resale to otherwise legitimate online purchasers to avoid detection is, in the language of the guidelines commentary, \u201cespecially complex or especially intricate offense conduct [in] ... the execution and concealment of [the] offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10) cmt. n. 8(C). We discern no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that the totality of the fraudulent scheme in which Dancer participated was complex and intricate enough to warrant the sophisticated-means enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Dancer also argues that including the sophisticated-means enhancement in his guidelines calculation was impermissible double counting. He contends other enhancements he received already accounted for the use of the encoder and the scope of the enterprise, and the other factors the district court considered, like the use of a laptop and internet purchases, could not, without those double-counted facts, independently constitute sophisticated means. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">Nothing Dancer presents to us suggests the Sentencing Commission did not intend the sophisticated-means enhancement to apply cumulatively with the other enhancements in \u00a7 2B1.1(b) that Dancer received. <em>See Webb, </em>665 F.3d at 1382. Indeed, the guidelines indicate to the contrary. \u201cThe offense level adjustments from more than one specific offense characteristic within an offense guideline are applied cumulatively\u201d absent circumstances not present here. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 4(A). Commentary to the guidelines specifically provides that if the conduct on which a sophisticated-means enhancement is based also forms the sole basis for an impeding or obstructing justice enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, then only the sophisticated-means enhancement applies. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10) cmt. n. 8(C). But the commentary identifies no other guideline that the Commission intended should not be applied cumulatively with the sophisticated-means enhancement. Further, the focus of the loss amount, victim number, and device-making enhancements Dancer identifies is on sentencing concepts that are distinct from how like facts, in conjunction with other facts of Dancer\u2019s offense, support a finding that the offense involved sophisticated means. <em>See Dudley, </em>463 F.3d at 1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">Because Dancer has not shown that application of the sophisticated-means enhancement in the calculation of his guidelines-range sentence was erroneous or constituted impermissible double counting, we affirm his consecutive 46-month sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
