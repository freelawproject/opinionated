We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Simmons injured his ankles at work on October 7, 2004. His employer, Respondent Northrop Grumman Ship Systems, Inc. (\u201cNorthrop\u201d), paid temporary total disability (\u201cTTD\u201d) benefits from October 8, 2004 until June 13, 2005. On July 27, 2005, Northrop received notice that Simmons filed a claim for additional compensation. Although Northrop controverted the claim, it paid Simmons TTD benefits for July 21 and 22, 2005, and reinstated TTD benefits on August 2, 2005. In 2006, while receiving TTD benefits, Simmons sought additional compensation for a back injury he also sustained in the 2004 work incident. Northrop disputed that injury but nevertheless continued to pay TTD benefits through May 10, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">At an informal conference before the District Director in July 2009, Simmons asserted that he should be allowed to be treated by a different physician, Dr. Ro-senfeld, and that Northrop owed him additional compensation for his back injury. The District Director disagreed, finding that Simmons was not authorized to switch physicians and Simmons needed to submit medical records from his treating physician, Dr. Juneau, to determine whether he was entitled to additional compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">Upon Simmons\u2019s request, the case was transferred to the Office of Administrative Law Judges for a formal hearing in August 2009.' The ALJ found that (1) Simmons\u2019s back injury was caused by the 2004 work-incident; and (2) Northrop had constructively denied Simmons treatment because Dr. Juneau stated that he could do nothing further to help alleviate Simmons\u2019s back pain. Accordingly, the ALJ concluded Simmons did not need authorization to see Dr. Rosenfeld and awarded Simmons TTD compensation and medical benefits for the back injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">Following the ALJ\u2019s award of benefits, Simmons\u2019s counsel filed fee applications with both the district director and the ALJ, asserting that he was entitled to employer-paid attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 28(a) and \u00a7 28(b) of the LHWCA. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 928(a)-(b). The District Director found that because Northrop had voluntarily paid some benefits and did not reject any of his recommendations, Simmons\u2019s counsel was not entitled to employer-paid attorney\u2019s fees under either provision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In contrast, the ALJ held Northrop liable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 28(a) because Simmons prevailed on the issues whether he was authorized to switch physicians and receive benefits for his back injury. The BRB, concluding that the requirements of neither \u00a7 28(a) nor \u00a7 28(b) had been met, affirmed the District Director\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees and reversed the ALJ\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees, Simmons timely petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">This court conducts a de novo review of the BRB\u2019s rulings of law. <em>Andrepont v. Murphy Exploration &amp; Prod. Co., </em>566 F.3d 415, 417 (5th Cir.2009). An ALJ\u2019s findings of fact are upheld when they are supported by substantial evidence and are consistent with the law. <em>Gulf Best Elec., Inc. v. Methe, </em>396 F.3d 601, 603 (5th Cir.2004). This court affords <em>Skidmore </em>deference to the director\u2019s interpretations of the LHWCA, examining \u201cthe thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it'power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(quoting <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 164, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944)).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Section 28(a) only applies when \u201cthe employer ... declines to pay <em>any </em>compensation\u201d within thirty days after receiving notice of a claim for compensation. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 928(a) (emphasis added). When Northrop received notice of Simmons\u2019s initial claim on July 27, 2005 it compensated Simmons within thirty days by reinstating TTD benefits on August 2, 2005. That Simmons subsequently sought <em>additional </em>benefits for his back injury does not change the fact that Northrop timely paid <em>some </em>compensation for the claim. <em>See Andrepont, </em>566 F.3d at 418-19; <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Director, </em>474 F.3d 109, 113 (4th Cir.2006). The BRB correctly concluded that \u00a7 28(a) is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Section 28(b) may apply to this case in which Northrop paid some compensation \u201cand thereafter a controversy developed over the amount of additional compensation, if any, to which the employee [Simmons] may be entitled\u201d for his back injury. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 928(b). Under \u00a7 28(b), attorney\u2019s fees may only be awarded against the employer when the following statutory events have occurred: (1) an informal conference; (2) a written recommendation from the deputy or Board; (3) the employer\u2019s refusal to adopt the written recommendation; and (4) the employee\u2019s procurement of a lawyer\u2019s services to achieve a greater award than the employer was willing to pay after the written recommendation. <em>Carey v. Ormet Primary Aluminum Corp., </em>627 F.3d 979, 982-83 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Here, the first two requirements of \u00a7 28(b) were met because an informal conference was held July 2009; and the District Director issued a written recommendation as detailed above. However, the third requirement was not fulfilled because Northrop did not refuse to adopt the those recommendations. It is irrelevant that Northrop subsequently disagreed with the <em>ALJ\u2019s </em>contrary findings because \u00a7 28(b) mandates that the employer must refuse the written recommendation of the <em>deputy or Board. See Andrepont, </em>566 F.3d at 421. Further, nothing in the LHWCA or any case law supports Simmons\u2019s assertion that there is an \u201cequitable exception\u201d that allows fee-shifting even when \u00a7 28(b)\u2019s requirements are not fully met. Therefore, the BRB properly reversed the ALJ and affirmed the District Director\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees payable by Northrop pursuant to \u00a7 28(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Simmons also asserts that this is an action by a seaman \u201cfor wages or salvage or the enforcement of laws enacted for [his] health or safety\u201d so it can be prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>cuted without prepaying fees or costs or furnishing security therefor. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1916. Simmons, however, is a longshoreman bringing a claim under the LHWCA, which specifically excludes coverage for seamen. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3)(G); <em>McDermott Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Wilander, </em>498 U.S. 337, 347, 111 S.Ct. 807, 112 L.Ed.2d 866 (1991). Simmons is not entitled to any benefits granted to seamen under \u00a7 1916.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the decision of the Board denying employer-paid attorney\u2019s fees to Simmons.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b360-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-14\">. The district director subsequently denied Simmons's motions for reconsideration and ordered Simmons to pay his attorney pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 928(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
