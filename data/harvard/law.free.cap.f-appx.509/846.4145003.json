On appeal, Brand argues that the district court committed procedural error because it miscalculated his offense level and criminal history category under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) and (c)(2). After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Because Brand did not specifically object to the district court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) and (c)(2) at the sentencing hearing, we review for plain error his sentencing arguments raised for the first time on appeal. <em>United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 842 (11th Cir.2009). To demonstrate plain error, the defendant must establish that (1) there is an error; (2) that is plain; (3) affecting his substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>In order to be plain enough for the plain error rule, an asserted error must be clear from the plain meaning of a statute or constitutional provision, or from a holding of the Supreme Court or this Court. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>627 F.3d 1372, 1381 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see also United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th Cir.2006) (stating that, when the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it). The defendant loses under the third prong if the effect of the error on the result is uncertain or indeterminate, such as where this Court would have to speculate. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1301, 1306 (11th Cir.2005). A failure to object to a PSI\u2019s factual allegations admits those facts for sentencing purposes and precludes the argument that they contained errors. <em>See Beckles, </em>565 F.3d at 843-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">A defendant who is subject to an enhanced sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) is an armed career criminal. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(a). An armed career criminal\u2019s offense level is the greatest of: (1) the offense level applicable from Chapters Two and Three; or (2) the offense level from \u00a7 4B1.1 (Career Offender) if applicable; or (3)(A) 34, if the defendant used or possessed the firearm in connection with a controlled substance offense, as defined in \u00a7 4B1.2(b); or (3)(B) 33, otherwise. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.4(b). An armed career criminal\u2019s criminal history category is the greatest of (1) the criminal history category from Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History), or \u00a7 4B1.1 (Career Offender) if applicable; or (2) Category VI, if the defendant used or possessed the firearm in connection with a controlled substance offense, as defined in \u00a7 4B1.2(b); or (3) Category IV. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">We have given an expansive construction to \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A)\u2019s phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d and rejected the more restrictive \u201cfacilitation test,\u201d <em>ie., </em>that the firearm had to facilitate the other felony offense. <em>United States v. Young, </em>115 F.3d 834, 836-38 (11th Cir.1997). Likewise, we have given an expansive interpretation to the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d as contained in other guideline sections, and refused to require that the firearm facilitate the other felony offense. <em>See, e.g., United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number><em>States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 695-96 (11th Cir.2002) (addressing former \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5)); <em>United States v. Matos-Rodriguez, 188 F.3d 1300, </em>1308-09 (11th Cir.1999) (addressing former \u00a7 2B5.1(b)(3)). In interpreting the analogous phrase in former \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), we said that an enhancement under that section may be applied when the two felony offenses are for different conduct, but are committed contemporaneously. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>276 F.3d 1231, 1234 (11th Cir.2001). Moreover, in certain circumstances, mere possession of a firearm can be enough to apply the \u00a7 2K2.1(b) enhancement. <em>Id. </em>We have also upheld as not clearly erroneous a \u00a7 4B 1.4(b)(3)(A) enhancement where the defendant had heroin, a gun, and $377 on his person at the same time. <em>United States v. Gainey, </em>111 F.3d 834, 837 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">In light of our expansive interpretation of the phrase \u201cin connection with,\u201d Brand cannot show that the district court plainly applied the wrong legal standard or proceeded without an adequate factual basis in determining his offense level and criminal history category under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) and (c)(2). The presen-tence investigation report\u2019s unchallenged facts established that Brand had sold cocaine base <em>and </em>a firearm to an undercover officer in the same transaction, thereby fulfilling the parties\u2019 earlier agreement. The firearm sale thus constituted an essential part of that particular drug sale. Although Brand\u2019s firearm possession need not have facilitated the drug offense, the firearm sale may have facilitated the drug sale by allowing Brand to become a single source for crack and firearms, or facilitated his relationship with the undercover detective, a known drug buyer. The district court did not plainly err in concluding that Brand possessed the firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d his controlled substance offense pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) and (0(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b870-9\">MARTIN, Circuit Judge, concurs in result.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
