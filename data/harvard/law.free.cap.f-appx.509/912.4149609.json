On appeal, Galloway argues the district erred in concluding he presented no direct evidence of discrimination and that, alternatively, he established a circumstantial case of discrimination by showing he could perform the essential functions of the job. He also asserts the district court erred in concluding he failed to show a reasonable accommodation existed. After review, we affirm the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, drawing all inferences and reviewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Ellis v. England, </em>432 F.3d 1321, 1325 (11th Cir.2005). Summary judgment should be entered against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an essential element of its ease, and on which it bears the burden of proof at trial. <em>Mize v. Jefferson City Bd. of Educ., </em>93 F.3d 739, 742 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-17\">To establish an ADA discrimination claim, a plaintiff must show, <em>inter alia, </em>that he was a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d <em>See Collado v. United Parcel Serv., Co., </em>419 F.3d 1143, 1152 n. 5 (11th Cir.2005). A \u201cqualified individual\u201d is an individual who \u201ccan perform the essential functions\u201d of the desired employment position \u201cwith or without reasonable accommodation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). Essential functions \u201c \u2018are the fundamental job duties of a position that an individual with a disability is actually required to perform,\u201d\u2019 <em>Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., </em>492 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2007), and \u201cconsideration shall be given to the employer\u2019s judgment as to what functions of a job are essential,\u201d <em>Davis v. Fla. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir.2000). An accommodation qualifies as \u201creasonable\u201d only \u201cif it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job.\u201d <em>Holly, </em>492 F.3d at 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-18\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Galloway presented direct evidence of discrimination, he nonetheless failed to present evidence to establish an essential element of his case: that he was a qualified individual under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>the ADA. <em>See Collado, </em>419 F.3d at 1152 n. 5; <em>Mize, </em>93 F.3d at 742. Specifically, the district court correctly concluded Galloway was not a qualified individual because he could not perform one of the job\u2019s essential functions, driving, with or without reasonable accommodation. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). The evidence below, including Aletheia House\u2019s written job description and the testimony of its chief operating officer, established that driving was an essential function of the position for which Galloway applied. Galloway created no genuine issue of material fact as to whether driving was an essential function, stating simply that he was not applying to a transportation position. Galloway\u2019s response does not address the need to drive as part of the case manager position, and is thus insufficient to create an issue of fact. Moreover, Galloway failed to establish any of his proposed accommodations were reasonable, as none of them would enable him to perform the essential function of driving. <em>Holly, </em>492 F.3d at 1256.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Aletheia House.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b935-13\">. We may affirm a district court\u2019s judgment based on any ground that finds support in the record. <em>Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., </em>257 F.3d 1249, 1256 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b936-10\">. Galloway failed to offer any substantive argument regarding the \"reassignment\u201d accommodation in his initial brief and has therefore abandoned the issue. See <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
