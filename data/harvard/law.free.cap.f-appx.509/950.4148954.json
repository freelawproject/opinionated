We substitute the following opinion for our original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-23\">Crisanto Diego Trejos Ortiz appeals his sentence of 180 months of imprisonment, following his pleas of guilty to smuggling goods from the United States, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 554, 2, and possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(1). Trejos Ortiz appeals the enhancement of his sentence for being a manager of an organization that illegally exported components for firearms and the reasonableness of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-24\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it enhanced Trejos Ortiz\u2019s sentence for his role as a manager. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>defendant is subject to a three-point increase in his base offense level if he served as \u201ca manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) (Nov.2011). The district court could determine Trejos Ortiz\u2019s role based on the facts in his presentence investigation report. <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 832 (11th Cir.2006). Although Trejos Ortiz objected to his classification as a manager, at his sentencing hearing, he challenged only the \u201clegal issue\u201d of how his conduct \u201ccomparted] ... [to] the other conspirators that were involved and the different roles of all of them.\u201d Trejos Ortiz admitted, by \u201cfailing] to object to [the] allegations of fact in [his presentence report],\u201d <em>United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006), that he provided currency, shipping information, and storage locations for the organization; he rented a garage used to store and package components to export; and he gave instructions to other members of the organization. Trejos Ortiz also admitted to facts establishing that he had exercised \u201ccontrol over at least one other participant in the criminal activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Jennings, </em>599 F.3d 1241, 1253 (11th Cir.2010). Trejos Ortiz confessed to federal investigators that he directed David Loaiza to retrieve a shipment of 27 receivers and gave Loaiza cash and an automobile to transport the shipment. Trejos Ortiz argues that he was subordinate to Andres Campo, but that does not absolve Trejos Ortiz for the logistical support he provided the organization or his role in directing Loaiza to undertake activities that benefitted the organization. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>933 F.2d 1541, 1546-47 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion when it sentenced Tre-jos Ortiz to a term of 120 months for his smuggling crime to run consecutively to a term of 60 months for his firearm offense. At the request of the government, the district court varied upward from Trejos Ortiz\u2019s advisory guideline range of 87 to 108 months. The district court provided five reasons for its upward variance: (1) Trejos Ortiz\u2019s \u201cactions contributed to and led to the death of cohort Erik Comesana\u201d or, \u201c[a]t a minimum[,] [established that] he was an accessory after the fact\u201d; (2) the grouping of Trejos Ortiz\u2019s offenses did not account for his illegal possession of two firearms; (3) Trejos Ortiz \u201cwas involved ... [in a sophisticated operation to] ship[ ] firearms to Colombia, a source country\u201d; (4) he \u201cused his status as a DEA confidential informant ... [to] stay[ ] in the country and ... to commit further crimes\u201d; and (5) he had a \u201chistory of drug dealing and arms trafficking and [had] consistently manipulated the justice system.\u201d Trejos Ortiz challenges the finding that he was involved with the murder, but we cannot say that finding is clearly erroneous in the light of Trejos Ortiz\u2019s admissions that he had accompanied Comesana to lawyers\u2019 offices, monitored the status of Comesana\u2019s cooperation with authorities for Campo, saw Comesana\u2019s dead body, disposed of Comesana\u2019s vehicle, and continued thereafter to participate in the organization. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 945 (11th Cir.1999). The district court reasonably determined that an upward variance was necessary to address the statutory purposes of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Trejos Ortiz had violated the law repeatedly, twice entering the United States illegally, committed crimes of escalating violence, and flagrantly disregarded the law by feigning cooperation with authorities while attempting to convince third parties to dispose of incrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>ting evidence. Trejos Ortiz\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">We AFFIRM Trejos Ortiz\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
