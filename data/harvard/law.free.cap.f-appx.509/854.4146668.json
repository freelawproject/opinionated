Pyfrom\u2019s convictions stemmed from his role in an unsuccessful attempt to deliver more than 100 kilograms of marijuana from the Bahamas to South Florida. At sentencing, Pyfrom faced a guideline range of 63 to 78-months imprisonment based on a total offense level of 26 and a criminal history category of I.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">The district court sentenced Pyfrom to 63-months imprisonment. On appeal, Py-from argues that this sentence is unreasonable. We review the final sentence imposed by the district court for procedural and substantive reasonableness. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Pyfrom does not contend, nor is there any indication, that the district court committed a procedural error in determining his sentence. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cA sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court improperly calculates the Guidelines range, treats the Guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory, fails to consider the appropriate statutory factors, selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d). Rather, Pyfrom claims that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately consider whether his \u201cailing medical condition or his status as an alien\u201d warranted a variance below his guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In determining whether a sentence is substantively reasonable, we are guided by the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThese factors include the available sentences, the applicable Guideline range, the nature and circumstances . of the offense, and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, and provide the defendant with needed medical care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). \u201c[W]hen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">We are not persuaded by Pyfrom\u2019s argument that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to deviate below his guideline range based on his medical condition or his status as an alien. First, the record is clear that the district court took each of these factors into consideration when arriving at its sentencing determination. Second, the record is equally clear that the district court also considered other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, such as Pyfrom\u2019s offense conduct, his presentence report, his sentencing guidelines, as well as his family obligations. Finally, in arriving at its determination, the district court took into consideration Pyfrom\u2019s express request that, based on these factors, he receive a low-end guideline sentence of \u201c63 months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>In sum, nothing in this record suggests that Pyfrom\u2019s 68-month sentence, at the low end of his guideline range, was unreasonable. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. The district court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion and Pyfrom\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
