He argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court imposed a three-year term of supervised release, notwithstanding that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) provides that supervised release \u201cordinarily\u201d should not be imposed \u201cin a case in which supervised release is not required by statute and the defendant is a deportable alien who likely will be deported after imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">As Velasquez concedes, our review of his challenge to the procedural reasonableness of his sentence is limited to plain error because he did not raise this argument in the district court. <em>See United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 328 (5th Cir.2012); <em>see also Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). The parties disagree whether Velasquez\u2019s challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence was preserved. We need not determine whether plain error review is applicable because, as discussed below, Velasquez\u2019s arguments fail even under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The district court was aware of the provisions of \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) because they were set out in the presentence report, which the district court adopted. Given the statements that the district court made when it imposed the sentence, which addressed Velasquez\u2019s history and the importance of his understanding that he may not return to this country without permission, Velasquez fails to show that the district court procedurally erred because it failed to adequately explain its decision to impose a term of supervised release. <em>See Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 329-30. Additionally, Velasquez fails to show error as to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence since the district court\u2019s statements at sentencing provided support for the imposed term of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009); \u00a7 5D1.1, comment, (n.5). Although Velasquez originally asserted that the district court erred in failing to give notice of its intent to depart upwardly by imposing a term of supervised release, he concedes that the issue is foreclosed by <em>Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 329. He seeks, however, to preserve the issue for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
