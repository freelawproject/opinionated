The presen-tence investigation report concluded that Slater was responsible for 14 grams of cocaine and 1.61 grams of crack cocaine, resulting in a base offense level of 18. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>\u00a7 2D1.1 (Nov.2007). The PSI also concluded that Slater was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, which raised his base offense level to 34. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.1. At sentencing, the government agreed that Slater should receive a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 31. Combined with a criminal history category of VI, the resulting guidelines range was 188 to 235 months imprisonment. The district court varied downward and sentenced Slater to 84 months imprisonment, finding that to be \u201csufficient punishment.\u201d The court also indicated that in order to avoid sentencing disparities it had sentenced Slater to a term that was less than the sentences imposed on more culpable codefendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Slater filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), contending that Amendment 750 to the guidelines reduced his guidelines range. The district court referred that motion to a magistrate judge. The magistrate judge recommended that the motion be denied, concluding that Amendment 750 did not lower Slater\u2019s guidelines range because he was sentenced as a career offender. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and denied the motion. This is Slater\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cWhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the [career offender] sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330. While Amendment 750 reduced the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, it did not reduce the base offense levels for a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">Slater contends that his sentence was \u201cbased on the subsequently-reduced crack cocaine guidelines\u201d because the district court \u201cconsidered all the available information in fashioning its sentence,\u201d \u201cincluding] the crack guidelines contained in \u00a7 2D1.1.\u201d We disagree. Slater\u2019s guidelines range of 188 to 235 months imprisonment was calculated using the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. The district court varied downward from that guidelines range after considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the need to protect the public and the need to avoid sentencing disparities. There is no indication that the sentence imposed by the district court was based on the crack cocaine guidelines found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Because Slater\u2019s guidelines range was based on the career offender guideline, and because Amendment 750 did not lower that range, the district court was not authorized to reduce Slater\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
