He alleged denial of his substantive due process rights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; gender discrimination, in violation of Title IX, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681; and retaliation, in violation of Title IX and Title VI, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d. The district court dismissed Bowers\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">Bowers\u2019s complaint arose from events surrounding denial of his admission to the Medical College of Georgia (\u201cMCG\u201d). Bowers applied for \u2014 and was denied \u2014 admission to MCG in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. After his first two applications were denied, Bowers filed a complaint with the United States Department of Education Office of Civil Rights (\u201cOCR\u201d), alleging gender discrimination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bowers later filed a second complaint with the OCR alleging that MCG retaliated against him for filing his first OCR complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">After reviewing Bowers\u2019s 2009 application, Dr. Geoffrey Young (who was aware of Bowers\u2019s OCR complaints) and two other reviewers (who were unaware of the OCR complaints), unanimously recommended that the application be denied. Based on this recommendation \u2014 and on a summary prepared by Dr. Young that allegedly omitted favorable information about Bowers \u2014 the full admission committee denied Bowers\u2019s 2009 application. Bowers requested that the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia conduct a review of MCG\u2019s denial of his 2009 application based on race, gender, and age discrimination. The Board rejected Bowers\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-13\">MCG later rejected Bowers\u2019s 2010 application for admission: Bowers\u2019s 2006 Medical College Admissions Test (\u201cMCAT\u201d) score was too old to be considered by the admissions committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-14\">Bowers filed suit against MCG; the Board of Regents; Dr. Ricardo Azziz, President of MCG, in his official capacity; Dr. Douglas Miller, the dean of MCG, in this official capacity; Dr. Young, associate dean of admissions at MCG, in his official capacity; and Dr. Errol Davis, chancellor of the University System of Georgia, in his official capacity (\u201cDefendants\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court granted Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss <em>de novo, </em>accepting all well-pleaded facts in the complaint and all reasonable inferences drawn from those facts as true. <em>McGinley v. Houston, </em>361 F.3d 1328, 1330 (11th Cir.2004). To survive dismissal for failure to state a claim, \u201ca plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (quotations omitted). \u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1965. Mere conclusory statements in support of a threadbare recital of the elements of a cause of action will not suffice. <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Bowers raises several challenges to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint. Bowers first argues that the district court erred in failing to recognize a fundamental right to purchase a medical school education. To establish a claim under section 1983, a plaintiff must show that he \u201cwas deprived of a federal right by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). Under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, substantive due process \u201cprotects those rights that are \u2018fundamental,\u2019 that is, rights that are \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u2019\u201d <em>McKinney v. Pate, </em>20 F.3d 1550, 1556 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Bowers has not shown that Defendants deprived him of a fundamental right and, thus, has failed to state a claim under section 1983. Both the United States Supreme Court and this Court have concluded that no fundamental right to public education exists, let alone a fundamental right to a public medical school education. <em>See Plyler v. Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 2396-97, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982) (public elementary and secondary education is not a fundamental right protected by the Constitution); <em>San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 1299-1300, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973) (same); <em>C.B. v. Driscoll, </em>82 F.3d 383, 389 (11th Cir.1996) (\u201cThe right to attend a public school is a state-created, rather than a fundamental, right for the purposes of substantive due process.\u201d). We are reluctant to expand the scope of rights that may be considered \u201cfundamental\u201d for purposes of substantive due process, and we see no reason to do so here. <em>See McKinney, </em>20 F.3d at 1556.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">Bowers also argues that Defendants infringed on his substantive due process rights when they refused arbitrarily and capriciously to consider his 2010 admissions application because his MCAT scores were too old. The Supreme Court has warned that courts should avoid overriding genuinely academic decisions \u201cunless [the decision] is such a substantial departure from accepted academic norms as to demonstrate that the person or committee responsible did not actually exercise professional judgment.\u201d <em>Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, </em>474 U.S. 214, 106 S.Ct. 507, 513-14, 88 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">Bowers has not alleged that MCG\u2019s test score policy differs from policies followed by other medical schools. And we do not understand that MCG\u2019s policy constitutes a \u201csubstantial departure from accepted academic norms.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Bowers\u2019s conclu-sory statement that MCG\u2019s policy is arbitrary and capricious, without more, fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>state a substantive due process claim. <em>See Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Next, Bowers argues that he sufficiently asserted a claim for relief under Title IX.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He contends that MCG\u2019s method of computing applicants\u2019 prerequisite grade point averages (\u201cGPAs\u201d) \u2014 which includes applicants\u2019 grades in undergraduate math courses even though MCG does not require applicants to take math courses\u2014 discriminates intentionally against men because men statistically are more likely to take math courses. The complaint does not, however, allege that men who take math courses usually hurt their GPAs as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">Title IX provides that no person \u201cshall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We apply Title VII case law to assess Bowers\u2019s Title IX claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate treatment under this framework, Bowers must show that (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was subject to an adverse admissions action; (3) the school treated similarly situated applicants who were not members of his protected class more favorably; and (4) he was qualified. <em>See Burke-Fowler v. Orange Cnty., Fla., </em>447 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">\u201cAlthough a Title VII complaint need not allege facts sufficient to make out a classic <em>McDonnell </em>Douglas<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>prima facie </em>case, it must provide \u2018enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest\u2019 intentional ... discrimination.\u201d <em>Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol., </em>516 F.3d 955, 974 (11th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., </em>534 U.S. 506, 122 S.Ct. 992, 997, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002), and <em>Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1965). In addition to containing well-pleaded factual allegations, complaints must also meet the \u201cplausibility standard\u201d set forth in <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal. See Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949-50. This plausibility standard requires \u201cmore than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1949. \u201cWhere a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant\u2019s liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). Our analysis of the plausibility standard is \u201ccontext-specific\u201d and \u201crequires [us] to draw on [our] judicial experience and common sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">Bowers\u2019s complaint alleges that the inclusion of undergraduate math GPAs discriminates intentionally against men. But Bowers\u2019s argument hinges on an assumption \u2014 one which Bowers does not allege expressly \u2014 that grades in undergraduate math classes are typically lower than grades in MCG\u2019s prerequisite classes. While this assumption may be possible, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>is equally possible that \u2014 particularly for those electing to take undergraduate math courses \u2014 grades in undergraduate math classes are equal to, or even higher than, grades in MCG\u2019s prerequisite classes. In this case, the inclusion of math GPAs would either have no effect on or may actually increase an applicant\u2019s GPA. Because both of these scenarios could be possible, Bowers\u2019s \u201chas not nudged his claims of invidious discrimination across the line from conceivable 'to' plausible.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1950-51. Thus, the district court concluded correctly that Bowers failed to state a claim for discrimination under Title IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Bowers argues that Dr. Young retaliated against him for filing a civil rights complaint with the OCR by misrepresenting Bowers\u2019s credentials to the admissions committee. To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation under Title IX,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Bowers must show that (1) he engaged in statutorily protected expression; (2) Defendants took action that would have been materially adverse to a reasonable applicant; and (3) a causal link existed between the two events. <em>See Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2415, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006); <em>Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">To demonstrate causation, \u201ca plaintiff must show that the decision-makers were aware of the protected conduct, and that the protected activity and the adverse actions were not wholly unrelated.\u201d <em>Shannon v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., </em>292 F.3d 712, 716 (11th Cir.2002). Causation may be inferred by a close temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse action. <em>Thomas v. Cooper Light, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cBut mere temporal proximity, without more, must be \u2018very close.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">Bowers bases his retaliation claim on the temporal proximity between the date on which Dr. Young received notice of Bowers\u2019s OCR complaint and the date on which Dr. Young misrepresented Bowers\u2019s qualifications to the admissions committee. But, according to Bowers\u2019s complaint, Dr. Young knew about Bowers\u2019s OCR complaint on or around 2 October 2008 \u2014 more than three months before Dr. Young allegedly made misrepresentations to the admissions committee on 22 January 2009. A three-month temporal gap, without more, does not establish the needed inference of causation. <em>See id. </em>Bowers has failed to state a claim of retaliation stemming from his OCR complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">Bowers also contends that the Board of Regents retaliated against him, in violation of Titles VI<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and IX, for requesting review of MCG\u2019s decision to deny his 2009 admission application. To succeed on a retaliation claim, plaintiffs must show that defendants\u2019 actions were materially adverse, meaning that the challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>actions would \u201cdissuade[] a reasonable [person] from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry., </em>126 S.Ct. at 2415.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">The district court determined correctly that Bowers\u2019s allegations that he (1) was not allowed to address the Board at the Board\u2019s meetings, (2) was asked to leave before the Board\u2019s vote, (3) was not permitted to copy documents produced at the meetings, and (4) was followed by a security guard, were not sufficiently adverse to state a retaliation claim. Such acts would not dissuade a reasonable person from pursuing a claim of discrimination. <em>See id. </em>Although Bowers alleges that these acts caused him \u201cextreme emotional distress,\u201d his subjective view of the adversity of Defendants\u2019 acts is not controlling. <em>See Butler v. Ala. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>536 F.3d 1209, 1215 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">We accept that the Board\u2019s affirmation of MCG\u2019s denial of Bowers\u2019s 2009 admissions application was materially adverse. But Bowers has failed to allege a causal link between his protected conduct and the Board\u2019s adverse act. Instead, a strong and reasonable inference from Bowers\u2019s complaint is that the Board upheld the denial of his 2009 application because Bowers was unqualified. Bowers\u2019s complaint alleged that each member of MCG\u2019s admissions committee who was interviewed by the OCR said that Bowers\u2019s 2008 application was rejected because his grades were too low. The complaint also alleged that MCG rejected Bowers\u2019s 2006 and 2007 applications. Even drawing all inferences in Bowers\u2019s favor, MCG\u2019s repeated denials of Bowers\u2019s applications for admission make it probable that the Board upheld MCG\u2019s rejection of Bowers\u2019s 2009 application because Bowers was unqualified, not in retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). And we draw the parties\u2019 attention to the teachings of <em>Iqbal </em>and <em>Twombly.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-9\">. Because Bowers is a licensed lawyer, his complaint does not receive the liberal construction typically afforded <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs\u2019 complaints. <em>See Olivares v. Martin, </em>555 F.2d 1192, 1194 n. 1 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b930-10\">. Bowers also alleged that he was discriminated against based on his age but has not raised an age discrimination claim in this suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b930-15\">.The district court concluded that MCG was not a proper party to suit and, instead, construed the claims against MCG to be claims against Drs. Azziz, Miller, and Young in their official capacities. Because Bowers has failed to state a claim against either MCG or Drs. Azziz, Miller, or Young, it is unnecessary for us to resolve this proper-party issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b932-8\">.In addressing Bowers's Title IX disparate treatment claim, the district court said that claims arising from the denial of Bowers's 2006, 2007, and 2008 admissions applications were time-barred and that events occurring outside the applicable statute of limitations could not be used to support Bowers's claims. Because the district court's statute of limitations analysis was unnecessary to that court's dismissal of Bowers\u2019s claims, we need not resolve this issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b932-11\">.
