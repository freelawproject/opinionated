For the following reasons, we deny his motion as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-25\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b397-26\">In 1998, a jury convicted Gordon of possessing heroin. Gordon was sentenced to life in prison as a habitual offender. Gordon\u2019s conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and the Louisiana Supreme Court declined review. Gordon then sought post-conviction relief in the state courts and was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-27\">In 2004, Gordon filed an application under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in federal district court. He alleged (1) the State illegally used peremptory challenges to exclude ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>rors on the basis of race; (2) evidence was improperly admitted at trial; (3) he received ineffective assistance of counsel; and (4) he was wrongly adjudicated a habitual offender. The district court denied the application in November 2006. This court dismissed Gordon\u2019s appeal as untimely in August 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">While that federal litigation was proceeding, the Louisiana legislature amended the statute under which Gordon was sentenced. That amendment was prospective only, but the legislature later made the more lenient penalty provisions retroactive. <em>See </em>La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 15:308,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> effective May 16, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In May 2006, Gordon filed a motion in the state district court, arguing that his sentence should be reduced according to Section 15.308. In July 2006, the state district court denied the motion without a written opinion. In 2007, the Louisiana Supreme Court held that Section 15.308 did not authorize a court to reduce prisoners\u2019 sentences; instead, prisoners were required to apply to the Risk Review Panel for relief. <em>State v. Dick, </em>951 So.2d 124, 132-33 (La.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">After the <em>Dick </em>decision was released, Gordon filed in state district court what he termed a motion to correct an illegal sentence. Gordon asserted that the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Dick </em>decision failed to recognize that the delegation of sentencing to the executive branch violated separation of powers and violated his rights to due process and equal protection. In July 2011, the state district court denied his motion. Gordon then appealed to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal, which denied relief in September 2011 based on <em>Dick. </em>In June 2012, the Louisiana Supreme Court denied relief without a written opinion. In September 2012, Gordon filed a Section 2254 application in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In October, the district court held that Gordon was attempting to file a successive application. Consequently, that court transferred the case to this court so that Gordon could seek authorization to file his application. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">An inmate seeking to file a successive Section 2254 application must first obtain an order from the relevant court of appeals authorizing its filing in district court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). If the application is successive, the appellate court may allow the claim to proceed if it \u201crelies on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court,\u201d or the facts underlying the claim were previously undiscoverable and meet certain other requirements. \u00a7 2244(b)(2). Those provisions do not apply if the petition is not actually successive. An application is successive \u201cwhen it: 1) raises a claim challenging the petitioner\u2019s conviction or sentence that was or could have been raised in an earlier petition; or 2) otherwise constitutes an abuse of the writ.\u201d <em>In re Cain, </em>137 F.3d 234, 235 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">We need to identify Gordon\u2019s claim before deciding whether it could have earlier been brought. His <em>pro se </em>pleadings in the district court and here are not written with much precision. We interpret <em>pro se </em>pleadings with liberality. <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972). Gordon argues that Section 15:308 is retroactive, perhaps argues that the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Dick </em>decision is a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive by that court, and claims he has been denied the benefits of that new statute. In the district court, Gordon set out the Louisiana statutory change. In a lengthy attachment that he titled \u201cSupporting Facts,\u201d Gordon set out details about his sentence, gave his understanding of why he would be entitled to a reduced sentence under the statutory change, and then claimed his sentence \u201cdoes not comply with the New Amendment\u201d and other statutory changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The only legal claim in these filings is that Gordon is entitled to a reduced sentence under the changes in the law in Louisiana. He does not explicitly renew the constitutional claims he made in state court about the procedure that was established (i.e., requiring resort to the Risk Review Panel). Prior to the <em>Dick </em>decision, one intermediate Louisiana court had held that applying to that panel was not the exclusive remedy for an inmate under Section 15:308; the state Supreme Court disagreed and held that only the Risk Review Panel could reduce a sentence under Section 15:308. <em>Dick, </em>951 So.2d at 129. In May 2012, though, the Louisiana legislature repealed the provision, Subsection C, that provided for review by the Panel. 2012 La. Sess. Law Serv. 123 (West).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">It is at least clear that Gordon is making a claim that arises from Section 15:308. That section became effective on May 16, 2006. La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 15:308. Though long before that date a magistrate judge had recommended denial of Gordon\u2019s application, the district court did not adopt that recommendation until November 29, 2006. Between May and November, Gordon might have filed for leave to amend his application, though such leave could easily have been denied. <em>See United States v. Armstrong, </em>951 F.2d 626, 630 (5th Cir1992). We need not decide how this timing affects Gordon\u2019s ability to have added a claim about the new statute. That is because everything he has filed in federal or state court indicates his challenge to Section 15:308 depends on the <em>Dick </em>decision, handed down in January 2007 after Gordon\u2019s first Section 2254 application had been denied. In addition, any claim that it is unconstitutional to give the Risk Review Panel the sole authority over potential reductions in sentencing is affected by the legislature\u2019s repeal of that provision in 2012. Whatever claims might exist as to those events, they did not exist prior to the time Gordon\u2019s first application was denied in November 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">We do not under Section 2244(b)(3)(A) determine whether an inmate has an intelligible, viable, or exhausted claim. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>only determine whether he has a successive one, and, if so, whether he may nonetheless present it in district court. Gordon\u2019s application is not successive. Consequently, his motion for permission to file a successive petition is DENIED as unnecessary. Gordon may file his petition directly in the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
