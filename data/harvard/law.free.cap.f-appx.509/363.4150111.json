He asserts that the evidence was insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly transferred the images from his jasonz_14@yahoo.com account into his Shiloe26 Photobucket account on October 1, 2007. According to Owens, he could not have transferred the images because September 20, 2007, was Yahoo\u2019s cut-off date for transferring photos from its photo service to another photo website. He suggests that the images migrated from the Yahoo account to the Photobucket account on October 1, 2007, spontaneously or accidentally without any affirmative act by him. He also promotes a theory that someone else used his work computer to transfer the images while he was at home with a spider bite on October 1, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">When the evidence, all reasonable inferences therefrom, and all credibility determinations are viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, the evidence before the jury was sufficient for a reasonable jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Owens caused the transfer of the images of child pornography. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>74 F.3d 575, 577 (5th Cir.1996). Though he denied it and testified that he was home without access to a computer on the day of the transfer, Owens\u2019s credibility was undermined by the disappearance of his employer\u2019s records that would have confirmed his absence, by the work-related instant messages sent from Owens\u2019s account that day, and by his co-worker\u2019s testimony that Owens asked him to provide inaccurate information to support his claim that he was home. It fell within the sole province of the jury to weigh the credibility of the witnesses. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number><em>United States v. Zuniga, </em>18 F.3d 1254, 1260 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The jury heard testimony, including an admission by Owens, that he was the subscriber of the jasonz_14@yahoo.com account and the Shiloe26 Photobucket account. Evidence established that the accounts were password protected. The jury heard how the transfer of images between the accounts required an affirmative act by the subscriber, a virtual \u201chandshake\u201d in which the subscriber was required to manually enter both his Yahoo and Photobucket user names and passwords, even when that information was saved on his computer. A Yahoo representative also testified that Yahoo would not transfer images unless the subscriber first selected the particular images and requested the transfer. While other employees of PT Brokers may have used Owens\u2019s work computer, there was no evidence that someone else maintained the passwords to the two accounts, and his co-workers explicitly testified that they did not access Owens\u2019s digital photo albums, view or save child pornography on his computer or his Yahoo or Photo-bucket accounts, or view pornography websites on his computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In sum, there is no \u201cequal or nearly equal circumstantial support\u201d for the theory that the images of child pornography spontaneously transferred between Owens\u2019s two accounts. <em>See United States v. Moreland, </em>665 F.3d 137, 149 (5th Cir.2011). Nor is there \u201cequal or nearly equal circumstantial support\u201d for the theory that someone else caused the images to be moved from the Yahoo account into the Photobucket account. <em>See id. </em>We will not second guess the jury\u2019s reasonable construction of the evidence or its credibility determinations. <em>See Zuniga, </em>18 F.3d at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
