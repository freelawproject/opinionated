On August 11, 1958, the Commissioner sent a second letter, addressed to her in care of her daughter, Mrs. Pfeffer, at the latter\u2019s address, pointing out, however, that there was no statutory requirement of such remailing. This letter was received by Mrs. Pfeffer, to whom letters testamentary were issued later. The petition for review was filed with the Tax Court on November 10, 1958, i. e., within 90 days of the second letter, but not of the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Under I.R.C.1939, \u00a7 272(a)(1), (f), and (k), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 272(a) (1), (f, k), the first notice of deficiency was clearly sufficient; and since timely filing is made jurisdictional, the Tax Court correctly held that it could not hear the petition. Galvin v. C. I. R., 2 Cir., 239 F.2d 166. Cases cited, such as Dolezilek v. C. I. R., 94 U.S.App.D.C. 97, 212 F.2d 458, and Teel v. C. I. R., 27 T.C. 375, affirmed 10 Cir., 248 F.2d 749, do not hold to the contrary, while Eppler v. C. I. R., 7 Cir., 188 F.2d 95, and Cole v. C. I. R., 30 T.C. 665, affirmed 2 Cir., 272 F.2d 13, are not in point, since in each of these cases the first letter had been sent to the wrong address.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
