Among the errors assigned is the failure of the trial court to grant appellant\u2019s (defendant\u2019s) motions for acquittal at the close of the Government\u2019s case and, as well, after verdict. It is contended that the motions should have been granted \u201cin view of the serious discrepancies in the testimony of the government\u2019s own witnesses, and the serious nature of impeaching evidence, and the obvious discrepancies as to the government\u2019s own exhibits, and the various locations given for the place of sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-29\">It is true that there were discrepancies in the testimony but they were resolved against defendant, after a very fair charge by the court. We see no reason to disturb the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-30\">We have examined the other arguments for reversal, and find no error affecting substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-31\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-32\">EDGERTON, Circuit Judge, dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
