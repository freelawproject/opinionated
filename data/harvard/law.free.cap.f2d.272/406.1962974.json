Sec. 1.167(a)-3, is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">The regulation upon which petitioner bases its claim to the right to take depreciation over the life of the license (plus the life of the temporary license) provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-14\">\u201cIf an intangible asset <em>is known from, experience or other factors to be of use in the business </em>* * * for only a limited period, the length of which can be estimated with reasonable accuracy, such an asset may be the subject of a depreciation allowance. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-15\">We affirm the findings of fact and conclusions of the Tax Court, that, on the basis of the history of the regulation of the television industry by the Federal Communications Commission,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it is \u201cnot known from experience or other factors\u201d that this intangible asset is of use in the business for only a limited period.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-16\">Therefore, we affirm the decision of the Tax Court on its findings of fact and opinion, 31 T.C. 952, and on this court\u2019s earlier decision in Nachman v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 191 F.2d 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-17\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-26\">. The Commission has never refused to grant a renewal of a license once it has been granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
