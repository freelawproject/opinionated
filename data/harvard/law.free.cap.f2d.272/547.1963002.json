MILLER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">The appellant met his estranged wife on the street and made such a violent assault upon her that fifty-five stitches were required to close her wounds. At the close of the evidence for the prosecution in his trial under an indictment charging assault with a dangerous weapon, Smith moved for acquittal on the ground of insanity, based on the idea that the Government itself had shown \u201csome evidence\u201d of insanity, and had wholly failed to carry the resulting burden of proving sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial judge held there was no evidence of insanity and so denied the motion. He invited the appellant to offer evidence tending to show he was insane when he committed the crime but the appellant did not accept the invitation. Smith\u2019s motion for an instruction on insanity was also denied. Electing to stand on his theory that the prosecution\u2019s proof contained \u201csome evidence\u201d of insanity, thus throwing upon the Government the burden of proving sanity, he did not testify and offered no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-15\">On this appeal appellant complains principally that the trial judge erred in not submitting an insanity issue to the jury. He suggests the Government\u2019s proof revealed there had been a deterioration in his family and social relationships and in his work habits. He says it showed a history of violent outbursts of temper in which he flew into rages; that he believed, probably without cause, that his wife had been unfaithful to him. \u25a0 He says his attack on her was \u201cbizarre\u201d in that the proof showed he approached her from behind and put his hands over her eyes before he began the attack upon her which continued over a distance of several blocks, and in that he stamped on the foot of a woman in whose house his wife sought refuge and who was attempting to interfere with his attack. Finally appellant quotes the testimony of an officer that he was \u201cnot coherent\u201d after the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-16\">These things, appellant contends, constituted \u201csome evidence\u201d of a mental disease or defect which made it the duty of the trial judge to instruct the jury on insanity. He particularly emphasizes the officer\u2019s statement that appellant was \u201cnot coherent\u201d shortly after the attack was over, and seems to regard that as strong evidence of insanity. It would not be surprising if a sane man were somewhat incoherent soon after he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>engaged in such a violent outburst of temper. We do not regard a lack of coherence in such circumstances as indicative of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">But, interestingly enough, the officer\u2019s statement that Smith was \u201cnot coherent\u201d was erroneously made, and was contrary to the fact. After the appellant sought to derive advantage from the statement, the witness was recalled and said he had been confused as to the difference between \u201ccoherent\u201d and \u201cincoherent\u201d and had intended to say Smith was coherent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That this was true is conclusively shown by the fact that the officer had just finished repeating a perfectly coherent statement which appellant had made to him: that, within fifteen minutes after the arrest \u201cHe [Smith] said he cut his wife and he didn\u2019t know why he did it except for the fact she had been talking to a man and he just lost his temper.\u201d The officer also said the appellant told him he had used a knife which he later threw away. The fact that the police were unable to find the knife probably accounts for the verdict of simple assault only.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">To hold that an insanity issue is presented in a criminal case merely because the accused has become increasingly indolent, has a violent temper, and then makes an unprovoked and unusually violent attack upon another because of some concocted grievance, would be tantamount to holding, as many psychiatrists profess to believe, that any person who commits a crime is mentally ill and should receive treatment instead of punishment. We are not prepared to make such a ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">One more thing remains to be noticed. In the District of Columbia every juror is given a copy of a booklet called \u201cJury Service, A Manual for the jury,\u201d prepared by the Committee on Improving the Administration of Justice, District of Columbia Branch, American Bar Association. The jurors in this case received and read the handbook and said they would be inclined to be guided by the information contained therein. This, the appellant argues, disqualified them and requires reversal here. The trial judge asked: \u201cIs there any member of the panel who would not follow the law as I give it to you, if it appeared that there was something in this handbook which might be in conflict with the law as I give it to the jury?\u201d There was no response. We have examined the handbook and find it innocuous. Certainly it does not appear that it caused any prejudice to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Other errors assigned do not justify discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-14\">. Appellant says the court erred in allowing the officer to be recalled, because he had remained in the courtroom after his first testimony when the rule as to separation of witnesses had been applied, This was within the discretion of the trial judge, and we do not flunk he abused it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b621-11\">BAZELON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ajo-dedup-0\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">One ground of the present appeal is that the trial court should have directed a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity because the prosecution had failed to bear its burden of proof of sanity. This ground of the appeal is untenable. As we said in Wright v. United States, 1957, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 36, 39, 250 F.2d 4, 7, what the prosecution must prove to sustain its burden depends upon the kind of evidence of insanity that has been adduced to bring the issue into the case. The facts and circumstances here brought out by the witnesses, if they contain some proof of insanity so as to bring the issue into the case, also contain sufficient proof of sanity to preclude directing a judgment of acquittal by reason of insanity. The learned trial judge was therefore right in refusing such a direction and determining to submit the issue of mental responsibility to the jury under proper instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">The next day, however, the trial judge reversed himself and refused to submit the issue to the jury. That refusal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>which is the principal basis of this appeal, was, in my view, reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">We held in Tatum v. United States, 1951, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 386, 389, 190 F.2d 612, 615, that \u201cSanity is an \u2018essential\u2019 issue which, if actually litigated \u2014 that is, if \u2018some proof is adduced\u2019 tending to support the defense \u2014 must be submitted to the jury under the guidance of instructions.\u201d We added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">\u201cWe are aware, of course, that any attempt to formulate a quantitative measure of the amount of evidence necessary to raise an issue can produce no more than an illusory definiteness. But if some such measure is to be attempted, we think the best approach is that expressed by us in Kinard v. United States, 1938, [68 App.D.C. 250, 253-254, 96 F.2d 522, 525-526], a prosecution for murder in which the trial judge had not submitted the issue of manslaughter to the jury. We said there that \u2018 \u201cThe evidence might appear to the court to be simply overwhelming to show that the killing was in fact murder, and not manslaughter or an act performed in self-defense, and yet, so long as there was <em>some evidence relevant to the issue </em>of manslaughter, the credibility and force of such evidence must be for the jury, and cannot be matter of law for the decision of the court.\u201d \u2019 \u201d 88 U.S.App.D.C. at pages 389-390, 190 F.2d at pages 615-616.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">And we pointed out that, under Davis v. United States, 1895, 160 U.S. 469, 16 S.Ct. 353, 40 L.Ed. 499, it was of no consequence whether the \u201csome proof\u201d of insanity be adduced by the defense or the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The question here before us, then, is whether, in the totality of the evidence heard by the jury, there was \u201csome proof\u201d of insanity, requiring submission of the issue to the jury under proper instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">The evidence upon which appellant grounded his request for an insanity instruction, all adduced through prosecution witnesses, was, as my brethren summarize it, that appellant had \u201cbecome increasingly indolent, [had] a violent temper, and then [made] an unprovoked and unusually violent attack upon another because of some concocted grievance * * * .\u201d Added to this summary should be the fact that the circumstances of the attack were such that the jury could have considered them bizarre<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the further fact that a police officer testified that appellant was not coherent after the arrest (about which last fact I shall say more below).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">My brethren say that to present the insanity issue to the jury in this case \u201cwould be tantamount to holding, as many psychiatrists profess to believe, that any person who commits a crime is mentally ill and should receive treatment instead of punishment.\u201d I respectfully suggest that they misconceive the role of judge and jury. By sending the insanity issue to the jury, the judge does not decide that the defendant is mentally ill and should be acquitted by reason of insanity. He simply allows the jury to decide the issue on the evidence. It seems to me that not to present the insanity issue to the jury is tantamount to holding, as a matter of law, that <em>no </em>person who commits a crime in the circumstances of this case is mentally ill and should receive treatment instead of punishment. I doubt that any court should ever be prepared to make such a ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">Whether it is a fact, as my brethren say, that many psychiatrists believe that all criminals are mentally ill or whether, if that is a fact, those psychiatrists are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>correct in that belief are matters not before us. Nor is it for us to decide whether this appellant was mentally ill when he committed the assault. We need not even decide whether the proof of insanity in the record was sufficient to create a reasonable doubt as to appellant\u2019s sanity. Tatum v. United States, 88 U.S.App.D.C. at page 390, 190 F.2d at page 616. The single question before us is whether there was \u201csome proof\u201d of insanity. If there was, it was error to prevent the jury from exercising its prerogative of deciding whether or not appellant should go to a hospital for treatment, rather than to a prison for punishment. To me it is plain that there was \u201csome proof\u201d of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Perhaps the most significant item in the proof of insanity adduced in the trial was the following testimony of the police officer under cross-examination by defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">\u201cQ. At the time you talked to him did you advise him that he didn\u2019t have to tell you anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">A. I advised him \u2014 -I asked him what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">\u201cQ. You just asked him what happened? A. Yes sir, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">\u201cQ. You didn\u2019t tell him he had any right not to talk to you or say anything? A. I advised him that he had a right to counsel. He just more or less told me that without me asking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">\u201cQ. Was he coherent at the time ? A. No sir, I don\u2019t believe he was coherent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-12\">\u201cQ. He was not? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-13\">\u201cQ. And you say he told you he just didn\u2019t know why he did this? A. He told me it was more a fit of temper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-15\">\u201cQ. In a fit of rage? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-16\">Although the prosecutor then examined the officer on re-direct, he made no attempt to elicit any revision of the above testimony. The next day, however, after both sides had rested and after the trial judge had stated that he would give the jury instructions on the issue of sanity, the prosecutor stated that he thought the officer had meant to testify that the appellant was <em>coherent, </em>rather than <em>incoherent. </em>There ensued a long discussion in open court, in the course of which the prosecutor said, <em>inter alia: </em>\u201cI submit that if that officer were put on the stand, he would tell you that he misunderstood the question * * * The officer was present during this discussion and heard all that was said. The court, over objection, then allowed the prosecution to reopen its case to place the officer on the stand again. The witness then testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-18\">\u201cQ. Officer Owens, yesterday you were asked this question by counsel for Walter U. Smith * * * :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-19\">\u201c\u2018Was he coherent at the time?\u2019 To which your answer was: \u2018No sir, I do not believe he was coherent.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-21\">Now did you understand that question when it was placed to you, sir? A. I was confused with that question. My apologies to counsel and to the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-23\">\u201cThe Court: I can\u2019t understand you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-24\">\u201cThe Witness: I was confused about that question, and my apologies to the Court and counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-25\">\u201cQ. [Assistant U. S. Attorney], How were you confused ? A. I thought, I was confused by the word \u2018incoherent\u2019 and the word \u2018coherent.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-26\">\u201cQ. Is it your testimony that you thought that the word used was \u2018incoherent\u2019? A. Yes, sir, I believe that is right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-27\">On cross-examination, the officer stated that he had heard every word of the preceding argument about what his testimony meant. He further testified that the prosecutor had approached him in the corridor the previous day; that they \u201chad a talk about the word \u2018incoherent\u2019 and \u2018coherent\u2019 <em>\u201d; </em>that the prosecutor explained to him that he had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d in the words; and that, when he went to roll call that night, he found in the precinct complaint book an order for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>him to </em>report back to <em>the </em>courtroom <em>in </em>the morning. A defense motion to strike the officer\u2019s new testimony was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">On the strength of the officer\u2019s new testimony, my brethren treat the record as showing appellant was coherent after the arrest, rather than incoherent. I do not suggest that it is improper for the prosecutor to attempt to correct mistaken testimony. While the fact that the discussion of the nature of the alleged mistake was conducted in the presence of the witness is disturbing, that was a matter of the trial court\u2019s discretion and I need not disagree with my brethren\u2019s conclusion that there was no abuse of that discretion. What my brethren disregard, however, is that the prosecutor could very easily have clarified the officer\u2019s confusion, if there was any, in his re-direct examination; that rather than follow that natural course, he waited until he could have a private talk with the witness in which he \u201cexplained\u201d to the witness the nature of the alleged mistake; and that, only after this explanation, was the witness recalled. Such conduct on the part of the prosecutor is grossly improper. The trial court, of course, knew nothing of these circumstances when he permitted the witness to be recalled. But, the circumstances having come out in the witness\u2019 testimony, it was an abuse of discretion to deny appellant\u2019s motion to strike the \u201ccorrected\u201d testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">I would, therefore, hold that the officer\u2019s revision of his testimony should have been stricken and would read the record, minus that evidence, as presenting some proof of insanity requiring submission of the issue to the jury. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of conviction and remand the case <em>for a </em>new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">Another matter which appears in this record deserves comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">Even before the officer \u201ccorrected\u201d his testimony, the trial judge had refused to submit the issue of insanity to the jury on the ground that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-13\">\u201c * * * There has been no lay testimony \u2014 lay, expert or professional testimony that this defendant is suffering from any mental disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-14\">\u201cNow maybe incoherence might be a symptom in some cases to a practiced, experienced mind, of insanity. But the jury doesn\u2019t have that, I don\u2019t have that, and you [defense counsel] don\u2019t have that capacity. You are not trained in that. * * * what is there here to justify an instruction on insanity? Only an inference that a jury may draw that incoherency shows a mental disease. You don't even have a lay witness to say that he is of unsound mind. That is my difficulty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-15\">The foregoing statement seems to reflect the clearly erroneous view that, unless there is opinion testimony to the effect that evidence offered of symptoms or manifestations of mental disorder or defect does reflect mental disorder or defect, such evidence may not be considered either by the court for the purpose of raising the insanity issue, Tatum v. United States, 88 U.S.App.D.C. at page 390, 190 F.2d at page 616, or by the jury for the purpose of resolving that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-16\">Opinion testimony, of course, may be helpful, and even persuasive to the court or jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But it is crystal clear from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>our decision in Tatum v. United States, supra, that such testimony is not essential to raise the issue of insanity. And it is equally clear from our decision in Misenheimer v. United States, 106 U.S.App.D.C. -, 271 F.2d 486, that the jury may consider \u201cunder proper instructions, any symptoms and manifestations of mental disorder\u201d in resolving that issue. As we reiterated in Carter v. United States, 1957, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 227, 237, 252 F.2d 608, 616, 618, \u201cThe conclusions, the inferences from the facts are for the trier of the facts.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-9\">. Appellant\u2019s wife, the victim of the attack, testified that he first placed his hands over her eyes, that he said nothing for a while, and that he then began to beat her and continued the beating as they went down the street for a distance of about a block and a quarter, all the while saying things that made no sense to her. Another witness testified that, as appellant was dragging his wife along the street, he stopped to bind up her wound with a handkerchief; and that, when the police arrived, appellant sat down and held the victim in his arms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b624-6\">. An explanation for the failure of the de-. fense to obtain a psychiatric examination and investigation appears from the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">\u201cDefense Counsel: If it were necessary, your Honor, I perhaps might be able to obtain a psychiatrist, without money I can\u2019t pay him, I can\u2019t get him. If I could make a phone call to get him to come in, if your Honor will permit me to open my case again, I can put him on the stand and he will tell your Honor that these facts which have been put into the record indicate that it is quite likely that this poor man is suffering from some mental disease or defect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-18\">\u201cThe Court: Of course I will let you do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-19\">\u201cCounsel: Now I have no money. I can\u2019t bring him in. This poor man is indigent. I am court-appointed as your Honor knows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-18\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>\u201cThe Court: I know. I think if you applied to the Court you probably could have gotten the government to pay for a psychiatrist, to make some showing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-19\">\u201cCounsel: Frankly, your Honor, at this point I am so convinced in my mind that there is some evidence in the record sufficient to meet the requirements of the law as laid down in this jurisdiction * * * <em>it</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
