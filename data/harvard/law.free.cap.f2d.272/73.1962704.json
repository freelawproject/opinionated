Massachusetts Bonding and Insurance Company became surety in accordance with the aforesaid Act. Foster-Newman subcontracted with Benjamin Lessner Co., Inc. Less-ner purchased material from plaintiff-appellee, Old Dominion Iron and Steel Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Lessner failed to pay plaintiff for the material supplied. Plaintiff now invokes the provisions of the Miller Act, claiming that sufficient notice was given the prime contractor, within the time prescribed by the Act, so as to permit the plaintiff to recover on the bond.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff seeks recovery of $3300, the value of the material supplied the subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">We are brought to the crux of the case by a review of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence which plaintiff contends constitutes sufficient notice under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">On January 22, 1957, within the 90 day period, Lessner wrote a letter<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to Foster-Newman, advising them of outstanding claims, including plaintiff\u2019s claim, against Lessner. The letter also stated that Lessner would \u201cindemnify\u201d and \u201chold harmless\u201d Foster-Newman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>from any such claims. It is admitted that the plaintiff at that time had no knowledge of this letter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Later, however, on February 12, 1951, Lessner wrote to the plaintiff <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> advising plaintiff \u201cwe have a considerable amount of money coming to us\u201d and \u201cwe have even gone so far as to list the accounts with the prime contractor * * * so that your interests would be protected.\u201d This letter was admitted in evidence in the court below, over objection, to show that the plaintiff had notice that the letter of January 22, 1957 had gone to the prime contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Briefly stated, the plaintiff\u2019s argument is that since the subcontractor advised the prime contractor that he (subcontractor) had a number of creditors, of which plaintiff was one, and that since the subcontractor had told the plaintiff that he (subcontractor) had listed plaintiff\u2019s claim with the prime contractor, the notice requirements of the Miller Act were satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\"> We cannot agree. Having in mind that the applicable section of the Miller Act is \u201cremedial\u201d and should be liberally construed,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> *nevertheless we find that the plaintiff here did nothing to secure the protection and benefits afforded him by the Act. As was stated in the Bowden case,'<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>' the provisions of the Act require a minimum of attention and effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-16\">In the Fleisher case,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Supreme Court said: \u201cWe think that a distinction should be drawn between the provision explicitly stating the condition precedent to the right to sue and the provision as to the manner of serving notice.\u201d 311 U.S. at page 18, <em>61 </em>S.Ct. at page 83. Certainly that case, in which there was written notice from the plaintiff-supplier to the prime contractor, does not relieve the plaintiff here of the responsibility of giving some notice himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-17\">The letter of February 12, 1957,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> does not avoid the explicit result of the Bow-den case, supra. In neither the Bowden case nor the case at bar did the plaintiff-supplier take any action to protect his interests by complying with the Act. The mere writing of a letter by the subcontractor to the plaintiff, informing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>plaintiff that his claim had been listed with the prime contractor, cannot cure the fatal defect in plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">It must be noted that in the .Coffee case, supra, there was a written exhibition to the contractor by the claimant as a notice of his claim. In the Houston case<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> there was \u201coral notice to principal contractor\u201d from the claimant, and a written \u201cacknowledgment of the request, and full recognition of Denton\u2019s (subcontractor) .indebtedness to Trane (ma-terialman).\u201d. In the Fleisher case, supra, and the Birmingham Slag case, supra, there was also written notice from the claimant to the prime contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">' The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded with directions to enter judgment for the appellant with costs to be paid by appellee.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-6\">. Section 2 of the Act of August 24, 1935, c. 642, 49 Stat. 794, 40 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 270b, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj\">\u201c(a) Every person wiio has furnished labor or material in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract, in respect of which a payment bond is furnished under section 270a of this title and who has not been paid in full therefor before the expiration of a period of ninety days after the day on which the last of the labor was done or performed by him or material was furnished or supplied by him for which such claim is made, shall have the right to sue on such payment bond for the amount, or the balance thereof, unpaid at the time of institution of such suit and to prosecute said action to final execution and judgment for the sum or sums justly due him: <em>Provided, however, </em>That any person having direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor but no contractual relationship express or implied with the contractor furnishing said payment bond shall have a right of action upon the said payment bond upon giving written notice to said contractor within ninety days from the date on which such person did or performed the last of the labor or furnished or supplied the last of the material for which such claim is made, stating with substantial accuracy the amount claimed and the name of the party to whom the material was furnished or supplied or for whom the labor was done or performed.

The court below rendered judgment for the plaintiff on the theory that +he subcontractor\u2019s action on behalf of the supplier was \u201cratified\u201d by the supplier, having learned of the subcontractor\u2019s action and having apparently acquiesced therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b146-13\">. \u201cJanuary 22, 1957</p>\n<p id=\"Aum\">\u201cFoster-Newman Contracting Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">3622 Thirteenth Avenue</p>\n<p id=\"b146-15\">Brooklyn 18, N.
