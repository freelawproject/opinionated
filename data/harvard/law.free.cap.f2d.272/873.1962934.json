The survivors, 11 members of the crew, the personal representatives of the estates of those lost, and the owners of the cargo filed claims against Moore-Mc-Cormack Lines, Inc., and that company filed cross-libels against the master, chief mate and chief engineer of the ship for negligent navigation. After a long trial Judge McGohey granted judgment against the owner without limitation in favor of the survivors, the personal representatives of those lost, and the cargo claimants, and dismissed the cross-libels. The issues in the case are whether the stowage of the \u201cMormackite\u201d was seaworthy, whether her navigation preceding the loss was proper, and whether, if the stowage was unseaworthy, the owner may limit its liability for either the cargo or loss of life under \u00a7 183(a) of Title 46 U.S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">The findings are that the ship had been laden at Vitoria, Brazil, which port she left on September 25th, and \u201cproceeded without untoward incident\u201d until on October 7th \u201cshortly after 4 a.m. heavy seas struck the vessel\u2019s starboard side, rolling her very hard to port about 20 to 25 degrees. The ore shifted. * * * The vessel took a port list. Her speed was reduced at once,\u201d and shortly thereafter the list was so far corrected she had only a little list to port. \u201cHeavier seas were still coming from starboard. Some time after 8:30 there was another very violent roll to port. The ore shifted heavily again. * * * The shifting continued. The vessel took a severe port list. * * * The list increased steadily. Chief, Officer Richardson and Chief Engineer Wall were then seen attaching fire hoses to the sounding pipes leading to the starboard deep tanks.\u201d \u201cAt or after 8:30 the speed had increased\u201d; and at about the time of the violent roll \u201cthe speed indicator * * * registered \u2018full speed.\u2019 \u201d \u201cHowever, \u2018the next telegraph order from the bridge\u2019 was \u2018full stop; * * * every moment it was changing.\u2019 \u201d The master on the bridge was \u201cordering \u2018right wheel amidships \u2014 he was trying to right the ship.\u2019\u201d \u201cAt 8:30 the vessel still had a port list which resulted from the first shift of cargo at 4 o\u2019clock. And, despite the fact that she had been on reduced speed since 4 o\u2019clock, she was nevertheless rolling hard. And the seas hitting her starboard were heavier than before. It is obvious that, in order to avoid a further shift of the ore a change of course was necessary. It is clear that this is just what Captain McMahon was trying to do.\u201d He may have been \u201ctrying to put her about and thus cause some of the ore to shift away from port to starboard.\u201d \u201cThe cargo pumps were put into operation after the 8:30 list.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b947-18\"> Upon these findings McGohey, J., found that the stowage was unseaworthy. It is not clear whether he would have so found, had there been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>no evidence as to the stowage itself; but upon that highly disputed issue he found that \u201cthe ore was stowed as indicated on the stowage plan, Claimant\u2019s Exhibit 4: that is, the ore in No. 1 lower hold was piled up through the hatch into No. 1 lower 'tweendeck; in No. 3 and 5 lower \u2019tweendeeks the ore was piled up through the hatches into the upper \u2019tweendeeks.\u201d He also found by inference which we accept, that the-master knew how the ore was stowed when the ship broke ground. If his conclusions were not \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d it would follow that for the personal injuries and deaths of the ship\u2019s company the petitioner was liable without limitation. \u00a7 183(e) Title 46 U.S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The. seaworthiness of the stowage depended first upon how it was put on board at Vitoria and whether that was in accordance with proper maritime practice. As has already appeared, the finding was that the ore was deposited in piles whose tops extended through the hatches in three instances. The ore had lain in piles ashore, near where the ship lay, from which it was dumped upon a \u201cconveyor belt\u201d which moved perpendicular to the ship\u2019s side. This <em>\u201cbelt\u201d </em>carried a \u201cchute\u201d which could <em>be </em>manipulated so as to discharge ore at varying angles into any of the hatches. The claimants argue that without hand trimming this necessarily resulted in stowing the ore in conical heaps which were apt to shift as the ship rolled. The ship answered that the chutes could deliver the ore at an angle and fill the hold, or \u2019tweendeck, so as to reach its sides and bulkheads in heaps not conical and therefore not likely to shift. Furthermore she put in evidence that the practice had been common at Vitoria to stow ore in this way, and that only in one instance had a cargo shifted that had been similarly stowed. Her expert witness, Wilson, testified that this method was safe. Moreover, although four or five of the survivors swore that the ore in the holds had lain in heaps and had extended through the hatches, some of these had stated upon examination by the Coast Guard they had not observed such stowage of the ore.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">We do not think that the evidence was such as would permit our disturbing the judge\u2019s finding on the facts. That the survivors' testimony was inconsistent was of course to be considered ; but it was not conclusive, especially since the judge had seen the witnesses. Again we cannot say that the judge should have accepted the opinions of the ship\u2019s experts in preference to that of Manning, the claimants\u2019 expert who condemned the stow. The outstanding fact is that in seasonable weather the ore did shift and in the end capsized the ship. As McGohey, J., put it, the \u201cinference is inescapable, I think, that she was unseaworthy as to her stowage.\u201d [164 F.Supp. 206.] When to this we add the almost inevitable conclusion that when she broke ground her master must have seen the stow, the denial of limitation follows; or at any rate we should not be warranted in holding that the findings were \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Other considerations apply to the claims of the cargo. A shipowner may limit his liability for cargo loss under \u00a7 183(a) of Title 46 only in case he proves that the loss was \u201cwithout\u201d his \u201cprivity or knowledge.\u201d In the case at bar the owner was a corporation, and it must be owned that it is hard to say from the books who are the officers whose \u201cprivity or knowledge\u201d will charge the corporation, except that they must apparently be \u201cthe managing officers\u201d (Craig v. Continental Insurance Co., 141 U.S. 638, 646, 12 S.Ct. 97, 99, 35 L.Ed. 886), whatever that may mean. In the case at bar it appears to be common ground that only notice to the following four of the corporation\u2019s officers would deprive it of its right to limit: Furey, Chief of Operations, Mayo, Marine Superintendent, Barrett, Assistant Marine Superintendent, and O\u2019Brien, Operations Manager. It does not appear that Claimants\u2019 Exhibit 4 came to the notice of any of these men before the ship broke ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>at Vitoria. Nor do we think that the evidence would have justified a finding, if the judge had made one (which he did not), that the practice of stowing ore, as the \u201cMormackite\u201d was stowed, had become so uniform as to charge these officers with knowledge; or that they, or at any rate Barrett, must have known that it had been so stowed. We do not say that there can never be such \u25a0\u201cnegligence\u201d of a \u201cmanaging officer\u201d of a corporation as will establish \u201cprivity or knowledge\u201d of the owner under \u00a7 183(a); indeed we have said otherwise, Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Lloyd Brasileiro, 2 Cir., 159 F.2d 661, 664, but in the case at bar Moore-Mc-Cormack Lines, Inc., had issued regulations, among which one (OV 34c II), provided that the \u201cusual chuting of ore into a vessel which results in a conical pile may be acceptable practice for specially constructed ore-carriers, but can cause considerable damage to vessels constructed to carry general cargo.\u201d Another regulation (OV 34c III), provided: \u201cWe have had vessels where the ore was stowed in single conical piles * * and some 0f these ships have made passages without damage; with others the top of the cone has rolled down * * * and in one case has given a list which required the Master to put into Halifax to re-trim his ship.\u201d As was obviously necessary in foreign ports, it was left to those in charge to follow these directions, and if they failed, their failure did not charge the owner with \u201cprivity or knowledge.\u201d The situation was clearly within La Bourgogne, 210 U.S. 95, 126, 28 S.Ct. 664, 675, 52 L.Ed. 973: \u201cThe petitioner having shown the promulgation of regulations for the conduct of its business, which exacted compliance by the captains of its vessels with the international rules, we think the burden of proving * * * a wilful departure from their requirements was indulged in * * * was cast upon the claimants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">Indeed, McGohey, J., did not charge the <em>owner </em>as to the cargo with privity or knowledge that it had been ill-stowed, but based his decision upon a finding that the \u201cstabilogauge\u201d used in stowing the ship had not been properly \u201ccalibrated.\u201d A \u201cstabilogauge\u201d is an instrument carried on cargo ships to determine their \u201cstability\u201d; that is to say, to determine how much cargo they may safely carry and where it should be stowed. It has to be properly \u201ccalibrated\u201d to the ship that is to be stowed: that is, it must be adjusted to the different carrying compartments and to the \u201cfree surface correction for tanks.\u201d One of the factors entering into the computation is the \u201clight ship weight\u201d and another is the \u201cvertical center of gravity.\u201d [164 F.Supp. 207.] The computation itself is exceedingly complicated. It does not appear that, when the ship was built and delivered to the government there was a \u201cstabilogauge\u201d on board, or, if so, how it was \u201ccalibrated.\u201d At that time her \u201clight ship weight\u201d was in fact 5,328 tons. Barrett, the Assistant Marine Superintendent, in 1948 chose the \u201cMormackite\u201d as a \u201ckey ship\u201d of several ships (C2SBls) for which to compute the stability, all being of one model. His computations were based upon a \u201csta-bilogauge\u201d which had been delivered to Pier 32 of the stevedoring department, although the trial record does not show that this \u201cstabilogauge\u201d had ever been put on board the ship. Barrett computed the actual \u201clight ship weight\u201d of the ship in 1948 by adding to, and subtracting from, her \u201clight ship weight\u201d when built (5,328 tons), any changes made thereafter. His figure of 4,661 tons as her \u201clight ship weight\u201d in 1948 was correct. He then computed that in order to make the 1948 \u201cstabilo-gauge\u201d a reliable test of proper stowage all that was needed was to add to her cargo, as stowed, a supposititious 110 tons of \u201cdeck load.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">Judge McGohey found that the record did not show that the ship carried a properly \u201ccalibrated\u201d \u201cstabilogauge,\u201d ahd that she was unseaworthy for that reason. He held that it was \u201cpossible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>and even probable\u201d (that) \u201cthe stabilogauge which the petitioner furnished for the use of Captain McMahon and Chief Officer Richardson on the Mormackite was calibrated to her original light ship weight of 5,328 tons and K G of 25.82 ft., they were sure to be misled in planning the stowage.\u201d [164 F.Supp. 211.] This presupposes that some \u201cstabilogauge\u201d had been put on board the ship; and that accords with every probability. However, even assuming that there was a \u201cstabilogauge\u201d that had been put on in 1945 before Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. bought her and that it had been \u201ccalibrated\u201d to a \u201clight ship weight\u201d of 5,328 tons, which nowhere appears, we can say with certainty that that was not the \u201cstabilogauge\u201d that was on the ship in 1954. This follows from a deposition of one, Kristal, which was not in record before Judge McGohey for reasons that will appear immediately. Kristal was the president of a company that made \u201cstabilogauges\u201d and he testified that on August 8, 1947, he had shipped to Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., a \u201cstabilogauge\u201d \u201ccalibrated\u201d for the \u201cMormackite\u201d with a \u201clight ship weight\u201d of 4,490 and a vertical center of gravity of 27.6 feet. It appears to us that it would be altogether unreasonable to suppose that this was not the \u201cstabilogauge\u201d that was later on board in 1948, whose \u201ccalibration\u201d Barrett accepted after the supposititious increase in its recorded tonnage of 110 tons deck load. Barrett\u2019s computation of \u201clight ship weight\u201d in 1948 being concededly correct, with this added increase in cargo the \u201cstabilogauge\u201d was reliable, and the ship <em>pro tanto </em>seaworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Kristal\u2019s deposition had been taken before the trial had ended, but the Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. did not offer it in evidence until after the judge had filed his opinion. Perceiving the importance that the \u201cstabilogauge\u201d had assumed, the owner then offered it in evidence. Judge McGohey refused to receive it, and after the appeal had been taken the owner moved in this court to have it added to the record on appeal. This motion we denied, adding, however, the following comment: \u201cappellant may of course argue as to-the claimed effect of the excluded evidence in presenting its appeal.\u201d We accept this as equivalent to treating the deposition as part of the record, reserving, however, to the claimants the privilege of contradicting it. The claimants in their brief have not suggested that they wish to do this, so that we-understand that we are to decide the-appeal as though the deposition were a part of the record. We conclude-therefore that it now appears that the \u201cMormackite\u201d was not unseaworthy <em>so. </em>far as concerned her \u201cstabilogauge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">It is not necessary to deal at length with the owner\u2019s argument that the disaster was caused by the bad navigation of the ship before the shift of' cargo about 8:30 a.m. She was, as we-have said, put at full speed for a time and the master attempted to change-her course so that she should be out of' the trough of the seas, or perhaps even, to expose her port side to the seas. There was testimony that this was not permissible navigation in such an emergency, but there was also testimony the-other way. It would be strange if there were any fixed methods that those in-charge were bound to adopt. Moreover, the question was in any event one of' fact, and we should not be warranted in holding it \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d for-judge McGohey to find that the ship\u2019s, navigation was at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">Lastly, it is quite plain that Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. did not warrant the stowage of the ship. The charter did indeed warrant that she was. \u201ctight, staunch and strong and in every way fitted for the voyage,\u201d but there was no warranty as to her stowage, especially on the return voyage. Moreover, the charter contained a provision that the bills of lading should be subject to the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, and that provision would be ineffective unless there was a limitation of liability in the absence of privity or knowledge of the owner \u2014 \u00a7 1308, Title 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>After what we have already said, it is clear that the dismissal of the cross-libels against the chief mate and chief engineer was proper. The claim of the master\u2019s estate has been settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">The judgment awarding unlimited damages for loss of life or personal injuries will be affirmed. The judgment awarding damages for loss of cargo will be affirmed, but with limited liability</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b951-5\">On Petition for Rehearing.</p>\n<author id=\"b951-6\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">The petition of the Moore-McCormack \u2018Lines, Inc. for a hearing is denied, but the Line should file an answer to the petition of Armco Steel Corporation and others for rehearing on two questions: (1) whether the cause should be remanded to Judge McGohey to make a finding that Barrett warned the master of the amount to be \u201ccranked\u201d into the stabilo-gauge; and (2) whether the cause should be also remanded to take testimony and to make findings as to the truth of the facts stated in the deposition of Kristal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
