Butterfield, who was not sued. The ease was tried to the court without a jury. At the conclusion of the evidence, the plaintiff, with leave of the court, filed an amended complaint to conform to the evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The amended complaint counted on the promissory note and also on certain written instruments or agreements executed contemporaneously with the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The district court filed a memorandum opinion incorporating its findings of fact and conclusions of law, and entered judgment against Edmiston,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">\u201c * * * in the sum of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) together with interest thereon at the rate of two per cent (2%) per an-num from March 10, 1953 until the date of this judgment, plus ten per cent (10%) of the total amount due as attorneys\u2019 fees, together with interest upon the entire sum from the date of this judgment at the rate of six per cent (6%) per annum,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0q\">and against Head, \u201cin the sum of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00), together with interest thereon at the rate of six per cent (G%) per annum from the date of this judgment.\u201d It was further provided that the total recovery against both defendants should not exceed the amount of the judgment rendered against Edmiston.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Head alone appealed. Wollmann cross-appealed, but only insofar as the judgment against Head failed to award Woll-mann \u201cinterest on the sum of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) at the rate of two per cent (2%) per annum from March 10, 1953 until the date of the judgment, plus ten per cent (10%) of the total amount due as attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AyG\">Wollmann was a dentist by profession, who lived in Huron, South Dakota. He had known Butterfield, a Montana resident, for many years and had engaged with Butterfield in previous ventures seeking the discovery and production of oil and gas. Edmiston and Head were citizens of Houston, Texas, who also prospected for and promoted the production of oil and gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Butterfield and Edmiston owned a one-eighth overriding royalty interest in a large acreage in San Patricio County, Texas, leased to D and E Drilling Company. That Company had completed a producing well on a part of that acreage and had drilled a second well on another part to almost the same depth when it had decided to plug the second well. It had set cement in the surface pipe and had the well half plugged and the rig torn halfway down when Edmiston induced a Mr. James L. Minahan, a consulting geological engineer of Fort Worth, Texas, to go with him to check \u201cthe Schlumberger electrical log services core analysis\u201d with respect to this second well.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">On March 6 or 7th, 1953, Minahan gave his opinion that there was a fifty-fifty chance of completing the well as a producing well. D and E was unwilling to spend further money on the well, and the lease on that part of the acreage would terminate shortly unless further efforts were made to bring the well into production. D and E offered to assign the lease to Edmiston, reserving a fractional three-fourths working interest in itself, if Edmiston would secure the funds necessary and proceed with cleaning and testing operations with a view to securing production. Wolf Drilling Company, which had drilled the well, estimated that $50,000 would be enough to attempt to complete the well as a producer. To keep from losing the rig, Edmiston arranged for the drillers to wait at an expense of $600 a day. Ed-miston and Butterfield offered interests in the venture to Minahan and to Head. The four (Edmiston, Butterfield, Mina-han, and Head) had several discussions among themselves about raising the necessary $50,000, and Butterfield suggested that he would contact Dr. Woll-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>mann and attempt to secure the funds from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\">Dr. Wollmann and his wife were then at a health resort in Mineral Wells, Texas, and Butterfield met Wollmann there at the Baker Hotel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After they had discussed the venture, Butterfield wrote by pen and ink on hotel stationery a letter proposal (hereafter referred to as Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 1) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">\u201cDear Doctor Wollmann:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB_S\">\u201cFollowing is understanding of our agreement concerning the participation in completion of the well at Corpus Christi: It is estimated there will be a total cost of $50,-000.00 to complete this well and put the oil and gas in the tanks for oil and lines for delivery of the gas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3R\">\u201cYou agree to advance this $50,-000.00. We, in turn, agree to do all necessary work in connection with completion of the well, as set-out, and to furnish all necessary casing, tubing, cementing, lines, tanks, etc. We further agree to give you a note of even date in amount of $50,000.00, bearing interest at two per cent, due in Nine months, said note to be signed by each, G. B. Butterfield, Adler Edmis-ton, Homer S. Head, Sr. and James Minahan, Sr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\u201cWe further agree that a full 75% of all oil and gas returns will credit toward payment of this note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">\u201cIt is further agreed between us that when this note is paid in full, an assignment will be made to you of Thirty-seven and one-half per cent (37-1/2%) in the working interest in this lease. It is understood that there is a one-eighth (1/8) land owners royalty and a one-eighth overriding royalty outstanding against this lease, making it a Seventy-five per cent (75%) lease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">\u201cSincerely,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">\u201cGordon B. Butterfield\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">The next day, Dr. Wollmann, accompanied by his wife, drove to Fort Worth to talk with Mr. Minahan. Minahan testified that he made it clear to Dr. Woll-mann there in Fort Worth that he was no longer personally interested in the transaction \u201cbecause I wouldn\u2019t put my money in it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">The following day, March 9, Dr. Woll-mann, still accompanied by his wife, drove to Houston. Mr. Edmiston met them at the hotel clerk\u2019s desk as they registered and made arrangements for Dr. Wollmann to discuss the matter on the following day at Mr. Head\u2019s office in the Gulf Building in Houston.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">At that meeting on March 10, Mr. Edmiston first handed to Dr. Wollmann a note from Mr. Head (hereafter referred to as Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 2) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-15\">\u201cHomer S.

Edmiston testified that he never did see that letter proposal. In any event, Dr. Wollmann and Mr. Edmiston, <em>witliout the benefit of legal advice, </em>undertook to reach an agreement, which Mr. Head\u2019s secretary typed, as follows (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">\u201cState of Texas</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aha-dedup-0\">\u201cCounty of Harris</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">\u201cThis memorandum of agreement entered into this tenth day of March, 1953, by and between Adler Edmiston, Trustee for Gordon B.

Now, Dr. Wollman (sic), what happened in connection with this transaction after you paid over the $50,000.00, and received these documents from Mr. Edmiston? A. The next day or so, we drove to Corpus Christi, down to where the well was being drilled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-28\">\u201cQ. And what occurred there, if anything? A. We met Mr. Edmis-ton, and we were there several days, and to (sic) the meantime, Mr. Head came down. We were going back and forth to the well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-29\">\u201cQ. All right. A. While they were drilling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-30\">\u201cQ. Did you have any conversation with Mr. Head about the financial aspects of this matter? A. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-31\">\u201cQ. Can you tell us in your own words just what happened at that time? A. I asked him to sign the note, and he told me that I didn\u2019t have the proper papers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-32\">\u201cQ. Was that the only reply he gave to you at that time? A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-33\">\u201cQ. Did he ever say that he wouldn\u2019t sign the note? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-34\">\u201cQ. Did you press him about his signing something at that time ? A. No, I didn\u2019t have the proper papers, so I didn\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-35\">Mr. Head testified that he simply declined to sign the note, and that Dr. Wollmann had nothing more to say at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the time. In connection with this conflict, the examination of Mr. Head by the district judge, quoted in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> may be revealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>The well eventually proved to be a dry hole and was finally plugged about January 23, 1955, and the equipment above the ground was then sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The respective factual contentions of the parties and the findings of the district court are thus stated in the memorandum opinion [176 F.Supp. 566]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">\u201cIt is the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, and theory, that under the agreement he was to be repaid, if the venture was unsuccessful, by the two defendants and Butterfield, and that the note evidences that obligation. He contends further that the Wymotex stock was security, to which he might look for satisfaction of the note, if Edmiston, Head and Butter-field otherwise were unable to pay it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">\u201cIn addition to such support as this theory may find in the written instruments, Butterfield corroborates the plaintiff\u2019s testimony in every particular. He readily, almost eagerly, admits his own liability, and that of the two defendants. In this respect it is noted that But-terfield was not made a party-defendant here; that he and the plaintiff were friends and successful co-adventurers in other matters long before this controversy arose; and, that Butterfield is a recent bankrupt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">\u201cHead and Edmiston testify that the agreement was not as stated above, or as the written instruments would tend to show. It is their testimony that Wollman (sic) was to risk his capital, and they their time and skill in undertaking to make the well produce; and that in the event of failure all were to lose, and that there was to be no repayment. Their testimony is to the effect that the note was never intended to constitute a personal obligation on their part, but was no more than a memorandum of the amount which Wollmann advanced, and to which he was entitled to recoupment from the first oil produced. They explain the Wymotex letter as an alternative defense, in that if Wollman (sic) was to be repaid in case of failure, he was to look only to the 25,000 shares above mentioned. This stock was then jointly owned by Edmiston and Butterfield, and had a value of some $2 a share. Since that time, its value has decreased to an extent that it now has little, if any, market value. During the trial, Edmiston indicated his willingness to surrender his share of such stock to Woll-man (sic), which he contends would satisfy the obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-12\">\u201cI find the facts to be in accordance with the plaintiff\u2019s theory and testimony. I find that it was the understanding of all parties that Wollman (sic) was to be repaid in the event the well was a failure, and that the note was intended to, and did, evidence this obligation. I find further that the block of Wymotex stock was intended simply to secure the payment of the obligation, but was not intended to be the sole source to which plaintiff might look for such satisfaction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">The district court entered judgment against Edmiston for the amount with interest and attorneys\u2019 fees due under the promissory note. As to Head, however, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-14\">\u201cThe plaintiff may not recover against Head <em>as a maker of the note, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>by reason of the terms of Article 5932, \u00a7 18, Vernon\u2019s Annotated Civil Statutes of this State. I find, however, that Head intended to, and by his letter of March 9, 1953 (Ex. 2) did, in writing, authorize Edmis-ton, as his agent, to deal with Woll-man (sic) and to bind him (Head) upon any contract so arrived at. I find that Edmiston was authorized to, and did, act as agent for Head, as well as on his own behalf, in executing the \u2018Memorandum of Agreement\u2019 (Ex. 3), and that Head is bound thereby. I find further that the \u2018Memorandum of Agreement\u2019 did no more than reduce to writing the oral understanding previously arrived at between the parties, and to which Head had assented on or before March 9, 1953.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">\u201cI find that Edmiston, Head and Butterfield were not acting as partners in this venture (as contended by plaintiff), and I find that Head did not intend to authorize Edmiston to execute the promissory note (as distinguished from the written contract) as Head\u2019s agent. It was contemplated by all concerned that Head and Butterfield would sign individually, and on their own behalf, and that the three would constitute joint makers. While the statute cited above would prevent recovery against Head as maker of the note, it does not prevent recovery for breach of the initial contractual obligation, or for breach of his written promise to sign the note as maker. Head\u2019s liability in this respect is clear.1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">\u201c * * * Had Head and Butter-field joined in execution of the note, the three would have been liable jointly and severally, and the plaintiff might have sought his recovery in full against any or all.2 Hence, Edmiston, who did sign, has not suffered. Clearly the escrow provision was intended purely as a means of affording the plaintiff additional security. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-10\">\u201c1. 6 Tex.Jurs., Bills &amp; Notes, \u00a7 36 and \u00a7 116; 10 C.J.S.

It is questionable whether the word was originally chosen even by the two nonlawyers, Wollmann and Edmis-ton. Mr. Head\u2019s secretary testified that they did not dictate the letter to her, \u201cMr. Edmiston just gave me a general outline of what he wanted, and I typed the letter.\u201d It is a fair inference that the word \u201csatisfy\u201d was initially the choice of the stenographer.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">While the secretary and Edmiston testified to the most definite understanding that the stock was to be accepted by Dr. Wollmann in lieu of the money, Dr. Wollmann testified that he and Edmiston talked about the stock being put up simply as collateral. Dr. Wollmann further testified that he attached little importance to the stock, and had not comprehended the provision that it was to be placed in escrow. Actually, that never was done. After the well proved to be a dry hole, Edmiston went to South Dakota and offered Dr. Wollmann not 25,000 shares as specified in the letter, but 50,000 shares of the stock. Dr. Wollmann refused, and testified: \u201cI asked for my $50,000.00 instead.\u201d We agree with the finding that the stock was intended simply as collateral security. If we disagreed, nevertheless recognizing the superior advantage enjoyed by the district court, which saw and heard the witnesses and observed their demeanor on the stand, we could not set aside the finding as clearly erroneous.

Appellant argues that, at the time of the transaction in Head\u2019s office, the value of the Wymotex stock <em>was </em>sufficient to <em>satisfy </em>the debt, and draws that inference from the district court\u2019s finding that the stock then \u201chad a value of some $2 a share.\u201d That finding is not necessary to support the judgment entered by the court. Actually, it seems to us clearly erroneous, for we find in the record no definite evidence of the value of the stock on March 10, 1953, but do find evidence strongly indicating that its then value was nowhere near $2 per share. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>The evidence of that stock\u2019s , value may be summarized as follows: During the latter part of 1952 and the first part of 1953, a Mr. Feland in Houston offered $75,000 for 100,000 shares which would, be 75 cents per share; in October 1954, it was worth 68 cents per share, and in October 1956, 38 cents per share. Sometime in 1956, Mr. Feland offered $75,000 for 300,000 shares, which would be 25 cents per share.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b378-9\">JONES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AhJ\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"AzP\">It is my view that the appellant authorized Edmiston to bind him on what he refers to as a \u201cdeal\u201d and that he became bound. The district court made its determination as to what the deal was and, among other things, found that the deal included a promise to pay Woll-mann if he did not get payment from a producing oil well. This determination is, I think, supported by substantial evidence. It was contemplated by Head that a note would be given to Wollmann. Head\u2019s letter to Wollmann says \u201cYou have a note for $50,000.00 to be signed by Butterfield, Edmiston and myself.\u201d Again it is said in the letter, \u201cI will sign the note with Messrs. Edmiston and Butterfield at any time.\u201d While Edmis-ton was authorized to bind Head in making the deal, Head reserved to himself the signing of the note. It follows, or so I think, that Head was not obligated on the note and it would be improper to require him to pay the attorneys\u2019 fee for which the note stipulated. Although not in agreement with all that is said by the district court, I am convinced that its decision is correct. Wollman v. Head, 176 F.Supp. 563, I concur in the affirmance of its judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b378-10\">RIVES, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"An9\">(concurring in affirmance, but dissenting from the failure to modify and increase the judgment) .</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">While I concur to the extent of at least affirming the judgment against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Head, I could hardly do so if I were not of the opinion that Head is liable on the promissory note the same as Edmiston. Butterfield\u2019s letter proposal (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 1) and Head\u2019s letter (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 2) each stated that Head\u2019s obligation to repay the $50,000 to Wollmann would be evidenced by a note. The only language that I find in the agreement (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 3) obligating Head to pay the sum of $50,000 to Wollmann is that referring to the note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-4\">\u201cThe First Party has this date executed a promissory note payable in nine months from date at the rate of 2% interest to Second Party to reimburse him for the money advanced for the completion of the above described well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">I accept all of the fact findings of the district court except the finding not necessary to support its judgment to the effect that the Wymotex stock had a value of some $2 a share at the time the transaction was closed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Among other such findings which I accept are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-19\">\u201c* * * I find that Head did not intend to authorize Edmiston to execute the promissory note (as distinguished from the written contract) as Head\u2019s agent. It was contemplated by all concerned that Head and Butterfield would sign individually, and on their own behalf, and that the three would constitute joint makers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-20\">When, however, Head found it necessary to leave town and be absent from the meeting in his office, Edmiston was spurred on by a sense of urgent necessity to definitely close the transaction, and to do so he undertook to sign both the note and the agreement on behalf of Head (and of Butterfield as well as of himself).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>While Edmiston expected Butterfield and Head thereafter to sign the note, he added the word \u201cTrustee\u201d after his own signature to signify that he was acting not only for himself, but also for Head and for Butterfield. That is made clear by the agreement entered into at the same meeting (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 3), \u201cby and between Adler Edmiston, Trustee for Gordon B. Butterfield, Homer S. Head, and Adler Edmiston, Harris County, Texas, known as the First Party and Dr. A. A. Wollmann, Jr., of Huron, South Dakota, known as the Second Party.\u201d The agreement recites that, \u201cThe First Party has this date executed a promissory note. * * * \u201d Throughout that agreement, Edmiston is referred to as \u201cTrustee\u201d with the meaning that he is acting for himself and his two co-venturers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The testimony is without dispute that, notwithstanding Edmiston\u2019s lack of authority to execute the promissory note (as distinguished from the written contract) as Head\u2019s agent, Ed-miston actually did purport to act on account of Head (as well as of Butter-field and himself) in signing the note, and, hence, his execution of the note could be ratified by Head for \u201c * * * ratification does not result from the af-firmance of an act, unless the one acting purports to act on account of another.\u201d 1 A.L.I., Restatement of Agency, \u00a7 85, p. 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-16\">Texas has the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law, which includes Article 5932, Section 18, Vernon\u2019s Annotated Civil Statutes of Texas, the statute to which the district court referred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>section is followed by two other sections which appear pertinent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Clearly, the addition of the word \u201cTrustee\u201d to Edmiston\u2019s signature did not exempt him from personal liability on the note.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> **As between the original parties, however, it was permissible to prove, and was in fact shown by the contemporaneous agreement (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 3), that the word \u201cTrustee\u201d was meant to indicate that Edmiston was acting not only for himself, but also for Head and for Butterfield. As between the original parties, the rule is well settled in Texas, as elsewhere,1,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">\u201cIn considering bills and notes as evidencing an agreement between the parties, application is made of the fundamental rule that other instruments executed at the same time, for the same purpose and in the course of the same transaction are to be construed therewith, \u2014 that is, all the papers are given the same effect as though they were in fact a single instrument.\u201d 6 Tex.Jur., Bills and Notes, \u00a7 47, p. 644.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Head\u2019s actual signature to the note was the means by which Edmiston had expected that his assumption of authority would be ratified. That was not, however, the exclusive mode of ratification. When Head, with full knowledge of the fact, either by having the note presented to him for his signature, or by the terms of the agreement referring to the note, joined in accepting the benefits (or what were then hoped would be benefits) of the $50,000 check which Dr. Wollmann delivered to Edmiston in return for the note and the other obligations, and joined in expending that fund over a long period of time, he effectually ratified and approved Edmiston\u2019s execution of the note on his behalf.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It cannot be said that that conduct amounted to no more than an unnecessary ratification of the agreement already authorized, for two reasons: (1) The agreement itself, as executed, showed that the \u201cFirst Party,\u201d which included Head, had executed the promissory note. (2) In parting with his $50,000, Wollmann relied on the promissory note as well as on the agreement, and he had a right to rely on both. That conduct would result in ratification even if it should be assumed, contrary to the weight of the evidence (see footnote 3 to majority opinion), that Head had theretofore repudiated any liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>on the note by flatly refusing to sign it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\">\u201cThe affirmance by the principal of a transaction with a third person is not prevented from resulting in ratification by the fact:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">\u201c(b) that the purported principal, before affirming, had repudiated the transaction, if the third person has not acted or has failed to act in reliance upon the repudiation.\u201d 1 A.L.I., Restatement of Agency, \u00a7 92, p. 227.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">I would hold Head liable on the promissory note the same as Edmiston.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-6\">.

Both the original complaint and the amended complaint, filed over Head\u2019s objections, made it plain that Wollmann was suing on the note quoted in the majority opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">The court below found \u201cthat Edmiston, Head and Butterfield were not acting as partners in this venture (as contended by plaintiff), and I find that Head did not intend to authorize Edmiston to execute the promissory note (as distinguished from the written contract) as Head\u2019s agent.\u201d The concurring opinion of Judge JONES accepts this finding that the note executed by Edmiston as Head\u2019s agent did not bind Head. The court concluded that, as far as the note was concerned, there was nothing in the Texas Statute or the facts which would \u201cprevent recovery * * * for breach of his [Head\u2019s] written promise to sign the note as maker. Head\u2019s liability in this respect is clear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-15\">The only documents quoted in the court\u2019s findings and conclusions were the note, Edmiston's letter of March 10 th to Wollmann in effect pledging 25,000 shares of Wymotex Oil Company stock \u201cto satisfy the $50,000.00 furnished us,\u201d and Head\u2019s letter of March 9th to Woll-mann.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-16\">The finding of the court below that Edmiston\u2019s effort to bind Head to the note was beyond the powers granted to him is the only finding which is supported by the evidence. It is equally clear that the suit as filed and as prosecuted in the lower court and in this Court must fail as to Head because it is an action on a writing not binding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>upon Head. The power of attorney granted by Head\u2019s letter of March 9th to Wollmann was in writing and was in clear and explicit and unambiguous terms. The court could not, therefore, legally consider any extraneous proof in construing the note and the letter constituting the sole power relied upon for its execution on behalf of Head.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Eliminating the note, there is nothing in the Memorandum of Agreement executed by Adler Edmiston which binds, or purports to bind, Head to pay Woll-mann any money. Wollmann was advised that the note was to be signed by Head and not by Edmiston for him, and his releasing the money to Edmiston before presenting the note to Head for his signature, when the evidence shows that he was easily available, was completely unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Wollmann knew within a very short time after the execution of the papers by Edmiston that Head was not going to sign a note in the terms of the one sued on. Head\u2019s reason was clear. He understood that, simultaneously with the closing of the deal, Edmiston and Butter-field were going to place stock with Woll-mann \u201cto satisfy the $50,000.00 furnished us.\u201d The trial court found the stock to be worth that amount of money\u2014 \u201cThis stock was then jointly owned by Edmiston and Butterfield, and had a value of some $2 a share.\u201d The majority opinion rejects that finding by the court below while accepting the residue of its findings. Faced with a record containing as much vague and equivocal testimony on the part of all of the parties as this one, I do not feel justified in accepting some of the fact findings of the court below and rejecting others. It is my feeling that the court below committed an error of law in holding Head liable under the \u201cdeal\u201d when Head categorically refused to sign the only thing which could obligate him personally to Wollmann. He had, without dispute as far as I can find, been led to believe that Wollmann was to be satisfied by the Wymotex stock. \u201cSatisfy\u201d is not a word of ambiguous, equivocal or uncertain meaning.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">The undisputed proof of Wollmann\u2019s dealings with Head is susceptible of no other construction but that he knew that Head had refused to sign a paper under which he would be personally bound to pay the $50,000. When he declined to sign the note because Wollmann did not have the proper papers, Wollmann took his papers back to his home in a distant state and kept them without ever mentioning the matter of a note from Head or making any demand for payment of a note for a period of more than four years. If, having parted with his $50,-000 without getting Head\u2019s signature on the note, Wollmann wanted to protect himself, he had ample opportunity to begin action immediately following Head\u2019s refusal, which would have prevented the $50,000 from being expended by Edmiston or anyone else. He failed to do so and demonstrated to Head and to everyone else that he was not relying on any supposed obligation of Head to answer to him personally for the money he had advanced. This construction by the two of the rights and obligations subsisting between them appears from evidence which is, in my judgment, uncon-tradicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">The other theory of liability, presumably accepted by the majority, is that casually adverted to by the court below that Head was liable to Wollmann for failure to carry out his written agreement to sign a note. The first answer to this is that the contract would be unenforceable, because the kind of note to be executed by Head was not described in the writing. An agreement to make a contract must set forth all of the terms of the contract to be executed or it will be unenforceable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nobody contends, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>therefore, that the note which Head referred to and which was executed by Edmiston in negotiable form was intended to be what on its face it purported to be. It was to be a note imposing an obligation different from that spelled out by the terms of the note sued on.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">It is plain, moreover, that any action against Head for failure to carry out his contract to sign a note was barred by Article 5527 of the Texas Code requiring an action on an indebtedness evidenced by contract in writing to be brought within four years after the cause of action accrues. This action was brought nearly three months after the expiration of the four year period of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The court below summarized its basic findings in the sentence: \u201cI find further that the \u2018Memorandum of Agreement\u2019 did no more than reduce to writing the oral understanding previously arrived at between the parties, and to which Head had assented on or before March 9, 1953.\u201d It seems to me that what the court did was to endeavor to construct an obligation from the jumble of writings and testimony about them, and this was not permissible under the suit as filed and prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Even if the court had the right to permit the unambiguous writings upon which alone I think the case should be decided to be varied, amended and supplemented by the testimony of contemporaneous negotiations between the parties, I think the contract it enforced by its judgment is too unrealistic and lacking in mutuality to have our approval. Under its terms, Wollmann, having made considerable money risking his capital in other oil \u201cgambles,\u201d suddenly turned money-lender, making a loan to three joint venturers with him, one of whom he had, according to his amended complaint, investigated and found worth the money, accompanied by security undis-putedly adequate to satisfy the loan. In addition, he had an assignment of the first oil runs as further protection. And, finally, he was to receive a bonus of a half interest in the well \u2014 as much as the other three joint venturers together. Leaving out of view that he did not conceive the idea of attempting enforcement of the note against Head until more than four years had elapsed, we are asked to by-pass the writings and create from the sharply disputed testimony a contractual arrangement which, in my opinion, is at war with reason and with the pattern of like joint ventures which have come before the courts. See, e. g., Stricker v. Morgan, 5 Cir., 1959, 268 F.2d 882; Baker v. Nason, 5 Cir., 1956, 236 F.2d 483; Sample v. Romine, 1942, 193 Miss. 706, 8 So.2d 257, 9 So.2d 643, 10 So.2d 346 and McCartney v. McKendrick, 1956, 226 Miss. 562, 85 So.2d 164. I think it is safe, in a situation such as faces us here, to stick to the writings. Both law and \u201chigh justice\u201d will be served better by such a course. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<author id=\"b384-10\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">The petitions for rehearing in the above styled and numbered cause are hereby denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">Judge CAMERON dissents from the portion of the order denying the Petition for Rehearing of Appellant Head and concurs in the residue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-12\">. Wollmann\u2019s original complaint copied the note in the body of it and alleged \u201cIn so executing and delivering said note, defendant Edmiston was acting on his own behalf, and as agent for Head and Butterfield, and was expressly authorized in writing by Head and Butterfield to execute and deliver said note as an obligation binding upon both of them. By reason of the premises, the defendants Head and Edmiston, together with Butterfield, jointly and severally obligated themselves to pay the said note according to its tenor and effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">In his amended complaint filed over Head\u2019s protest and after all of the evidence was in, Wollmann again copied the note, referred to the contract of March 10th executed by Edmiston and charged again: \u201cIn so executing and delivering said note, and in executing the said contract, defendant Edmiston was acting on his own behalf, and as agent for Head and Butterfield, who were, both on and prior to March 10, 1953, associated with him as partners in the development of the lease * * * referred to. In addition, Edmiston was expressly authorized in writing by both Head and Butterfield to execute and deliver the above described contract and note as obligations binding upon both of them. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-18\">Thereupon he copied in the body of the amended complaint Head\u2019s letter to him on March 9th wherein Head stated that Edmiston was authorized to close the deal, but that he would sign the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-19\">The only prayer of the original complaint was repeated in the amended complaint: \u201cWherefore, premises considered, plaintiff prays * * * that upon final trial he have judgment against them, jointly and severally, for the sum of $50,-000.00, together with interest thereon at the rate of two per cent per annum from March 10, 1953 until the date of judgment, plus ten per cent of the amount due as attorney\u2019s fees * <em>* </em>thus demonstrating anew that he was suing upon the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-22\">His brief before us is devoted in considerable part to an effort to support his cross appeal for interest and attorney\u2019s fees as provided in the note.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b383-7\">.
