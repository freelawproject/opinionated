Canopus, a vessel of Panamanian registry. In a reasoned opinion, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 143 F.Supp. 945, Judge Bicks sustained exceptions to the libel because of a previous decision in 1954 by Judge Edelstein in a civil action between the parties as well as in the exercise of independent discretion to decline to accept jurisdiction in this suit between aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-24\"> Judge Edelstein\u2019s dismissal of the civil action was based both upon the statute of limitations and upon a refusal to accept jurisdiction. No appeal was taken from it. Citing N.Y.Civil Practice Act, \u00a7 23, appellant tries here to reopen the question of jurisdiction and assert a new theory of liability. But the claim is now completely <em>res judicata, </em>on jurisdictional as well as substantive issues. Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U.S. 165, 170, 172, 59 S.Ct. 134, 83 L.Ed. 104; Angel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>v.

And any attempt to reopen a judgment in a civil action is completely controlled by F.R.Giv.P. 60(b), not by state statute.</p>\n<p id=\"aur-dedup-0\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
