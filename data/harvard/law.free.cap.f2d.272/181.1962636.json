The Board requests enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-18\">The only issues presented by this appeal are factual ones. We have carefully reviewed the record as a whole and find that there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings that the Company violated Section 8(a) (1) and (3) of the Act.
