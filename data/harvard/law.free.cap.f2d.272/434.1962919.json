Statement of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"A9m\">This is an appeal by a secured creditor, The Textile Banking Company, Inc., (hereafter called \u201cBank\u201d) from an Order of the District Court affirming the Order of Distribution of the assets of Ein-horn Bros., Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">The facts of the case are not in dispute. Sometime prior to January, 1957, Einhorn Bros., Inc., had borrowed money from the appellant Bank. As security for the loan, Einhorn entered into an Inventory Loan Agreement granting the Bank a security interest upon all of Einhorn\u2019s merchandise inventory. Following the filing provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2the Bank perfected its security interest, e. g., obtained a valid lien, upon the inventory in January, 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-17\">Thereafter, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed claims against Einhorn for non-payment of sums due under the Unemployment Compensation Law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and thereby obtained liens upon all real and personal property of Einhorn.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-18\">On June 4, 1957, the Dickinson Realty Company took an assignment of the lease under which Einhorn was operating its business. An installment of rent became due on November 1, 1957, but was not paid. On November 12, 1957, the Dickinson Realty Company had a warrant of distress for rent due and owing served upon Einhorn. The details of the landlord\u2019s distraint are important in this ease, and will be fully discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-19\">On November 18, 1957, the Bank attempted to have the merchandise inventory removed from the leased premises by bringing an action of replevin with bond. On that same day, Einhorn filed a Petition for an Arrangement under Chapter XI of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 701 et seq. The Bankruptcy Court issued an order restraining execution of the Writ of Replevin before the sheriff could have the inventory removed. The Bank took no further action in the replevin action or otherwise to contest the restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-20\">In the months following, Einhorn was unable to meet the terms of the proposed Arrangement, and as a result, an Adjudication of Bankruptcy was entered on January 22, 1958. The Receiver and Trustee finished the manufacture of the merchandise inventory and sold it for $36,025.59. The remaining assets were sold for $9,959.55.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>II. The Distribution in Bankruptcy</p>\n<p id=\"AV7\">The general scheme of distribution of a Bankrupt\u2019s assets under the Federal Bankruptcy Act is shown below.

Other Unsecured Creditors</p>\n<p id=\"b509-22\">1. Claim of the Health Insurance and Retirement Fund of the Philadelphia Dress Joint Board<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 1,200.00</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Referring to the chart, the secured creditors are listed in the order in which their respective liens arose. It must be remembered that the Federal Bankruptcy Act does not provide any rule for deciding questions of superiority among competing liens.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> State law governs such questions. The Commonwealth and the landlord in this case contend that their respective liens are superior to the lien of the Bank, even though the Bank\u2019s lien arose before the liens of the Commonwealth and before the landlord obtained its lien by distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Assuming that this contention is correct, the Trustee in Bankruptcy, following Pennsylvania law, would distribute the proceeds of the merchandise inventory first to the Commonwealth and the landlord, and then to the Bank. But the Trustee would also have to consider the effect of Sec. 67, sub. c(l) of the Federal Bankruptcy Act (quoted in footnote 4, supra) which requires the postponement of payment of both the liens of the Commonwealth and the lien of the landlord to the payment in full of costs of administration and wages. The Act does not in terms postpone the payment of the Bank\u2019s lien. Nor does the Act dictate what effect is to be given the Bank\u2019s lien by the postponement of the two liens superior under State law to the Bank\u2019s lien. This Court has already, however, concluded that the effect to be given the Bank\u2019s lien by the postponement of the superior liens is postponement of the Bank\u2019s lien. In re Quaker City Uniform Co., 3 Cir., 1956, 238 F.2d 155.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Following the doctrine of the Quaker City case, the order of distribution in this case would be (1) costs of administration, (2) wages, (3) liens of Commonwealth, (4) lien of landlord, and (5) Bank\u2019s lien.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That is the order of distribution adopted by the Referee and affirmed by the Court below<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-17\">The Bank did not seriously urge this Court to overrule its decision in Quaker City. Instead the Bank has attempted to show that the claims of the Commonwealth and landlord were not valid liens; or, if these claims did amount to valid liens, such liens were not superior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>lien of the Bank. If the Bank is correct in either of its contentions, then the Bank should have received full satisfaction of its claim out of the proceeds of the sale of the inventory subject to its lien before any other claim was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">III. Validity of the Landlord\u2019s Lien</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The Bank argues that the landlord did not have a valid lien on the merchandise inventory because a landlord\u2019s lien arises only upon goods distrained, and the goods listed in the notice of distress did not include the merchandise inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The requirement that a notice of distress be served upon the tenant is set forth in the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1951, Art. Ill, Sec. 302, Pa.Stat.Ann., Tit. 68, Sec. 250.302 (Purdon, 1958 Supp.). That section provides that personal property upon the leased premises is subject to distress for rent due, and requires the following notice of distress: \u201cNotice in writing of such distress, stating the cause of such taking, <em>specifying the date of levy and the personal property distrained sufficiently to inform the tenant or owner what personal property is distrained </em>and the amount of rent in arrears, shall be given, within five days after making the distress, to the tenant and any other owner known to the landlord * * * \u201d. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Whenever goods upon which there is a distress for rent are sold by a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy the landlord acquires a lien on the proceeds of the sale of such goods.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, the landlord in this case had a lien upon the fund created by the sale of only those goods upon which there was a distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">The notice of distress in this case specified items of office furnishings together with 300 dresses as the property distrained. At the end of this handwritten list of items is printed the phrase \u201ctogether with all and singular the goods and chattels on the premises sufficient to pay the rent and costs.\u201d The notice further specified the rent due and owing as $55,183.62.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">The Bank contends that because merchandise inventories were not specifically mentioned in the list of items distrained in the notice, the inventories cannot properly be regarded as part of the goods which were distrained. This argument would merit more consideration if the Bank had acted, or failed to act, in reliance upon the notice, and had been damaged thereby. But the Bank\u2019s conduct with respect to the merchandise inventory was never affected by anything in the notice. Furthermore, anyone reading the notice in order to determine what property was subject to the landlord\u2019s distress would have been fairly apprised, both from the catch-all phrase printed at the end of the list of the items distrained, and from the amount of rent claimed as due, of the fact that <em>all </em>personal property on the premises was included.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">We hold that the landlord had the right to distrain all of the personal property on the premises, including the merchandise inventory; that the landlord did restrain all such property; and that the notice of distraint gave adequate warning to anyone interested that all property on the premises was subject to the landlord\u2019s distraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">The next contention of the Bank is that when it caused to issue a Writ of Replevin With Bond, the landlord\u2019s rights in the inventory were thereby annulled. The Bank bases this conclusion on a line of Pennsylvania cases<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which hold that once property, upon which there was a warrant of distress, has been replevied, the landlord must rely on the replevin bond for satisfaction of his claim for rent. Therefore, argues the Bank, the landlord in this case lost its lien upon the inventories when the Writ of Replevin was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>But the landlord was never able to look to the replevin bond for satisfaction of its claim for rent. A replevin bond is designed to protect a party interested in the property replevied against any loss which might be caused by the conduct of the party who has gained possession of this property, pending the outcome of the action of replevin. The Bank here never gained possession of the inventory, and so there was no need to protect the landlord\u2019s interest in the inventory by way of a replevin bond. The landlord, therefore, did not lose its lien on the inventory when the Bank instituted the action of replevin.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The last argument made by the Bank to show that the landlord did not have a valid lien is based entirely on the case of In re Mount Holly Paper Co., 3 Cir., 1940, 110 F.2d 220.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Mount Holly case<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> is easily distinguishable from the case at bar because it was decided under sections of the Federal Bankruptcy Act which are no longer in force.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In conclusion, we hold that the Dickinson Realty Company, landlord, had a lien for $1,054.11 on the proceeds of the sale of all the assets of the Bankrupt, including the merchandise inventory, which lien was neither annulled by the issuance of the Writ of Replevin nor forfeited by the landlord\u2019s distraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">IV. The Superiority of the Landlord\u2019s Lien</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">The final argument of the Bank against the landlord is that the Bank\u2019s lien was superior to the landlord\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-14\"> It is true that even though the landlord had a valid lien on the proceeds of the sale of the merchandise inventory, the Bank\u2019s lien should not have been postponed in payment (under Sec. 67, sub. c(l) of the Federal Bankruptcy Act; see footnote 4, supra) unless the landlord\u2019s lien was superior to the Bank\u2019s lien under Pennsylvania law. As the Court below points out, before the Uniform Commercial Code, a landlord\u2019s lien was given superiority over other liens by Pennsylvania statute<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and case-law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Uniform Commercial Code does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>apply to a landlord\u2019s lien,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and, therefore, we conclude, does not change existing Pennsylvania law.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The Bank offered one final argument against the superiority of the landlord\u2019s lien which was adequately answered by the Court below.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Referee, then, correctly applied the doctrine of the Quaker City case (footnote 9, supra) in postponing payment of the Bank\u2019s lien until costs of administration, claims for wages, and the landlord\u2019s lien were paid in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">V. The Superiority of the Liens of the Commonwealth</p>\n<p id=\"b513-15\">Applicable Pennsylvania statutes clearly indicate the superiority of the Commonwealth\u2019s liens for sums due under the Unemployment Compensation Law over any other liens on the same property.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In order to overcome the clear statutory directives, the Bank relies first on the case of Commonwealth, etc., v. Lombardo.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Bank points out the following language in that opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>\u201c * * * The language of section 308.1 of the Unemployment Compensation Law [Tit. 43 Sec. 788.1 of Purdon\u2019s, see footnote 21, supra] is not in our opinion effective to establish a lien against the personal property of an employer so as to prevent its transfer to a bona fide purchaser for value prior to the time that the writ of fieri facias, the first step in the execution process, is placed in the hands of the sheriff.\u201d At pages 608, 609 of 356 Pa., at page 662 of 52 A.2d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">From this statement the Bank concludes that the Commonwealth, in the case at bar, never had a valid lien against the merchandise inventories of the Bankrupt, since the Commonwealth never issued a writ of fieri facias.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The simple answer to this contention is found in the same statement from the Lombardo case upon which the Bank relies: The Court says that the language of Sec. 308.1 is not effective to establish a lien against personal property of an employer <em>\u201cso as to prevent its transfer to a bona fide purchaser for value.\u201d </em>The Bank contends, however, that its lien is entitled to the same protection against the Commonwealth\u2019s lien as is accorded a bona fide purchaser for value. But this contention assumes the result for which the Bank argues. The whole point of the Lombardo case is that Sec. 308.1 does not <em>specifically </em>state the effect to be given the Commonwealth\u2019s lien as against a bona fide purchaser for value. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court itself stated in the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">\u201cThe real question here is whether an innocent purchaser of personal property ought to be bound by such notice as is afforded by the filing of the lien. As we have analyzed the law, under the principles of statutory construction, our answer is no.\u201d At page 605 of 356 Pa., at page 661 of 52 A.2d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">But as to the effect of the Commonwealth\u2019s lien <em>as against competing liens, </em>Sec. 308.1 <em>specifically </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">\u201cAll contributions * * * thus entered of record shall <em>first </em>be allowed and paid out of the proceeds of such sale * * * \u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">The Fiscal Code (72 Purdon Stat. \u00a7 1401, 1958 Supp., quoted in footnote 21, supra) specifically provides that at a judicial sale the Commonwealth's lien shall be allowed <em>before any other claim or lien. </em>The Lombardo case has no effect on the clear meaning of these statutes as applied to the facts of the case at bar, i. e., as applied to the question of the superiority of the Commonwealth\u2019s lien as against the lien of the Bank at a judicial sale, or sale in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">But the Bank contends that the Lombardo case has already been applied by this Court in resolving a question of competing liens. In the case of Ersa Inc. v. Dudley, 3 Cir., 1956, 234 F.2d 178, this Court held that the filing of a lien for unpaid contributions due under the Unemployment Compensation Law does <em>not </em>create a perfected lien upon the employer\u2019s personal property, and that the lien is perfected only when a writ of fieri facias is delivered to the sheriff. Following the statement in the Lombardo case (to the effect that the lien is not established until the sheriff has the writ of fieri facias), the Court held that as between a prior recorded lien of the Commonwealth and a lien of the United States, the lien of the United States prevailed, although arising (in point of time) <em>after </em>the Commonwealth\u2019s liens were recorded.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>The Court below distinguished the Ersa case on the ground that it determined the extent to which liens of the Commonwealth (arising under the Unemployment Compensation Law) must be perfected in order to prevail over a subsequent lien of the Federal Government. In addition, we observe another distinguishing feature of the Ersa case, which is that the lien competing with that of the Commonwealth arose subsequent to the recording- of the Commonwealth\u2019s lien, whereas here the lien competing with that of the Commonwealth arose prior to the recording of the Commonwealth\u2019s lien. In the case at bar whether or not the Commonwealth issued a writ of fieri facias could have made no difference to the Bank. This is true since it obtained the lien prior to the time of recording by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The Referee and the Court below, therefore, correctly determined that the lien of the Bank was inferior to that of the Commonwealth and as a result, it was entitled to priority of payment over the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The decision of the Court below is affirmed.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-11\">.

The lease contained an acceleration clause providing that upon default by the lessee future rent would mature and become due. The landlord, considering the future rent as due, distrained for the $900.-00 past due and for $3,000.00, one year\u2019s rent in advance. The Special Master awarded the landlord the $900.00 only.. The landlord objected to the Master\u2019s refusal to award him the $3000.00 for future rent due and to the Master\u2019s subordination of his claim to claims for wages. The District Court affirmed the Master\u2019s report.

Under that Act, in order for a lien to be valid against the trustee in bankruptcy, ' the lien had to be \u201cgiven or accepted in good faith\u201d (Sec. 67, sub. d of the Act). Furthermore, as pointed out in footnote 15, supra, if a landlord had acquired a valid lien under state law securing one year\u2019s rent, the Bankruptcy Act recognized that lien without limitation as to the amount of rent it could secure. Under the present Act, a lien is limited to the amount of rent owing for three months of actual occupancy (Sec. 67, sub. c(l) and Sec. 64 of the present Act). Therefore, today, no matter how much rent a landlord claims in his notice of distress, he cannot possibly obtain a lien for more than the amount of rent due for three months actual occupancy. Therefore, the bad-faith-argument adopted by the Court in the Mount Holly case has no application under the law as it is today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b512-17\">.

This is the doctrine whereby one claiming a lien against two or more classes of property, one of which is also subject to a junior lien, will be required to exact satisfaction from the property not subject to the junior lien. Thus, the junior lien is preserved where other assets exist sufficient to satisfy the senior lien. See Collier, op. cit. supra, par. 67.27, at 300. Textile\u2019s reliance upon the doctrine in the instant case is misplaced. Although the landlord\u2019s lien attached to property on the bankrupt\u2019s premises other than that subject to Textile\u2019s security interest, by virtue of \u00a7 67, sub. c(l), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 107, sub. c(l), the lien is subordinated to both wages and costs of administration. These latter claims are more than sufficient to exhaust all other assets of the estate, thus compelling, the landlord to resort to the fund claimed by Textile. In this situation, the possibility of marshaling is obviously excluded.\u201d Matter of Einhorn Bros., Inc., D.C.E.D.Pa.1959, 171 F.Supp. 655, 660.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b513-9\">. \u201cContributions to be Liens; entry thereof</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-10\">\u201cAll contributions * * * due and payable by an employer * * * shall be a lien upon the franchises and property, both real and personal, of the employer * * * from the date a lien for such contributions * * * is entered of record in the manner hereinafter provided.

The facts in that case were as follows: One Patsy Lombardo owed the Commonwealth sums due under the Unemployment Compensation Act. The Commonwealth recorded the debt and thereby obtained a lien upon the debtor\u2019s property. The Commonwealth reduced the lien to a judgment in 1943. In 1946 the debtor transferred his automobile to one Bose Lom-bardo. A few months later, the Commonwealth issued a writ of fieri facias and the sheriff seized the automobile from Bose Lombardo. Bose Lombardo was eoncededly a bona fide purchaser for value without actual notice of the lien. The Commonwealth argued that the purchaser had constructive notice of the lien since the lien was recorded. The Court held, however, that Bose Lombardo took the automobile free from the Commonwealth\u2019s lien. In the opinion the Court stated: \u201cNo such restriction on the alienation of personal property has existed in our law * * *. If we are to read such an intent into the law, [i. e., the Unemployment Compensation Law] it would seem that the language of the act should state clearly and unequivocally its purpose to limit one of the incidents of ownership of personalty, that is, its freedom of alienation by transfer of possession.\u201d At page 603, of 356 Pa., at page 659 of 52 A.2d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\">. In the Ersa case, one Manos owed $223.56 to the Commonwealth for sums due under the Unemployment Compensation Law. In 1950, the Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>recorded the debt and obtained a first lien on Manos\u2019 restaurant equipment. The lien was subsequently reduced to a judgment. <em>Thereafter </em>(in 1952) liens for taxes due the United States were recorded. In 1954, the Commonwealth issued a writ of fieri facias on the judgment, and the restaurant equipment was sold for \u00a7179.87 to the Commonwealth, which in turn sold it to Ersa for $1,436.-68. The Director of Internal Revenue then posted a notice of levy on the property bought by Ersa, and Ersa brought this action to strike the levy. The District Court, 134 F.Supp. 627, quashed the levy, on the theory that (1) Federal law determines the superiority between liens for taxes due the United States and taxes due a State, and (2) the test of superiority under Federal law is first-in-time, first-in-right. Therefore, the lien of the Commonwealth, being first in time, prevailed over the lien of the Federal Government. The Circuit Court agreed with the District Court except in one important respect; i. e., the Circuit Court held that the lien of the Commonwealth was <em>not </em>prior in time to that of the Federal Government, since the Commonwealth\u2019s lien is not \u201cperfected\u201d until issuance of a writ of fieri facias.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b515-19\">.
