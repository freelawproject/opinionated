Associate Judges].</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b470-30\">MARTIN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b470-31\">This appeal is from a decision of the Commissioner of Patents, acting through the Assistant Commissioner, affirming the decision of the Examiner of Interferences sustaining the opposition b5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Maas &amp; Waldstein Co., appellee here, to the applications for registration of \u201cPlexichrome\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for a \u201cfinish coating for asphalt and concrete surfaces,\u201d and for \u201cPlexicolor\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for \u201cpaint for masonry walls.\u201d Opposer, whose earlier use is conceded, owns the trademark \u201cPlex-tone\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for \u201cindustrial coating finishes for producing multiple-colored film coatings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">The Assistant Commissioner found that the products identified by the marks in issue each \u201cfall in the broad category of \u2018paint products\u2019 * * * \u201d and reach the same prospective purchasers through the same trade channels. Upon considering the marks themselves, the Assistant Commissioner held that despite certain aural and visual differences, \u201cthey stimulate almost identical mental associations,\u201d and that confusion of prospective purchasers was therefore likely, when applied to the goods in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Applicant urges that its coatings comprise aqueous dispersions of acrylic resins produced only in monotone colors whose chemical nature and use is \u201cdistinctly different\u201d from the multi-colored enamel type of paint product bearing opposer\u2019s mark. It further contends that the prefix \u201cPlexi\u201d is in wide use on acrylic resinous products and other paints, dies and chemical products, as evidenced by several registrations to third parties introduced in evidence, and that therefore prospective purchasers would be less likely to be confused between trademarks comprising the common prefix \u201cPlex\u201d or \u201cPlexi.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Applicant further contends that the prefix \u201cPlex\u201d is descriptive of the goods in controversy. This contention is based upon various dictionary definitions referring to that syllable as a combining form pertaining to a weaving or twining together, connoting complication or complexity, as in the complexity of color associated with opposer's multi-color product.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">Opposer has moved to strike from the record applicant\u2019s exhibits appended to its \u201cRequest for Reconsideration\u201d of the decision of the Examiner of Interferences, and those exhibits attached to \u201cApplicant\u2019s Reply\u201d to the examiner\u2019s denial of such \u201cRequest * The motion is herewith granted to the extent that those matters not introduced in evidence prior to the close of testimony have not been considered in reaching our decision herein, namely Exhibits O to W inclusive, and the matter submitted therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">Regardless of the specific compositions of applicant\u2019s and opposer\u2019s products, we agree with the Assistant Commissioner that since they are used as finish coatings of various surfaces, they all come within the general category of paint products. In addition, there is nothing in appellant\u2019s applications which limits the marks set forth therein to \u201cacrylic emulsion paints,\u201d though the accompanying specimens indicate the current marketing of a \u201cplexiglass type dispersion\u201d under each mark set forth. Since the likelihood of confusion must be determined on the basis of the \u201cgoods covered in appellant\u2019s applications,\u201d Intercontinental Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Continental Motors Corp., 230 F.2d 621, 43 CCPA 841, the present composition of those goods, not disclosed in the applications, is not controlling. Cf. Meyer Chemical Co. v. Anahist Co., Inc. (Warner-Lambert Pharmaceutical Co., Assignee, Substituted), 263 F.2d 344, 46 CCPA 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">Furthermore, although the surfaces to which the products may be applied are identical in some instances and vary in others, all are so closely related that for the purpose of resolving the issues in this controversy, we find that no significant distinction exists. The op-poser\u2019s witness testified that its products are sold through two channels of distribution; the first by company representatives who solicit business from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>manufacturers of furniture, television sets, caskets and similar articles; and the second, by franchised distributors who sell to building and painting contractors. The witness testified further that the opposer company does not sell directly to the \u201chome user.\u201d However, the company does suggest a retail price which, we presume, is for the guidance of the distributor in the retail trade. With reference to the applicant, the stipulation of record states that \u201cThe applicant\u2019s coatings and finishes including the coating identified by the trademark \u2018Plexicolor,\u2019 are sold through established paint dealers and distributors, and to paint contractors, institutions, commercial users and home owners directly as well.\u201d In view of this evidence we conclude that the products of both parties move generally in the same channels of trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">As to the words themselves, applicant contends that the prefixes \u201cPlex\u201d and \u201cPlexi\u201d are weak since marks containing those syllables are commonly registered in the paint and related trades. It has introduced a number of third party registrations in endeavoring to support this proposition. Only one, \u201cPlexite,\u201d is registered for paint products. We do not believe that this one registration for a paint product substantiates the contention that such prefixes are descriptive of any material in this field. Considering the words \u201cPlextone,\u201d \u201cPlexichrome\u201d and \u201cPlexicolor\u201d in their entireties, we agree with the conclusion of the Assistant Commissioner that the words \u201clook and sound somewhat different but they stimulate almost identical mental associations\u201d and, since the record discloses extensive advertising of \u201cPlextone\u201d by the opposer in connection with the promotion of its product over a five-year period and also reveals a large volume of sales during this same period, and since a substantial doubt is raised as to the likelihood of public confusion, such factors require this court to resolve that doubt in favor of the first user.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">For these reasons we affirm the decision of the Assistant Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">WORLEY, C. J., dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">JOHNSON, J., concurs as to \u201cPlexi-chrome\u201d and dissents as to \u201cPlexicolor.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-8\">.
