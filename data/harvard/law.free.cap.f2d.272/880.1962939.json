United States, 1954, 348 U.S. 19, 75 S.Ct. 6 [99 L.Ed. 20], cast its dark shadow on the traditional admiralty trial de novo it has become common practice for losing parties to approach this court with some temerity, feeling, quite understandably, that the burdens cast upon them by McAllister are practically insurmountable.\u201d Planting itself firmly, however, on \u201cthe sincere belief that the findings of the district court are clearly and manifestly erroneous\u201d, and, arguing its case with a vigor and assurance worthy of a better cause, it makes a gallant but unsuccessful attempt to overcome the heavy odds against it. For a careful consideration of the record <em>convinces </em>us that the findings are not only not clearly erroneous but are well supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-20\">The judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
