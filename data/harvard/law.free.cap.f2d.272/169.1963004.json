Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, as tolling the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">Thereupon the defendant, alleging: that plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is barred by Article 5526 of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, the two year statute of limitations-; that plaintiff\u2019s complaint shows on its face that \u201cArticle 5539a. Limitations on dismissal for want of jurisdiction and refiling action in proper court\u201d, is not applicable to this case, and, that therefore, it did not toll the running of the statute; moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">The district judge, on the authority of the Texas cases relied on by defendant, Chalmers v. Am. National Ins. Co., Tex.Civ.App., 103 S.W.2d 228, Binge v. Gulf Coast Orchards Co., Tex.Civ.App., 93 S.W.2d 813, Garrett v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indemnity Co., Tex.Civ.App., 107 S.W.2d 726, City of Ranger v. Gholson, Tex.Civ.App., 141 S.W.2d 396, granted the motion, and plaintiff has appealed, urging upon us that, while the cases relied on by defendant-appellee do support its view, the decision of the Court of Civil Appeals, in Burford v. Sun Oil Co., Tex.Civ.App., 186 S.W.2d 306, is to the contrary and controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-14\">We do not think so. Indeed, we think it clear that the Burford case is not in conflict, but in accord, with the cases on which appellee and the district judge relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-15\">The judgment was right. It is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
