Subsequent thereto, appellant was unable to continue the services of his retained counsel and, at his request, this Court appointed counsel to aid him in the preparation and presentation of his appeal. By letter, this appointed counsel has advised the Court that, \u201cI have carefully reviewed the entire record in this case and can find nothing in the nature of reversible error.\u201d No argument has been heard from the appellee, but since the report from appointed counsel each of the three judges composing this Court has carefully read and considered the entire record and has become satisfied that counsel has diligently investigated any possible grounds of appeal, and agrees with counsel\u2019s evaluation of the case. The Court is of the opinion that any issues which might be raised are so frivolous that the appeal should be dismissed. Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 39 (a), 18 U.S.C. Compare Ellis v. United States, 1958, 356 U.S. 674, 78 S.Ct. 974, 2 L.Ed.2d 1060. Counsel\u2019s request for leave to withdraw from the case is therefore granted, and the appeal is</p>\n<p id=\"b767-22\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
