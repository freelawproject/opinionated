These two subsequent items were (1) the employer\u2019s wage increase of October 7,1954, and (2) the employer\u2019s withdrawal on November 19, 1954 of recognition of the union on the ground that the union no longer represented the majority of its employees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">As our study of the record pursuant to the mandate convinces us that there was substantial evidence on the record as a whole in support of at least one of these two subsequent items, neither of which was previously assayed by the majority on the prior hearing because of the holding on \u00a7 10(b), we find it unnecessary to reconsider those matters occurring within the six-month period. In accordance with the mandate, it follows that the Board\u2019s order should be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-13\">. Footnote 10 was appended to the last word of the opinion and road:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-14\">\u201c10. The Board urges that we instruct the Court of Appeals to enforce the Board\u2019s order. We decline to do so. Cf. National Labor Relations Board v. Pittsburgh S.S. Co., 340 U.S. 498, 71 S.Ct. 453, 95 L.Ed. 479. However, we think it appropriate to state that if the factual summary contained in Judge Rives\u2019 dissenting opinion finds support in the record as a whole, the Board\u2019s order should be enforced \u2018even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.\u2019 Universal Camera Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456. 467.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b846-13\">.
