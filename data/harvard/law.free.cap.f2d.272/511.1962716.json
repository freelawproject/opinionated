Her counsel chose the District Court because he believed that the Municipal Court lacked jurisdiction in cases involving the title to real estate. On motion of the appellee, the complaint was dismissed by the District Court on April 6, 1959, for lack of jurisdiction. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Whatever may have been the state of the law prior to September 9, 1959, the Congress on that date amended \u00a7 11-762, D.C.Code (1951, Supp. VII) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by extending the jurisdiction of the Domestic Relations Branch of the Municipal Court of the District of Columbia to cover adjudication of property rights in actions involved in that section. As so amended \u00a7 11-762 reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">\u201cThe Domestic Relations Branch and each judge sitting therein shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all actions for divorce from the bond of marriage and legal separation from bed and board, including proceedings incidental to such actions for * * * <em>determinations and adjudications of property rights, both real and personal, in any action hereina-bove referred to in this section, irrespective of any jurisdictional limitation imposed on the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia </em>* * *.\u201d (Italics indicate the amendment.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">The case will be remanded to the District Court with directions to vacate its order dismissing the cause for lack of jurisdiction and to transfer the case to the Municipal Court for trial in that tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-13\">Remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-28\">.
