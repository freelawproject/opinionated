The district court sustained defendant's motion to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s complaint on the merits, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">Appellant Brass and Copper Workers Federal Labor Union No. 19322, AFL-CIO (Union) and appellee American Brass Company, Kenosha Division, a Subsidiary of Anaconda Copper Company (Company) entered into an Amended Pension Plan Agreement and a Collective Bargaining Agreement (Agreement). The latter Agreement provided for arbitration under two separate sections. Article VII of the Agreement, entitled \u201cGrievance Procedure,\u201d provided for a series of \u201csteps\u201d to be followed in the procedure of adjusting \u201cany complaint, controversy or grievance\u201d involving the \u201cterms\u201d of the Agreement. After conferences between the Company and Union at successively higher levels, provision was made for a joint or unilateral request for the intervention of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (Mediation Service). Article VII expressly retained for both parties the right of arbitration in the case of discharges for cause or disciplinary layoffs, but such requests were required to be made \u201cin writing <em>within ten (10) days after the Company\u2019s final answer in writing to the Union.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b922-13\">Article VIII of the Agreement, entitled \u201cArbitration,\u201d provided for arbitration of \u201cany dispute\u201d involving \u201cthe interpretation or application of any part of this Agreement which cannot be settled between the parties.\u201d This article also specified a time limit for submission to arbitration of \u201cten (10) days following the date when it is determined that the parties cannot agree.\u201d The Article further required that the issues for decision be set forth in writing and that arbitrators confine their decision to such issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-14\">Thus both articles provided that arbitration must be requested within ten days as above set out. The contract did not, as such, indicate whether a court or an arbitrator should determine that the parties had complied with this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-15\">Both the Pension Plan and the Collective Bargaining Agreement were in effect on April 1, 1955, when the Company compulsorily retired all employees who were then 69 years of age or older. Such employees were not eligible for pensions under the Pension Plan<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because of insufficient service with the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-16\">On April 4, 1955, the Union orally and in writing <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> protested the compulsory re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>tirement of the non-pensioners, complaining that such retirements constituted discharges without \u201ccause,\u201d contrary to the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, and requested reinstatement and reimbursement for any loss suffered by reason of the compulsory retirement. The Company refused to. reinstate the employees; it never gave a written answer to the Union\u2019s letter of April 4th.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">On April 12, 1955, the Union wrote the Company as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-5\">\u201cIn accordance with Article VII Section 4 lines 199 to 202 we request that the Company join with us in submitting the question of illegal discharge of employees mentioned in our communication to you under date of April 4, 1955, to the U. S. Department of Conciliation for disposal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-6\">\u201cPlease advise at your convenience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">The Company\u2019s reply of April 14, 1955 was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-8\">\u201cWe acknowledge receipt of your communication of April 12, 1955 wherein you request that the Company join you in seeking the services of the U. S. Department of Conciliation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-9\">\u201cThe Company does not consider that the retirement of certain employees referred to in your letter of April 4, 1955 to be illegal discharges and consequently cannot join you in your request.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">After the Company\u2019s refusal to join in a mutual request to submit the grievance to the Mediation Service, the Union did not immediately request arbitration, but made a unilateral request for the Mediation Service to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">On May 23, 1955, Virgil H. Burtz, a Commissioner of the Mediation Service, after having conferred with the Company, informed the Union that \u201cvery little, if anything, could be gained by a joint conference with one of our Commissioners present, as both parties\u2019 positions are firm\u201d and that the parties were \u201cfree to proceed with arbitration in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-12\">On June 6, 1955, thirteen days after receipt of Burtz\u2019s letter, the Union requested arbitration of the discharges in the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-13\">\u201cIn accordance with Section 4 of Article VII the Union has contacted the Federal Mediation &amp; Conciliation Service requesting that they mediate the dispute between the American Brass Company and Local No. 19322 regarding the discharge of employees 68 years of age and over. We have been advised that they are unable to mediate said dispute at this time. We are requesting that in accordance with the terms of our agreement that this question be submitted to arbitration. Please advise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-14\">No written reply was ever received to this letter. On August 7, 1957, the Union instituted this action to compel arbitration of the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-15\">In the action below, the parties conceded the substantive arbitrability of the discharge O', <em>e., </em>that the dispute is the type that the parties had agreed to arbitrate), but the Company contended that the merits of the case could not be reached because the Union had not followed the <em>procedural </em>requirements of the collective bargaining agreement. Specifically, the Company contended that the Union had not (as required by the Agreement) filed its request to arbitrate within ten days after the receipt of the Company\u2019s \u201cfinal answer\u201d of April 14, 1955. The Union argued that its filing was timely, or at least, that there was no prejudice even though the request for arbitration was filed delinquently. This conflict obviously required an interpretation of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-16\">But there was further conflict between the parties regarding <em>who </em>should resolve this problem. The Company stated that it was the responsibility of the court, in a suit for specific performance, to determine whether the Company had <em>broken its promise </em>to arbitrate. This determination must include not only the issue of whether the Company had agreed to arbitrate the subject matter (substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>arbitrability) but also whether the Union had complied with the agreed procedure to bring the grievance to arbitration (procedural arbitrability). The Union, however, contended that the latter matter should be determined by the arbitrator himself prior to his consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">The district court held that under the contract in question, the issue of procedural compliance necessary to bring the matter before the arbitrator was itself arbitrable under Article VIII as an \u201cinterpretation * * * of any term of the agreement,\u201d but that since the dispute was not negotiated below and <em>formally </em>made a part of the grievance procedure, it was not an arbitrable dispute properly subject to a decree for specific performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">. Since the dispute over procedural arbi-trability had not been formally processed through the grievance procedure, the trial court could find no inference from the Agreement that the parties intended this issue to be submitted to the arbitrator. Relying on the case of Boston Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Insurance Agents\u2019 Int. Union, 1 Cir., 1958, 258 F.2d 516, the court determined the issue was one for it to decide. Proceeding with such determination and analysis of the Agreement, it held'that under the procedure of Article VII, the Union must consider the Company\u2019s letter of April 14, 1955 as a \u201cfinal answer.\u201d But even assuming the Union was proceeding under Article VIII (although its letter of June 6 mentioned only Article VII), Burtz\u2019s letter of May 23 was held to be a \u201cfinal answer,\u201d and the request for arbitration was not made until thirteen days later. Since this was in excess of the time limit stated in \u201cunambiguous language\u201d in the Agreement, the court refused to grant specific performance, holding that the Union \u201chas lost its rights to enforcement of the arbitration promise by non-compliance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">This appeal is based on dual grounds, first, that the issue of compliance with the Agreement is for the arbitrator to decide, and second, if for the court, that the court below erred in its determination of the issues under the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">The question of procedural arbitrability is therefore drawn in sharp terms. The necessity for determining this issue flows, essentially, from the case of Textile Workers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills, 1957, 353 U.S. 448, 77 S.Ct. 912, 1 L.Ed.2d 972, in which the Court held that promises to arbitrate were specifically enforceable under \u00a7 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act and that federal rules of decision controlled cases under this section. Since there was no extensive residuum of federal law except the express provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act on this subject, the Court charged the judiciary to fashion a federal common law on a case-by-case basis. In exercising this traditional judicial function, courts were to be guided by the purposes of national labor legislation and could absorb state rules of decision as federal law when such were consistent with the goals of national labor policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">Subsequent to the holding that \u00a7 301 provides a forum for a party to bring an action to compel arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement, federal courts have been faced with the problem of determining when it is proper to order arbitration. The initial problem involved substantive arbitrability, which in turn, required a delineation of the power and responsibility of judges and arbitrators. It is obvious that an arbitrator\u2019s range of decision is necessarily restricted by a court\u2019s prior determination whether the parties had agreed to arbitrate the subject matter of the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">In each case it is a collective bargaining agreement that the court must interpret. In certain instances the parties expressly indicate that arbitrability is for the courts. See Local 201, Intern. Union of Elec. Radio and Mach. Workers, A.F.L.-C.I.O. v. General Electric Company, 1 Cir., 1959, 262 F.2d 265. Many times parties voluntarily submit arbitra-bility to the arbitrators.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>- The difficult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>\u2022case arises, as here, when the agreement \u2022does not expressly indicate who should \u2022decide this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">It is now well-settled that issues \u25a0of substantive arbitrability are for the courts to determine. The keystone decision was Local No. 149 of Am. Federation of Technical Engineers (A.F.L.) v. General Electric Company, 1 Cir., 1957, 250 F.2d 922, certiorari denied 1958, 356 U.S. 938, 78 S.Ct. 780, 2 L.Ed.2d 813. Chief Judge Magruder there concluded that when one of the parties to a collective bargaining agreement appears before a court requesting a decree ordering specific performance of a contract to arbitrate, the court \u201chas the inescapable obligation to determine as a preliminary matter that the defendant has contracted to refer such issue to arbitration, and has broken this promise.\u201d Id., 250 F.2d at page 927.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">In this decision Chief Judge Magruder examined the contention of those commentators who urge that the issue of substantive arbitrability be left, in the first instance, for the arbitrator.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But he concludes that these arguments are not controlling in the case where a party comes to the court for specific performa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>nee,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but are important and persuasive for the parties at the bargaining table in writing a contract which grants arbitrators wide scope in their decisions and even in expressly reserving such a determination for the arbitrator.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">In the sole post-Lincoln Mills case under \u00a7 301 which has involved procedural arbitrability, Boston Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Insurance Agents\u2019 Int. Union, 1 Cir., 1958, 258 F.2d 516, Chief Judge Magruder held that the court was unwilling to \u201cwhittle away\u201d the holding in Local No. 149 and determined that under the rationale of that case, procedural arbitrability is in the first instance, a matter for the courts to determine.7 <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">In Boston Mutual, the employer requested a declaratory judgment that the union\u2019s grievance claim with respect to the discharge of an employee had not been submitted for arbitration within a reasonable time and was therefore not subject to arbitration. In his holding, Chief Judge Magruder again referred to the large body of opinion which argues that arbitrators should be given wide sway, but concludes this is relevant to the bargaining table, not to a decree for enforcement. He stated, however, that-\u201cpractical considerations as to what, would best promote effective labor arbi-trations,\u201d id., 258 F.2d at page 517,. might be an element in construing the-scope of ambiguous language as to the-matters sent to arbitration. However, the court concluded that the \u201cinescapable-obligation\u201d of determining the issue of seasonable submission to arbitration was for the court,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and remanded for that consideration.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">We approve the rationale of the-decision in Boston Mutual. In the ease where a collective bargaining agreement gives no indication of the intended party to determine the issue of procedural arbitrability, it is, in the first instance, for the court to make this decision in a suit, brought to compel arbitration. Accordingly, we hold that the district court was correct in considering this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">Further, having found that the-district court properly considered the issue of procedural arbitrability, we find no error in its disposition of this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>Even considering the events most favorable to appellants (that the letter of May 23 was the \u201cfinal answer\u201d), appellant\u2019s request for arbitration came too late under the terms of the Agreement, since it was made thirteen days after receipt of the final answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\">The judgment of the district court dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint on the merits is</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-10\">. The Pension Plan Agreement provided for the termination of the eligible employee\u2019s services following his sixty-eighth birthday, unless written permission was given to continue service beyond that date. On January 1, 1955, - Company had retired all workers eligible under the Pension Plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b922-11\">. \u201cIn accordance with the Agreement now in effect between the American Brass Company and Local No. 19322, F.L.U.A.F.L., the Union protests the illegal discharge of certain employees, listed in your communication to the Union under date of February 14, 1955, because of age. We further request reinstatement of said employees with all rights restored and retroactive pay for time lost because of such illegal discharge.\u201d (Relevant section of Union\u2019s letter)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b924-8\">. A survey conducted by the American Arbitration Association of 1,728 grievances in 1954 shows that the issue of arbitra-bility was raised in a total of 138 cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>or 7.7%. In 41 of these cases, arbitra-bility was the sole issue. Only three of 1,183 cases studied involved court action to compel specific performance of the promise to arbitrate.

It is said that a collective bargaining contract is a very special type of document, in respect of interpretation, as to which an arbitrator has certain advantages over a court; that a collective bargaining agreement, though embracing a multitude of terms covering numerous employees working at various tasks, cannot be expected to have pin-pointed each of many problems to be dealt with in relations between the management and the union; that the contract instead contains unexpressed assumptions that many procedures and practices will continue; that under the more simplified and speedy procedures of an arbitration, more evidence with regard to these unexpressed assumptions may be available, and an arbitrator may have the additional advantage of background knowledge derived from past experiences with the parties. Therefore it may be desirable in the first instance to have an arbitrator pass on the threshold question of arbitrability, instead of running the possible risk that a court, in the guise of ruling on this preliminary question of the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, may in effect make a ruling upon the merits of the asserted grievance.

A state ease heavily relied upon by appellant here, Southwestern New Hampshire Transp. Co. v. Durham, 1959, 102 N.H. 169, 152 A.2d 596, holds that procedural arbitrability is for the arbitrator to decide. This case, however, was an <em>appeal </em>from the prior ruling of arbitrators. It does not meet the core of the problem in an action to <em>compel </em>arbitration, in which the court has to determine how extensively it would examine whether the reluctant party had breached its promise to arbitrate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b926-7\">.
