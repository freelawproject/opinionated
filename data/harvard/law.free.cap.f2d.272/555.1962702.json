In his complaint he alleged that his wife, appellant Mazie M. Vito, on October 30, 1956 had been duly adjudicated <em>non compos mentis, </em>and he asked that a guardian ad litem be appointed. That step was taken. The guardian filed a report in lieu of answer but admitted the adjudication of in-competeney and that on December 13, 1956, Mr. Vito had purchased Lot 80 in Square 37 in the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellee Bonart answered the complaint. He admitted he had entered into a binding contract to purchase that particular property and prayed for the entry of an order to enable Mr. Vito to convey a \u201cgood, complete and insurable title to the property.\u201d After denying Mrs. Vito\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the District Court entered a judgment authorizing Mr. Vito to convey to appellee Bonart the described premises \u201cas fully as if the said James Vito were unmarried.\u201d The guardian has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-19\">The record shows that on October 3, 1957, Mr. Vito contracted to sell the described real estate to Mr. Bonart.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant concedes that Mr. Vito at any time up to November 29, 1957 could have conveyed a clear title without his wife\u2019s joining in a deed through a guardian. He correctly so concludes, for ever since 1901,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> D.C.Code \u00a7 18-204 (1951) had provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-21\">\u201cWhere any married woman is a lunatic or insane, and has been so found upon inquisition, and the said finding remains in force * * * the husband of such lunatic or insane * * * person may grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>and convey by his separate deed * * * as fully as if he were unmarried, any real estate which he may have acquired since the finding of such inquisition * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">But, the guardian now argues, the husband\u2019s sole authority so to execute a deed was terminated as of November 29, 1957, by Public Law 85-244,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>section 3(b) of which reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">\u201cThe intestate share * * * shall attach to all real property owned by husband or wife during cover-ture: <em>Provided, </em>That neither husband nor wife hereafter shall have the right to convey, transfer or encumber his or her real property free of the surviving spouse\u2019s interest in case of intestacy, as provided in this Act, without joinder of the other .spouse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Appellant\u2019s reliance upon the foregoing provision is misplaced. Although the Act specifically repealed many sections of the 1901 Act, Congress voiced no such repealer of section 18-204, supra. Under that section rights had accrued both in Mr. Vito and in Mr. Bonart.\u00ae The real estate here, the subject matter in suit, had been acquired subsequent to the adjudication of incompetency, the finding as to which had not thereafter been disturbed. The contract of sale had been entered into by Messrs. Vito and Bonart before the effective date of the 1957 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">It is fundamental that a \u201cretrospective operation will not be given to a statute which interferes with antecedent rights, or by which human action is regulated, unless such be \u2018the unequivocal and inflexible import of the terms, and the manifest intention of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d Union Pac.
