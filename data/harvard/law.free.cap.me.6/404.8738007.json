The defendant pleaded a general release, in bar of the action ; to which the plaintiff, after <em>oyer, </em>demurred.</p><p id=\"b404-7\">It appeared that the release was a discharge of all demands, contained in a general assignment of <em>Cox\u2019s </em>effects for the benefit of his creditors mentioned in the preceding case ; and that the plaintiff, on becoming party to the assignment, qualified his assent thus <em>: </em>\u2014 \u201c JV. <em>F.
