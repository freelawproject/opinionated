The only claim was that the sentence imposed was cruel and unusual punishment. Two and one-half years to five years with credit for time served was imposed on this defendant after he pled guilty to assault in the second degree with intent to commit sodomy in satisfaction of an eight count indictment. That sentence was fair and proper. Beldoek, P. J., Ughetta, Christ, Rabin and Benjamin, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
