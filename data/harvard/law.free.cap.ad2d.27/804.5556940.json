Appeal from order entered on March 24,1966, denying reargument dismissed. The complaint in this action for damages and injunction, brought by plaintiff \u201c individually and on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated consumers of milk in the City of New York,\u201d charges an unlawful conspiracy by appellant and other milk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>companies pursuant to which the price of milk to consumers in New York City was fixed by wrongful means at a specified minimum price. Authorities such as <em>Society Milion Athena </em>v. <em>National Bank of Greece </em>(281 N. Y. 282, 292), <em>Gaynor </em>v. <em>Rockefeller </em>(15 N Y 2d 120, 129), and <em>Onofrio </em>v. <em>Playboy Club of N. Y. </em>(20 A D 2d 3, revd. on dissenting opinion, 15 N Y 2d 740) indicate that on this record a class action is not maintainable. The basis of plaintiff\u2019s individual cause is not clearly alleged, and it is observed that the affidavits submitted in opposition to the motion do not include one by himself. Settle order on notice. Concur\u2014Botein, P. J., Stevens, Rabin and Bastow, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
