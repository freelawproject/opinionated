The board\u2019s findings were predicated largely upon proof of certain sales contracts prepared by claimant himself, showing sales on commission during the period for which he certified total unemployment. Certainly the board was entitled to credit this evidence and to deny credence, as it expressly did, to claimant\u2019s statement that he predated all the contracts. Decision affirmed, without costs. Gibson, P. J., Herlihy, Reynolds, Aulisi and Staley, Jr., JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
