Co. </em>v. <em>Commrs. of Clinton County, </em>1 Ohio St. 77; <em>State, ex rel. Allison, </em>v. <em>Garver, </em>66 Ohio St. 555; <em>Strain </em>v. <em>Southerton, </em>148 Ohio St. 153; 10 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d 385 and 392, Sections 308, 314; 16 American Jurisprudence 2d 491, Section 240; annotation, 76 A. L. R. 1053.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Appellant argues that Articles II and X of the Ohio Constitution clearly demonstrate that the grant of a referendum power to the electorate in a township on zoning matters is an impermissible delegation of legislative power to the people by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">It is true that the legislative power vested in the General Assembly by Section 1 of Article II is not plenary. Section la of Article II specifically reserves the power of initiative to the people of the state with respect to state laws; Section lc of Article II specifically reserves the power of referendum to the people of the state with respect'to state laws; and Section If of Article II specifically reserves the powers of initiative and referendum to the people of each municipality on municipal laws. Furthermore, nowhere in Article II is there provision for the reservation of the powers of initiative and referendum to the people of townships on township laws. Nor is there such a provision in Article X, which controls township organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">However, this does not mean, as appellant would have us construe it to mean, that provision for initiative and referendum by the people of each township cannot be created by statute. It merely demonstrates that the rights of the people in the several townships, as to the powers of initiative and referendum, have not been accorded the status of a constitutional prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">This court long ago recognized that townships are merely agencies of the state in a system of state government. <em>State, ex rel. Bates, </em>v. <em>Trustees of Richland Twp., Vinton County, </em>20 Ohio St. 362, 371; <em>State, ex rel. Godfrey, </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>95 Ohio St. 166. And that, as to matters of purely local concern, a delegation of legislative power by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>the General Assembly to township trustees is entirely permissible. <em>Grover Hill </em>v. <em>McClure, </em>6 <em>C. C. </em>(N. S.) 197, 17 C. D. 376, affirmed, 72 Ohio St. 676; <em>Tuber </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>6 Ohio St. 2d 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">However, appellant is not challenging directly the power of the General Assembly to allow township trustees to adopt zoning resolutions, but instead the power of the General Assembly to allow the people of a township, by the power of referendum, to reject what the township trustees have adopted. Appellant\u2019s reliance on specific reservations of the powers of initiative and referendum in the Ohio Constitution to the people of the state on state laws, and to the people of each municipality on municipal laws, to establish its proposition, is not well founded. Nowhere does the Ohio Constitution provide for the delegation of legislative power to political subdivisions such as townships, and were we to carry appellant\u2019s argument to its logical conclusion we would find that no power to legislate as to purely local matters could ever be conferred on townships by the General Assembly \u2014 there being no specific constitutional provision permitting the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The fact is that the Ohio Constitution is silent not only as to a reservation of the powers of initiative and referendum to the people of the several townships but also as to any grant of authority to township trustees to legislate. Yet this court has already recognized the validity of a statutory grant of authority by the General Assembly to township trustees to legislate as to matters of purely local concern, such as zoning. <em>Grover Hill </em>v. <em>McClure, supra </em>(6 C. C. [N. S.], 197); <em>Tuber </em>v. <em>Perkins, supra </em>(6 Ohio St. 2d 155).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">What the General Assembly has done in Section 519.12, Revised Code, is to provide the people of the several townships with a power to veto, by use of the device of referendum, zoning resolutions passed by township trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">We find no constitutional impediment to a grant of legislative power by the General Assembly to township trustees to mal?e zoning resolutions, nor for the General As<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>sembly to reserve the power of referendum to the people who will be affected by such resolutions. Therefore, Section 519.12, Revised Code, insofar as it accomplishes these purposes of the General Assembly, is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">By finding no constitutional infirmity in the township referendum provision of Section 519.12, Revised Code, we are constrained to affirm the Court of Appeals disposition of this case unless, as appellant argues, the case should be remanded to the Court of Appeals for a determination whether the referendum is unconstitutional as applied to appellant\u2019s land.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">It is clear that the only effect of the referendum is to restore the zoning situation in Austintown Township to that which existed at the time appellant made application for a change in early 1966. The referendum does not take away any zoning rights acquired by appellant by the action of the township trustees, since the General Assembly, through Section 519.12, Revised Code, has expressly provided that any such rights cannot be obtained without the acquiescence of those voters living in the community affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The petition filed by appellant in this case seeks to have the 1966 zoning amendment declared unconstitutional and void. Since that amendment was nullified by the referendum, relief from any operative effect it might have had has already been afforded appellant by the people of Austintown Township. The petition does not attack the constitutionality of the 1948 ordinance, as amended in 1959, and the only other relief sought by appellant in its petition is an order to the zoning inspector to issue permits so that appellant might construct apartment dwellings on its property. Nowhere in the petition is it alleged that such permits were sought and denied. Therefore, it appears that appellant has not exhausted its administrative remedies and no showing can possibly be made that an adequate remedy at law is not available. See <em>State, ex rel. Foreman, </em>v. <em>City Council of Bellefontaine, </em>1 Ohio St. 2d 132; <em>State, ex rel. Sibarco Corp., </em>v. <em>Berea, </em>7 Ohio St. 2d 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b218-5\">Tart, C.

I would concur in the syllabus on the ground that the exercise of the power to zone by a board of township trustees under Chapter 519, Revised Code, is not the exercise of purely <em>legislative </em>power but, at best, are quasi-legislative, quasi-judicial and quasi-executive powers, <em>i. e., administrative </em>power, and, therefore, the General Assembly is not inhibited from attaching a referendum procedure as a concomitant thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">However, I dissent from the judgment. I am unable to agree, as a matter of law upon this record, that the entire township, which contains an electorate of at least 7,000 persons, is \u201caffected\u201d by the act of the Board of Township Trustees as to the property involved here. The proposition of law stated by the syllabus is that the referendum may extend to \u201cthat portion of a township electorate to be most affected\u201d by the zoning amendment. Therefore, the cause should be remanded for a determination of that fact. If the referendum provided by the General Assembly is more extensive than is reasonably necessary to protect interests substantially and materially affected by the amendment, the referendum should be held invalid as impinging upon the interests of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
