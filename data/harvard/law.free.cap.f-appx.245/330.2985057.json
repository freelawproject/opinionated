We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-28\">\n<em>I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b352-29\">On February 11, 1987, the Lewises\u2019 executed two farm loans with FSA, formerly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>the Farmers Home Administration, for their catfish operation. Loan 44-05, due January 1, 1988, had a face value of $101,000.00 bearing 7.5 % interest. Neither party contests that all applicable statutes of limitations have run on Loan 44-05. Loan 44-06, due in sixteen annual installments of $6,760.00, had a face value of $72,591.38 bearing 4.5 <em>% </em>interest. Loan 44-06 contained an optional acceleration clause, which stated that \u201cthe government at its option may declare all or any part of any such indebtedness immediately due and payable.\u201d The Lewises missed the first two payments for Loan 44-06, due on January 1, 1988, and January 1, 1989. In response, on June 14, 1989, the FSA sent an Attachment 9 notice under 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1951.907(f)(3), entitled \u201cNotification of Intent to Accelerate or Continue Acceleration of Loans and Notice of Your Rights\u201d (the \u201cNotice\u201d). The Notice advised them of the amount overdue, $87,267.45, and right to apply for loan service programs. The Notice also stated that FSA sent the Lewises a copy of an Attachment 1 notice on November 11,1988, which notified them of the overdue debt and provided information about farm loan programs. In 1994, FSA received $1,835.00 from the income tax refund of Shelia Lewis pursuant to the administrative offset allowed in \u00a7 1951.121-124. In October 2003, the FSA Mississippi State Settlement Review Committee reviewed Loan 44-06 and recommended to classify the loan as \u201ccurrently not collectible.\u201d The Settlement Review Committee then certified the loans to the Treasury Department for offset pursuant to 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3711 and 3716 because an investigation revealed no assets available to satisfy a judgment lien. On April 22, 2004, the Treasury Department transferred the Lewises\u2019 delinquent account to a private collection agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The Lewises\u2019 filed suit seeking to enjoin the FSA from collecting on the two farm loans. They also sought a declaratory judgment that the statutes of limitations had run for regular collection and administrative offset. FSA conceded that the statutes of limitations had run on Loan 44-OS and both parties moved for summary judgment on the remaining issues. The district court granted in part and denied in part the Lewises\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granted FSA\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court reasoned that the six year statute of limitations under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415(a) prevented collection on the installments due from January 1, 1988, to January 1, 2000; and the ten year statute of limitations under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3716(e) prevented collection on the installments due from January 1, 1988, to January 1, 1996. FSA could still collect payment, however, on all installments due after these dates. Accordingly, the district court enjoined FSA from attempting to collect on the time-barred installments. The Lewises timely appealed the district court\u2019s judgment, arguing that the statutes of limitations for Loan 44-06 began to run against the entire debt at the time of their default on the first scheduled payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\n<em>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same legal standards as the district court. <em>Machinchick v. P.B. Power, Inc., </em>398 F.3d 345, 350 (5th Cir.2005). In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court must determine whether the submissions show that no genuine issue exists as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Hart v. Hairston, </em>343 F.3d 762, 764 (5th Cir.2003). In deciding whether a fact issue has been created, the facts and inferences must be reviewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Reaves Brokerage Co. v. Sunbelt </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number><em>Fruit &amp; Vegetable Co., </em>336 F.3d 410, 412 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\n<em>III. DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">If a borrower defaults on his farm loan, the FSA implements a collection process set forth in 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1951.907(a)-(h). These regulations determine the type of notice sent to the borrower based on the status of the loan. In this case, the FSA determined that \u00a7 1951.907(f) applied because the Lewises\u2019 payments were more than 180 days delinquent and not yet accelerated by the agency. The Lewises do not dispute this assertion. Attachments 1 and 2 notices inform borrowers of an outstanding debt and about loan service programs. To apply for the loan service programs, the borrower must complete an application within forty-five days after receipt of Attachments 1 and 2 notices. If the borrower fails to respond in a timely manner or submits an incomplete form, and the FSA has not accelerated the account, then the agency sends an Attachment 9 notice pursuant to \u00a7 1951.907(h)(2). An Attachment 9 notice includes the amount of the borrower\u2019s debt and provides options to avoid loan acceleration. An Attachment 9 notice also states that FSA will accelerate the borrower\u2019s farm loans but does not indicate acceleration and makes no demands for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The collection of farm loans are subject to two statutes of limitations: 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415 and 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3716. Section 2415 reads that actions for money damages brought by the United States \u201cshall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of the action accrues.... The provisions of this section shall not prevent the United States or an officer or agency thereof from collecting any claim of the United States by means of administrative offset, in accordance with section 3716 of Title 31.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415(a) <em>&amp; </em>(i). Section 3716 prevents the administrative offset of \u201ca claim under this subchapter that has been outstanding for more than 10 years.... \u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3716(e)(1). The applicable regulations define \u201coutstanding\u201d under this subchapter the same as \u201caccrue\u201d under \u00a7 2415(a). 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 901.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">The Lewises argue that their default on the first installment triggered the limitations period under \u00a7 2415(a). We address the issues of whether the statutes run on each installment as payment becomes due or on the entire debt amount after default on one installment. We also determine whether FSA\u2019s actions and conduct amount to acceleration of Loan 44-06 even though FSA never sent notice of acceleration.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">The Fifth Circuit has not ruled on these issues in the context of installment government loans when the debtor never made any payments. <em>See United States v. Bloom, </em>112 F.3d 200, 204-05 (1997). The Lewises cite <em>SMS Fin., LLC v. ABCO Homes, Inc., </em>167 F.3d 235 (5th Cir.1999), and <em>FDIC v. Belli </em>981 F.2d 838 (5th Cir.1993), for the proposition that their default on the first scheduled payment, January 1, 1988, triggered the statute of limitations as to the entire debt amount. <em>SMS </em>and <em>Belli </em>are distinguishable from the instant case. In <em>SMS, </em>the parties agreed that the statute of limitations ran against the entire debt on the maturation date. The case primarily dealt with whether the plaintiff received the benefit of a tolling provision under \u00a7 2415(a). 167 F.3d at 242. In <em>Belli </em>a bank demanded full payment under two guarantees and a promissory note. 981 F.2d at 839. The following year, the FDIC was appointed receiver of the Bank, and in its corporate capacity, the FDIC purchased the notes and continuing guarantees. <em>Id. </em>The FDIC filed suit more than six years later, seeking to recover the out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>standing balance on the promissory note, as well as the amount due on the continuing guarantees. <em>Id. </em>The court held that the FDIC\u2019s claims were time barred, reasoning that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">Neither the FDIC nor the opinions on which it relies point to authority for the proposition that a transfer from one party to another of a cause of action that has already accrued somehow effects a new accrual for purposes of \u00a7 2415(a). To the contrary, the ordinary usage of the term \u201caccrues\u201d is that a cause of action \u201caccrues\u201d when \u201cit comes into existence.\u201d Assignment of a cause of action that has already accrued does not ordinarily re-commence the limitations period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 840. In this case, the district court relied upon the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Dos Cabezas Corp., </em>995 F.2d 1486 (9th Cir.1993). The <em>Dos Cabezas </em>court concluded that a creditor may not hold a debtor liable on future installments when the contract contains an optional acceleration clause. Therefore, \u201cunless the creditor exercises the option, the statute of limitations applies to each installment separately, and does not begin to run on any installment until it is due.\u201d <em>Dos Cabezas Corp., </em>995 F.2d at 1490 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The Lewises argue that <em>Dos Cabezas </em>runs afoul of Fifth Circuit precedent. We read <em>Dos Cabezas </em>and <em>Betti </em>as pronouncing consistent statements of law. The FSA did not receive this debt from a third party after acceleration. Here, the debt arose from a contractual loan agreement between the Lewises and the FSA, and the FSA never accelerated Loan 44-06 pursuant to the governing regulations. This reasoning comports with the interpretation of \u00a7 2415(a) from other Circuits in the context of federal installment contracts. <em>See, e.g., Elephant Butte Irr. Dist. of N.M. v. Dep\u2019t of Interior, </em>160 F.3d 602 (10th Cir.1998); <em>Bd. of Trs. of Dist. No. 15 Machinists\u2019 Pension Fund v. Kahle Eng\u2019g Corp., </em>43 F.3d 852 (3rd Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Feterl, </em>849 F.2d 354, 356 (8th Cir.1988); <em>Trs. for Alaska Laborers-Construction Inds. Health and Sec. Fund v. Ferrell, </em>812 F.2d 512 (9th Cir.1987); <em>United States v. Alessi, </em>599 F.2d 513, 515 (2d Cir.1979). Accordingly, we hold that the statutes of limitations in \u00a7 2415(a) and \u00a7 3716(e)(1) run from the due date of each installment.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Alternatively, the Lewises argue that the Notice dated June 13, 1989, demonstrates acceleration of Loan 44-06, and thus, it triggered the statutes of limitations as to the entire debt amount on both loans. The Notice informed the Lewises that they were $87,267.45 in arrears on the two government loans. This calculation includes the entire amount of Loan 44-05 and the two delinquent installments of Loan 44-06. The Notice sent to the Lewises indicates that FSA will accelerate the loan unless the borrower pays his outstanding loan amount, lists servicing options, provides steps to be taken to avoid acceleration, and gives information about what will happen if the borrower does not respond to the notice. The form reads that \u201cif you do not respond to this notice ... FmHA will accelerate or continue acceleration of any loans.... \u201d The requisite acceleration notice under 1955(d)(2), on the other hand, contains unequivocal language stating \u201cNotice of Acceleration of Your Debt to the Farmers Home Administration and Demand for Payment of that Debt.\u201d The plain language of the regulations directing the sequence of collection notices, and the FSA\u2019s compliance with the regulations, do not indicate that the agency accelerated Loan 44-06 at any point in time. Therefore, the ten-year statute of limitations for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>administrative offsets applied to the installments as they became due.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Loan 44-06 required the Lewises to pay annual installments over a period of sixteen years. The six-year statute of limitations for money damages, pursuant to \u00a7 2415(a), has run for installments due between January 1, 1988, and January 1, 2000. The ten-year statute of limitations for administrative offsets, pursuant to \u00a7 3716(e), has run for installments due between January 1, 1988, and January 1, 1996. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
