Plaintiff asserted that the defendants\u2019 rap song \u201cIn Da Club\u201d infringes on its copyright for its rap song \u201cIts Your Birthday.\u201d The district court granted summary judgment for defendants, holding that plaintiff was unable to establish that the \u201cIn Da club\u201d song is substantially similar to original, copyrightable aspects of \u201cIts Your Birthday.\u201d Based upon the well-reasoned and comprehensive opinion of the district court, which we attach hereto, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-17\">Attachment</p>\n<p id=\"b896-18\">UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT FLORIDA</p>\n<p id=\"b896-19\">CASE NO.: 06-20079-CIV-HUCK/SIMONTON</p>\n<p id=\"b896-20\">LIL\u2019 JOE WEIN MUSIC, INC., a Florida Corporation, Plaintiff, vs. CURTIS JAMES JACKSON, p/k/a/ 50 CENT, SHADY RECORDS, INC., a New York Corporation, INTERSTATE RECORDS, INC., a Delaware Corporation, UNIVERSAL MUSIC &amp; VIDEO DISTRIBUTION CORP., a California Corporation, Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-23\">PAUL C. HUCK, United States District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-24\">\n<em>ORDER GRANTING FINAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b896-25\">THIS MATTER is before the Court upon Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment [D.E. # 43], filed on September 6, 2006. Plaintiff, Lil\u2019 Joe Wein Music, Inc. (\u201cLil\u2019 Joe Wein\u201d), has brought an action pursuant to 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101, <em>et. seq., </em>asserting that the Defendants \u201cjointly and severally, participated in the reproduction of the infringing works ... prepared derivative works ... and distributed copies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>or phonorecords of the copyrighted works by sale or other transfer of ownership.\u201d Compl. 1119. Specifically, Lil\u2019 Joe Wein claims that Defendants\u2019 rap song \u201cIn Da Club\u201d infringes on Lil\u2019 Joe Wein\u2019s copyright for its rap song \u201cIts Your Birthday.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Lil\u2019 Joe Wein is unable to establish that the \u201cIn Da Club\u201d is substantially similar to original, copyrightable aspects of \u201cIts Your Birthday,\u201d Defendants are entitled to final summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Luther Campbell (\u201cCampbell\u201d), professionally known as Luke,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is the credited author of the song \u201cIts Your Birthday.\u201d Campbell Decl. \u00b6 4. The lyrics to \u201cIts Your Birthday\u201d include the phrase \u201cGo _, it\u2019s your birthday\u201d repeated with various proper names used in succession. Although there is some confusion as to the exact date of the song\u2019s creation, it appears that Campbell wrote it in March or April of 1994. <em>See </em>Weinberger Dep. at 80:23-90:14. The song was first released on July 7, 1994 on the Luke record, <em>Freak for Life. See </em>Def.\u2019s Ex. 19, Report of Judith Finell, at 1. \u201cIts Your Birthday\u201d later appeared on several albums released by Campbell\u2019s record company, Luke Records, which have sold in excess of 1,500,000 copies. Weinberger Decl. \u00b6 20. Campbell has stated that the phrase, \u201c \u2018Go_, it\u2019s your birthday\u2019 was a chant that was used and heard in the clubs and on radio prior to the creation of the song [sic] \u201cIt\u2019s Your Birthday.\u201d Campbell Decl. \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-18\">Lil\u2019 Joe Wein is a Florida corporation engaged in the music publishing business. Compl. \u00b6 2. Lil\u2019 Joe Wein acquired the copyrights at issue in this case at a bankruptcy sale arising from the insolvency of Campbell, Luke Records, and Jamdat Publishing, an entity owned by Campbell. Lil\u2019 Joe Wein then became the registered owner of musical composition copyrights for the song \u201cIts Your Birthday\u201d under the United States Copyright Office, Copyright PA 877-745 issued August 4, 1997 (\u201c745 Copyright\u201d). <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 14. In addition, Lil\u2019 Joe Wein is the registered owner of musical composition copyrights for the song \u201cIts Your Birthday (Bonus Remix)\u201d under the United States Copyright Office, Copyright PA 1-072-403 issued March 10, 2000 (\u201c403 Copyright\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-19\">Defendant, Curtis Jackson, p/k/a 50 Cent (\u201cJackson\u201d or \u201c50 Cent\u201d), is a recording artist who resides in Connecticut. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 3. Defendants, Shady Records (\u201cShady\u201d), Interscope Records, Inc. (\u201cInterscope\u201d), and Universal Music &amp; Video Distribution Corp. (\u201cUniversal\u201d), are companies involved in the record production and distribution business. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4-7. 50 Cent is the author of the song \u201cIn Da Club,\u201d which appears on the album <em>Get Rich or Die Try in\u2019, </em>which was released on February 6, 2003. Jackson Decl. \u00b6 3. That song opens with the lyrics:</p>\n<p id=\"b897-20\">Go, go, go, go</p>\n<p id=\"b897-21\">Go, go, go shawty</p>\n<p id=\"b897-22\">It\u2019s your birthday</p>\n<p id=\"b897-23\">We gon\u2019 party like it\u2019s yo birthday</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>We gon\u2019 sip Bacardi like it\u2019s your birthday And you know we don\u2019t give a f\u2014 It\u2019s not your birthday. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">50 Cent avers that certain of those lyrics are his original creation, while others are \u201cphrases [he had] heard at hip hop nightclubs, street parties and other hip hop events for many years prior to 1994.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 6. Indeed, Defendants set forth numerous instances pre-dating the creation of \u201cIts Your.Birthday\u201d where similar expressions of \u201cGo _, it\u2019s your birthday\u201d were used.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">Lil\u2019 Joe Wein has initiated this litigation pursuant to 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 <em>et seq., </em>claiming that the words and rhythms of \u201cIn Da Club\u201d infringe upon Lil\u2019 Joe Wein\u2019s copyright to \u201cIts Your Birthday.\u201d In their Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants argue that Lil\u2019 Joe Wein\u2019s claim for copyright infringement must fail because (1) the phrases at issue are not original to Lil\u2019 Joe Wein\u2019s songs, (2) the phrases at issue are not copyrightable, and (3) Lil\u2019 Joe Wein\u2019s and Defendants\u2019 works are not substantially similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Aib\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, and affidavits show that there is no genuine issue of material fact, and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(C); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). An issue of fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d if it is a legal element of the claim under applicable substantive law which might affect the outcome of the case. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 </em>U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>Allen v. Tyson Foods, </em>121 F.3d 642, 646 (11th Cir.1997). An issue of fact is \u201cgenuine\u201d if the record taken as a whole could lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party. <em>Allen, </em>121 F.3d at 646. On a motion for summary judgment, the Court must view all the evidence and all factual inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and determine whether that evidence could reasonably sustain a jury verdict. <em>Celotex, 477 </em>U.S. at 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548; <em>Allen, </em>121 F.3d at 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">While the burden on the movant is great, the opposing party has a duty to present affirmative evidence in order to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment. <em>Anderson, 477 </em>U.S. at 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505. A mere \u201cscintilla\u201d of evidence in favor of the non-moving party, or evidence that is merely colorable or not significantly probative is not enough. <em>Id.; see also Mayfield v. Patterson Pump Co., </em>101 F.3d 1371, 1376 (11th Cir.1996) (conclusory allegations and conjecture cannot be the basis for denying summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">Under these standards, courts have \u201cregularly granted summary judgment in copyright cases where it is clear that the plaintiff cannot make out the elements of the claim\u201d of copyright infringement. <em>Siskind v. Newton-John, </em>1987 WL 11701 at *4 (S.D.N.Y. May 22, 1987). In approving of the use of summary judgment in copyright cases, the Second Circuit has noted that the remedy \u201csignal[s] an important development in the law of copyright, permitting courts to put \u2018a swift end to merit-less litigation\u2019 and to avoid lengthy and costly trials.\u201d <em>Hoehling v. Universal City Studios, Inc., </em>618 F.2d 972, 977 (2d Cir.1980)</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">B. Standard for Establishing Copyright Infringement</p>\n<p id=\"b898-15\">Lil\u2019 Joe Wein must prove two elements in order to establish its <em>prima facie </em>claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>for copyright infringement: (1) that it owns a valid copyright in \u201cIts Your Birthday,\u201d and (2) that Defendants copied constituent elements of the copyrighted work that are original. <em>Calhoun v. Lillenas Publ\u2019g, </em>298 F.3d 1228, 1232 (11th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Feist Publ\u2019ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., </em>499 U.S. 340, 361, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991)). If Lil\u2019 Joe Wein does not have direct proof of copying, it must establish that Defendants had access to \u201cIts Your Birthday,\u201d and that \u201cIn Da Club\u201d is so substantially similar to \u201cIts Your Birthday\u201d that \u201can average lay observer would recognize the alleged copy as having been appropriated from the original work.\u201d <em>Original Appalachian Artworks, Inc. v. Toy Loft, </em>684 F.2d 821, 829 (11th Cir.1982). Lil\u2019 Joe Wein has shown that it has a valid copyright in \u201cIts Your Birthday.\u201d However, it has submitted no evidence of direct copying. Defendants do not dispute that they had access to the immensely popular song. Therefore, the determinative issue before the Court is whether the two works are substantially similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">C. Substantial Similarity</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">In order to establish substantial similarity, Lil\u2019 Joe Wein must satisfy a two-pronged test: (l)an extrinsic, objective test, and (2) an intrinsic, subjective test. <em>Herzog v. Castle Rock Entm\u2019t, </em>193 F.3d 1241, 1257 (11th Cir.1999) (citing <em>Beal v. Paramount Pictures, </em>806 F.Supp. 963, 967 (N.D.Ga.1992), <em>aff'd, </em>20 F.3d 454 (11th Cir.1994)). \u201cUnder the extrinsic test, a court will inquire into whether, as an objective matter, the works are substantially similar in protected expression.\u201d As a part of this test, the Court will determine whether Lil\u2019 Joe Wein seeks to protect only uncopyrightable elements; if so, the court will grant summary judgment for defendant. <em>Id. </em>Under the extrinsic test, expert testimony is appropriate. <em>Id. </em>Under the intrinsic test, a court will determine whether, upon proper instruction, a reasonable jury would find that the works are substantially similar. <em>Beal, </em>806 F.Supp. at 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">Copyright protection \u201cmay extend only to those components of a work that are original to the author.\u201d <em>Feist, </em>499 U.S. at 361, 111 S.Ct. 1282. Although \u201cIts Your Birthday\u201d is entitled to copyright protection as a work, not every element is protectible <em>per se. Rogers v. Koons, </em>960 F.2d 301, 307 (2d Cir.1992). \u201c[Cjopyright does not prevent subsequent users from copying from a prior author\u2019s work those constituent elements that are not original ... as long as such use does not unfairly appropriate the author\u2019s original contributions.\u201d <em>Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enter., </em>471 U.S. 539, 547-48, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985). The question of substantial similarity can be decided as a matter of law on a motion for summary judgment either where the \u201csimilarity concerns only noncopyrightable elements of a plaintiffs work, or when no reasonable trier of fact could find the works substantially similar.\u201d <em>Lassin v. Island Def Jam Music, </em>No. 04-22320-CIV at 6, 2005 WL 5632056 (S.D.Fla. Aug. 8, 2005) (quoting <em>Walker v. Time Life Films, Inc., </em>784 F.2d 44, 48 (2d Cir.1986)). \u201c[W]here we compare [works] that contain both protectible and unprotectible elements, our inspection must be \u2018more discerning\u2019; we must attempt to extract the unprotectible elements from our consideration and ask whether the <em>protectible elements, standing alone, </em>are substantially similar.\u201d <em>Knitwaves, Inc. v. Lollytogs Ltd., </em>71 F.3d 996, 1002 (2d Cir.1995) (emphasis in original, citations omitted). \u201cThe copied elements of a work must be original and nontrivial to constitute improper appropriation.\u201d <em>Jean v. Bug Music, </em>2002 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>WL 287786 at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 27, 2002). \u201cOriginal, as the term is used in copyright, means only that the work was independently created by the author (as opposed to copied from other works), and that it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity.\u201d <em>Feist, </em>499 U.S. at 345, 111 S.Ct. 1282.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">\u201cA signature and long-standing feature of live performance rap music is the hip hop chant. The chant is a form of audience engagement staged by the performer (me, dj or rapper) who provides a familiar phrase or saying, often in call and response format, designed to energize, include, affirm and engage the audience.\u201d Report of Trida Rose at 2. Both Campbell and Jackson state that they had heard the disputed phrase of \u201cGo _, its your birthday\u201d and that it was a common hip-hop chant. Numerous postings on USENET,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> pre-dating the release of \u201cIts Your Birthday,\u201d include several uses of the phrase \u201cGo [name], it\u2019s your birthday.\u201d Likewise, Defendants make reference to many additional songs and books, dated after \u201cIts Your Birthday\u201d but before \u201cIn Da Club,\u201d that use variations of the \u201cbirthday\u201d phrase without license from Lil\u2019 Joe Wein.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">The Defendants also set forth several specific examples of the use of the phrase before the creation of \u201cIts Your Birthday.\u201d First, the Defendants cite the 1993 film <em>Who\u2019s the Man?, </em>starring Dr. Dre and Ed Lover (\u201cLover\u201d), two notable MTV personalities at the time. <em>See </em>Def. Ex. 20. Ed Lover, who plays an inept barber in the movie, gives a customer a particularly awful haircut. In an effort to assuage the distressed customer, Lover compares him to the famous actor Wesley Snipes. Lover then raps, \u201cGo Wesley, go Wesley, go go go Wesley, it\u2019s your birthday.\u201d Lover states that the line \u201cwas improvised during the filming and was based on a chant commonly heard at the time in nightclubs and on the radio.\u201d Lover Decl. \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-13\">Second, Defendants make reference to the song \u201cThe Birthday Jam\u201d by the Miami Bass DJ\u2019s. The song, released on June 14,1994, contains the lyrics, \u201cGo granddad, Its your birthday. Go granddad, Its your birthday ... Go grandma, Its your birthday. Go grandma, Its your birthday.\u201d <em>See </em>Ph\u2019s Ex. 1. Defendants concede that they do not know whether the song was created before or after \u201cIts Your Birthday\u201d was created. However, because \u201cThe Birthday Jam\u201d was released publicly before \u201cIts Your Birthday,\u201d it appears to have been independently created.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-14\">Finally, in a supplemental filing, Defendants set forth a song published on March 1, 1993: \u201cBounce (Its Your Birthday),\u201d by the Incredible Crew. The song contains the lyrics \u201cgo, go, go, go,\u201d and \u201cGo [name], and \u201cit\u2019s your birthday.\u201d Defendants assert that the song incorporates lyrics and rhythms that are identical to \u201cIts Your Birthday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b900-15\">Lil\u2019 Joe Wein disputes the relevance of this evidence. With respect to <em>Who\u2019s the Man?, </em>Lil\u2019 Joe Wein contends: (1) that the Defendants fail to describe how the line is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>spoken in terms of rhythms, melodies and rhythmatic placement and the nature of its similarity to the songs at issue in this case; (2) that the lyrics are hardly discernable to the ordinary listener without specialized listening equipment; and (3) that there was an issue of contested fact as to whether the film was in circulation or distribution such that it could be considered the source or inspiration for \u201cIts Your Birthday.\u201d The Court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Lil\u2019 Joe Wein\u2019s own expert, Judith Finell (\u201cFinell\u201d), states that every element of similarity that exists between \u201cIn Da Club\u201d and \u201cIts Your Birthday\u201d is present in <em>Who\u2019s the Man?. </em>Finell reached a similar conclusion with respect to \u201cThe Birthday Jam,\u201d finding the only difference to be the use of different proper names. The Court, without the assistance of any specialized listening equipment, viewed the segment of Who\u2019s the Man? and had no difficulty discerning the lyrics. Moreover, Lover\u2019s declaration only serves to confirm the lyrical content. Finally, the Court takes judicial notice, on the basis of several newspaper articles discussing the film, that Who\u2019s the Man? received wide commercial distribution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By arguing that the film could not have served as the source or inspiration of \u201cIts Your Birthday,\u201d Lil\u2019 Joe Wein misses the point. Defendants do not contend that Lil\u2019 Joe Wein infringed on another\u2019s copyright, but simply that the phrase at issue was a common hip-hop chant at the time. Its presence in Who\u2019s the Man? serves to bolster that notion.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">Lil\u2019 Joe Wein offers no evidence to suggest that \u201cGo_, its your birthday\u201d was original to \u201cIts Your Birthday.\u201d Of particular note is the fact that the author of the work, Campbell, himself admits that he did not create the phrase, but borrowed it from popular chants at the time. Lil\u2019 Joe Wein thus fails to meet <em>Feist\u2019s </em>essential requirement that an element be \u201cindependently created.\u201d Lil\u2019 Joe Wein argues that even if those lyrics were not original, the lyrics in combination with the rhythms, beats, and melodies are in fact original. This argument is belied by the testimony of Lil\u2019 Joe Wein\u2019s own expert, Judith Finell. Although she does recognize similarities between \u201cIts Your Birthday\u201d and \u201cIn Da Club,\u201d she saw those same similarities in <em>Who\u2019s the Man? </em>and \u201cThe Birthday Jam.\u201d Lil\u2019 Joe Wein did not submit any evidence refuting Defendants\u2019 argument that \u201cBounce (It\u2019s Your Birthday)\u201d incorporates those exact same similarities. Furthermore, Finell failed to express any opinion as to the originality of Lil\u2019 Joe Wein\u2019s use of the contested phrase. Accordingly, because the \u201cbirthday\u201d phrase was a common, unoriginal, and noncopyrightable element of the song, it is not entitled to copyright protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-14\">Other courts dealing with common phrases or chants have reached similar conclusions. <em>See, e.g., Jean, </em>at *5-6 (finding that the a sequence of three notes and lyrics lacked requisite originality); <em>Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. v. Jostens, Inc., </em>155 F.3d 140, 144 (2d Cir.1998) (finding that a prior-used phrase was not deserving of copyright protection); <em>Boone v. Jackson, </em>2005 WL 1560511 at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 1, 2005). As in those cases, Defendants here have shown that the disputed phrase is unprotectible because it uses a common musical and lyrical phrase that has been use in other prior works. Lil\u2019 Joe Wein points to <em>Positive Black Talk Inc. v. Cash Money Records, </em>2003 WL 1921999 (E.D.La. April 21, 2003), which refused to grant summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>judgment based upon defendant\u2019s claims that the phrase at issue was a common hip-hop chant. There, however, the plaintiff actually asserted that he was the creator of the common chant. Here, to the contrary, the author of the phrase in question concedes that he borrowed it from his experiences at hip-hop events and nightclubs. Because Lil\u2019 Joe Wein\u2019s action seeks only to protect unprotectible material, it fails the extrinsic test.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">To the extent the Defendants even conceded that it did copy the \u201cbirthday\u201d phrase portion of the song, Lil\u2019 Joe Wein still fails the intrinsic test. Outside of that limited \u201cbirthday phrase,\u201d there are virtually no similarities between the contested works.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, Lil\u2019 Joe Wein does not allege that any aspect of \u201cIn Da Club\u201d infringes upon \u201cIts Your Birthday\u201d other than the initial \u201cbirthday\u201d section. Once those non-protectible elements are removed, no similarities remain. Moreover, the disputed phrase, although prominently placed at the beginning of \u201cIn Da Club,\u201d represents only approximately eleven seconds of a three-minute, thirteen-second song. <em>See, Jean, </em>at *5 (finding that in making a determination of whether the copying is so trivial as to be considered <em>de minimis, </em>the Court should consider the amount of the copyrighted work that was copied). It is, therefore, the finding of the Court that Lil\u2019 Joe Wein fails the intrinsic test as well because the \u201caverage lay observer\u201d would not confuse the two works. No reasonable jury, properly instructed, could conclude that Lil\u2019 Joe Wein\u2019s and the Defendants\u2019 compositions are substantially similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">For all of the foregoing reasons, having considered the parties\u2019 submissions and being duly advised in the premises, Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">GRANTED and the complaint is DISMISSED. All pending motions are hereby DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers, Miami, Florida, this October 27, 2006.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-12\">. Lil\u2019 Joe Wein\u2019s complaint also alleged that Defendants' DVD, \"50 Cent: The New Breed,\u201d improperly used Lil\u2019 Joe Wein\u2019s copyrighted work, \"I Like It, I Love It.\u201d Those claims have been previously dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b897-15\">.

There is no substantive difference between the different versions for the purposes of this litigation. Likewise, unless otherwise specified, discussion of \"Its Your Birthday\u201d or \u201cIn Da Club\u201d refer to all versions of the songs, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b900-9\">. USENET is an online forum for \"users to discuss, read about, or post messages on a particular topic,\u201d <em>Ellison v.

Lil' Joe Wein contends that \"The Birthday Jam\u201d fails to prove that \"Its Your Birthday\u201d is not original because the creator of the former was a party to an exclusive song writing agreement with Luke Records at the time he allegedly created it. Lil\u2019 Joe Wein argues that it owns the rights to \"The Birthday Jam,\u201d therefore. This argument is inapposite with respect to whether the phrase at issue is original in \"Its Your Birthday.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b901-9\">. <em>See, e.g., </em>Roger Ebert, <em>Yo!
