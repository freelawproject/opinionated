Because Moreno was convicted in Texas in 1987 of burglary of a habitation and again in 1988 of three counts of burglary of a habitation, the probation officer determined that Moreno was an armed career criminal within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(a) (2003). Because Moreno used or possessed a gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>in connection with a controlled substance offense, Moreno\u2019s total offense level was determined under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) (2003). The district court sentenced Moreno at the top of the guidelines imprisonment range to concurrent 235-month terms of imprisonment. Moreno appealed his sentence and this court remanded for resentencing in accordance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>183 Fed.Appx. 437, 438 (5th Cir.2006). On remand, the district court determined again that Moreno is an armed career criminal. The district court reimposed the same sentence. Moreno gave timely notice of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Moreno contends that the district court erred in determining that his 1987 and 1988 state convictions of burglary of a habitation were crimes of violence and that he is an armed career criminal under \u00a7 924(e) and \u00a7 4B1.4(a). He contends that the Texas offense of burglary of a habitation does not have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, that the offense is not equivalent to the enumerated offense of burglary of a dwelling, and does not by its nature, present a serious potential risk of physical injury to another person. Because Moreno did not raise these issues in the district court, we review them for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005). To demonstrate plain error, Moreno must show clear or obvious error that affects his substantial rights; if he does, this court has discretion to correct a forfeited error that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings, but is not required to do so. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">In <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), the Court held that, because the term \u201cburglary\u201d is variously defined by different states, the meaning of the term, for purposes of \u00a7 924(e), was limited to a \u201cgeneric\u201d definition of burglary set forth in the Court\u2019s opinion: a \u201ccrime, regardless of its exact definition or label, having the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d 495 U.S. at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143. The Texas offense of burglary of a habitation is a \u201cgeneric burglary\u201d for purposes of applying \u00a7 924(e). <em>See United States v. Silva, </em>957 F.2d 157, 162 (5th Cir.1992). <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), cited by Moreno, did not change the definition of \u201cgeneric burglary\u201d set forth in <em>Taylor. See </em>544 U.S. at 19, 125 S.Ct. 1254; <em>see also United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1199, 126 S.Ct. 1398, 164 L.Ed.2d 100 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">Citing <em>Shepard, </em>Moreno argues that no evidence was presented showing that the predicate burglaries were generic burglaries. Interpreting <em>Shepard, </em>this court has held that \u201ca district court errs when it solely relies upon the [presentence report\u2019s] characterization of a defendant\u2019s prior offenses for enhancement purposes.\u201d <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>487 F.3d 279, 281 (5th Cir.2007). Because Moreno did not dispute the adequacy of proof with regard to the predicate burglaries, we review this question for plain error. <em>See id. </em>Moreno has not asserted or shown on appeal that his prior convictions for burglary of a habitation were not violent felonies. <em>See id. </em>at 281-82. Accordingly, Moreno has not shown that his substantial rights were affected by any error on the part of the district court in failing to require supporting documentation showing that the predicate burglaries were generic burglaries. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number><em>Ochoa-Cruz, </em>442 F.3d 865, 867 (5th Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Moreno contends that the district court erred in determining his offense level under \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A). Under \u00a7 4B1.4(a), a \u201cdefendant who is subject to an enhanced sentence under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) is an armed career criminal.\u201d Under \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A), the offense level of an armed career criminal is 34 if he \u201cused or possessed the firearm ... in connection with ... a controlled substance offense, as defined in \u00a7 4B1.2(b)....\u201d \u201cThe term \u2018controlled substance offense\u2019 means an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the ... possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to ... distribute____\u201d\u00a7 4B1.2(b). A \u201c\u2018controlled substance offense\u2019 include[s] the offense of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such [an] offense[].\u201d \u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The probation officer determined that Moreno\u2019s offense level under \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) because Moreno had \u201cpossessed the firearm in connection with a controlled substance offense, as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b), namely, aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute cocaine....\u201d The probation officer reported that a confidential informant disclosed to the United States Secret Service that Moreno intended to purchase cocaine using counterfeit currency. The scheme was verified using surveillance and monitored conversations. After his arrest, Moreno gave a statement confirming his role in the drug transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Moreno contends that the offenses to which he pleaded guilty, i.e., possession of counterfeit United States currency and possession of a firearm by a felon convicted of three or more previous violent felonies, were neither crimes of violence nor controlled substance offenses. Because this issue was not raised in Moreno\u2019s original appeal, it is barred under the mandate rule unless Moreno shows that the district court\u2019s ruling was clearly erroneous and will result in a manifest injustice. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>470 F.3d 200, 204-05 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Marmolejo, </em>139 F.3d 528, 531 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">Moreno cannot show that the district court clearly erred. \u201c[T]here is no requirement that the enhancement in \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) be applied only when the defendant is charged with or convicted of a crime of violence. Rather, if a district court finds, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that the unlawful conduct occurred, the enhancement is proper.\u201d <em>United States v. Rockey, </em>449 F.3d 1099, 1104 (10th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Guerrero, 5 </em>F.3d 868, 872-73 (5th Cir.1993) (district court did not plainly err in determining that defendant convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm had possessed the firearm in connection with a uncharged crime of violence (burglary of a habitation)).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">Moreover, even if the district court did err in sentencing Moreno at level 34 under \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A), instead of at level 33 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(B), such an error would not result in a manifest injustice under the circumstances of this case. Moreno does not dispute that the uncharged drug offense would constitute a controlled substance offense under \u00a7 4B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">Moreno contends also that the district court erred in assessing the four-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2003). Because application of the armed career criminal provision resulted in a higher offense level than the Chapter Two offense level, any error in applying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) could not have resulted in a manifest injustice. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
