To the contrary, after hearing defense counsel\u2019s lengthy argument for a lower sentence than the one the defendant received, the court announced that the Guidelines sentence range was not presumptively correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">What is more, in fashioning the defendant\u2019s sentence, the court properly consulted the Guidelines as advisory, painstakingly considered the sentencing factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), took into account everything the defendant and his attorney had to say, and looked for a way in which to impose a sentence below the prescribed sentence range. In the end, after taking the \u00a7 3553(a) factors into account, the court concluded that a sentence below that sentence range would be inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">The sentence in this case is not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
