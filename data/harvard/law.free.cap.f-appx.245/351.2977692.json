He challenges the district court\u2019s denial, following an evidentiary hearing, of his motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a consented-to search. The evidentiary hearing was held before a magistrate judge, who recommended granting the motion. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>court instead denied it, in a comprehensive and well-reasoned opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">On 20 February 2004, law enforcement personnel, having initiated surveillance of Mendoza\u2019s residence, observed, <em>inter alia, </em>Mendoza\u2019s accompanying a vehicle from his garage to a parking lot, where it was picked up by another individual. After a traffic stop of that vehicle, the individual consented to its being searched, which revealed 23 bundles of cocaine concealed in a hidden compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">In order to determine Mendoza\u2019s involvement, Officers executed an investigatory stop of his vehicle, obtaining his written consent to search his residence and vehicles surrounding it. The search revealed, <em>inter alia: </em>approximately $476,000; and packaging material, including electrical tape, resembling that used for the earlier-seized cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">For the denial of a suppression motion, a district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error; its conclusions of law, <em>de novo. E.g., United States v. Cardenas, </em>9 F.3d 1139, 1147 (5th Cir.1993). The evidence is reviewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>E.g., id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Mendoza first contends there was no reasonable suspicion supporting stopping his vehicle. Of course, law-enforcement officers may conduct a brief investigatory stop of a vehicle and its occupants upon reasonable suspicion \u201ccriminal activity may be afoot\u201d. <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). \u201c \u2018Reasonable suspicion\u2019 is considerably easier for the government to establish than probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Tellez, </em>11 F.3d 530, 532 (5th Cir.1993). There need only be \u201csome minimal level of objective justification for the officer[s\u2019] actions, measured in [the] light of the totality of the circumstances\u201d. <em>United States v. Rideau, </em>969 F.2d 1572, 1574 (5th Cir.1992) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Mendoza does <em>not </em>contest, <em>inter alia: </em>the association of his residence, and a vehicle registered in his name, with previous drug-trafficking investigations; prior to the vehicle drop-off, his being observed purchasing, <em>inter alia, </em>electrical tape, and the vehicle\u2019s being moved into his garage, where it remained for approximately four hours; and his presence at the drop-off. Based on the totality of the circumstances, there was objective justification for stopping Mendoza\u2019s vehicle. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Mendoza next maintains his consent was <em>not </em>voluntary. A district court\u2019s voluntariness-of-consent determination is reviewed for clear error, in the light of: (1) the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s custodial status; (2) the presence of coercive police procedures; (3) the extent and level of the defendant\u2019s cooperation with the police; (4) his awareness of his right to refuse consent; (5) his education and intelligence; and (6) his belief no incriminating evidence will be found. <em>E.g., United States v. Kelley, </em>981 F.2d 1464, 1470 (5th Cir.1993). No single factor is dispositive or controlling. <em>E.g., id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">Although, upon effecting the investigatory stop, some Officers approached Mendoza\u2019s vehicle with their firearms drawn, the evidence established, <em>inter alia, </em>Mendoza: was <em>not </em>physically restrained prior to giving his initial consent; was calm and appeared \u201crelaxed\u201d during the stop; cooperated with the Officers and answered their questions; and was informed of his right to refuse consent. Moreover, Mendoza did <em>not </em>present evidence of: the Officers\u2019 having pointed their firearms at him, or any occupants of his vehicle; any Officer\u2019s having displayed a firearm while obtaining his consent; or his lack of understanding of the written consent forms or his right to refuse such consent. Accordingly, he fails to show the district court\u2019s voluntariness<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>of-consent determination was clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>121 F.3d 928, 934, 939 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Kelley, </em>981 F.2d at 1470 (\u201cWhere ... a finding of consent [is based] on the oral testimony at a suppression hearing, the clearly erroneous standard is particularly strong [because] the judge had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
