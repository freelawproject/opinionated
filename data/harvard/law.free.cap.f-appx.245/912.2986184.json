After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-18\">A district court\u2019s interpretation of federal procedural rules, such as the Federal Rules of Evidence, is subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See Pickett v. Iowa Beef Processors, </em>209 F.3d 1276, 1279 (11th Cir.2000) (holding a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Federal Rules of Civil Proee<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>dure is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review); <em>see also United States v. Campa, </em>459 F.3d 1121, 1174 (11th Cir.2006) (reviewing district court\u2019s interpretation of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure <em>de </em>novo); <em>S.E.C. v. Sargent, </em>229 F.3d 68, 79 (1st Cir.2000) (noting that \u201cthe interpretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence is a question of law which we review <em>de novo\u201d)-, Davoll v. Webb, </em>194 F.3d 1116, 1136 (10th Cir.1999) (reviewing district court\u2019s interpretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence <em>de </em>novo).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, including its rulings on the admissibility of expert testimony, for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1258 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc); <em>Wright v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>375 F.3d 1252, 1260 (11th Cir.2004). Even where a ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony may be \u201c \u2018outcome determinative,\u2019 we do not apply a stricter standard .... \u201d <em>McDowell v. Brown, </em>392 F.3d 1283, 1294 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c[T]he deference that is the hallmark of abuse-of-discretion review requires that we not reverse an evidentiary decision of a district court unless the ruling is manifestly erroneous. Thus, it is by now axiomatic that a district court enjoys \u2018considerable leeway<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in making these determinations.\u201d <em>Frazier, </em>387 F.3d at 1258 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, abuse-of-discretion review</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-5\">recognizes the range of possible conclusions the trial judge may reach. \u201cBy definition ... under the abuse of discretion standard of review there will be occasions in which we affirm the district court even though we would have gone the other way had it been our call. That is how an abuse of discretion standard differs from a <em>de novo </em>standard of review. As we have stated previously, the abuse <em>of </em>discretion standard allows \u2018a range of choice for the district court, so long as that choice does not constitute a clear error of judgment.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1259 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">To the extent Long challenges the district court\u2019s analysis of the elements of his claim under the AEMLD, we are presented with a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. See Ritch v. Robinson-Humphrey Co., </em>142 F.3d 1391, 1393 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cThis Court reviews the district court\u2019s imposition of the causation element in the Alabama Securities Act, a question of law, de novo.\u201d) (citing <em>Kahn v. Smith Barney Shearson, Inc., </em>115 F.3d 930, 932 (11th Cir.1997) (questions of law reviewed <em>de </em>novo)).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">The parties are familiar with the background facts and we only summarize them here. On April 9, 2002, while operating a Model 537 forklift manufactured by Raymond, Long was injured when several pallets that were placed on the forks impacted one of the shelving system stanchions, causing one or more of the pallets to fall into the operator compartment. The pallets pinned Long in the operator compartment and ultimately crushed one of Long\u2019s legs. Although he suffered extensive injury, requiring surgery and hospitalization, Long says he now has substantially recovered from the injuries but continues to have an impairment of fifteen percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">According to Long\u2019s complaint, Raymond offered a platform barrier, or guard, as an option when the Model 537 was manufactured and sold. It was undisputed that the optional platform barrier was offered to and declined by the original purchaser of the Model 537 involved in the accident here. It was Long\u2019s theory that if the Model 537 he was operating had been equipped with a platform barrier, the barrier would have prevented or substantially reduced his injuries because the pallets would have been blocked from enter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>ing the operator compartment. Raymond says that it offers the platform bander as an optional feature for the Model 587, but highlights that the barrier substantially diminishes the forklift\u2019s ability to perform one of its primary purposes: to order-pick individual case goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">In support of this his theory of liability, Long proffered the testimony of Gene Cook as an expert in the area of industrial safety. Long wanted to introduce Cook\u2019s testimony to establish that without the optional platform barrier, the Model 587 was openly and obviously defective. Long says that with the barrier, the likelihood of injury from the Model 537 would be substantially reduced, if not eliminated entirely. The district court conducted a lengthy mid-trial hearing on the admissibility of Cook\u2019s proffered expert testimony, pursuant to Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and the gatekeeping requirements of <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), and concluded Cook was not qualified to testify on two essential elements of Long\u2019s AEMLD claim. The court subsequently entered judgment as a matter of law in favor of Raymond, based on Long\u2019s failure to present acceptable expert evidence on two elements of his claim \u2014 specifically, he could not show that the Model 537 was defective and he presented no evidence on causation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">First, Long argues that, in evaluating Cook\u2019s testimony, the district court erred by applying Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and the <em>Daubert </em>standard for the evaluation of expert testimony, and not applying Rule 601 and Alabama\u2019s standard for the competency of witnesses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Federal jurisdiction in this case is based upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. Under the Erie<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> doctrine, a federal court sitting in diversity must apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">\u201cRules of procedure encompass rules of evidence, and therefore, the Federal Rules of Evidence, not state evidentiary rules, apply.\u201d <em>McDowell v. Brown, </em>392 F.3d 1283, 1294 (11th Cir.2004). More specifically, we expressly have held that \u201cthe admissibility of expert testimony is a matter of federal, rather than state procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although in some cases, Rule 601 of the Federal Rules of Evidence mandates the application of state law on issues of competency, the instant issue squarely is a question of the <em>admissibility </em>of certain expert testimony, rather than the <em>competency </em>of the witness himself. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>the district court had been presented with an issue concerning Cook\u2019s competency and had applied Rule 601 and Alabama\u2019s standard for competency, the district still would have remained <em>obligated, </em>after determining that Cook was competent to testify on a substantive issue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>the case, to screen the testimony under Rule 702 to determine if it is otherwise admissible expert testimony. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the district court correctly applied Rule 702 and conducted a <em>Daubert </em>hearing, consistent with its gatekeeping obligations, in analyzing Dr. Cook\u2019s proffered testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">We likewise discern no error in the district court\u2019s ultimate exclusion of Cook\u2019s testimony. More specifically, the court found that Cook\u2019s testimony consisted of \u201cmerely recognizing a safety hazard,\u201d and that, in the context of a claim under the AEMLD, the plaintiff was required to present evidence that (1) the plaintiffs injuries would have been eliminated or in some way reduced by an alternative design, <em>and </em>(2) the utility of the alternative design outweighed the utility of the design actually used. The district court determined that Cook was not qualified, within the meaning of <em>Daubert, </em>to testify about either of these elements of Long\u2019s claim. On this record, we discern no manifest error or clear error and thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding Cook\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">Finally, from our review of the transcript and the entire record, we discern no legal error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that without Cook\u2019s testimony, and absent any other evidence on two elements of an AEMLD claim, Raymond was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, consistent with Alabama law.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b935-12\">.
