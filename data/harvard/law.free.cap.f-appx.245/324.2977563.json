Richardson was sentenced as an armed career criminal pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), and <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.4 (2005). On appeal, Richardson argues that the district court erred in sentencing him as an armed career criminal. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-23\">A defendant with three prior convictions for violent felony offenses committed on separate occasions is subject to treatment as an armed career criminal. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1); USSG \u00a7 4B1.4. Though Richardson did not dispute in the district court the fact of his prior convictions or the sentences he received or object to the accuracy of the source material in the presentence report, he contends on appeal that he was improperly designated an armed career criminal because specific attributes of his prior convictions, specifically the dates they were committed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>whether they were violent, remained unproven.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">However, contrary to Richardson\u2019s argument, the district court was not required to make any factual findings concerning Richardson\u2019s prior record, and the district court could rely on \u201cthe conclusive significance\u201d of his record, <em>see Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 25, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), as set out in the presentence report. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 285 (4th Cir.2005) (sentencing judge entitled to rely on undisputed information in presentence report that \u201cbears the earmarks of derivation from Shepard-approved sources such as the indictments and state-court judgments from [defendant\u2019s] prior convictions\u201d), cer<em>t. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1005, 126 S.Ct. 1463, 164 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In this case, the district court properly relied on the presentence report in concluding that Richardson\u2019s prior convictions occurred on different occasions. Notably, the offenses occurred on different dates, in different geographical locations, and involved different criminal objectives and victims. <em>See Thompson, </em>421 F.3d at 284-86; <em>United States v. Williams, </em>187 F.3d 429, 431 (4th Cir.1999). Moreover, it is readily ascertainable from the presentence report that Richardson was convicted of violating N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 14-54, the state statute proscribing breaking and entering buildings. Because this Court has previously determined that a violation of \u00a7 14-54 constitutes a violent felony for ACCA purposes, <em>see Thompson, </em>421 F.3d at 284-85, the convictions were properly used as ACCA predicate offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Richardson also contends that his sentence is unconstitutional after <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because it was enhanced based on prior convictions that were neither alleged in the indictment nor found by a jury beyond a controlling precedent. In <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-54 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1010, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005), we held that prior convictions used as a basis for ACCA enhancement need not be charged in the indictment or established beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
