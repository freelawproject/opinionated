Williams\u2019 suit claims that the defendants arrested him without probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Williams was arrested after the police observed him driving recklessly, nearly causing two accidents. He asserts that his arrest was without probable cause and unconstitutional because witnesses at the scene of his arrest told the officer that Williams did not drink or do drugs and that he must be suffering from a medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The district court concluded that the evidence in the summary judgment record raised a genuine issue of fact as to whether the defendants acted negligently, but also recognized that negligence alone was insufficient to establish a constitutional violation. We agree. As the plaintiff recognizes, the doctrine of qualified immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law. <em>Malley v. Briggs, </em>475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986). Williams\u2019 actions prior to his arrest clearly gave the officers probable cause to arrest him. The officer\u2019s failure to recognize and act on William\u2019s medical condition was at most negligent and therefore not sufficiently aberrant to overcome the defense of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Regarding Williams\u2019 claims against the city, the district court concluded that Williams failed to establish liability on the part of the city based on a failure to demonstrate that the alleged misconduct in this case was the result of a municipal policy or custom as required by <em>Monell v. Dept. of Social Services of City of New York, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Again, we agree. The above analysis also supports the conclusion of the district court that Williams failed to state a claim under the Mississippi Tort Claims Act. That act requires \u201creckless disregard for the safety and well-being of any person not engaged in a criminal act at the time of injury.\u201d Mississippi Code Ann. \u00a7 11 \u2014 46\u20149(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing the plaintiffs case on summary judgment for essentially the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s Order dated July 12, 2006</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-9\">.
