By order dated 29 November 2006, we concluded that Wilson is barred by an appeal waiver from challenging the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines and the reasonableness of his sentence. After further review of the record, we conclude that Wilson\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are without merit; we therefore affirm Wilson\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-21\">Wilson initially pled not guilty to the section 922(g)(1) charge, but later entered a guilty plea pursuant to a written plea agreement, which included a waiver provision that excepted claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. In accordance with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, the district court conducted a plea colloquy and established that Wilson wished to plead guilty and understood the rights he was waiving. During the colloquy, Wilson acknowledged that he understood that his potential sentence could be as much as ten to fifteen years, that he had discussed the sentencing guidelines with his counsel, and that a sentence higher than estimated would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>be grounds for setting aside the plea. Wilson also indicated that he was \u201cfully satisfied with the representation and advice\u201d received from his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Nevertheless, Wilson later filed two <em>pro se </em>motions to discharge his appointed counsel on the grounds of ineffective assistance, claiming that counsel made certain legal errors about the indictment and that counsel misinformed Wilson of the possible sentencing range. Wilson\u2019s attorney also filed a motion to withdraw as counsel based on a strained relationship with Wilson. A magistrate judge denied Wilson\u2019s second motion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and his counsel\u2019s motion on 25 October 2005, noting that (1) the motions were made \u201con the eve of sentencing,\u201d (2) the district court had explained the possible sentencing range during the colloquy, and (3) permitting Wilson\u2019s counsel to withdraw would cause unnecessary delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Neither Wilson nor his counsel filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s order with the district court, although the district court raised the motions <em>sua sponte </em>during the 26 October 2005 sentencing hearing. The court informed Wilson that the indictment had not been amended, that Wilson\u2019s counsel \u201chas done quite well,\u201d and that Wilson had previously acknowledged that a higher than anticipated sentence would not be the basis for invalidating the guilty plea. The court ultimately sentenced Wilson to 47 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">The only remaining issue in Wilson\u2019s appeal is whether the district court erred in denying his motions to dismiss trial counsel for ineffective assistance. Although we generally do not review ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal, <em>see Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003), the record in this case indicates that, at the 26 October hearing, the district court considered and rejected Wilson\u2019s claim that his trial counsel failed to inform Wilson adequately of the range of punishment he faced if he pled guilty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Camacho, </em>40 F.3d 349, 355 (11th Cir.1994) (noting that we may hear ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal if record is sufficiently developed), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by United States v. Sanchez, </em>269 F.3d 1250 (11th Cir.2001). The question of \u201c[w]hether a criminal defendant\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective is a mixed question of law and fact, subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">To succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 690, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). As the district court implicitly determined, even if Wilson\u2019s counsel was in some way deficient in advising Wilson of the possible sentencing implications from his guilty plea, Wil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>son cannot establish prejudice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> During the plea colloquy, the district court itself explained to Wilson \u2014 in detail \u2014 the consequences of the plea agreement, range of punishment, and sentencing contingencies before accepting Wilson\u2019s guilty plea. Thus, any failure on the part of Wilson\u2019s counsel to clearly explain the possible punishment was cured by the district court. For this reason, Wilson\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-14\">. In our prior order, we reserved judgment on Wilson\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, noting that we did not have access to the transcript of the 26 October 2006 hearing, during which Wilson indicates that the district court denied that claim after extensive discussion. Wilson has since filed a transcript of that hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b33-8\">. Neither the magistrate nor the district court ruled explicitly on Wilson\u2019s initial motion for new counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b33-9\">. During the hearing, the district judge stated that he \u201cwould be very surprised to find out that [counsel] didn\u2019t tell you about [sentencing] contingencies when you and he discussed these\u201d and then said: \u201cBut in any event I specifically told you don't rely upon anyone\u2019s estimate, including your own, about what your base offense level may be or what your guideline range may be or what the ultimate sentence may be....\u201d The judge also told Wilson that \"the fact that you are getting a higher than estimated sentence was something you specifically told me you understood would not be the basis for changing your plea.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b34-4\">. In general, we lack jurisdiction to review a magistrate judge's order where the party appealing such order \u201cfailed to object to or appeal the magistrate judge's decision to the district court.\u2019\u2019 <em>United States v. Brown, </em>342 F.3d 1245, 1246 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 59(a) (noting that a party\u2019s failure to object to a magistrate\u2019s order on a nondispositive motion \"waives a party\u2019s right to review\u201d). But, although Wilson did not file <em>formal </em>objections to the magistrate\u2019s order, he did discuss the contentions contained in his motions with the district judge at the 26 October sentencing hearing. We think the district court\u2019s consideration and rejection of those contentions sufficient to provide us with jurisdiction over this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
