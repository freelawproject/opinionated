For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-13\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b410-14\">On November 2, 1999, Taylor filed a claim for disability benefits and supplemental security income benefits under Title XVI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401, <em>et seq. </em>She asserted that she had been disabled since August 18, 1991, due to the loss of full use of the left side of her body (including her left hand and leg), diabetes, and high blood pressure. Her initial claim was denied, as was her request for reconsideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She then requested a hearing before an ALJ. The ALJ conducted a hearing on January 10, 2002, and issued a decision concluding that Taylor was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act. The ALJ thus denied benefits to Taylor. After the Appeals Council affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision, Taylor filed this action. A magistrate judge heard her case and recommended affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision. The district court adopted that recommendation and denied relief. Taylor now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">This court reviews a denial of social security benefits \u201conly to ascertain whether (1) the final decision is supported by substantial evidence and (2) whether the Commissioner used the proper legal standards to evaluate the evidence.\u201d <em>Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). A final decision is supported by substantial evidence if we find relevant evidence sufficient to establish that a reasonable person could reach the same conclusion reached by the Commissioner. <em>Id. </em>In our review of the evidence, we do not substitute our judgment for the Commissioner\u2019s judgment. <em>Id. </em>If there are conflicts in the evidence, we accept the Commissioner\u2019s resolution of those conflicts so long as that resolution is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The ALJ uses a five-step sequential analysis to evaluate claims of disability: (1) whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity; (2) whether the claimant has a severe impairment; (3) whether the claimant\u2019s impairment meets or equals the severity of an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R., \u00a7 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1; (4) whether the impairment prevents the claimant from doing past relevant work; and (5) whether the impairment prevents the claimant from doing any other work. <em>Perez v. Barnhart, </em>415 F.3d 457, 461 (5th Cir.2005); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). To be entitled to benefits, an applicant bears the initial burden of showing that she is disabled. <em>Abshire v. Bowen, </em>848 F.2d 638, 640 (5th Cir.1988) (per curiam). Here, the ALJ found that Taylor retained the residual functional capacity to do a number of jobs; she thus failed the fifth step of the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">Rather than directly challenging the substantiality of the evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s decision, Taylor challenges the steps the ALJ took to obtain the evidence. When Taylor applied for benefits in November of 1999, she identified the Medical Center of Louisiana at New Orleans (\u201cMCLNO\u201d) as the only place where she had received treatment. Further, the field officer who initially assessed her noted that her only difficulty in movement was a slow and stiff gait. Taylor indicated that no doctor had any medical records or information about her health or impairments. The Commissioner then obtained Taylor\u2019s previous year\u2019s records from MCLNO. The records indicated that Taylor had visited MCLNO five times in the previous year, largely for checkups related to her diabetes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On two of those visits, she reported that she was walking for exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">For reasons that are unclear from the record, the Commissioner ordered a consultative evaluation by Dr. Mandich on December 17, 1999.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Mandich concluded that Taylor suffered from hypertension that could be controlled with medication, adult-onset diabetes, and had a history of stroke in 1992 with slight residual stiffness to the left leg and subjective feelings of diminished fine coordination in the left hand. The Commissioner then turned Taylor\u2019s files, including the report from Dr. Mandich, over to two Adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>tration medical consultants, both of whom concluded, in reports completed on January 31, 2000, and February 11, 2000, that Taylor was capable of light work. On February 25, 2000, the Commissioner told Taylor that she did not qualify for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">On May 1, 2001, Taylor requested a hearing before an ALJ. In her request for the hearing, she identified Dr. Weisberg as a treating physician. This was the first indication to the Commissioner that she might have a treating physician. Records provided by Dr. Weisberg indicate that he first saw Taylor on November 3, 1995. Dr. Weisberg observed that Taylor walked very slowly and could only walk a couple of blocks before her left foot began to drag. He also noted that her left arm and hand were weak and she had some difficulty performing rapid successive movements with her left hand. He concluded that her motor disorganization interfered with her daily living, specifically noting that it took her 10 times longer to dress herself than it normally would. Dr. Weisberg also noted that although her speech was slightly slurred, he could easily understand what she was saying. Dr. Weisberg did not see Taylor again until May 26, 2000, over four years later. On that visit, Weisberg noted the same problems, concluding that Taylor showed \u201ca moderate degree of motor disorganization\u201d in her left arm and leg. Dr. Weisberg also concluded that Taylor was not capable of living independently.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">By the time of Taylor\u2019s second recorded visit to Dr. Weisberg, she had already filed for benefits, seen Dr. Mandich, and been denied benefits. Still, she asserts that (1) the Commissioner should not have ordered or relied on the consultative evaluation; (2) the ALJ should have recontacted the \u201ctreating physician,\u201d Dr. Weisberg, in order to resolve discrepancies between his findings and those of Dr. Mandich; and (3) the ALJ should have given Dr. Weisberg\u2019s opinion controlling weight. These claims are essentially procedural in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u201cProcedural perfection in administrative proceedings is not required\u201d as long as \u201cthe substantial rights of a party have [not] been affected.\u201d <em>Mays v. Bowen, </em>837 F.2d 1362, 1364 (5th Cir.1988). We will thus only remand \u201cif such improprieties would cast into doubt the existence of substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision.\u201d Morr<em>is v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 333, 335 (5th Cir.1988). The burden for proving a disability is on the claimant, so it is ultimately her responsibility to provide evidence supporting her claims. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.912(a). Given the very limited medical information that Taylor provided when she applied for benefits, the Commissioner was certainly justified in ordering a consultative evaluation to determine the nature of her disability. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 416.912(f). Though Taylor points out that the Commission must make \u201cevery reasonable effort\u201d to obtain the necessary evidence from either a treating physician or her \u201cown medical sources,\u201d Dr. Weisberg\u2019s identity was entirely unknown at the time the exam was ordered. Further, there is no indication that MCLNO would have been able to provide any additional relevant information about Taylor\u2019s condition \u2014 the Commissioner requested and received Taylor\u2019s full medical history from MCLNO \u2014 so there is no reason in the record suggesting that the Commissioner should have recontacted MCLNO before ordering a consultative evaluation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Once the ALJ was presented with Dr. Mandich\u2019s report, it was the ALJ\u2019s prerogative to decide how much weight it would receive. Taylor asserts that because she had identified Dr. Weisberg as her treating physician by the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>of the hearing before the ALJ, the ALJ should have deferred to his opinion or conducted a detailed analysis of his views as described in 20 C.F.R \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). However, nothing about Taylor\u2019s relationship with Dr. Weisberg establishes the \u201clongitudinal\u201d pattern of care described in section 404.1527(d)(2); Taylor\u2019s two visits to Dr. Weisberg, four years apart, are the sort of \u201cindividual examinations\u201d that are <em>distinguished </em>in the regulation from the continuous care provided by a treating physician. The ALJ did not need to accept Taylor\u2019s assertion that Weisberg was her treating physician at face value, given the limited treatment relationship she established with him. <em>See Hernandez v. Heckler, </em>704 F.2d 857, 860-61 (5th Cir.1983) (affirming ALJ\u2019s determination that a doctor who only saw the claimant twice in a 17-month period was not a treating physician). Because Taylor\u2019s two visits to Dr. Weisberg did not establish him as her treating physician, the ALJ did not err by not attempting to resolve his statements with Dr. Mandich\u2019s conclusions. Nor was it error to deny Dr. Weisberg\u2019s opinion controlling weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Taylor also asserts that the ALJ made errors of fact in rejecting Dr. Weisberg\u2019s findings. Specifically, she contends that, contrary to the ALJ\u2019s findings, (1) Dr. Weisberg\u2019s findings were not inconsistent with those of Dr. Mandich; (2) Dr. Weisberg\u2019s findings were not based on Taylor\u2019s subjective complaints; and (3) Dr. Weisberg\u2019s findings were not contrary to the weight of the medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Taylor\u2019s first assertion is belied by the fact that she rests her procedural claim on a contention that the ALJ should have given more weight, not less, to Dr. Weisberg\u2019s findings, and that if the ALJ did so she would have prevailed. The record makes clear that Dr. Weisberg and Dr. Mandich did not have identical views of the nature of Taylor\u2019s medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">The ALJ stated that Dr. Weisberg\u2019s opinion \u201cappears to be based on the subjective complaints of [Taylor] which he takes at face value.\u201d This statement was a reference to Dr. Weisberg\u2019s conclusion that Taylor was not capable of independent living despite being able to cook, clean, and perform other household activities. The ALJ found Dr. Weisberg\u2019s conclusion to be inconsistent with his observations and thus found that Dr. Weisberg was crediting Taylor\u2019s self-evaluation. The record supports this finding, as well as the related finding that Dr. Weisberg\u2019s conclusion that Taylor was incapable of independent living was contrary to the weight of the medical evidence. Both Dr. Mandich and a vocational expert procured by the ALJ found that Taylor\u2019s disabilities were not so severe as to preclude employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-15\">. Taylor apparently stopped working on July 1, 1980, because she became pregnant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\">. Taylor was non-compliant with her prescribed diabetes medication on three occasions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\">. Given the rather limited information and documentation provided by Taylor, it would be reasonable to assume the Commissioner requested this consultation in order to make an informed decision about the nature of her disability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
