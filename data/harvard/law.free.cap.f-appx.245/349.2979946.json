Gay, Jr., Assistant U.S. Attorney, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Western District of Texas, San Antonio, TX, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b372-6\">Before DEMOSS, STEWART, and PRADO, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b372-7\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Jose Gerardo Pasillas-Bonilla (Pasillas) appeals his convictions and sentences for conspiracy to import more than 50 kilograms of marijuana, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 50 kilograms of marijuana, and illegal reentry after deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Pasillas first challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions. Pasillas\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court now would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Pasillas properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">Pasillas also argues that the district court violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 32 by not making a specific finding on his objection to an enhancement for his role in the offense. Rule 32 requires the sentencing court to make findings regarding controverted facts in the PSR, or to state that those facts will not be taken into account at sentencing. The district court satisfied the mandate of Rule 32 when it overruled the objection and adopted the PSR because the findings in the PSR were \u201cso clear\u201d as not to leave this court to \u201csecond guess\u201d the basis for the district court\u2019s decision. <em>United States v. Carreon, </em>11 F.3d 1225,1230-31 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
