We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-19\">When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S. Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-22\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on July 21, 2006. Go-forth subsequently filed a \u201cRequest For Reconsideration Of Judgment And Certificate Of Appealability\u201d that was entered on the district court\u2019s docket as both a motion for reconsideration and a notice of appeal. Though Goforth\u2019s \u201cRequest For Reconsideration\u201d was properly construed as the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal, <em>see Smith v. Barry, </em>502 U.S. 244, 248-49, 112 S.Ct. 678, 116 L.Ed.2d 678 (1992), we nevertheless conclude that it was untimely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>as it was filed on January 16, 2007,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and Goforth failed to timely obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Additionally, we construe Goforth\u2019s \u201cRequest For Reconsideration\u201d and informal brief as an application to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Jones v. Braxton, </em>392 F.3d 683, 689-90 (4th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.2003). In order to obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a prisoner must assert claims based on either: (1) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review, or (2) newly discovered evidence sufficient to establish that no reasonable fact finder would have found the movant guilty. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Goforth\u2019s claims do not satisfy either of these conditions. Therefore, we decline to authorize a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Additionally, we deny Goforth\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-8\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court.
