Meredith appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), of his personal injury tort action against Honeywell International, Inc. (\u201cHoneywell\u201d), on the ground that the action was barred by the exclusivity provision of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Code \u00a7 65.2-100 <em>et seq. </em>(the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>\u201cAct\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court ruled that at the time of his injury, Meredith was a statutory employee of Honeywell and, therefore, his sole right and remedy was under the Act. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The material facts of this case are undisputed. Honeywell is in the business of manufacturing various products, chemicals, and materials, including caprolactam<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which is transported from Honeywell\u2019s Hopewell, Virginia plant to its Irmo, South Carolina plant. Honeywell contracted with Oakley Tank Services (\u201cOakley\u201d), other independent companies, and had its own drivers hauling caprolactam between plants. Specifically, Honeywell contracted with Oakley to transport caprolactam from its Hopewell plant to its Irmo plant, and then to return to the Hopewell plant, occasionally carrying a load of \u201cwash water\u201d from which Hopewell would recover additional caprolactam. Both Honeywell drivers and contracted drivers followed the same procedures when loading caprolactam from the Honeywell plant. A driver parked his truck at a loading station, placed his keys in a lock box, and provided paperwork to a Honeywell control operator located in a control room. The driver could then wait in the control room while the control operator loaded the truck with caprolactam. Upon loading the truck and providing the driver with completed documentation, the control operator would unlock the lock box, allowing the driver to retrieve his keys and drive the truck out of the plant. Meredith was a truck driver employed by Oakley and, at the time of his accident, was working the run to transport caprolactam from the Honeywell Hopewell plant to its Irmo plant. Meredith followed the above-outlined procedure and, after presenting his paperwork to the control operator, sat in a chair in the Hopewell plant control room which collapsed beneath him, resulting in his alleged injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in dismissing Meredith\u2019s case pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), based on its holding that Honeywell was Meredith\u2019s statutory employer. In support of his position, Meredith asserts that: (1) he was not engaged in Honeywell\u2019s trade, business, or occupation; (2) he was an independent contractor; and (3) Honeywell was not his statutory employer under the normal work test.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">We find that the district court correctly held that Meredith\u2019s action was barred by the Act. It is undisputed that the transportation of the caprolactam between Honeywell\u2019s Hopewell and Irmo plants was an essential part of the work that Honeywell performed in the manufacture and processing of caprolactam. Meredith\u2019s job was to effect that transportation. At the time of his injury, his truck was being unloaded and prepared for the return trip, he had just presented required documentation to the control operator, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>then attempted to sit in the chair located in the control room. The district court found that neither the act of sitting,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> nor the fact that Meredith was not responsible for the actual unloading of the product,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> removed Meredith\u2019s activity from the trade, business, or occupation of Honeywell, and we agree. Moreover, as the district court held, the operative factual distinctions regarding the relationship between premises owner and contractor for purposes of the applicability of the Act are whether the transportation was intra-company, or between two separate companies, with the former properly being held to be part of the owner\u2019s trade, business or occupation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and whether the product delivered was independently manufactured, with such products being held not to be within the defendant\u2019s trade, business or occupation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, the transportation of caprolactam from Honeywell\u2019s Hopewell plant to its Irmo plant, where the chemical was processed and used to manufacture nylon, was an integral part of Honeywell\u2019s \u201ctrade, business or occupation\u201d under the plain language of Va.Code \u00a7 65.2-302(A). Plus, Meredith was not merely delivering an independently manufactured product to a job site. Rather, he was transporting material manufactured by Honeywell between Honeywell\u2019s manufacturing plants, which was, as the district court held, an essential part of Honeywell\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Nor does the fact that Honeywell had a contract with Oakley the terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>which provided that Oakley was an independent contractor, that neither Oakley nor its employees would be considered Honeywell employees, and that Oakley would obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance for its employees, alter the legal obligations of the respective parties under the Act. As properly noted by the district court, the Act explicitly provides that \u201cno contract or agreement, written or implied, ... shall in any manner operate to relieve any employer in whole or in part of any obligation created by this title.\u201d Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 65.2-300(A). Thus, the contract does not protect Honeywell from its obligations as a statutory employer under the Act, nor does it provide Meredith with a loophole through which he can circumvent the exclusivity provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Finally, Meredith\u2019s assertion that Honeywell was not his statutory employer under the \u201cnormal work test\u201d espoused by the Virginia Supreme Court in <em>Shell Oil Co. v. Leftwich, </em>212 Va. 715, 187 S.E.2d 162, 167 (1972), is likewise without merit. While Honeywell does not presently use its direct employees to transport caprolactam along the precise interstate route followed by Meredith, their drivers transport the same chemical, in the same manner, using the same procedures and equipment, for the same purpose, between the Hopewell plant and other Honeywell fiber plants in Virginia. We find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that there is no legal distinction between the fact that Meredith transported the caprolactam across state lines, and that the Honeywell drivers transported the substance within Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The facts of this case establish that Honeywell was Meredith\u2019s statutory employer, and accordingly, his sole remedy was under the Act. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Meredith\u2019s tort action against Honeywell for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-6\">. Section 65.2-302(A) of the Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">When any person (referred to in this section as \"owner\u201d) undertakes to perform or execute any work which is part of his trade, business or occupation and contracts with any other person (referred to in this section as \"subcontractor\u201d) for the execution or performance by or under such subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by such owner, the owner shall be liable to pay to any worker employed in the work any compensation under this title which he would have been liable to pay if the worker had been immediately employed by him [thus rendering the worker a \"statutory employee\u201d of the owner].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">The Act excludes all other rights and remedies of such employees, at common law or otherwise, on account of such injury. <em>See </em>Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 65.2-307.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-15\">. Caprolactam is a chemical intermediate used by Honeywell in the manufacture of nylon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b350-4\">. We note that it was an essential part of the entire process of hauling the material that the driver complete his paperwork and wait while his tanker truck was filled with caprolactam. While Meredith contends that he ceased being Honeywell\u2019s statutoiy employee while his truck was being refilled from the time he presented his paperwork until the time he fell, he has offered no case law to support such a proposition. Indeed, the contention that Meredith ceased to be a statutoiy employee of Honeywell while he was awaiting the filling of his truck is as frivolous as would be a contention that he ceased being a statutory employee had he been injured while stopping to catch his breath on his way to submitting his paperwork, or during the time he was exiting his truck after pulling into the Hopewell facility. The law does not provide for such piecemeal differentiation, and we decline to impose it in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b350-5\">. Citing <em>Conlin v.
