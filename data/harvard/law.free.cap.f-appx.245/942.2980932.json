In a prior published decision, we vacated a sentence of equal length that the district court imposed earlier. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>441 F.3d 1322, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">The facts are set forth in great detail in our previous published decision. <em>See Scott, </em>441 F.3d at 1324-26. Nevertheless, a brief recitation of the facts pertinent to this appeal is necessary. On September 14, 2004, while serving his sentence for carjacking, Scott mailed a threatening letter to Judge Charles R. Butler of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama, the judge who had sentenced him following his carjacking conviction. The letter instructed Judge Butler \u201cto watch [his] back Every Step Of The Way\u201d because \u201cI Will Get you Killed One Day.\u201d The letter was signed \u201cTIME BOMb.\u201d Scott wrote to Judge Butler again on September 19, 2004, enclosing a second threatening letter, as well as an additional envelope. This additional envelope contained a third letter that included a threat to kidnap Judge Butler\u2019s children, along with a white powder which was eventually identified as a cleaning substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">Judge Butler\u2019s staff alerted the Marshals Service. The Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed Scott in prison on September 23, 2004. During the interview Scott acknowledged sending the letters. When asked if he intended to make good on these threats upon release from prison, Scott stated: \u201cThere are a lot of people that I want to do something to, but I have not made up my mind when or where I will do it.\u201d In response to the agents\u2019 further questioning, Scott just smiled.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-14\">On November 17, 2004, a grand jury handed down a six-count indictment against Scott. Scott then pleaded guilty to threatening a federal official in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115(a)(1)(B) and filed a \u201cfactual resume\u201d admitting the elements of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-15\">After determining the guidelines range and applying the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court imposed a 120-month sentence. Scott appealed and we vacated the sentence because we concluded that the district court had misinterpreted the guidelines, calculating a range of 70 to 87 months. <em>See Scott, </em>441 F.3d at 1325. We determined that the correct guidelines range was 37 to 46 months. <em>See id. </em>at 1329-30. Because the \u201cstep from 46 months to 120 months is significantly greater than the step from 87 months to 120 months\u201d, we were reluctant to \u201csay that the court, had it known of the appropriate range, would have sentenced Scott to the same severe sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>Accordingly, we vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">On remand, the district court once again imposed a 120-month sentence, incorporating its application of the \u00a7 8553(a) factors from the first sentence hearing. The court emphasized the severity of Scott\u2019s offense, characterizing it as \u201can attack on the judicial system, which is the very glue that holds this civilized society together.\u201d The district court also cited the \u201cgeneral goals of punishment\u201d and of deterrence as rationales for the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">On appeal, Scott argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because: (1) the district court, whose primary justification for the sentence was to deter others from committing similar crimes, did not cite any authority demonstrating that his lengthy sentence would have a deterrent effect on others; (2) the district court on remand failed to meaningfully consider the corrected guideline range; (3) the district court\u2019s act of resentencing Scott to the same prison term does not promote respect for the law because it sends the message that a successful appeal \u201cis a meaningless endeavor\u201d; and (4) the district court failed to consider Scott\u2019s \u201ctraumatic\u201d personal history and compared Scott to non-offenders rather than to similarly-situated defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">Scott also asserts that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because: (1) the large deviation from the guideline range was not supported by compelling circumstances as the threats against the judge were largely preposterous and were the product of his \u201cdisturbed mind\u201d; (2) specific deterrence of Scott would be better provided through mental health services; and (3) we have reversed below-guideline sentences where the variance was similar to the one in this case and should attempt to have \u201ceven-handed standards of reasonableness\u201d for upward and downward variances.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">We review the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). Our review for reasonableness is deferential. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006). Unreasonableness may be procedural, such as occurs when the procedure the district court used does not meet the requirements found in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), or it may be substantive in nature. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006). After <em>Booker, </em>a district court, in determining a reasonable sentence, must consider the correctly calculated advisory guideline range and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2006). After correctly calculating the advisory guideline range, the district court may impose a more severe or lenient sentence, so long as the resulting sentence is reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">In reviewing a sentence for reasonableness, we consider the factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a) and the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing a particular sentence. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1360-61 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3040, 168 L.Ed.2d 755 (2007). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense, (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>training or medical care; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the sentencing guidelines range; (5) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; (7) and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7). \u201c[T]here is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose[,]\u201d and the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Here, the sentence imposed by the district court was procedurally reasonable. At the initial sentence hearing, the district court discussed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at great length, and it incorporated that analysis during the sentence hearing following remand. At the second sentence hearing, the district court also considered the correct guidelines range of 37 to 46 months, as well as the advisory nature of the guidelines. Additionally, the court acknowledged Scott\u2019s disadvantaged and troublesome upbringing, but found that his \u201cviolent past behavior\u201d and inability to begin \u201cthe process of disengaging <em>from </em>his previously learned inappropriate social behavior\u201d weighed in favor of the statutory maximum sentence. Moreover, the court stated that the sentence was appropriate given the extremely serious nature of the offense and the need to protect the public from Scott. Further, the district court noted that the sentence would deter others from committing similar crimes. The district court was not required, as Scott argues, to cite authority for the proposition that lengthy sentences deter criminal conduct; it is enough that deterrence is one of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B). Finally, the district court observed that Scott should be able to obtain the substance abuse treatment and mental health care that he requires while serving his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">The district court\u2019s decision to impose the same sentence on remand does not, as Scott suggests, send the message that a successful appeal \u201cis a meaningless endeavor.\u201d At the outset of the second sentence hearing, the district court acknowledged the correct guidelines range and then proceeded with its discussion of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Furthermore, we explicitly allowed for the imposition of the same sentence after remand in our prior published decision in this case. <em>See Scott, </em>441 F.3d at 1330 (\u201cIn vacating the sentence and remanding for a new sentence proceeding, we do not mean to imply that the district court on remand cannot reach the same sentence as it did before, provided that it corrects the one error identified in this opinion.\u201d). Indeed, we also noted \u201cthat if it had wished to do so the district court could have stated that it would reach the same sentence regardless of how the disputed [guidelines] issue was decided. A statement like that would have convinced us the error was harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Williams, </em>431 F.3d 767, 775 (11th Cir.2005) (Carnes, J., concurring)); <em>see also United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1348-49 (11th Cir.2006) (inviting district courts to indicate that they would reach the same sentence even if a guidelines calculation were incorrect if the court conducts an appropriate analysis of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and noting such sentences would be upheld if on review, the sentence is reasonable). Because the district court carefully considered the correct advisory guideline range and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in reaching its decision, the sentence is procedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">The 120-month sentence is also substantively reasonable. Scott\u2019s offense was particularly serious. He threatened to kill a federal judge and suggested that he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>employ explosives to accomplish the task. He also threatened to kidnap the Judge\u2019s children and included a suspicious substance with the threatening letter. These threats cannot be dismissed as \u201cjailhouse banter\u201d or merely the inconsequential product of a disturbed mind. They were specific, and when questioned by federal agents Scott did not disavow the threats. Instead, he gave a cryptic response to the agents\u2019 questions and smiled at them.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Scott\u2019s argument that future criminal conduct by him would be better prevented by treatment than incarceration is unpersuasive. It is not an \u201ceither or\u201d proposition. As the district court noted during the sentence hearing, the Bureau of Prisons should provide treatment options to address his substance abuse problem and mental health issues. Scott can avail himself of these services during the 120-month period of incarceration and afterward while on supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Finally, Scott\u2019s argument that we have reversed as unreasonable the imposition of below-guidelines sentences with variances smaller than the upward variance in this case misses the point of individualized sentences. At each sentence proceeding, the district court must analyze the \u00a7 3553(a) factors with regard to a defendant\u2019s own characteristics and the specific crime involved. Neither <em>Booker </em>nor any other decision require that we compare the variance in this case to variances in cases involving different crimes and defendants with different characteristics. The aim of the sentencing guidelines is to produce consistency across sentences for similar crimes committed by defendants with similar characteristics. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 254, 125 S.Ct. 738 (observing that \u201cthe sentencing statute\u2019s basic aim [is] ensuring similar sentences for those who have committed similar crimes in similar ways\u201d). That we have reversed other sentences for dissimilar crimes committed by dissimilar defendants is of no moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
