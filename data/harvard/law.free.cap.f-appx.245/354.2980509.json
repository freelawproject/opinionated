De La Pena-Juarez, </em>214 F.3d 594, 601 (5th Cir.2000) (when a written sentence and oral pronouncement conflict, the oral pronouncement generally governs, but \u201cit is the district court\u2019s intention that ultimately determines the final judgment\u201d). The district court was statutorily mandated to impose a specific term of release for each count. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)\u00ae, (b)(l)(B)(ii)(II). There was an ambiguity between the oral and written judgments; therefore, the district court was authorized under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36 to correct what was either \u201ca clerical error in [the] judgment, ... or ... an error in the record arising from oversight or omission\u201d. Fed.R.Crim.P. 36; <em>see De La Penar-Juarez, </em>214 F.3d at 601. Accordingly, the amended judgment merely modified the existing, original sentence, which Molina challenged under \u00a7 2255 in 1997. Therefore, his 2005 \u00a7 2255 motion was successive.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED; MOTION TO EXPAND THE GRANT OF A CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b377-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
