Sayles\u2019 Rev. Stats., arts. 1869-1888; Withers v. Patterson, 27 Texas, 500; Holman v. Klatt, 9 Texas Ct. Rep., 280.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-6\">The court erred in admitting in evidence the deed of John M. Taylor as administrator, to Elizabeth Taylor, because:</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-7\">.First. Said deed recited no order of confirmation of the sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-8\">Second. The record of the administration negatived any jurisdiction in the Probate Court, it affirmatively appearing that the administration was not taken out for or on account of any debts (the only debt being <em>$3.00), </em>shown by the exhibit made \u201cof the condition of the estate,\u201d and for a final settlement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-9\">Third. The report of the commissioners to divide the estate suggesting that the tracts could not be divided fairly by a division in kind, was a contradiction on its face, and on its face untrue, and failed to give a sufficient legal reason for their recommendation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-10\">Fourth. The record showed names and residences of the heirs of the estate (one being a married woman residing in Liberty County, to wit: Miley Rye, and one a minor, H. B. Mitchell) and negatived service or notice to them of the proceeding to sell the land because it could not be divided. And because one of the distributees of the estate, Elizabeth Taylor, the widow, bid less than the commissioners appraised the land at by over 50 percent. Rev. Stats., arts. 1888, 1852, 1853, 2171, 2172, 2173, 2195; Withers v. Patterson, 27 Texas, 492; Holman v. Klatt, 9 Texas Ct. Rep., 280; McNally v. Haynes, 59 Texas, 586; Rock v.

Boring, 44 Texas, 243; cites <em>3 </em>Met., 405.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-11\">The administration on this estate for the purpose of partition of the property among the heirs of Murfrey Taylor, consisting of $3,000 of notes and accounts, six tracts of land (over 2,500 acres), personal miscellaneous property valued at $734, is void. Miley Rye (her heir) and Mitchell, a minor at the time, can attack same in this suit. Rev. Stats., art. 3606; Holman v. Klatt, 9 Texas Ct. Rep., 280; Wardlow v. Miller, 69 Texas, 395; Steven v.

Patterson, 27 Texas, 500.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-5\">The administrator\u2019s \u201cwritten application\u201d for the appointment of commissioners to partition the real estate did not invoke the jurisdiction of the Probate Court, had the administration been voidable only. Rev. Stats., art. 2157; Rev. Stats., arts. 2144, 2147; Rev. Stats., arts. 2158, 2159, 2160, 2162; Stegall v. Huff, 54 Texas, 197.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-6\">The sale to Eliz. Taylor of all the lands was without legal authority. Rev.

Hanrich, 70 Texas, 731.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-8\">The attempted partition of the estate, by eliminating the personalty and not requiring the advancement brought into hotchpotch, by the heirs, &lt;and giving the commissioners the chance to equalize the shares without recommending the sale of the real estate, as it was in this case, separately considered, rendered the whole partition nugatory, and sale of the land void. Rev. Stats., arts, 2144, 2147.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-9\">Greers, <em>Nall &amp; Neblett </em>and Taliaferro, <em>Nall &amp; Dies, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfD\">The trial court did not err in holding that the Probate Court of Hardin County acquired jurisdiction over the estate of Murfrey Taylor. Lynch v. Baxter, 4 Texas, 437; Storer v. Lane, 1 Texas Civ. App., 250; Rindge v. Oliphint, 62 Texas, 682; Poor v. Boyce, 12 Texas, 440; Lewis v. Ames, 44 Texas, 336; Martin v. Robinson, 67 Texas, 382; Giddings v. Steel, 28 Texas, 750; Baker v. DeZavalia, 1 Posey, 638; Bartlett v. Cocke, 15 Texas, 478.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-10\">The court did not err in admitting in evidence the deed from the administrator of the estate of Murfrey Taylor to Elizabeth Taylor, conveying the lands in controversy; first, because the deed was made upon an order of court directing the sale of the land and after the confirmation of the sale; and second, because if there was no technical confirmation the records show that the sale was reported and the administrator directed to pay over the money to the parties entitled to the same and that appellants had been paid their share of the money arising from the sale of the land, and the purchaser was entitled to a confirmation of the sale and the deed was sufficient in a collateral proceeding to defeat appellants\u2019 recovery. Moody v. Butler, 63 Texas, 210; Poor v. Boyce, 12 Texas, 446; Simmons v. Blanchard, 46 Texas, 266; Neill v. Cody, 26 Texas, 290; Calloway v. Nichols, 47 Texas, 327; West v. Keeton, 42 S. W. Rep., 1034; Rindge v. Oliphint, 62 Texas, 687.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-11\">The partition proceeding in the estate of Murfrey Taylor, deceased, in which the property in controversy was ordered sold, was sold, paid for and the money distributed and paid over to appellants and the other heirs, is good as against a collateral attack and sufficient to preclude appellants from recovery. Heath v. Layne, 62 Texas, 687; Perry v. Blakey, 23 S. W. Rep., 804; Lyne v. Sanford, 82 Texas, 63; Moore <em>v. </em>Blagge, 91 Texas, 159.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The Probate Court of Hardin County had jurisdiction over the estate of Murfrey Taylor. This appears sufficiently upon this collateral proceeding and it was not necessary that appellees should have shown appointment of the administrator and his qualification. It was sufficient to show the order of court directing the property sold upon the report of the commissioners that it could not be divided, the report of the sale and the administrator\u2019s deed. Rindge v. Oliphint, 62 Texas, 687; McAnally v. Haynie, 59 Texas, 586; Moore v. Blagge, 91 Texas, 159; Poor v. Boyce, 12 Texas, 440; Rev. Stats., 2170, 2171, 2175.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-3\">The partition proceedings in the estate of Murfrey Taylor, together with the administrator\u2019s deed, were sufficient to pass the title of Murfrey Taylor to the purchaser and are not subject to collateral attack. Moore v. Blagge, 91 Texas, 159; Rindge v. Oliphint, 62 Texas, 682; Rev. Stats., arts. 2170, 2171, 2175.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-4\">The court did not err in instructing a verdict for the defendant, appellee here, first, because the administration proceedings under which the property was sold after partition, and the deed executed to Eliza-* beth Taylor were sufficient to pass the title of Murfrey Taylor into Mrs. Taylor and this title by mesne conveyance passed down to and vested in the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-5\">Second, the court did not err in instructing a verdict for the defendant, because the' evidence shows that appellee is an innocent purchaser for a valuable consideration without notice of the deed from Harper to Moore, under the heirs of E. B. Harper. Moore v. Blagge, 91 Texas, 159; Moody v. Butler, 63 Texas, 210; Simmons v. Blanchard, 46 Texas, 266; Taylor v. Harrison, 47 Texas, 454.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b216-6\">JAMES, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"ApW\">This is an action to try title. Miley Rye and H. B. Mitchell, under whom the plaintiffs claim, were two of the seven persons entitled to the estate of Murfrey Taylor who died in 1881. Plaintiffs sue for two-sevenths of the Champion Choate survey in Hardin County alleged to contain 553% acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">An administration was granted on his estate to John M. Taylor, administrator, and inventory filed on September 23, 1881, embracing this tract and other tracts and certain personalty, the tract in question being appraised at $275. A sale of personal property was reported and approved July 5, 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">We may state at this place, that on August 6, 1886, the court house of Hardin County was burned. All the papers concerning this estate are missing except the administrator\u2019s report, hereinafter mentioned, which was filed in 1898. Ho probate docket, if any there was, prior to the one which commenced in 1885, is found.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">On September 17, 1883, the following order appears:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">\u201cEstate of M.

This report stated that all debts had been paid and that it was presented for approval as his account for final settlement. It set forth the remaining property real and personal giving the value of each item, the names and residences of the persons entitled to an equal share of the estate, describing H. Bell Mitchell as \u201cH. Bell Mitchell, A. H. Mitchell, guardian,\u201d and omitting the widow to whom, it appears from the report, property had been set aside. On February 4, 1884, the county judge marked or endorsed this report \u201cExamined and approved February 4, 1884,\u201d and ordered it to be recorded, which was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">On May 5, 1884, two of the above named commissioners filed the following report which was recorded May 5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">\u201cThis day, May the 5th, 1884, come into open court, S.

Mitchell, for Bell Mitchell, the sum of $301.46 with receipt thereof, which report was examined and approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-19\">Defendant, among other things, claims that it holds from and under Mrs. Elizabeth Taylor all the land, but it is not deemed necessary to-investigate this, for if the administrator\u2019s deed be sustained, plaintiffs would be without any title and could not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-20\">The above, in substance, forms the undisputed testimony. The court charged the jury that the evidence established the fact that whatever title Murfrev Taylor had to the land passed out of his estate by the administrator\u2019s deed to Elizabeth Taylor and that therefore plaintiffs had no interest in the land and directed them to find for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-21\">The following are substantially the reasons assigned of error in the instruction:</p>\n<p id=\"b221-22\">\u201c1. The record of the administration shows affirmatively that there were no debts owing by decedent to warrant an administration, hence the Probate Court of Hardin County acquired no jurisdiction.\u201d Appel-, .lant admits the existence of one debt. It was not discharged by the heirs to prevent an administration. That it was of small amount can make no difference. The maxim <em>de minimis non curat lex </em>can not be utilized to defeat jurisdiction'.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number><em>\u201c2. </em>The report of the commissioners to divide the estate suggesting that the tracts could not be divided fairly by a division in kind was a contradiction on. its face, and on its face untrue and failed to give a sufficient legal reason for their recommendation.\u201d The court having approved and acted upon said report, it was a judicial act which should have been appealed from or questioned directly if unsatisfactory to the heirs. The court had power to order the sale upon the report, and it is to be presumed that it considered the matter and arrived at the same conclusion as the commissioners, and if this act was erroneous it can not be revised in this collateral manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">\u201c3. The record shows names and residences of the heirs of the estate (one being a married woman residing in Liberty County, to wit, Miley Bye and one a minor, H. B. Mitchell) and negatived servic'd or notice to them of the proceeding to sell the land because it could not be divided. And because one of the distributees of the estate bid less than the commissioners appraised the land at by over 50 percent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The point last made is of no force. Mrs. Taylor was not awarded the land under article 2178, Sayles\u2019 Bevised Statutes. The limitation as to the price at which land may be taken by an heir under said article has no application to a purchaser at a sale. The only restriction upon a sale is that it requires confirmation by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Articles 2155 and 2156, Sayles\u2019 Bevised Statutes, requires in applications for partition and distribution that citation be issued and served personally on each person entitled to a share. What was intended to be, and what was acted upon as, an application for partition, was sworn to by the administrator before the clerk on January 15, 1884, and presumably filed on that day, but was not acted upon until February 4, 1884. The heirs were residents of Texas in Hardin and adjoining counties. That service of citation may have been had upon them in the meantime is presumable. The papers are gone, the docket, which the law required to be kept and which should be presumed to have been kept, is gone, in fact there is room for the presumption that service of citation was had personally on them, even the minor, H. Bell Mitchell, and on collateral attack such presumption must be indulged. The fact that no guardian <em>ad litem </em>appears to have been appointed for the minor (who at that time was without a guardian) does not render the proceeding void. (Montgomery v. Carlton, 56 Texas, 361; Laughter v. Seela, 59 Texas, 177.) The action of the court was had at the February term, and personal service may have been had to that term. But if it were a case of premature judgment, it would not be void. (Davis v. Robinson, 70 Texas, 397; Tobar v. Losano, 6 Texas Civ. App., 689.) The statute does not require notice to the heirs of the proceeding to sell the land because it had been reported not capable of division.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\u201c4. The administrator\u2019s \u2018written application\u2019 for the appointment of commissioners to partition the real estate did not invoke the jurisdiction of the Probate Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">An inspection of the instrument which this proposition refers to will show that it conforms substantially to the requirements of such an application. (Art. 2154, Sayles\u2019 Rev. Stats.) We are at a loss to comprehend from appellant\u2019s brief, precisely what the point is their counsel seeks to make in connection with the above proposition. Beference is probably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>intended to the order of September 17, 1883, appointing commissioners. If so, the subsequent proceedings supplement that order, as will be explained under the next head.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\">\"5. The sale to Elizabeth Taylor was without legal authority, because the exhibit to- accompany the application for partition was filed January 15, 1884. The commissioners were appointed September 17, 1883, without notice. The commissioners reported May 5, 1884, valuing the tracts of land at $2,610; valuing the Choate at $250.. This Choate tract was bid in by Mrs. Taylor at $110. The Jasper land, valued at $1,361, bid in at $748\u2014all the lands went to Mrs. Taylor for $1,375. The commissioners reported these tracts not susceptible of partition, which on its face was a false report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">This mixes and presents various propositions. It may be that when the court entered an order appointing commissioners of partition on September 17, no application had been filed calling for it. But one was field later on January 15, 1884, as already referred to. There appears no order at that time appointing these commissioners, and it may be the court let the -matter proceed upon the appointment that had been previously entered. This would not be fundamentally wrong. But when we refer to the order which the court made acting upon the report of the commissioners, we find it recited therein that they were appointed at the February term of the court, 1884, which was the term at which the court acted upon the administrator\u2019s application. Thus the minutes indicate the appointment as made at the proper time. The report of the commissioners shows the same. A docket entry of such order would have been sufficient. (West v. Keeton, 42 S. W. Rep., 1034; Calloway v. Nichols, 47 Texas, 327.) All the other matters suggested in the above proposition have been discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\"><em>\u201c6. </em>The attempted partition of the estate by eliminating the personalty and not requiring the advancements to be brought into hotchpotch by the heirs, and giving the commissioners a chance to equalize the shares without recommending the sale of the real estate as it was in this case separately considered, rendered the whole partition nugatory and the sale of the land void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">It appears from the report contained in the application that the administrator had about $1,394.83 and a few insignificant articles, besides the lands. A proper observance of the statute would have required an order for the commissioners to divide all the property remaining, instead of the real estate only. It seems to us, however, that had the commission included the personalty, the result would have been the same considering the reason given for not being able to make a fair and equal division of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">The statute was intended to confer upon the Probate Court general jurisdiction over the subject of partition of estates, and an order of that court within the scope of such jurisdiction can not be declared void, simply because the procedure prescribed has not been strictly followed. Such matters are susceptible of being waived by the parties interested. Suppose all the heirs had been <em>sui juris </em>and had desired a partition of the lands through commissioners, choosing to divide the funds on hand without the aid of commissioners, and the court had so ordered, it would hardly be questioned that such proceeding would be sustained under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>these circumstances even on an appeal. If, therefore, it was a matter in its nature subject to the consent or waiver of the parties, a judgment of the court in reference to it can not be treated as void. (Murchison v. White, 54 Texas, 78.) Such judgment may be erroneous, but it can not be reviewed or set aside in a collateral proceeding. This being so it seems hardly necessary to advert to the fact that all of the heirs of Murfrey Taylor who were of age, including Miley Rye, accepted from the administrator the proceeds from the sale to Mrs. Taylor, as did also the plaintiff, A. H. Mitchell, who is the heir of H. Bell Mitchell and formerly acted as guardian of- the estate of said H. Bell Mitchell, and as such guardian received for his ward a share of the proceeds from the administrator. We may also state that the record shows that Miley Rye died in 1886, and that H. Bell Mitchell died about four years prior to the trial of this cause at the age of about twenty-four years, and no direct proceeding was ever brought to question the administration proceeding under article 332, Sayles\u2019 Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">It can not be claimed on the face of the probate proceedings in evidence that the sale to Mrs. Taylor was not confirmed by the court. The order of November 3, 1885, and that at the August term, 1886, evidence the court\u2019s approval of the sale. It was not \"essential to the title that the administrator\u2019s deed should recite the order of confirmation. The confirmation could be shown otherwise. This was not an ordinary sale of land, which the statute requires to be confirmed. The statute in connection with the. sale to effect partition does not provide for its confirmation, but it is no doubt contemplated that the sale in such a case should be subject to the approval of the court. The subsequent orders in evidence afford unmistakable evidence that this sale met with the court\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">We are of opinion that the administrator\u2019s deed should be held valid in this proceeding, and therefore we sustain the court in charging the jury to return a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Appellees insist that the verdict is right upon another aspect of the evidence, which involves the claim that defendant is entitled to the land as an innocent purchaser of the title which existed prior to its acquisition by Murfrey Taylor. We had not considered the briefs on this branch of the case, because not necessary. But we may say that we think the fact of innocent purchaser, if it had been material, would have been one that could not have been taken from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
