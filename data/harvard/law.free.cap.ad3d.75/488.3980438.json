Green Constr Corp., </em>100 AD2d 509 [1984]); and it is further,</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Ordered that the judgment is affirmed; and it is further,</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Ordered that one bill of costs is awarded to the defendant JMS Architect &amp; Planner, EC.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">On an appeal from a judgment entered after a nonjury trial, this Court \u201cmay render the judgment it finds warranted by the facts, taking into account in a close case \u2018the fact that the trial judge had the advantage of seeing the witnesses\u2019 \u201d <em>(Northern Westchester Professional Park Assoc. v Town of Bedford, </em>60 NY2d 492, 499 [1983], quoting <em>York Mtge. Corp. v Clotar Constr. Corp., </em>254 NY 128, 134 [1930]). At a nonjury trial, evaluating the credibility of the witnesses is a matter committed to the discretion of the trial court <em>(see McCaffrey v McCaffrey, </em>69 AD3d 585 [2010]; <em>Wasserman v Wasserman, </em>66 AD3d 880 [2009]).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The plaintiffs contention that it established the requisite elements for recovery on a theory of an account stated is without merit. An account stated represents an agreement between the parties reflecting an amount due on a prior transaction <em>(see M &amp; A Constr. Corp. v McTague, </em>21 AD3d 610 [2005]; <em>Jim-Mar Corp. v Aquatic Constr., </em>195 AD2d 868, 869 [1993]). An essential element of an account stated is an agreement with respect to the amount of the balance due <em>(see Interman Indus. Prods. v R. S. M. Electron Power, </em>37 NY2d 151, 153-154 [1975]; <em>Erdman Anthony &amp; Assoc. v Barkstrom, </em>298 AD2d 981 [2002]). The determination of the trial court that there was no agreement with respect to the balance due is supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The plaintiffs contentions regarding relief in quantum meruit are not properly before this Court. The record reflects that the plaintiff made a calculated decision to forgo this relief in the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">The parties\u2019 remaining contentions either are without merit or need not be addressed in light of our determination. Covello, J.E, Angiolillo, Dickerson and Sgroi, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
