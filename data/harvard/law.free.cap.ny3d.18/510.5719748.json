IV Dismissing Mirvish\u2019s claim to ownership on grounds of untimeliness or failure of delivery makes for good public policy.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b576-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b576-6\">Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Jacques Lipchitz, the Russian-born cubist sculptor, died in 1973 at the age of 81. He was survived by his wife, Yulia H. Lipchitz, who inherited many valuable works of art from her husband, including \u201cThe Cry,\u201d a 1,100-pound bronze sculpture, cast three of seven, 1928-1929. After she was widowed, Yulia began a relationship with Biond Fury as early as 1980; the two of them lived together for 17 years prior to her death on July 20, 2003 at the age of 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">From time to time, Yulia would make gifts to Fury, including art created by her late husband. She memorialized these gifts by giving Fury a picture of the artwork with a writing describing the piece and declaring that it was a gift. After Yulia\u2019s death, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Fury produced a photograph of \u201cThe Cry\u201d with the following notation on the back, in Yulia\u2019s handwriting: \u201cI gave this sculpture \u2018The Cry\u2019 to my good friend Biond Fury in appreciation for all he did for me during my long illness. With love and my warm wishes for a Happy Future, Yulia Lipchitz October 2, 1997, New York.\u201d At the time, \u201cThe Cry\u201d was apparently in storage in New York in the custody of the Marlborough Gallery, Inc. (Marlborough), the Manhattan art dealer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">About a year later, the French minister of culture and communication approached Pierre Levai, Marlborough\u2019s president, to ask about the possibility of placing \u201cThe Cry\u201d on exhibit in Paris for a period of five years, \u201cwith a view to its ultimately being purchased.\u201d The minister proposed to include \u201cThe Cry\u201d in a group of modern and contemporary works to be installed in the Tuileries Gardens near the Louvre Museum. On November 11, 1998, Levai wrote the minister that he had discussed the French government\u2019s request \u201cwith the Lipchitz family,\u201d who agreed to loan the sculpture for three years, unless Yulia died earlier. At the conclusion of the loan, Levai continued, the family was \u201cprepared to negotiate a sale of the work,\u201d but if \u201c[a]t the conclusion of the loan, . . . the sculpture [was] not purchased, it [was] to be returned to the Lipchitz family in New York at the borrower\u2019s cost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Levai discussed the loan of \u201cThe Cry\u201d to the French government only with Mott, never with Yulia. Mott, who at the time did not know about the handwritten gift instrument conveying \u201cThe Cry\u201d to Fury, is the executor and a residuary beneficiary of one third of his mother\u2019s estate. He is an attorney, and he handled Yulia\u2019s financial affairs and held power of attorney from her for many years prior to her death. Mott also performed legal work for Marlborough, beginning as early as 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">According to Mott, he talked to his mother about the loan and, on her behalf, \u201cconsented that [\u2018The Cry\u2019] should be put on display in the [Tuileries Gardens] in Paris and it was and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>had [Yulia\u2019s] name on the loan.\u201d The French government at some point also inquired if, once the exhibition was over, Yulia was willing to make a gift of \u201cThe Cry.\u201d Mott testified that Yulia told him \u201cNo, of course not, but if they want to buy it, they can buy it\u201d\u2014i.e., that \u201cwe would [give] ... a right of first refusal.\u201d \u201cThe Cry\u201d was in Paris, subject to this agreement, when Yulia died. Her will did not mention \u201cThe Cry\u201d or any other specific work of art. Fury claims not to have known that the sculpture was loaned to the French government in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">On March 9, 2004, Fury\u2019s attorney sent a letter to Mott\u2019s attorney demanding immediate delivery of \u201cThe Cry\u201d to Fury; he enclosed a copy of the deed of gift. Fury\u2019s attorney sent a second letter on September 30, 2004, noting that there had been no response to \u201c[the] March 9, 2004 demand to deliver \u2018[T]he Cry\u2019 to Mr. Fury.\u201d Then on January 12, 2005, Fury\u2019s attorney wrote yet again, complaining that he had \u201cnot received any response to [his] repeated written demands for delivery of \u2018The Cry\u2019 which was indisputably gifted to Mr. Fury by Yulia Lipchitz\u201d; renewing the demand; and warning that \u201c[f] allure to deliver [the sculpture would] require commencement of a proceeding under SCPA 2105.\u201d This provision authorizes a person with a claim to property or the proceeds thereof alleged to be in a fiduciary\u2019s possession or control to petition Surrogate\u2019s Court for an order requiring the fiduciary to show cause why he should not deliver the property or proceeds <em>(see </em>SCPA 2105 [1]). Upon return of process, the surrogate must \u201cdetermine the respective interests of the parties in the property or the proceeds or value thereof and make a decree accordingly\u201d (SCPA 2105 [3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Mott claims to have sold \u201cThe Cry\u201d and three other sculptures in a package deal in July 2004 to Marlborough International Fine Art Establishment (Marlborough International) for $1 million. He testified that he did this because these four works had been on consignment for a very long time,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the estate needed the cash; moreover, he \u201cdid not believe that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>any merit to [Fury\u2019s] claim.\u201d But in a letter to the French minister dated January 10, 2005, six months <em>after </em>the purported sale of \u201cThe Cry\u201d to Marlborough International, Mott informed the minister that Yulia had passed away in 2003; noted that \u201cthe agreement for the loan also provided that at its conclusion the Lipchitz family would be prepared to negotiate a sale of the Sculpture\u201d; and inquired \u201c[o]n behalf of the family . . . whether the Ministry [had] any interest in acquiring the Sculpture at this time before arrangements are made for its return.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">On September 15, 2005, Fury sold his interest in \u201cThe Cry\u201d to David Mirvish, an art collector and gallery owner in Toronto, for $220,000. On October 4, 2005, Mirvish\u2019s attorney notified Mott of the sale, and demanded that he let Mirvish know where the sculpture was and \u201callow [him] to take possession of it within 10 days of [the] letter\u201d; and \u201c[p]ending resolution of this matter, . . . make no sale or other transfer of the sculpture nor remove it from its present location.\u201d In a letter dated October 14, 2005, the estate\u2019s attorney refused this demand, asserting that \u201cthe Estate was the true owner of [\u2018The Cry\u2019], which was never subject of a valid inter vivos gift from [Yulia] to Biond Fury\u201d; on October 20, 2005, he additionally informed Mirvish\u2019s attorney that the sculpture \u201chad been on consignment to a gallery for many years and was sold over a year ago.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">By petition dated October 26, 2005, Mott, as the executor of Yulia\u2019s estate, brought an action against Fury, asking Surrogate\u2019s Court for a determination pursuant to SCPA 209 (4) that the estate \u201cwas the rightful owner of, and . . . legitimately sold and passed title of the Cry.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 209 (4) empowers Surrogate\u2019s Court \u201c[t]o determine a decedent\u2019s interest in any property claimed to ... be property available for distribution under [the] will. . ., and to determine the rights of any persons claiming an interest therein, as against the decedent, or as between themselves, and to construe any instruments made by [decedent] affecting such property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Mirvish subsequently commenced this action in Surrogate\u2019s Court against Mott, individually and as executor of Yulia\u2019s estate, by petition dated July 31, 2006. He asserted various causes of action against Mott, the estate or both; specifically, he alleged conversion; sought to impose a constructive trust on proceeds from the sale of \u201cThe Cry\u201d received by the estate; asked for an order pursuant to SCPA 2105 compelling delivery of the property or the proceeds from its sale; alleged replevin; and demanded an order pursuant to SCPA 2102<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> disclosing the sculpture\u2019s whereabouts. In September 2006, Mott filed an answer that raised a statute of limitations defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Upon Mirvish\u2019s application, Surrogate\u2019s Court issued an order dated September 12, 2007 directing Mott to hold in escrow the $1 million that he \u201creceived on his alleged sale of The Cry, pending resolution of the conflicting claims of ownership\u201d (2007 NY Misc LEXIS 7111, *8 [Sur Ct, NY County 2007]). The surrogate noted \u201cthat on one hand [Mott] claim[ed] to have sold The Cry in 2004, while on the other hand he subsequently corresponded with the French government presenting himself as still having control over the statue\u201d <em>(id. </em>at *3-4). She concluded that equitable relief was warranted in view of these \u201cdiscrepancies in [Mott\u2019s] assertions regarding his control over, and ownership of[ ] The Cry, coupled with his obvious willingness to ignore claims which he on his own determined to be invalid without first seeking judicial determination\u201d <em>(id. </em>at *5).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">By letter dated September 19, 2007, Mirvish\u2019s attorney notified Surrogate\u2019s Court that his client had filed suit in Supreme Court in June 2007 against Marlborough and Marlborough International for \u201camong other things, conversion relating to the July 2004 sale of <em>The Cry </em>by Hanno Mott, on behalf of the Estate, to Marlborough International, and the subsequent transfer of <em>The Cry </em>to Switzerland in 2006.\u201d He informed the surrogate that this lawsuit had been settled almost immediately, on August 23, 2007, and \u201c[p]ursuant to the settlement, the July 2004 sale was rescinded and <em>The Cry . . . </em>returned to New York [where it was] being held in escrow pending [her] determination of the ownership issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Mott, as executor of Yulia\u2019s estate, joined the settlement agreement, thereby agreeing to be bound by paragraphs 4 and 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>through 16 inclusive (with one exception not relevant here).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Notably, paragraph 4.b of the agreement states that the escrow agent shall hold \u201cThe Cry\u201d and a disclaimer of interest in the sculpture executed by Marlborough and Marlborough International \u201cuntil such time as it receives (i) joint instruction from Mirvish and Hanno Mott . . . , or (ii) <em>a final non-appealable judgment of a New York State Court determining ownership of the Sculpture, </em>whereupon the Sculpture and disclaimer of interest shall be delivered pursuant to such joint instruction or judgment\u201d (emphasis added). Paragraph 7 describes the Surrogate\u2019s Court proceeding as \u201clitigation over title\u201d to \u201cThe Cry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ApN\">Subsequent to the settlement, the parties skirmished by letter and motion practice over the release of the $1 million held in escrow. At a court conference on September 4, 2008 and by letter dated the same day, though, Mirvish\u2019s attorney confirmed to the surrogate that his client had \u201cwithdrawn his claims for conversion and replevin in order to simplify the issues before the Court,\u201d and, as a result, was \u201calso withdrawing his objection to Mr. Mott\u2019s motion to vacate the temporary restraining order requiring [him] to keep $1 million in escrow and restraining him from selling <em>The Cry.\u201d </em>By September 2008, of course, \u201cThe Cry\u201d had been returned from Switzerland to New York and was in the custody of the agreed-upon escrow agent. By order dated October 3, 2008, Surrogate\u2019s Court vacated its prior order directing Mott to escrow $1 million, pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulation consenting to the release of these monies.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">At the time the settlement agreement was reached in August 2007, Mott\u2019s motion and Mirvish\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment in this action, filed the previous June and July, respectively, were pending. Mott argued in his motion that Mirvish\u2019s claim was untimely, and he could not prove all elements of a gift. Mirvish countered Mott\u2019s motion and contended in his cross motion that Yulia made a valid gift of \u201cThe Cry\u201d to Fury; Mott\u2019s refusal to turn over \u201cThe Cry\u201d and the estate\u2019s sale of the sculpture in 2004 were acts of conversion; and Mirvish, as Fury\u2019s assignee, was the true owner of \u201cThe Cry.\u201d By order dated December 30, 2008, Surrogate\u2019s Court granted Mirvish\u2019s cross motion and denied Mott\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The surrogate concluded that Yulia had made a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>inter vivos gift of \u201cThe Cry\u201d to Fury. She observed that the wording of the deed of gift was \u201cin the past tense, Le., T gave this sculpture \u201cThe Cry\u201d to my good friend Biond Fury,\u2019 \u201d which was not only \u201cindicative of an antecedent transfer,\u201d but also \u201cclearly identified] the intended object and [was] consistent with [Yulia\u2019s] long pattern of making gifts of similar items to her companion.\u201d Mott appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The Appellate Division reversed the surrogate\u2019s decree; granted Mott\u2019s motion for summary judgment to the extent of declaring Mirvish\u2019s claims of ownership of \u201cThe Cry\u201d and his claims for damages barred by the statute of limitations; and denied Mirvish\u2019s cross motion (75 AD3d 269 [1st Dept 2010]). The court observed that constructive delivery of a \u201cmonumental work of art such as <em>The </em>Cry\u201d would be \u201cappropriate\u201d; however \u201cFury\u2019s testimony [was] the only evidence of the decedent\u2019s delivery of the gift instrument to him,\u201d and his testimony was \u201cinadmissible under CPLR 4519 [the Dead Man\u2019s Statute] because Fury [was] the person from whom [Mirvish] derive [d] his interest\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 272). As a result, the Appellate Division concluded that it was error for the surrogate to grant Mirvish\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment <em>(id.). </em>The court then granted Mott\u2019s motion for summary judgment \u201cto the extent of declaring that [Mirvish\u2019s] claim of ownership of <em>The Cry </em>and his claims for damages [were] barred by the statute of limitations\u201d because \u201cThe Cry\u201d was converted no later than 1998 when loaned to the French government <em>(id. </em>at 276). We granted Mirvish leave to appeal, and now reverse (16 NY3d 705 [2011]).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The principles of law that control the outcome of this appeal are a good deal less complicated than the history of the dispute, as is the application of those principles to the facts. In <em>Gruen v Gruen </em>(68 NY2d 48 [1986]), we held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">\u201c[f]irst, to make a valid inter vivos gift there must exist the intent on the part of the donor to make a present transfer; delivery of the gift, either actual or constructive to the donee; and acceptance by the donee. Second, the proponent of a gift has the burden of proving each of these elements by clear and convincing evidence\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 53 [citations omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Belatedly, mere possession of a gift after the donor\u2019s death creates a presumption of delivery to the donee during the donor\u2019s lifetime. In <em>Sofsky v Rosenberg </em>(76 NY2d 927 [1990]), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>for example, we affirmed summary judgment in favor of the defendant grantee because his \u201cpossession of the deed create [d] a presumption that the deceased grantor had delivered the deed to him before her death\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 930). The plaintiff, the grantor\u2019s spouse, speculated that the deed was placed, at some unspecified time, in either an office safety box or a safety-deposit box at a bank, and that the defendant grantee had clandestinely and fraudulently removed the deed from one of those locations either while the grantor was seriously ill, or after she died. We concluded that these \u201cunsupported, conclusory allegations that the deed had not been delivered\u201d were insufficient to overcome the presumption and raise a triable issue of fact <em>(id. </em>at 930).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Here, Yulia\u2019s intent to make a present transfer of \u201cThe Cry\u201d was clear on the face of the gift instrument, as the surrogate concluded. There is no suggestion Yulia was coerced; there is no question about her capacity. Nor is there any dispute that Fury accepted the gift. Moreover, the Dead Man\u2019s Statute creates no impediment to reliance on the presumption of delivery created by Fury\u2019s possession of the gift instrument, which was specifically addressed to him, after Yulia\u2019s death. Put another way, Mott has not raised a triable issue of fact so as to overcome the presumption of delivery; Mirvish has established each of the elements of a valid inter vivos gift\u2014intent, delivery and acceptance\u2014by clear and convincing evidence. Both Mott, as executor of Yulia\u2019s estate, and Mirvish filed petitions asking the surrogate to resolve the conflicting claims of ownership of \u201cThe Cry,\u201d and she correctly ruled in Mirvish\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Further, even assuming that the statute of limitations for Mirvish\u2019s conversion and replevin claims has lapsed, the estate cannot as a result secure possession of or title to the sculpture.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mott, on behalf of the estate, acknowledged and agreed in the settlement agreement that Surrogate\u2019s Court would decide the ownership of \u201cThe Cry\u201d <em>on the merits-, </em>indeed, this is the relief he sought in his petition pursuant to SCPA 209 (4), where he asked the surrogate to determine that the estate \u201cwas the rightful owner of, and . . . legitimately sold and passed title of the Cry.\u201d And under the settlement agreement, the estate cannot secure possession of \u201cThe Cry\u201d without a final judicial determination of ownership in its favor. But here, the surrogate rightly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>concluded that Yulia made a valid inter vivos gift of \u201cThe Cry\u201d to Fury, who sold his interest in the sculpture to Mirvish. So if the escrow agent cannot deliver \u201cThe Cry\u201d to Mirvish because of the expiration of the statute of limitations, even though Mirvish has been adjudicated the sculpture\u2019s true owner, \u201cThe Cry\u201d would be condemned to languish in escrow in perpetuity. This is surely not what the parties intended when they entered into the settlement agreement, which called for the return of \u201cThe Cry\u201d from Switzerland to New York, to be held in escrow awaiting delivery to the party\u2014either the estate or Mirvish\u2014 finally adjudicated the sculpture\u2019s owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the order of Surrogate\u2019s Court reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\">. Marlborough\u2019s records show that \u201cThe Cry\u201d was \u201cpicked up\u201d from the Lipchitz studio in Hastings-on-Hudson on July 9, 1997 for transport to the Marlborough warehouse. Fury, on the other hand, testified that, to the best of his recollection, in the late 1990s \u201cThe Cry\u201d was moved from the Lipchitz studio to the Michael Leonard warehouse in New York, which is where he believed it to be located at the time Yulia made the gift of it to him; and that sometime later Hanno Mott, Yulia\u2019s son from her first marriage, arranged for \u201cThe Cry\u201d to be transported elsewhere. Although Fury did not know for sure, he \u201cassume[d]\u201d that \u201cThe Cry\u201d was delivered to the Marlborough warehouse after it was removed from the Michael Leonard warehouse at Mott\u2019s direction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\">. The record is not clear as to whether \u201cThe Cry\u201d was entrusted to Marlborough for sale as well as storage. Mott testified that in March 2004, when he first became aware of Fury\u2019s claim of ownership, \u201cThe Cry\u201d \u201chad been on consignment and was continuing on consignment\u201d with Marlborough although \u201cthere was no written consignment agreement,\u201d simply \u201ca receipt that the work was received on consignment.\u201d For his part, Levai first declared that \u201c[t]o the best of [his] knowledge,\u201d Mott in 1997 asked him \u201cto keep [\u2018The Cry\u2019] for him, to keep it with some other sculptures in order to help him in storage\u201d; and that he \u201creally [didn\u2019t] remember\u201d if \u201cThe Cry\u201d was consigned to Marlborough. He later testified that \u201cto the best of [his] knowledge,\u201d there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>was no consignment agreement for \u201cThe Cry\u201d; that Marlborough customarily memorialized consignments in a writing; that \u201cThe Cry\u201d was not, in fact, consigned to Marlborough; and that Marlborough was never \u201casked to attempt to sell\u201d the sculpture apart from the discussions with the French government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b579-9\">. Ownership of \u201cThe Cry\u201d was not the only bone of contention between Mott and Fury. The petition, among other things, also asked the surrogate to determine that the estate was the rightful owner of two other works of art that Fury claimed Yulia gave him as gifts. One of these was alleged to have subsequently been sold to Mirvish\u2019s art gallery, which was therefore named as a respondent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b580-8\">. SCPA 2102 authorizes a proceeding in Surrogate\u2019s Court to require a fiduciary \u201c[t]o supply information concerning the assets or affairs of an estate relevant to the interest of the petitioner when the fiduciary has failed after request made upon him in writing therefor\u201d (SCPA 2102 [1]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b581-6\">. Indeed, the obligations of Mirvish, Marlborough and Marlborough International under the settlement agreement were contingent upon Mott\u2019s execution of the joinder by August 31, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b583-7\">. In light of our disposition of this appeal, we need not and do not express any opinion as to whether Mirvish\u2019s conversion and replevin claims accrued no later than 1998, as Mott contends and the Appellate Division agreed, or in 2004, as Mirvish urges.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
