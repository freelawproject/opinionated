II. This Court should remit the proceeding to Supreme Court to resolve the question of fact regarding the nature of the licensees\u2019 addresses. <em>(Matter of Hanig v State of N.Y.

The present appeal is not purely a question of law and as such, is not within the scope of review of the New York State Court of Appeals under CPLR 5601 (a). <em>(Simon v Electrospace Corp., </em>28 NY2d 136; <em>Matter of Kelly, </em>285 NY 139; <em>Suria v Shiffman, </em>67 NY2d 87; <em>Matter of Wilson v McGlinchey, </em>2 NY3d 375; <em>Matter of Jaclyn P, </em>86 NY2d 875; <em>Matter of Hime Y., </em>54 NY2d 282; <em>Cohen v Hallmark Cards, </em>45 NY2d 493; <em>Heary Bros.

Disclosure of the veterinarian and veterinary technicians licensees\u2019 registered street addresses does not constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy as the agency did not meet its burden of proof to show that the requested information falls within an exemption to the Freedom of Information Law. <em>(Matter of Capital Newspapers Div. of Hearst Corp. v Burns, </em>67 NY2d 562; <em>Matter of Fink v Lefkowitz, </em>47 NY2d 567; <em>Matter of Carnevale v City of Albany, </em>68 AD3d 1290; <em>Matter of New York Times Co. v City of N.Y.

The Appellate Division was correct in holding the agency did not meet its burden of proof and ordering the disclosure of the addresses requested by the Schenectady County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Inc. <em>(Matter of Data Tree, LLC v Romaine, </em>9 NY3d 454; <em>Matter of Hanig v State of N.Y. Dept. of Motor Vehs., </em>79 NY2d 106.) IV Disclosure of the requested addresses, even if residential in nature, would comport with the precedent in this state set by state laws and the Appellate Division. <em>(Matter of Carnevale v City of Albany, </em>68 AD3d 1290; <em>Matter of Buffalo News v Buffalo Mun. Hous. Auth., </em>163 AD2d 830; <em>Cornell Univ. v City of N.Y. Police Dept., </em>153 AD2d 515, 75 NY2d 707; <em>Matter of New York Teachers Pension Assn. v Teachers\u2019 Retirement Sys. of City of N.Y., </em>71 AD2d 250.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b109-4\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">We hold that an agency responding to a demand under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) may not withhold a record solely because some of the information in that record may be exempt from disclosure. Where it can do so without unreasonable difficulty, the agency must redact the record to take out the exempt information.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Petitioner sent an e-mail to the Education Department, asking for the names and addresses of veterinarians and veterinary technicians licensed by the Department in Schenectady County. The Department replied that it would provide a list of names, and the city and state portions of the addresses, but would not provide street addresses because \u201c[i]t is not public information for us to provide home addresses for a licensed professional and thats [szc] what we have on file.\u201d Petitioner responded: \u201cWhat about business address?,\u201d and the Department replied: \u201cNo[t] everyone has provided us with a business address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Petitioner then formally requested the list of names and addresses under FOIL. The Department again offered to provide names and cities, but repeated its refusal to provide street addresses, explaining: \u201cAs our computerized files are currently configured, we are unable to distinguish a licensee\u2019s business address from a residential address.\u201d After an unsuccessful administrative appeal, petitioner began this proceeding to require that the list be produced. Petitioner specifically sought only \u201ca photocopy of the requested list with names of licensed professionals and their business addresses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Supreme Court dismissed the petition. The Appellate Division reversed, with two Justices dissenting, and granted the petition <em>(Matter of Schenectady County Socy. for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Inc. v Mills, </em>74 AD3d 1417 [3d Dept 2010]). The Department appeals as of right, pursuant to CPLR 5601 (a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">The Department argues that disclosure of licensees\u2019 home addresses \u201cwould constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d and so is not required by FOIL (Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 [2] [b]; \u00a7 89 [2], [2-a]). But we do not need to address this claim, because petitioner is not seeking home addresses, only business addresses, and the Department makes no claim that the business addresses are private.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">It seems obvious to us that, if the Department does not want to supply home addresses, it should simply delete them from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>the list. It says that its computer database does not distinguish between home and business addresses, but it does not claim that it would be hard to find out, by communicating with the licensees, which addresses are homes and which are businesses. This should not be a burdensome task, because the number of licensed veterinarians and veterinary technicians in Schenectady County is unlikely to be very large; it was represented at oral argument that the number is 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">It is true that FOIL generally does not require an agency to create a new record (Public Officers Law \u00a7 89 [3] [a] [\u201cNothing in this article shall be construed to require any entity to prepare any record not possessed or maintained by such entity\u201d with specified exceptions]). But there is a difference between creating a new record and redacting an existing one. Courts deciding FOIL issues often order redaction when a record contains both exempt and nonexempt information <em>(e.g. Matter of Data Tree, LLC v Romaine, </em>9 NY3d 454, 464 [2007] [noting that \u201ceven when a document subject to FOIL contains . . . private, protected information, agencies may be required to prepare a redacted version with the exempt material removed\u201d (citing Public Officers Law \u00a7 89 [2] [c] [i])]; <em>Matter of New York Times Co. v City of N.Y. Fire Dept., 4 </em>NY3d 477, 482-483 [2005]; <em>Matter of Scott, Sardano &amp; Pomeranz v Records Access Officer of City of Syracuse, </em>65 NY2d 294 [1985]). In responding to petitioner\u2019s FOIL request, the Department had the choice of producing the existing record in full or removing the information that it did not want to produce and that petitioner did not demand. It cannot refuse to produce the whole record simply because some of it may be exempt from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">We are at a loss to understand why this case has been litigated. It seems that an agency sensitive to its FOIL obligations could have furnished petitioner a redacted list with a few hours\u2019 effort, and at negligible cost. Instead, lawyers for both sides have submitted briefs and argued the case in three courts, demanding the attention of 13 judges, generating four judicial opinions and resulting in a delay in disclosure of almost four years. It is our hope that the Department, and other agencies of government, will generally comply with their FOIL obligations in a more efficient way.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
