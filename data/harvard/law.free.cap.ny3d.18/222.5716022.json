Moreover, the claim is without merit.

The evidence adduced at trial established that defendant, who did not own the building, engaged in a scheme to profit from its illegal sale. Defendant gained control of the property by means of a forged and fraudulently notarized deed. He then contracted to sell it to a third party for $300,000. Pursuant to a clause in the sales contract, the property was to be delivered \u201cvacant and free of leases or tenancies.\u201d To that end, defendant, on two occasions, paid others to set fires in the building to drive the tenants out. Defendant was convicted, upon a jury verdict, of three counts of arson in the first degree, one count relating to a fire set on May 25, 2004 (expectation of pecuniary profit), and the other two counts relating to a fire set on May 30, 2004 (expectation of pecuniary profit and use of an incendiary device).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">On appeal, defendant argued that the prosecutor repeatedly violated the trial court\u2019s <em>Molineux </em>rulings <em>(see People v Molineux, </em>168 NY 264 [1901] [for <em>Molineux </em>rule]; <em>People v Allweiss, </em>48 NY2d 40, 46-48 [1979] [for summary of principles related to <em>Molineux </em>rule]) by eliciting evidence of an uncharged arson attempt and of his prior bad acts and associations\u2014the elicited testimony linked defendant to violence, guns, the Nation of Islam, and a violent motorcycle gang. In defendant\u2019s view, the prosecutor\u2019s repeated violations of the court\u2019s <em>Molineux </em>rulings cumulatively denied him the right to a fair trial <em>(see People v Calabria, </em>94 NY2d 519, 522 [2000]).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Defendant further argued that the elicited expert testimony concerning the origins of the fires was inadmissible under <em>People v Grutz </em>(212 NY 72, 82 [1914] [\u201cThe physical facts\u201d of an arson are always \u201cso simple that they can be readily understood when properly described, and it is then for the jury to draw the appropriate conclusion,\u201d without guidance of expert opinion]) and <em>People v Narrod </em>(23 AD3d 1061, 1062 [4th Dept 2005] [it was error to allow an \u201carson investigator to testify that he had ruled out accidental causes of the fire\u201d]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to defendant, the experts\u2019 improper testimony invaded the jury\u2019s province and denied him the right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The Appellate Division affirmed the convictions, stating that any error concerning the contested testimony was harmless (74 AD3d 995, 995 [2d Dept 2010]). A Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Although, as the People concede, certain questions asked by the prosecutor at trial clearly violated the trial court\u2019s <em>Molineux </em>rulings, the contested testimony elicited, on the whole, was not significant. That is, if defendant was prejudiced at all, such prejudice was minimal. Each time after defendant moved for a mistrial based on an alleged violation of the court\u2019s <em>Molineux </em>rulings, the trial court, in its discretion, considered the arguments of the parties, concluded that what happened did not rise to the level of a mistrial and, in certain instances, provided further instruction to counsel to refrain from making statements regarding improper topics. For example, at the conclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, defendant moved for a mistrial, arguing, inter alia, that the prosecutor\u2019s references to the Nation of Islam and Muslims were intended to inflame and prejudice the jury. After ruling that a mistrial was not warranted, the court told the prosecutor to \u201cstay focused\u201d and to avoid the appearance of stereotyping certain individuals just because they are members of the Nation of Islam and/or Muslims.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The trial court also took steps to minimize the impact of arguably improper testimony or prosecutorial statements during the trial. For example, after the prosecutor made conclusory statements of fact during his opening statement, the court sustained defense counsel\u2019s objection and reminded the jurors in no uncertain terms that \u201cwhat counsel says is not evidence in the case. Rather, you may consider the opening statement as a preview or an outline of what counsel believes the evidence will prove in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>In any event, to the extent any evidence subject to the trial court\u2019s <em>Molineux </em>rulings was improperly admitted, such error was harmless <em>(see People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230, 240-242 [1975]). The evidence against defendant, from his own taped admissions, and testimony of the individual who set the first fire at defendant\u2019s behest, overwhelmingly established defendant\u2019s guilt of the crimes charged. Further, there was no reasonable possibility or significant probability that the improper questions and elicited references to defendant\u2019s bad acts and negative associations affected the jury\u2019s verdict, or that the absence of such errors would have led to an acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Defendant\u2019s second argument\u2014that the expert testimony, ruling out accidental and natural causes of the fires and concluding that one of the fires was intentionally set, invaded the jury\u2019s province\u2014is equally unavailing. At the outset, we consider the rule set forth in <em>Grutz </em>prohibiting expert testimony concerning whether a fire was intentionally set. This prohibition occurs as dictum in an opinion written in 1914\u2014at a time when fire investigations involved far less technical expertise than they do today. Nevertheless <em>Grutz </em>is still frequently cited for the proposition that an expert may not invade the province of the jury by testifying that a fire was intentionally set<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or that the facts are \u201cconsistent\u201d with an intentionally set fire.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It has continued to be cited even after Appellate Division panels have held that an arson expert may testify to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that, based on the expert\u2019s investigations, all possible natural and accidental causes of the fire had been eliminated<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\u2014 thus eliminating all but intentional causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The result is that the law in New York is at once confusing and anomalous. As the Connecticut Supreme Court has recently noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">\u201cthe rule, followed by the courts of New York and Virginia, that precludes an expert witness from giving an opinion about the ultimate issue in arson cases, namely, whether the fire was intentionally set</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>... is a distinct minority position that stands in stark contrast to the \u2018modern trend,\u2019 which is \u2018to abolish the ultimate issue prohibition\u2019 \u201d <em>(State v Beavers, </em>290 Conn 386, 417 n 27, 963 A2d 966, 977 n 27 [2009], quoting 1 Paul C. Giannelli and Edward J. Imwinkelried, Scientific Evidence \u00a7 5.07, at 321 [4th ed 2007], and citing cases).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">We now put the <em>Grutz </em>proposition to rest. New York has a well-established body of case law concerning the admissibility and limits of expert testimony, that should be brought to bear in deciding what an arson expert may tell the jury in a particular case. \u201cThe guiding principle is that expert opinion is proper when it would help to clarify an issue calling for professional or technical knowledge, possessed by the expert and beyond the ken of the typical juror\u201d (De <em>Long v County of Erie, </em>60 NY2d 296, 307 [1983] [citations omitted]; <em>see People v Taylor, </em>75 NY2d 277, 288 [1990] [same]). Moreover, this principle applies to testimony regarding both \u201cthe ultimate questions and those of lesser significance\u201d <em>(People v Cronin, </em>60 NY2d 430, 432-433 [1983]).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Although, in deciding whether expert testimony is admissible, courts must determine whether \u201cthe potential value of the evidence is outweighed by the possibility of undue prejudice to the defendant or interference with the province of the jury\u201d <em>(People v Bennett, </em>79 NY2d 464, 473 [1992]), \u201ccourts should be wary not to exclude such testimony merely because, to some degree, it invades the jury\u2019s province\u201d <em>(People v Lee, </em>96 NY2d 157, 162 [2001]). \u201cExpert opinion testimony is used in partial substitution for the jury\u2019s otherwise exclusive province which is to draw \u2018conclusions from the facts.\u2019 It is a kind of authorized encroachment in that respect\u201d <em>(People v Jones, </em>73 NY2d 427, 430-431 [1989] [citation omitted], quoting <em>Cronin, </em>60 NY2d at 432). Obviously, expert testimony would not generally be admissible in a case where the fire\u2019s cause is not in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Here, because the evidence adduced at trial conclusively established, apart from the expert testimony, that the subject fires were intentionally set, it can be argued that the admission of expert testimony was largely unnecessary. In any event, any error was harmless, because the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was overwhelming and there was no significant probability that the jury would have acquitted defendant without the expert testimony <em>(see Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d at 240-242).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Grapfeo, Read, Smith and Pigott concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-7\">. With respect to the first fire, a battalion chief testified that \u201cit appeared a flammable liquid had been put on the stairs and lit on fire\u201d and \u201c[tjhere was no other apparent cause for the fire.\u201d The chief further testified that the second fire was \u201csuspicious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The fire marshal who investigated the first fire testified that the \u201cpour pattern\u201d indicated that a flammable liquid had run from one step down to the next and been ignited.
