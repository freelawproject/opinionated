St. Ohio, \u00a7' 3185, requires a subcontractor, in order to be entitled to a mechanic\u2019s lien, to file an affidavit, which shall contain an \u201citemized statement\u201d showing the value and amount of labor done or materials furnished, and also \u201ca copy of the contract if it is in writing.\u201d An affidavit filed thereunder contained a copy of a contract by which the claimant agreed to furnish, to be used in a building, for a lump price, \u201ccertain described scenery, stage work, fixtures, and properties,\u201d \u201cas set forth in detail in a certain specification, which is marked \u2018A,\u2019 attached to, and is hereby made a part of, this contract.\u201d The affidavit also stated that it'contained an itemized statement of account, marked \u201cExhibit A.\u201d But a single paper marked \u201cExhibit A\u201d was filed, which was in the form of an account including a large number of items of stage scenery, ptc., but with no price attached to such items. <em>Held, </em>that under the liberal construction to be given to the statute, in accordance with the rule of the supreme court of the state, such exhibit might fairly be considered as constituting both the specification of the contract and the itemized statement of account, and that the affidavit was sufficient to entitle the claimant to a lien, in the absence of any evidence showing that it did not truthfully and intelligibly describe both the items contracted for and those furnished.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b840-8\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Ohio.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b840-9\">This is another subcontract lien claim, heard with the cases just disposed of by the opinion just filed under the style of \u201cGreat Southern Fireproof Hotel Company against Benjamin F. Jones et al.\u201d See 116 Fed. 793. The appellants claimed a lien for certain stage scenery, fixtures, and stage properties furnished and used to equip the stage of the opera house included in the building erected for the appellee company. The lien was denied upon the ground that the contract, a copy of which is set out in the recorded affidavit of lien, refers to certain specifications as part of the contract, which specifications were omitted from the affidavit made to secure the- statutory lien. The affidavit sets out, among other things, that \u201cthe account hereto attached and marked \u2018Exhibit A,\u2019 and made a part hereof, is a true and correct statement of the labor performed and the materials furnished by Sosman &amp; Landis to W. J. McClain, contractor for the building and erection of the Great Southern Fireproof Hotel and Opera House, together with the amount and values of said labor and material and times of furnishing said materials and doing said work.\u201d Recorded as a part of said affidavit, and made a part thereof, is what purports to be a copy of the contract referred to, by which the appellants bound themselves to supply to said McClain \u201ccertain described scenery, stage work, fixtures, and properties, as set forth in detail in a certain specification which is marked \u2018Exhibit A,\u2019 attached to, and is hereby made a part of, this contract.\u201d For the said articles the said McClain agreed to pay the lumping or entire price of $7,100 in three installments, as set out in the agreement. It is further averred that \u201cthe said materials were furnished and said labor performed in accordance with the terms\u201d of the contract above referred to. Filed with this affidavit, and recorded as 'part thereof, is a statement- styled \u201cExhibit A,\u201d and being the only exhibit of any kind attached to or recorded as part of said affidavit. This statement is in the following form: \u201cW. J. McClain, General Contractor, Columbus, Ohio. Original. Bought of Sosman &amp; Landis.\u201d Then follow some 200 items of scenery, stage work, and properties, of which a few are set out below as \u2022 illustrations of the whole: \u201c1 act drop curtain; 1 variance border; 2 tor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>mentor wings; 1 light fancy chamber set consisting of 1 center door piece, 2 set doors, 2 jog pieces, 1 center arch, 2 side arches, 3 borders,\u2014all framed; 1 ancient street drop, 26x42 ft.; 1 rocky pass drop, 26x42 ft.; 2 rocky pass wing flippers, 3x20 ft; 1 conservatory backing; 1 garden balustrade in four pieces framed; 1 bay window framed; 2 garden stumps; 4 pieces paper mache statuary,\u201d etc. None of the items are priced.

St. The affidavit filed shows that the work performed and materials supplied, for which a lien on the property of the hotel company is claimed, was done at the instance of W. J. McClain, the principal contractor under a contract with the hotel company, and that the labor performed and materials supplied by appellants was in virtue of a contract in writing between affiants and said principal contractor. Included in the affidavit is a copy of said contract, and that copy discloses the fact that Sosman &amp; Landis were to furnish said McClain, for use in the building being erected by him for the hotel company, \u201ccertain described-scenery, stage work, fixtures, and properties,\u201d for an entire price, payable in installments as the contract was carried out. The copy of the contract so set out and made part of said affidavit also recites that the said \u201cscenery, stage work, fixtures, and properties\u201d to be furnished for the said entire price are \u201cas set forth in detail in a certain specification which is marked \u2018A,\u2019 attached to, and is hereby made a part of, this contract.\u201d It is plain that, in order to know what certain \u201cscenery, stage work,\u201d etc., was to be furnished by Sosman &amp; Landis for the lumping price set down in the contract, it is necessary to see the specifications referred to, and that without them the contract is incomplete. But appellants say the specifications were filed and recorded and constitute the Exhibit A found on record and file marked \u201cExhibit A\u201d according to the description of the specifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>tions contained in the copy of the contract. That paper has been already, in substance, set out. It is the only exhibit filed and recorded, while the affidavit refers to two documents, \"and makes each a part thereof as \u201cExhibit A.\u201d According to the affidavit, \u201can itemized statement\u201d of account is filed as \u201cExhibit A,\u201d and the specifications of the contract are also filed as \u201cExhibit A.\u201d Was this single document used both as the specifications under the contract and as a statement of account, or were there two distinct documents, only one of which is filed? In favor of the contention that the document filed is not the \u201cspecification\u201d called for as part of the contract is the fact that in form it is an account, and from its form and dates and footings would appear to have been made up after the completion of the contract, and intended as the \u201citemized statement,\u201d also required to be included as part of the affidavit. Upon the other hand, there is the circumstance that, while two documents are stated to be filed and made part of the affidavit, one being called \u201cthe account hereto attached, and marked \u2018Exhibit <em>A,\u2019 </em>and made a part thereof,\u201d while the pther is styled \u201ca- certain specification which is marked \u2018Exhibit <em>A,\u2019 </em>attached to and made a part of this contract,\u201d only one document was in fact filed and recorded, and that one document is marked \u201cExhibit A,\u201d and in that particular answers for either one of the annexed papers made part of the affidavit. Again, it may fairly be said that the internal evidence afforded by an inspection of the document indicates that 'it may quite as well constitute the \u201ccertain specification marked \u2018Exhibit A,\u2019 \u201d and made part of the contract, as \u201cthe account hereto attached and marked \u2018Exhibit A.\u2019 \u201d In view of the fact that Sosman &amp; Landis were to furnish certain \u201cscenery, stage work, fixtures, and properties for an entire price,\u201d it is difficult to see how a more detailed description should be necessary to an understanding of the contract by those experienced in details of stage furnishings than is afforded by the descriptive items contained in the document filed. In the absence of any evidence that any other or, different specifications ever existed, and of any evidence tending to show that the description found in the filed document is not intelligent, we are quite inclined to believe that one document was made to serve as both an account and specification, and that the specification originally part of the contract as an annexed paper has simply been made to serve the purpose also \"of an itemized statement by the addition of dates and footings, etc., and that this one document is the Exhibit A twice referred to and called for. The provision of the statute in respect to filing an account, and also the provision for filing a copy of any written contract when the materials have been furnished under such a contract, are substantially brought forward from the former mechanic\u2019s lien statutes of 1843 ancl 1853. The seventh section under each of the acts referred to was the section which pointed out what the person claiming the lien must do in order to secure the lien. In Thomas v. Huesman, 10 Ohio St. 152, the Ohio supreme court, after pointing out the equitable purposes of the statute, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-4\">\u201cLooking thus at the object of the statute, and perceiving it to be one of an equitable character and beneficent tendency, section 7 being directory of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>the mode of securing the object of the statute, the same ought to be liberally construed, for the furtherance and attainment of such object.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">The notice which it was the purpose of section 3185, Bates\u2019 Ann. St., to secure, was notice to the owner and others interested of the labor done and materials furnished for which the lien was claimed, and the value thereof, and of the contract under which they were furnished. The affidavit filed and recorded, including the document filed as \u201cExhibit A,\u201d fulfill every purpose of the statute by giving to the owner notice of the items of \u201cscenery, stage work, fixtures, and properties\u201d which Sosman &amp; Eandis had agreed to supply for a lumping sum, and which they in fact averred had been supplied according to the agreement. The items in account are sufficiently descriptive to serve as specifications, and were probably intended to serve both as specifications and an account when filed. To have twice copied the same list of items would have served no useful purpose. We are the more content to place this construction upon the document filed as \u201cExhibit A,\u201d because the answer made no such objection, and put the defense wholly upon different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Just before the final hearing, leave'to file an amended answer presenting this objection was denied. This was in the reasonable discretion of the court below, and under the circumstances was not unreasonably denied. The defect, if it be one, was apparent, and should have been earlier presented, and an opportunity thus afforded for correction or explanation, if possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The decree will be reversed, and the cases remanded, with direction to render a decree for the appellants according to the prayer of the bill.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
