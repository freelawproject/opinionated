J. Emmins, G. W. Sonnefield, and K. W. Ab-right, citizens of Texas, against James A. Blanchard, plaintiff in error here, a citizen of Louisiana. The suit is to collect the last payment on a contract to build a house. Plaintiffs averred that they had erected the.house and completed it as required by the contract, and that it had been accepted, and is now occupied by the defendant and his tenants. The defendant answered, admitting the contract, and denying that the plaintiffs had completed the house pursuant to the contract and the specifications. The defendant designated a number of particulars in which the building was defective, and in which plaintiffs failed to comply with the specifications, and concluded by averring that by the failure of the plaintiffs to construct the building according to their contract the defendant has been damaged in the sum of $5,000, which amount is due him, \u201cand for which sums he prays judgment in reconvention.\u201d The case was tried on those issues.

Under the law of Louisiana, a suit may be maintained upon a building contract, although the work be defective or unfinished; and the remedy of the defendant in such case is for reduction of the price agreed upon, to the extent of damages sustained by reason of the defective performance. Cairy v. Randolph, 6 La. Ann. 202; McClure v. King, 15 La. Ann. 220. In such case the defendant may reconvene for damages sustained by the contractor\u2019s failure to comply with his agreement. Hill v. Penny, 15 La. Ann. 212; Civ. Code La. art. 2769. By the' terms of the contract, the contractors were to be paid in five different payments,\u2014four as the work progressed. The fifth payment (the one involved in this suit) was to be made 15 days after the building and works are all completed, delivered, and accepted by Blanchard; \u201csaid payment to be made on the certificate of Bridges &amp; Snyder, architects; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>said certificate to be final and conclusive that the work done warranted said payments.\u201d In the second section of the contract the contractors agreed that they would do the work in strict accordance with the plans and specifications, and deliver the same to Blanchard, clean and \u201cin good condition and complete, on or before the first day of November, 1901.\u2019\u2019 Section 4 provided for an insurance policy on the property, to be procured by the contractors, and concludes with these words, \u201cIt being understood that the works shall be at our risk until accepted by you or your assigns as a whole.\u201d Tins idea is repeated in the specifications, made part of the contract, wherein the contractors agree to properly protect their work during its progress, and \u201cto repair any damage to their work, and deliver the building broom clean and in perfect repair.\u201d Construing the contract as a whole, it requires the contractors to deliver the building completed according to the specifications and in perfect repair. The contract, we think, clearly shows that Blanchard was not required to receive the house in a defective condition; that it was to be delivered in good condition, completed according to the specifications. Such being the contract, Blanchard having interposed a plea that the plaintiffs had failed to construct the building according to their contract and the plans and specifications, and claiming to have been damaged by such failure in the sum of $5,000, it seems to us clear that he should have been permitted to offer proof tending to sustain his plea. It appears from the record that he offered to show by several witnesses the defective character of the building after- it had been completed and tendered to him, and that this evidence was objected to on the part of the plaintiffs as to any work done prior to October 4th, when the last payment was made, for the reason that the defendant had paid the architects\u2019 estimate tendered him on October-4th. This objection was sustained by the court, and Blanchard excepted, and this ruling is assigned as error. If it be conceded\u2014a question which- we do- not decide\u2014that the certificate of the architects was conclusive as to the condition of the work at the time the payment was made on October 4th, that would not be sufficient to exclude the evidence, for by the terms of the contract the work as a whole must be in good condition when Blanchard is called on to accept it. The record does not show that the certificate calling for the fifth and last payment was ever issued by the architects. The fifth payment was to be made on that certificate 15 days after the building and works are all complete, delivered and accepted by Blanchard. The certificate authorizing the fifth payment is the only one which was to relate to the condition of the building at the time it was to be delivered and accepted. The evidence offered and rejected tended to show that the contractors had not completed the house according to the contract, and that they did not deliver it to Blanchard completed and in perfect repair. It was admissible on the issues raised by Blanchard\u2019s general denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 petition, and also to support his reconvention. We think the circuit court erred in refusing to receive the evidence offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The judgment of the circuit court is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
