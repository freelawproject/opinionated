The application for registration, filed January 25, 1950, under Sec. 2(f) of the Trade-Mark Act of July 5, 1946, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052 (f), alleged September 6, 1941 as the date of first use of the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-22\">The examiner denied registration on the stated ground that since the trademark, other than appellant\u2019s corporate name, True Temper, which is included as part of the mark in one of the specimens shown in the accompanying drawings, is generically descriptive of the goods to which the mark is attached, and merely simulates the action of a crippled shad, the mark is incapable of distinguishing appellant\u2019s goods from the goods of other dealers in fish bait.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-23\">In affirming the action of the examiner, the commissioner properly observed that whether the term \u201cCrippled Shad\u201d indicates a lure simulating a crippled shad, or a lure for catching shad, appellant is not authored under the law to appropriate these \u2022 words exclusively to its own use, inasmuch as \u201ccrippled\u201d is merely descriptive of functional features of the lure and \u201cshad\u201d is nowise capable of exclusive appropriation by appellant or anyone else in the fish lure field, cit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>ing James Heddon\u2019s Sons v. Millsite Steel &amp; Wire Works, 6 Cir., 128 F.2d 6, Id., D.C., 35 F.Supp. 169. See also Bailey Meter Co. v. Watson Comr. P\u00e1ts., 101 U.S.P.Q. 278. The commissioner further and explicitly held that the combination made up of the words \u201cCrippled Shad,\u201d which appellant seeks to register, is not a registrable term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">Inherent in appellant\u2019s position is the acknowledgment that it is the custom of fishermen to fish with live bait consisting of crippled shad or crippled minnows. Upon that basis appellant, among other things, argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVH\">* * * It should be recalled that Appellant\u2019s goods are \u201cartificial\u201d fish lures, that these have never been alive; that these can never be maimed; that these can never be crippled. Since live baits can not become \u201ccrippled\u201d in the ordinary sense of the word, it seems fantastic to say that the artificial product can be. It seems better to say that this is a \u201cfloating surface bait with wounded minnow action.\u201d It would not be normal to say \u201ccrippled bait.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">It is further contended that since appellant is requesting registration under Section 2(f) of the Act of 1946, its affidavit should be accepted here and should have been accepted by the tribunals of the Patent Office as \u201cprima facie evidence that the mark has become distinctive\u201d under Section 2(e) of the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-8\">* * * This provides that marks which may be merely descriptive (Section 2(e) of the Act) may be registered upon proof of substantially exclusive and continuous use thereof as a mark by the applicant in commerce for the five years next preceding the date of filing of the application for its- registration. This proof is submitted in the language of the Statement [statute], verified by affidavit of an officer of the appellant company, wherein it is stated \u201cThe mark is claimed to have become distinctive of the applicant\u2019s goods in commerce which may lawfully be regulated by Congress through substantially exclusive and continuous use thereof as a mark by the applicant in commerce among the several states for the five years next preceding the date of the filing of this application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">The Solicitor for the Patent Office concedes that Section 2(f) of the Act of 1946 authorizes \u201cthe registration of marks which are, to some extent, descriptive.\u201d Under the Act of 1905 descriptive or geographic words which had acquired a secondary meaning in the public mind were recognized as registrable by the Supreme Court. Baglin v. Cusenier Co., 221 U.S. 580, 591, 31 S.Ct. 669, 55 L.Ed. 863. In such a situation, as that court later pointed out, the applicant for the registration of a descriptive word or combination is obliged to \u201cshow more than a subordinate meaning which applies to it. It [the applicant] must show that the primary significance of the term in the minds of the consuming public is not the product but the producer.\u201d Kellogg Co. v. Nat. Biscuit Co., 305 U.S. 111, 118, 59 S.Ct. 109, 113, 83 L.Ed. 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">Another recent decision by the Supreme Court regarding the scope and the significance of the Act of 1946 reiterated the doctrine that the Act and its \u201csweeping reach into \u2018all commerce which may be regulated by Congress\u2019 does not constrict prior law or deprive courts of jurisdiction previously exercised.\u201d Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., 344 U.S. 280, 287, 73 S.Ct. 252, 256, 97 L.Ed. 252. See also Burgess Battery Co. v. Marzall, Com\u2019r Pats., 92 U.S.P.Q. 90, affirmed 96 U.S.P.Q. 293. Our court in a case published in its latest reports observed, however, that while the burden of proof for distinctiveness should rest upon tbe applicant for registration, Congress set up no standard by which the \u201cdistinctiveness\u201d of his mark was to be determined by the Patent Office and by the Courts, other than to suggest that substantially exclusive and continuous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>use of a mark in commerce for the 5 years immediately preceding application for registration could be considered as prima facie proof that it had become distinctive. In re Hollywood Brands, Inc., 214 F.2d 139, 41 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">This court has further held that affidavits relied upon to establish proof of \u201cdistinctiveness\u201d may or may not reflect the views of the purchasing public; that a combination of descriptive words used, as in the case at bar, as a mere adjunct to applicant\u2019s trade name are not registrable in any case where the combination is of such a character as to be incapable of becoming a trade-mark or of distinguishing the applicant\u2019s goods.

DuPont De Nemours &amp; Co., 154 F.2d 143, 33 C.C.P.A., Patents, 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">For the reasons hereinbefore stated, the decision appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
