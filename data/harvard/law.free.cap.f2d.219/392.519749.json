HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b440-19\">Judge Galston\u2019s opinion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has stated the facts in such detail that it will be unnecessary for us to repeat them; in what we say we shall assume an acquaintance with it. He found that the defendant infringed the claims in suit, but that they were invalid, because the specifications only disclosed a variant from the prior art that would not support a patent. Since we agree with his second conclusion, we do not find it necessary to decide the first. The plaintiff stakes the invention upon the fact that none of -the earlier disclosures sh\u00f3wed the element that the water, as it passed through the holes, \u201c20,\u201d in the \u201cperforated disk, 18,\u201d remained in the form of jets until it struck upon the \u201ctapered plug, 28.\u201d Instead of this the jets had always been fused into a single body of water in the annular space, substantially triangular in cross section, whose top is the \u201cdisk, 18,\" whose side is the cylindrical \u201cskirt, 22,\u201d and whose bottom is the sloping wall of the \u201cplug, 28\u201d : i. e., the \u201cchamber.\u201d In the patent in suit on the other hand air is sucked through the annular opening between the lower edge of the \u201cskirt, 22,\u201d and that of the \u201cplug, 28,\u201d and the water begins to be aerated within the \u201cchamber\u201d both before and after the jets strike the sides of the \u201cplug, 28.\u201d Obviously, if the \u201cchamber\u201d is always full of water, no aeration can take place in it; and whether the \u201cchamber\u201d will fill up depends upon whether water flows out in greater velocity than it flows in. That in turn depends upon whether the combined area of the holes, \u201c20,\u201d in the \u201cdisk, 18\u201d is less than the area of the annular opening between the \u201cskirt, 22\u201d and the lower edge of the \u201cplug, 28.\u201d Only when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>that is true, will the water form in jets in the \u201cchamber\u201d and remain so until it strikes the \u201cplug, 28\u201d. This, the plaintiff urges, is not only a new, but a valuable, improvement in \u201caerators\u201d of the kind involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">The claims do assume that there will be jets within the \u201cchamber,\u201d and that as jets they will \u201cimpinge\u201d upon the \u201cplug, 28\u201d; and the plaintiff\u2019s expert swore that it was within the compass of the ordinary craftsman to know how to keep the \u201cchamber\u201d from filling by regulating the relation of the two areas, as we have mentioned. The specifications are not, indeed, as plain a disclosure as one could wish of this feature of the invention. All that appears is that, \u201cwhen water is flowing through the pipes 10 and 14, and through the perforations 20 in the disk 18, an aspirating effect is produced whereby air is drawn in through the slots 24 and mixed with the water.\u201d So far it is consistent with the disclosure that aeration will not commence till the water emerges from the \u201cchamber.\u201d (Col. 2, lines 43-48). This language is immediately followed, however, by these words: \u201cThis aspirating and mixing effect is enhanced by a tapered plug, 28,\u201d and that presupposes that the process begins in the \u201cchamber.\u201d However, although the specifications are not too clear, we do not find it necessary to hold that the disclosure as a whole is not \u201cfull, clear, concise, and exact\u201d enough to satisfy \u00a7 112, Title 35, U.S.C., though we were to take as authoritative the declaration in Schriber-Schroth Co. v. Cleveland Trust Co., 305 U.S. 47, 57, 59 S.Ct. 8, 12, 83 L.Ed. 34, that the scope of a patent \u201ccannot be enlarged by claims in the patent not supported by the description.\u201d We shall therefore assume that, even disregarding the language of the claims, the description that we have quoted from the specifications demanded a \u201cchamber\u201d such as we have described.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The prior art did not indeed disclose exactly that kind of \u201cchamber\u201d; but there were a number of devices for accomplishing the same result. For example, the patent, issued to Aghnides, in 1940 \u2014 No. 2210846 \u2014 disclosed a \u201cchamber,\u201d square in cross section, in which \u201cmeans are provided in the path of the stream of water, after it leaves the aperture or apertures and before it discharges at the outlet end, for finely breaking up the water and offering sufficient resistance for thoroughly mixing it with air\u201d (page 1, lines 17-23). One such \u201cmeans\u201d is the \u201cperforated screen, 16\u201d that \u201cadmits the water into the casing 14 in the form of a plurality of jets\u201d (page 1, lines 35-37). The water sucks air into the \u201cchamber\u201d through \u201cports\u201d where it mixes with the water; and at the bottom of the \u201cchamber\u201d is another \u201cscreen, 20\u201d (page 1, line 39), or two \u201cscreens 40, 42,\u201d that form the exit. This implies that the \u201cchamber\u201d is never filled with water as it is in the patent to Gettins, No. 2564060, and probably also in Goodrie\u2019s earlier patent, No. 2134182. On the other hand there is no \u201cplug, 28\u201d in Aghnides\u2019 chamber that creates an annular discharge opening and avoids clogging which is said to occur when screens form the bottom of the \u201cchamber,\u201d though it is to be noted these are optional also in the patent in suit (Col. 3, lines 19, 20 and lines 51-53).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Thus, the validity of the patent may be said to depend upon whether it was an \u201cinvention\u201d to substitute \u201cplugs,\u201d like those disclosed in several of earlier patents, in place of the bottom screens of Aghnides; for equivalents of the \u201cskirts, 22\u201d of the patent in suit, extending below the air ports, were present in Goodrie\u2019s earlier patent. It is true that the disclosure has had a substantial sale, and we will assume that it was an improvement upon what had gone before; but we think that it was one of those combinations of existing elements that are not entitled to a monopoly. We shall not try to add to the definitions of what is meant by \u201cinvention.\u201d In the end probably it is doubtful whether more can ever be said than that the court thinks that the combination before it does, or does not, deserve a patent, though we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>are sure that the standard has become more exacting in recent years. It has for long been the custom of courts in deciding the importance to be attributed to a new combination to charge the applicant \u201cwith a knowledge of all preexisting devices\"<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and then to ask how much originality it took to make the change. The plaintiff argues that the screens used by Aghnides readily clogged and had to be cleaned. Faced with such a difficulty it does not appear to us that it would have demanded more than the most commonplace ingenuity to turn to Goodrie\u2019s earlier disclosure for a solution. In any event it is clear to us that the Supreme Court would not to-day hold such a combination patentable.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-20\">. 119 F.Supp. 506.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b442-13\">.
