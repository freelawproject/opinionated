Teamsters Union, 346 U.S. 485, 488, 74 S.Ct. 161, 164. Understanding that the scope of the injunctive order below is so limited, it is ordered that the motion, in so far as it seeks complete suspension of the injunction pending appeal, be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-23\">The motion, in so far as it seeks prompt hearing on the merits of the appeal, is granted and the appeal is assigned for hearing on December 30, 1954, at 11:00 a. m. The appellant is directed forthwith to file as the record on appeal, with the usual docket fee, the record made for purposes of the pending motion with leave to either party, if desired, to supplement the record on appeal by the inclusion of additional papers from the file of the Court below. The main briefs of the parties may incorporate by reference prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>briefs and need not be printed provided three copies shall be.available for the court: they shall be filed and served on opposing counsel on or before December 29, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER authorizes us to say that he concurs in the foregoing dispositions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
