Carbone, 327 U.S. 633, 66 S.Ct. 734, 90 L.Ed. 904, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-11\">\u201cAs disclosed by the decision of that Court the evil intended to be covered and curtailed was the conduct of some of the employers or subemployers in indecently and immorally demanding and receiving part of the wages intended for the employees. In that case some of the union officials were indicted, just as one of the union officials here is indicted, for demanding kickbacks and the Supreme Court held that such an act was not covered by the statute, and that the law was not intended to affect legitimate union activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">In the Carbone case the indictment charged in detail that the accused union officials were collecting from the employees weekly contributions toward initiation fees in the union, pursuant to union rules, and in furtherance of an agreement between the union and employer whereby the latter agreed to employ only those persons who were members of or approved by the union. According to the majority of the Supreme Court, the trial judge in that case construed the indictment to set up a factual situation which only described a legitimate union device for collecting lawful dues or fees. The Supreme Court was bound by the construction of the trial court by the provisions of the statute under which the direct appeal in that case was taken;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the majority, by reference to Congressional Reports, held that the statute did not extend to lawful activity by labor unions and their officials. It is true, as appellee contends, that there is language in the opinion from which it might be concluded that the Supreme Court exempted union officials from the coverage of the Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>whatever might be their conduct. However, the remarks were made in connection with excerpts from Congressional Reports, and it should be noted that the three dissenting Justices disagreed with any such broad generalization. We do not construe the opinion in the Carbone case to exempt any person from the coverage of the Act simply because he is an official of a labor union.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The statute, in unmistakable terms, applies to \u201cwhoever\u201d commits the offense proscribed. Like any other criminal statute we think it is directed against an offense, not against particular persons. True, the Carbone decision exempted persons who were engaged in legitimate union activities, but we think that exemption extended to such persons because of the nature of the activities in which they were engaged, not simply because they were officials of the union. The indictment in the Carbone case, according to the trial court\u2019s construction as interpreted by the Supreme Court, described the activities of the accused in such a manner as to show that they were simply collecting union dues or fees according to union rules, a lawful activity not proscribed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In the instant case, however, no such facts appear in the indictment. It is shown that there was an agreement between the employer and the union whereby the latter would employ only those persons who were members of or approved by the union or its representative (appellee); but the indictment does not disclose that the appellee was collecting the money from the employees pursuant to any instructions from his union or in furtherance of any union rules. For aught that appears in the indictment, appellee may very well have been using his union position and the agreement with the employer to extort money from employees for his own private gain in no way connected with the union or its \u201clegitimate activities\u201d. It affirmatively appears in the indictment that his position was such that he had control over the employees\u2019 jobs. We know of no rule of law which requires an indictment to negative every conceivable exception or exemption to the statute under which it is returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Facts may appear in response to a. motion for particulars, or during the trial itself, which will bring this matter within the orbit of the Carbone ease; but for the purposes of this appeal we are bound by the facts which are alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">We think the instant case is clearly distinguishable from Carbone, and that the indictment as written charges an offense under the Kickback Act. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-9\">. \u201cWhoever, by force, intimidation, or threat of procuring dismissal from employment, or by any other manner whatsoever induces any person employed in the construction, prosecution, completion or repair of any public building, public work, or building or work financed in whole or in part by loans or grants from the United States, to give up any part of the compensation to which he is entitled under Ms contract of employment, shall be fined not more than \u00a75,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d Juno 25, 1948, c. 645, 62 Stat. 740.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-14\">.
