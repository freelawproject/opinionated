A check of these documents shows they have been received by this court. He also complains that the officials at Folsom Prison gave him a dull razor blade to shave with, an undersized light bulb, and that they have interfered with his sleep. No question warranting action by this court is stated. The application is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
