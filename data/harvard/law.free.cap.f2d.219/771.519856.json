The action was originally instituted against both Dr. Robert E. Moran and Children\u2019s Hospital. At the pretrial, the pretrial judge dismissed the complaint as to Children\u2019s Hospital, but allowed it to proceed to trial against Dr. Moran. At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case, a motion was made for direction of a verdict in favor of Dr. Moran, and this motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">We have examined the record and have reached the conclusion that there was no evidence to show that the doctor had failed to exercise that degree of care and skill ordinarily exercised by a surgeon in this locality.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court had no alternative but to direct a verdict in so far as the doctor was concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">Likewise, we see no error on the part of the pretrial judge in dismissing at pretrial the complaint against Children\u2019s Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b820-13\">.
