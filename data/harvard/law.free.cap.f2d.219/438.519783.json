Among other cases, Judge Ford cited as compelling his conclusion the following authorities: Dana-her v. United States, 8 Cir., 184 F.2d 673, 675, 676; Raives v. Raives, 2 Cir., 54 F.2d 267; Pence v. United States, 316 U.S. 332, 338, 62 S.Ct. 1080, 86 L.Ed. 1510; Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York v. Hilton-Green, 241 U.S. 613, 622, 36 S.Ct. 676, 60 L.Ed. 1202; Great.

Vince, 6 Cir., 118 F.2d 232, certiorari denied 314 U.S. 637, 62 S.Ct. 71, 86 L.Ed. 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-21\">The findings of fact of the-United States District Court being supported by substantial evidence and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>\u2022clearly erroneous, and the conclusions of law drawn therefrom being soundly based, the judgment of the district court, 118 F.Supp. 277, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
