See Davilman v. United States, 6 Cir., 180 F.2d 284, 286; Hudspeth v. United States, 6 Cir., 183 F.2d 68. Compare United States v. Rosenberg, 2 Cir., 200 F.2d 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-25\">The answer to the second question presented is \u201cYes\u201d. No findings of fact or conclusions of law are required where it appears conclusively, as it does here from the face of the motion and the record in the case, that the party is entitled to no relief. Brown v. United States, 6 Cir., 212 F.2d 589. Compare Carroll v. United States, 4 Cir., 174 F.2d 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-26\">Judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
