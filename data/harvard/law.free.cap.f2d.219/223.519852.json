Meccano, Ltd. v. John Wanamaker, 253 U.S. 136, 141, 40 S.Ct. 463, 64 L.Ed. 822; Huber Baking Co. v. Stroehmann Bros. Co., 2 Cir., 208 F.2d 464, 465, 467; Aeolian Co. v. Fischer, 2 Cir., 29 F.2d 679, 681; Behre v. Anchor Ins. Co., 2 Cir., 297 F. 986, 991. We see no such abuse in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-18\">The motion was heard upon supporting and opposing affidavits and the copies, attached to the complaint, of plaintiff\u2019s pamphlet, \u201cKiller in the Streets,\u201d and the defendants\u2019 pamphlet, \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen to Us.\u201d Each pamphlet deals pictorially in cartoon style with three common types of highway accident resulting from careless driving by members of a family. Only the expression of ideas is copyrightable, and Judge Dawson was of opinion [126 F. Supp. 515] that there was not \u201csufficient similarity in the execution of the work\u201d to show infringement. The pictures in the accused pamphlet are different from, and superior to, those of the plaintiff\u2019s pamphlet. Even if some of the words ascribed to the pictured characters are sufficiently similar to suggest plagiarism, as to which it is unnecessary to express an opinion, the denial of a temporary injunction was proper, because the affidavits raise a question as to the validity of plaintiff\u2019s copyright on the ground that its pamphlet, under a different title, had been dedicated to the public by prior publication without any copyright notice. Furthermore, the affidavits do not show that money damages will not be an adequate remedy or that plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury if a temporary injunction is denied. With respect to the counts alleging unfair competition and misuse of confidential information, there are disputed questions of fact decision of which should await final hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-19\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
