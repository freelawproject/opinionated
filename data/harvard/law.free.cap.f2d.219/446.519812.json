The opposition is predicated on that clause of section 2(d) of said Act of 1946 relating to the likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception of purchasers resulting from similarity between trade-marks. The Examiner of Interferences and Examiner-in-Chief of the United States Patent Office, in respective opinions, held that \u201cTalk-A-Phone\u201d and \u201cSelect-O-Phone,\u201d considered in their entireties, were not similar in sound, meaning, or appearance, and consequently were not likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception of purchasers when applied to the goods of the parties. The decision of the Examiner-in-Chief is reported as Kellogg Switchboard &amp; Supply Co. v. Talk-A-Phone Co., 98 U.S.P.Q. 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, surviving corporation of a merger with opposer, moved at the conclusion of the proceedings below to be substituted in place of opposer. The motion being granted by the Assistant Commissioner of Patents, that corporation appears here as appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\u201cSelect-O-Phone\u201d was adopted and registered as a trade-mark for private interoffice telephonic communication systems by a predecessor of appellant in 1916. Use of the mark has been continuous since that time, and advertising on a national level has been extensive. Appellant\u2019s intercommunicating \u201cSelect-O-Phone\u201d system utilizes conventional telephone equipment. A plurality of stations within an office or factory may, for example, be wired for communication, each station having a telephone set. The user at one phone calls another on the system through a master automatic switchboard, a bell or buzzer notifying the called party. Appellant\u2019s apparatus is sold primarily to industrial and commercial establishments, prices varying, according to the extent of service desired, between $97 and $5,218.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">\u201cTalk-A-Phone\u201d was adopted and first used by a predecessor of appellee in 1937. In its application for registration of the mark, appellee described its goods as interoffice telephonic communication apparatus consisting of speakers, amplifiers, and intercommunicating circuits therefor. This apparatus is essentially a loudspeaking system with no signal except the voice of the calling individual. The station called is permitted to answer without having to operate a switch or the like. Appellee\u2019s sales are also principally made to industrial and commercial establishments. Its prices are similar to those for appellant\u2019s system, but more than 50% of appellee\u2019s sales are for apparatus selling for approximately $150, uninstalled.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">The operation of the respective systems of communication of appellant and appellee are known to the court and are fully and clearly described in the record, such description being supplemented by numerous exhibits showing the apparatus in question. While these systems differ in construction and in the manner of use, each system is intended for the same general purpose and are hence competitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">In the light of the foregoing facts, the question presented is whether \u201cTalk-A-Phone\u201d so resembles \u201cSelect-O-Phone\u201d as to be likely, when applied to goods of the same class, to cause confusion o'r <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>mistake or to deceive purchasers as to the source of origin of such goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">In its brief on appeal, appellant argues that the words \u201cTalk\u201d and \u201cPhone\u201d being purely descriptive of the appellee\u2019s goods, and therefore devoid of trademark significance, the dominant and distinctive characteristics of appellee\u2019s mark, if any, must be found in the features of form and cadence of the expression \u201cTalk-A-Phone\u201d as a whole, and in the suffix, \u201cA-Phone.\u201d These features, according to appellant, constitute the dominant and distinctive elements of its previously registered mark, \u201cSelect-O-Phone,\u201d and thus the two trade-mark notations are virtually identical except for the descriptive prefix \u201cTalk\u201d in ap-pellee\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Although it is true that the word \u201cTalk\u201d is descriptive, and the form and cadence of both marks are similar, and the suffix \u201cPhone\u201d is common to each mark, we believe, for reasons we will now state, that the involved marks are not confusingly or deceptively similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The suffix \u201cPhone\u201d is generieally descriptive of the goods of both parties, and cannot be subjected to exclusive trade-mark usage by anyone. A prefix sought to be used by a newcomer In combination with that descriptive suffix should be sufficiently distinctive, and employed in such association, however, as will eliminate any likelihood of confusion with another\u2019s prior use of that, suffix. See Eureka Williams Corp. v. McCorquodale, 205 F.2d 155, 40 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1028. More particularly, and in broader perspective, we quote from the case of Aluminum Air Seal Mfg. Co. v. Trim-Set Corp., 208 F.2d 374, 376, 41 C.C.P.A., Patents, 764, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6l\">\u201c * * * Although it is well established that a descriptive word can have, in itself, little or no trade mark significance and cannot properly be \u201cconsidered as being the dominant part of a trade mark, it is equally well established that the controlling and decisive principle is whether the competing marks are confusing when observed in the light of their over-all presentations. In this respect, it is true that in the final analysis the contested marks should not be judicially dissected or component parts measured one against the other, as the purchaser himself does not dissect the marks, but is confused, if at all, by the mark as a whole. From a purely objective standpoint, however, existing and apparent similarities [and dissimilarities] in significance, sound, and appearance between constituent parts of trade marks cannot be overlooked as they provide a rational foundation upon which a conclusion may be formed as to the general subjective impression made by the marks upon the buying public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Applying the above principles to the instant case, and being cognizant of the clear difference in sound, meaning, and significance between \u201cTalk\u201d and \u201cSelect,\u201d we now consider whether the general subjective impression made by the marks <em>as a whole </em>is such as to be likely to confuse the type of purchaser buying the respective products to which the marks in question are affixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\"> The respective communication systems of appellee and appellant are, as heretofore indicated, quite expensive. They are purchased primarily by commercial or industrial establishments. Sales are many times made through trained purchasing agents who are required to be discriminating in the selection of what is bought, particularly where the product purchased represents a considerable, long-term investment. Seldom do business houses or individuals purchase expensive items on impulse, without proper reflection and discriminating care. In International Silver Co. v. American Silver Co., 37 F.2d 622, 623, 17 C.C.P.A., Patents, 871, for example, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-10\">\u201cWe may take judicial notice of the fact that the purchase of silverware, sterling or plated, involves a considerable degree of care and dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>crimination upon the part of the purchaser. The goods are valuable. They are not a matter of every day purchase upon the part of an individual, like food products or other products that require frequent replacement. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Certainly, this ruling may be applied with equal force in a case involving expensive telephonic equipment. That skilled buyers would clearly differentiate between a \u201cSelect-O-Phone\u201d and \u201cTalk-A-Phone\u201d system of communication seems too manifest to us to admit of serious dispute, but, in any event, whether the buyers be skilled or otherwise, we do not think that the marks, considered as a whole, are likely to give rise to confusion in trade, mistake, or deception of purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Examiner-in-Chief is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AU5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-8\">. Section 2(f) provides that \u201cExcept as expressly excluded in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section, nothing herein shall prevent the registration of a mark used by the applicant which has become distinctive of the applicant\u2019s goods in commerce. * * * \u201d 15 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1052(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
