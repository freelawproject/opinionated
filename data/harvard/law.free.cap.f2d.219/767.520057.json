Donovan and Catherine J. Donovan for specific performance of a contract for the sale of real estate or, alternatively, for damages in the sum of $150,000. Thomas J. Fisher &amp; Company, Inc., the real estate broker with which Burke and River Road had made a deposit of $5,000, appeals from the judgment, which in effect forfeited the deposit, and ordered it divided equally between the Fisher company and the Donovans.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Although the Fisher company\u2019s cross-claim against the Donovans for a commission of five per cent, amounting to $9,500, was not discussed in the trial court\u2019s opinion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was not expressly dealt with in the judgment, Fisher devoted its argument on appeal to the proposition that the cross-claim was improperly dismissed. Doubtless such dismissal is implicit in the judgment, since the court concluded as a matter of law that the sellers had properly declared a forfeiture. It followed, therefore, that the Fisher company was entitled to only $2,500, or one half of the deposit forfeited when the buyer defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">We see no reason to disturb the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-18\">.
