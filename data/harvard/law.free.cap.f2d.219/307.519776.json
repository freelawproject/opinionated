The district court dismissed the libel on the ground that the libellant failed to sustain the burden of proving fault on the part of the Hudson, claimant\u2019s tug. Judge Abruzzo\u2019s opinion is reported in 115 F.Supp. 598. The appellant contends that the court erred in dismissing the libel and in not holding the Hudson solely at fault for violation of the starboard hand rule of navigation in a crossing situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-17\">The Bayonne Cut Channel is about 500 feet in width and runs in a generally northerly and southerly direction. The Greenville Channel is much wider and runs in a generally east and west direction. The southeast corner of the intersection of the two channels is marked by a green flashing light, and the collision occurred about 100 feet north and 40 feet west of this light. The libellant\u2019s tug, Chippewa II, with the flood tide under foot was proceeding northerly in the Bayonne Cut and was favoring the starboard side of the Cut. The claimant\u2019s tug Hudson was proceeding easterly in Greenville Channel. Ahead of her, also proceeding easterly, was a McAllister tug with a tow of two earfloats, one on either side. The Chippewa passed under the stern of the Mc-Allister tow and attempted to pass in front of the Hudson, but the latter\u2019s bow struck the Chippewa\u2019s port side about 20 feet forward from the stem.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-18\">Testimony on behalf of the Chippewa placed the Hudson 700 or 800 feet behind the McAllister tow; the Hudson\u2019s witnesses put the distance at less than 100 feet. The district court made no specific finding as to the distance; his opinion says that the Hudson was \u201csomewhere\u201d behind the McAllister. Whatever the distance there can be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>doubt that when the two light tugs sighted each other they were on crossing courses, the Hudson being to the north and west of the Chippewa and the latter being on the former\u2019s starboard bow. Hence the Hudson was the burdened vessel and it was her duty to pass under the stem of the Chippewa, while the Chippewa\u2019s duty was to hold her course and speed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is most amazing that the district court\u2019s opinion does not mention the starboard hand rule, for the libel charged that one of the faults of the Hudson, \u201cbeing the burdened vessel\u201d, was her failure to \u201cstop and reverse or go around the stern\u201d of the Chippewa. Without even alluding to this statutory rule of navigation, the opinion states that the Chippewa \u201cwas guilty of bad navigation\u201d and her \u201cattempt to maneuver behind the stern of the \u2018McAllister\u2019 and in front of the bow of the \u2018Hudson\u2019 was extremely dangerous. Careful navigation would have dictated that he [the Chippewa\u2019s captain] go under the stern of the \u2018Hudson\u2019.\u201d The reverse is true; it was the Hudson\u2019s duty to go under the Chippewa\u2019s stern. She did nothing to keep clear of the privileged vessel, apparently oblivious to her duty to do so. It was this which created the danger and caused the collision. Her fault is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"> It is argued in the appellee\u2019s brief that the Chippewa gave up her privilege because she did not hold her course, but first went to starboard, then to port, which put her \u201con a course parallel to both the carfloat tow and the Hudson\u201d, and then to starboard again, and that this \u201cwinding course\u201d brought about the collision. No reason is advanced why the Chippewa should have engaged in so crazy a maneuver, and the court\u2019s opinion contains no suggestion that she did. The appellee endeavors to support its contention by certain findings, particularly No. 10 which states that the attempt of the Chippewa to maneuver behind the stern of the McAllister tow and in front of the bow of the Hudson \u201cinvolved a winding course * * The findings of fact and conclusions of law appearing in the record were prepared by counsel for the claimant. Without change they were signed by the judge three weeks after he had filed his opinion. This court has heretofore had occasion to comment on the undesirable character of findings thus made.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To the extent that such findings go beyond the facts as stated in the trial judge\u2019s opinion, they have less weight on appeal than they would be entitled to if they represented the judge\u2019s independent determination. The Severance, 4 Cir., 152 F.2d 916, 918. Neither of the exhibits referred to in Finding 10 supports the appellee\u2019s contention that the Chippewa\u2019s swing to port put her on a course parallel to the carfloat tow and the Hudson, nor the finding that her navigation involved a \u201cwinding course\u201d. Indeed, Captain Purdy\u2019s diagram (Exhibit A) indicates that in so far as she varied from a straight line, the variation was slight. The contention that the Chippewa relinquished her privileged position is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">The only debatable question is whether damages should be divided or the Hudson held solely responsible for the collision. As was said in The Boston Socony, 2 Cir., 63 F.2d 246, 248:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-11\">\u201cThe privileged vessel is always in a difficult situation. The rule is that she must keep her course and speed until it becomes apparent that the burdened vessel cannot alone avoid the collision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">The Chippewa\u2019s testimony is that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>did hold her course and speed until in extremis. Even if Captain Purdy's diagram be accepted as showing a technical violation, her variation from a straight course was so slight that it could not have affected the result, had the Hudson performed her duty as the Chippewa had reason to suppose she would. See Harbor Oil Transport Co. v. The Plattsburgh Socony, 2 Cir., 151 F.2d 708, 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for entry of a decree holding the Hudson solely responsible.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-5\">. 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 204, 206; 33 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 80.7, 80.9; The Boston Socony, 2 Cir., 63 F.2d 246; The Florence Hines, D.C.E.D.N.Y., 68 F.Supp. 754, affirmed, Staples v.
