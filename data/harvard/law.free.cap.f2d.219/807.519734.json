Defendant is presently confined in a New York State prison under state sentence under its multiple offender law, and seeks this relief as a basis for amelioration of his state sentence. Judge Dimock first decided that defendant was entitled to a full hearing, United States v. Di Martini, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 118 F.Supp. 601, and then, after it had been accorded, concluded that defendant had not proved his contention of being unlawfully deprived of counsel on the occasion of his conviction below. D.C.S.D.N.Y., 120 F.Supp. 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">While defendant\u2019s assertions of lack of notice of the government\u2019s motion to dismiss may not appear overconvincing, we should not stop with this if we could discover merit in his appeal; we are accustomed to make various concessions of time to prisoners in confinement. But we can see no merit in the appeal. Whether fully entitled or not, defendant has had.an extensive hearing, including full testimony, before an experienced and patient trial judge who has decided against him on factual issues; and no question of law remains. And specifically on defendant\u2019s request for permission to proceed in forma pauperis, he has shown no statutory grounds for its grant.</p>\n<p id=\"AYm\">Accordingly defendant\u2019s motion must ^ f n '</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
