On November 22, 1954, plaintiffs filed a complaint in the court below seeking an injunction to restrain Underwood from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>prosecuting its state-court action. The next day, plaintiffs moved for a temporary injunction. After argument, Judge Smith entered an order granting a preliminary injunction which restrained Underwood from proceeding with its state-court suit, \u201cso far as it seeks injunctive relief.\u201d On December 16, Judge Smith denied Underwood\u2019s motion for dissolution of the preliminary injunction. Underwood at once filed a notice of appeal and moved in this court for an order staying Judge Smith\u2019s injunction order pending appeal. After considering the oral arguments and briefs concerning that motion, this court, on December 23, entered an order denying it. 2 Cir., 219 F.2d 99. That order is quoted in part in the Appendix to this opinion. We set December 30 as the date for argument of the appeal, and heard it on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">1. The basic problem is that of the jurisdiction of the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is no diversity of citizenship here. However, 28 U.S.G. \u00a7 1337 confers on federal district courts jurisdiction of \u201cany civil action or proceedings arising under any Act of Congress regulating commerce.\u201d The Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 141 et seq., is such an Act. But 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2283 carves out a large segment of what would otherwise be the district court\u2019s jurisdiction, by providing that a federal court \u201cmay not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or when necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgment.\u201d Section 10 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160 \u2014 in subsections (j) and <em>(l) </em>\u2014 expressly authorizes a federal district court, in certain specified circumstances, to issue injunctive orders at the suit of the N.L.R.B.; and, were there such a suit, the court below would be the particular district court empowered by that Act to do so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But the specified circumstances grounding jurisdiction to make any such order do not here exist, since Underwood has not lodged with the Board a charge of unfair labor practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">There remains the question whether the phrase \u201cnecessary in aid of its jurisdiction,\u201d in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283, supplies the basis of jurisdiction. In approaching that question, we make the following assumptions, <em>arguendo: </em>(1) Underwood in its state-court suit sought injunctive relief against nothing other than conduct constituting unfair labor practices exclusively covered by the Labor-Management Relations Act. (2) The state court has no valid power to grant such an injunction, so that if it did enter an injunction order, that order, if affirmed by the highest state court, would be reversed by the United States Supreme Court on the ground that, in the Act, Congress conferred such power exclusively upon the federal courts. See Garner v. Teamsters Union, 346 U.S. 485,<footnotemark>2a</footnotemark> 74 S.Ct. 161, 98 L.Ed. 228. That is, we assume, <em>ar-guendo, </em>that the exception noted in Garner, 346 U.S. at page 488, 74 S.Ct. 161, does not permit the state court to grant such injunctive relief at the suit of Underwood. (See infra, point 2 of this opinion.) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">We add a further assumption, <em>ar-guendo, </em>i. e., that the court below, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the suit of the Board, would have had potential jurisdiction, as \u201cnecessary in aid of its jurisdiction,\u201d under 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2283, to enjoin Underwood from prosecuting its state-court suit, notwithstanding Underwood had not filed a complaint with the Board. In Capital Service, Inc., v. N.L.R.B., 347 U.S. 501, 74 S.Ct. 699, 98 L.Ed. 887, the company obtained a state court injunction against certain union conduct, and also petitioned the Board. The Board found the union\u2019s conduct in part protected and in part prohibited by Section 8(b) (4). Where there is such an unfair practice, Section 10 (i) allows the Board to procure an injunction against the union. The Board sought two injunctions from the federal district court\u2014 one against the <em>union </em>under Section 10 <em>(l) </em>and one against the company to prevent it from enforcing its state decree. The United States Supreme Court held that, since the district court could enjoin the union under Section 10 <em>(l), </em>it could issue a valid injunction against the company \u201cin aid of its jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"al-dedup-0\">But here the company filed no complaint with the Board. Nevertheless, as above noted, we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that, if the Board here had sought the injunction, there would have been jurisdiction in the district court. An analogy may be found in judicial interpretation of the All Writs Act, 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 1651(a) which provides, \u201cThe Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d It has been held that a federal appellate court, \u201cin aid of its jurisdiction,\u201d may issue a writ of mandamus to require a district judge to hear a case clearly within his jurisdiction which he has erroneously refused to hear.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In such a situation, the jurisdiction of the appellate court, thus aided, is potential; it acts \u201cso that the power of review may not be defeated.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">So here it is arguable that, if moved by the Board, the district court, by enjoining Underwood, could have acted validly to prevent the state court from intruding on the exclusive power of the Board and the exclusive jurisdiction of the district court. For then it might be said that the Board had a legal interest entitled to protection, and thus a \u201cstanding\u201d to maintain such a suit, with the consequence that the district court would have potential jurisdiction in \u201caid of its jurisdiction.\u201d Cf. Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System v. Transamerica Corporation, 9 Cir., 184 F.2d 311; West India Fruit &amp; Steamship Co. v. Seatrain Lines, 2 Cir., 170 F.2d 775. We may also assume, <em>ar-guendo, </em>that the same would be true if here the Board had intervened and asked the court to grant the injunction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">All the foregoing assumptions, however, do not help here, since the Board did not ask the district court to act. This outstanding fact distinguishes Bowles v. Willingham, 321 U.S. 503, 64 S.Ct. 641, 88 L.Ed. 892; Porter v. Lee, 328 U.S. 246, 66 S.Ct. 1096, 90 L.Ed. 1199; and Porter v. Dicken, 328 U.S. 252, 66 S.Ct. 1094, 90 L.Ed. 1203. The plaintiffs have at stake no legally protected interest of their own, and therefore have no \u201cstanding\u201d to maintain their suit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It follows, we think, that the district court lacked power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>to grant an injunction \u201cin aid of its jurisdiction,\u201d because it had no jurisdiction to aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Despite the absence of a legally protected interest in plaintiffs, it may be assumed, <em>arguendo, </em>that they could have maintained their suit, and the court would have had potential jurisdiction, if Congress had provided that an \u201caggrieved person\u201d (or the like) could, in such manner, vindicate or protect the Board\u2019s interest;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for then the plaintiffs would be part of a class of what we have called \u201cprivate Attorney Generals.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But, as there is no such statutory provision,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we think the district court had no jurisdiction. See, e. g., Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 303 U.S. 41, 58 S.Ct. 459, 82 L.Ed. 638; Amalgamated Utilities Workers v. Consolidated Edison Company, 309 U.S. 261, 60 S.Ct. 561, 84 L.Ed. 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">We recognize that the result may be regarded as undesirable, if, as we have assumed, <em>arguendo, </em>Underwood\u2019s state-court complaint seeks an injunction against nothing but unfair labor practices which are exclusively covered by the Labor Management Relations Act. For, if the state-court does grant such an injunction, and if its order is fatally defective as exceeding the proper area of state jurisdiction but is affirmed by the highest state court, then, long before that order can be reversed by the United States Supreme Court, its practical effect may well be to break the strike by invalid means.<footnotemark>10a</footnotemark> Thus, on that assumption, by refusing to complain to the Board, the company may achieve its aim and thereby frustrate the Congressional policy embodied in the Labor Management Relations Act, described as follows in Garner v. Teamsters Union, 346 U.S. 485, at pages 499-500, 74 S.Ct. 161, at pages 170-171, 98 L.Ed. 228: \u201cThe detailed prescription of a procedure for restraint of specified types of picketing would seem to imply that other picketing is to be free of other methods and sources of restraint. For the policy of the national Labor Management Relations Act is not to condemn all picketing but only that ascertained by its prescribed processes to fall within its prohibitions. Otherwise, it is implicit in the Act that the public interest is served by freedom of labor to use the weapon of picketing. For a state to impinge on the area of labor combat designed to be free is quite as much an obstruction of federal policy as if the state were to declare picketing free for purposes or by methods which the federal Act prohibits.\u201d It may be, as plaintiffs\u2019 counsel suggests, that the Board\u2019s failure to intervene, or otherwise to seek injunctive relief here, derives entirely from its want of a sufficient staff, and that, accordingly, frustration of the Congressional policy may stem from factors which Congress never contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-16\">No such considerations, however, can operate to create federal jurisdiction. Countering any implications, based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>such considerations, which might be drawn from the Congressional policy expressed in the Labor Management Relations Act, is another older and well-established policy \u2014 dating from 1793<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and later set forth in Section 265 of the Judicial Code (former 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 379) \u2014 of avoiding friction between state and federal courts by prohibiting the latter from enjoining the prosecution of state-court proceedings. In Toueey v. New York Life Insurance Company, 314 U.S. 118, 62 S.Ct. 139, 86 L.Ed. 100, the Court held that Section 265 of the Judicial Code precluded federal court injunctions against litigants attempting in state courts to litigate the <em>res judicata </em>effects of federal court judgments; it required an amendment of that section \u2014 contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283 \u2014 to establish an exception conferring federal jurisdiction to enjoin prosecution of such suits.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the face of this policy, we think jurisdiction to enjoin state-court actions, other than those within the exceptions prescribed in Section 2283, may not be implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">It is suggested that we confront another hurdle to jurisdiction in the Norris-LaGuardia Act<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which forbids federal courts to grant injunctions in respect of labor disputes; the Supreme Court has indicated that the inroads on that Act made by the Labor Management Relations Act may not be widened by mere implication to permit a federal court to grant such relief;<footnotemark>13a</footnotemark> and one court of appeals has so held where a union sought an injunction.<footnotemark>13b</footnotemark>* We need not consider that suggestion since, if we were to accept it, it would but supplement other sufficient grounds of our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">Our court must interpret the pertinent federal statutes by interpreting, as best it can, the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretations of those enactments; our decision, perforce, represents a gloss upon a gloss. Removal of the obstacles to jurisdiction here, no matter how undesirable any of us may deem those obstacles,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> must come either from Congress or the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">2. This must be added: In our order of December 23, 1954, we construed Garner v. Teamsters Union, 346 U.S. 485, 74 S.Ct. 161, 164, as allowing the state court to grant a valid injunction, at the suit of Underwood, to prevent \u201cmass picketing, threatening of employees, obstructing streets or highways, or picketing homes\u201d, or any activity which threatens \u201cprobable breach of the state\u2019s peace or would call for extraordinary police measures by state or civil authority.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On the argument of the appeal, plaintiff contended that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>we had erred because Garner permits state-court action (other than for damages) at the suit of the appropriate state officials only, and, even then, solely through criminal proceedings. We need not and do not consider that contention. For our order was merely a stop-gap pending an early hearing on the merits as to the jurisdictional question ; as such, it is not at all to be relied on as an authoritative construction of the Garner doctrine. Indeed, as it now turns out, we need not have dealt with the scope of Judge Smith\u2019s order since, as we now hold, he had no jurisdiction to issue any injunction. And since we thus have no jurisdiction,- of course we do not assume to define the jurisdiction of the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Reversed with directions to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">1. Underwood\u2019s state-court complaint reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">\u201c1. The plaintiff is a Delaware corporation authorized to do business in the State of Connecticut employing approximately 1800 persons at its plants in the City of Bridgeport in the manufacture of office business machines, equipment and miscellaneous related articles as well as the production of materials for the National defense program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">\u201c2. The plaintiff conducts its manufacturing operations in three separate plants and locations within the City of Bridgeport.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">\u201c3. International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers, CIO (hereinafter called the International Union) is a voluntary labor organization affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) engaged in the organization and representation of employees for the purposes of collective bargaining under the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\"><em>\u201c4. </em>The defendants, Howard J. Mat-tioli and Tom D. Williams, are representatives of International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers, CIO. i</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-13\">\u201c5. Local 267 of International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers (hereinafter called the Local Union) is a duly chartered local of International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers, CIO.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-14\">\u201c6. The defendants, Robert Cannell, Edward Thompson, Stanley Wasik, William Basta, Sr. and June Goss, are the duly elected officers of the Local Union.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-15\">\u201c7. The defendants, William Dobi, Jack Smith, Edward Mikita, Agnes Wal-ley, Louis Blanchard and Frances Farrell are the duly elected members of the Executive Board of the Local Union.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-16\">\u201c8. The International Union and the Local Union have, by reason of a certification issued by the National Labor Relations Board in June 1954, represented themselves as the collective bargaining representative of employees in an appropriate unit constituting approximately 1200 of the total of 1800 employees of the plaintiff at its various plants in the City of Bridgeport.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-17\">\u201c9. The plaintiff, through its representatives, together with representatives of the International Union and the Local Union entered into negotiations in collective bargaining after said certification by the National Labor Relations Board but said parties failed to reach an agreement with respect to wages, rates of pay and working conditions as respects the employees in the appropriate bargaining unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-18\">\u201c10. On or about November 5, 1954 said International Union and Local Union, through their officers, agents and members, including, among others, the individual defendants, effected a strike against the plaintiff at all three of its plants and thereafter arranged for the picketing of these plants of the plaintiff in the City of Bridgeport.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-19\">\u201c11. The individual defendants personally directed and actively participated in mass picketing at the entrances to the various plants of the plaintiff during the normal hours of plant op* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>erations on November 8 and succeeding days when such plants under normal conditions would have been operating.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\">\u201c12. The mass picketing directed by the International Union and the Local Union and the individual defendants herein named at the entrances to the various plants of the plaintiff involved the congregation of excessively large numbers of persons exceeding at times several hundred people milling around in close formation so as to prevent the entrance of any person to the plaintiff\u2019s plants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">\u201c13. The International Union and the Local Union have declared to plaintiff\u2019s representatives it to be their avowed purpose, through their officers, agents, representatives, and members, to close down all plant operations and exclude not only employees in the unit whom they represent but also 600 or more other persons who constitute plaintiff personnel not represented by either union, as well as those persons required and charged with the responsibility of the physical maintenance of buildings, equipment, and facilities and such other persone, not employees, as may have occasion to do business with the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">\u201c14. Such mass picketing as is being conducted by the Local Union and the International Union through their members causes obstructions to the various entrances to the plaintiff\u2019s premises in a manner and to an extent that it is impossible for any person to enter the premises of the plaintiff without the use of force to push their way through the mass of individuals and thereby come in personal contact with the individuals massed as pickets, all of which is hazardous and will subject such persons seeking to enter the premises of the plaintiff to the danger of personal injury, violence and assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">\u201c15. The plaintiff, by reason of the conduct of the persons engaged in mass picketing, the threats of intimidation and violence and the risk of personal injury and harm to its employees not represented by the Union and to others who have occasion to enter its premises, has been compelled to discontinue any effort to operate its plant, including the shutting off of all heat, water, sprinkler systems and power, thereby creating serious hazards and risks of damage, fire, deterioration of plant properties and facilities, together with an incalculable loss to its business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">\"16. The International Union and the Local Union, together with the individual defendants, have engaged and participated in the use of flying squads of pickets who approach entrances of the plants in large numbers running from various directions to congregate at such entrances whenever persons seek to enter the plaintiff\u2019s premises, and by such conduct, including shouting and threats of violence, intimidate persons lawfully and properly entitled to enter the plaintiff\u2019s premises and by the action of such flying squads are impelled, as a matter of personal safety, not to attempt to enter the plant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">\u201c17. The defendant unions, through their officers, agents, and representatives, together with the individual defendants and in concert with other members of the Union, have threatened to continue the unlawful picketing here-inbefore mentioned so as to exclude forcibly, through mass formations, individual employees and others seeking to enter the premises of the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-11\">\u201c18. The conduct of the defendants herein named and others in concert with them constitutes unlawful picketing which is causing irreparable damage to the plaintiff for which it has no adequate remedy at law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-12\">\u201c19. Plaintiff is suffering irreparable injury to the conduct of its business in that employees other than those represented by the unions and other persons appearing at its gates are impelled to refrain from entering the plant because the conduct of the persons participating in mass picketing induces fear of intimidation, violence and physical injury causing the discontinuance at this time of the conduct of the plaintiff\u2019s business including, among other things, the main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>tenance of its records, correspondence with other firms, persons, corporations with whom it does business, maintaining and disbursing payrolls not only for employees in the bargaining unit but also for all other employees at its Bridgeport plants, the administration of insurance programs for all of its employees and other necessary and proper functions in the maintenance of business and the protection and preservation of its property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">\u201c20. All of the activities of the defendant unions and of the persons named individually as defendants are being carried out in an unlawful manner in defiance and derogation of the rights, privileges and immunities of the plaintiff in that such acts are accompanied by threats of intimidation and violence which interfere with the use, free and otherwise, of the plaintiff\u2019s property and the rights of individual employees and others to engage in gainful occupation and business transactions with the plaintiff, all of which are intended and directed to cause irreparable injury to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">\u201c21. The plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable injury by the continuance of the acts of the defendants as herein set forth for which it has not adequate remedy at law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">\u201c22. The plaintiff, notwithstanding the efforts and assistance rendered by the local police, has been unsuccessful in its endeavors to assist persons to obtain entrance to the plaintiff\u2019s premises without serious risk or danger of personal injury and violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">\u201c23. Plaintiff further alleges that unless a temporary injunction shall be issued substantial, real and irreparable injury will result to the plaintiff in that such real and irreparable injury far outweighs any consequence that may result from such issuance to the defendants in this proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\">\u201cWherefore the plaintiff prays:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\">\u201c1. That a temporary injunction issue against the International Union, the Local union, the individual defendants personally and in their capacity as agents, representatives and members of the local Union or the International Union and persons acting in concert with or otherwise participating with them or acting in their aid or behalf, which shaft enjoin, restrain and prohibit each and! every one of them from</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-12\">\u201c(a) Congregating in large numbers-by mass picketing or otherwise, upon the-sidewalks or roadways in front of, near or around the plaintiff\u2019s premises in said! City of Bridgeport and the various entrances thereto in such a manner or by any means to block or obstruct said entrance to said premises and prevent or interfere with entrance into and egress from said premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-13\">\u201c(b) By force, violence or intimidation or threat or implication of force or violence or by the use of offensive language or otherwise, preventing or interfering with any person from entrance to or egess from said premises and place of business of the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-14\">\u201c(c) Preventing or interfering in any way whatsoever with ingress to or egress from the plaintiff\u2019s business of trucks, vehicles, mail, merchandise, fuel or other materials destined to or from said premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-15\">\u201c(d) Maintaining or allowing to remain at any entrance to the premises of the plaintiff a greater number of persons acting as pickets than the Court shall deem proper, or permitting said pickets to conduct themselves in a manner different than is permitted by law and is prescribed by order of the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-16\">\u201c2. That the plaintiff have all of the aforesaid relief pending the determination of this action and that thereafter a permanent injunction issue to the extent that the Court may deem necessary and appropriate in the protection of the rights of the plaintiff in and to its property and its interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-17\">\u201c3. That the plaintiff have such other, further and different relief as to the Court may seem just and proper in the premises, including all costs incurred by the plaintiff in these proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-18\">\u201c4.
