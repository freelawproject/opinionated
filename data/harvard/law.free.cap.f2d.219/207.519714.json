Anthony Friloux, Asst. U. S. Atty., Malcolm R. Wilkey, U. S. Atty., Houston, Tex., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b256-25\">Before HUTCHESON, Chief Judge, HOLMES, Circuit Judge, and ALLRED, District Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b256-26\">ALLRED, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b256-27\">Appellant was convicted by a jury of unlawfully acquiring marihuana without paying the tax thereon, in violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2593(a). He was sentenced to five years imprisonment and fined one dollar, after admitting his identity as a second offender, as charged in an information filed under section 2557 (b), of Title 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Two questions are presented on this appeal: First: Legality of a search of appellant\u2019s home conducted by city officers without a search or arrest warrant. Second: whether certain incriminating statements made after arrest were voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\"> The search question was brought on before the court in advance of trial and overruled. Appellant called two Houston city officers. So far as the testimony at that hearing is concerned,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trial court committed no error in overruling the motion to suppress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant failed to discharge his burden.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Over objection, McCleary, a federal narcotics agent, was permitted to testify that on the morning after the arrest appellant told him that the evidence seized by the city officers was marihuana, that he hadn\u2019t been a dealer very long, that he bought it from a man who used to run the Overpass Inn and that further questioning led to the name of his source. Appellant had requested that he be permitted to take McCleary on voir dire \u201cfor the purpose of ascertaining whether or not a proper warning\u201d had been given. We think this sufficiently raised the question as to whether the statements were voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"ApOy\">McCleary had testified on direct examination that one of the first things he did was to advise appellant as to his constitutional rights, that \u201che didn\u2019t have to tell me anything, but anything he did tell me might be used for or against him.\u201d This statement \u2014 that anything he might tell the officer might be used <em>for </em>appellant \u2014 standing alone would not mean a great deal but is very significant in the light of what transpired and the testimony of the city officers who were present at the time. It is noted that McCleary says that <em>one </em>of the first things, not the <em>first </em>thing, he did was to advise appellant as to his constitutional rights. All the officers say that a demand was made for production of the order form required under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2593; and that they questioned appellant as to his source of supply. The arrest had been made the night before at 8:30 p.m. Appellant and his wife were taken to the police station and questioned. They were not \u201cbooked\u201d until 10:40 p.m., when a notation was made on the police blotter \u201chold for the morals division and the federal officers.\u201d McCleary was called early the next morning and, along with the arresting officers, questioned appellant. He denies making a \u201cbargain,\u201d or knowing of any the city officers may have made, with appellant,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>but admits he talked with him about his source of supply and in reference to aiding and assisting him and the city officers in catching the big suppliers; that appellant called some of them over the phone and, under supervision of the officers, went out and made purchases resulting in successful prosecutions; and \u25a0that appellant \u201ccooperated\u201d in every way. Officer Poole, on the other hand, testified positively that on the morning of June 4th, he was present when MeCleary talked to appellant as to his source of supply, that they attempted to strike up a bargain with him at that time and that appellant performed his portion of the bargain. He had further testified<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that on the day following the arrest, when he was talking to appellant about his source of supply, that he had told appellant that <em>\u201cwe\u201d </em>would release his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">It is clear from the foregoing that appellant\u2019s statement to MeCleary was involuntary as a matter of law. The trial judge instructed the jury that they could not consider it unless the Government had proved that it was made freely and voluntarily, \u201cthat is, not in response to any force, threat or promises.\u201d This is correct in the abstract but not as applied to the facts in this case. It omits the element of hope of reward, incentive or inducement held out by the officers. They deny any express promise and the jury may well have believed that such a promise had to be express; but, as pointed out above, MeCleary testified that one of the first things he did was to tell appellant that anything he said might be used <em>for, </em>as well as against him. It is logical that appellant believed from this alone that it would be best for him to tell the whole story and that he would be helping himself, or his wife, by \u201ccooperating.\u201d Added to this is the testimony of Poole that <em>they </em>struck a bargain with him, which appellant kept; and that he told appellant that \u201cwe\u201d would not prosecute the wife.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Just what the \u201cbargain\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>the record does not show. From appellant\u2019s standpoint, it was a poor bargain since the officers had no authority to promise him immunity. But the controlling fact is that there <em>was </em>a bargain, part and parcel of the whole conversation about source of supply and \u201ccooperation\u201d which, while not affording immunity, relieves appellant from the use of the admission in evidence against him.'<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\u2019 \u201cIn the federal courts, the requisite of voluntariness is not satisfied by establishing merely that the confession was not induced by a promise or a threat. A confession is voluntary in law if, and only if, it was, in fact, voluntarily made.\u201d Ziang Sung Wan v. United States, 266 U.S. 1, 14, 45 S.Ct. 1, 3, 69 L.Ed. 131. <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The testimony of the Government\u2019s own witnesses clearly shows that appellant\u2019s admission to McCleary, while under arrest, was not voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Nor can we say that this was harmless error. Without these admissions, the record would stand: The city officers watched an informer start up the stairs to appellant\u2019s apartment; they saw him return a short time later when he delivered a package to them (which was not introduced in evidence), within 10 minutes, according to one officer, longer according to another, they went to the apartment, knocked and no one answered, although they had not seen appellant or his wife leave; they had started to leave when appellant and his wife arrived; they told him they had some bad information about him selling marihuana and that they wanted to search; appellant and his wife denied the accusations and inquired whether the officers had a warrant of any kind; the officers replied in the negative but said they wanted to search anyway; appellant produced a key and opened the door; the officers found a small quantity of marihuana right where the informer (who \u201cwas in the racket or that dealt in marihuana\u201d) told them it would be; appellant said, \u201cthat is what you are looking for, it is marihuana.\u201d While failure to produce an order form, upon reasonable notice and demand by the collector, is presumptive evidence of guilt under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2593(a), it is not conclusive; and had it not been for McCleary\u2019s testimony that appellant said it was his, that he hadn\u2019t been a dealer very long, etc., the jury might have believed that it belonged to the informer. The absence of appellant and his wife from the apartment, the informer\u2019s identity as a marihuana dealer, his ready entry into the apartment, his telling the officers right where they would find it and the fact that no marked money was used, or found on appellant, might have created a reasonable doubt. We cannot say what the jury would have done but appellant had the right to have them pass on the question without the damaging admission made under the \u201cbargaining\u201d atmosphere in which it was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-8\">. On the night of June 3, 1953, the officers sent a \u201cspecial employee\u201d to appellant\u2019s residence to attempt to buy marihuana. After he reported a buy to them, they went to the house, knocked and, receiving no response, were about to leave, when appellant and his wife came up. One of the officers told appellant he had some bad information about him selling marihuana and that they wanted to search the premises. Appellant asked if they had a warrant of any kind and, upon being informed that they did not, produced a key and let them in. The officers searched and found the marihuana charged in the indictment. They arrested appellant and his wife, took them to the city jail, questioned them a short time, then lodged them in jail overnight. The next day they turned the evidence over to McCleary, a federal narcotics officer who \u201cadopted\u201d the case on the following day, June 5th. They denied it was their policy to file their cases in the federal courts when they could not make a narcotics case in state court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b257-14\">.

A, <em>Not exactly in those words. </em>I do distinctly recall this conversation, that after talking to him, he told me that he owned all of it, that his wife had nothing to do with it, and I told him that inasmuch as she was not selling and as she had nothing to do with it, she had nothing to fear and I would not be one to prosecute her if that was the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">\u201cQ.
