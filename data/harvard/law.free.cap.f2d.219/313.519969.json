The main appeal is from the trial court\u2019s holding as to invalidity, non-infringement, and lack of unfair competition in appellee\u2019s sale of the accused ironing table, while appellee has cross-appealed from the holding that its advertisement is so confusingly similar to that of appellant as to justify injunctive relief, as well as its allocation of one-fourth costs against appellee and refusal to award it attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Appellant is a Minnesota corporation organized in 1889, and is extensively engaged in the manufacture and sale of ironing tables. Appellee is a Texas corporation which, though never having manufactured the accused table structure, has sold the device for its manufacturer, Smith ville Metal Products Company of Smithville, Texas, which company is not a party to this suit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The patent in suit was issued March 17, 1942 to appellant, as assignee from the inventor-applicant, Edward T. John. Claim 1 thereof, which is the only claim in issue, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">\u201c1. An ironing table top, comprising a framework formed of longitudinal and transverse members and a peripheral frame member united with the longitudinal and transverse members, and a surface member consisting of a single sheet of flat expanded metal resting upon the longitudinal frame members and having edges thereof secured to the peripheral member.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-16\">On the initial issue of Claim l\u2019s validity, appellant insists that its use of flat expanded metal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> *****8 as an ironing table top involved patentable invention because the prior art reveals that no one, prior to the advent of its patent, had recognized that this type metal had inherent properties and characteristics which peculiarly adapted it for unusual efficiency as an ironing table top, viz.: the required strength to support an iron during the ironing operation and still provide the desirable smooth surface and open area for ventilation and steam escape, as well as the desirable characteristic of absorbing the high temperatures to which an ironing table top is subjected in localized areas without bulging, buckling or undergoing other structural distortion. Appellant further insists that Claim 1 is valid because it embodies an invention which remedied many problems theretofore unsolved by the prior art in the trade; that its validity is further reinforced by its due issuance by the Patent Office after consideration of all pertinent prior art references, as well as by its extensive commercial success and the recognition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>appellant\u2019s statutory monopoly by its largest competitors in the field; that the structural variations in appellee\u2019s table are insufficient to avoid infringement under the doctrine of equivalents; and finally, that the testimony reveals appellant\u2019s table has acquired such secondary meaning and significance in the trade as properly entitled it to prevail also on its charge of unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Appellee insists that the trial court properly held Claim 1 invalid because, when viewed in the light of more pertinent prior art references not considered by the Patent Office before issuance of the patent, the mere substitution of flat expanded metal for other ironing table top materials already known did not involve patentable novelty or invention, but was only a logical extension of prior existing knowledge readily apparent to any skilled artisan in the trade, particularly since its use as a table top was suggested in numerous trade circulars and publications issued prior to the patent in suit; alternatively, and solely in the event this Court considers Claim 1 valid, that appellee\u2019s ironing table exhibits substantial structural differences sufficient to avoid infringement; that appellant is entitled to no relief on its theory of unfair competition because of its own acts in permitting the patented structure to be sold under different names and trade-marks through various other outlets, which fact effectively refutes the contention that its product had become so identified with appellant as to acquire secondary significance in the trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The district court found, 114 F.Supp. 224, that no patentable novelty or invention existed in appellant\u2019s mere use of flat expanded metal for an ironing table top; that such metal and its inherently advantageous properties were well known prior to the advent of the patent in suit; specifically, that the use of woven wire, perforated metal, and expanded metal lath for ironing table tops, as suggested by the prior art, reveals them as fully equivalent materials to flat expanded metal, and the mere substitution of the latter material for the former did not constitute patentable invention, but was <em>\u201ca </em>logical step for a skilled man designing an ironing table and involved only engineering or mechanical skill\u201d; that, irrespective of its finding of invalidity, appellee\u2019s accused device did not infringe the patent in suit because, whereas the disclosure of Claim 1 is expressly restricted to \u201ca framework including more than one longitudinal member which is united to the peripheral frame member\u201d, appel-lee\u2019s table had a different framework, in that it exhibits \u201conly a single partial longitudinal member\u201d;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> finally, that appellant \u201chas not established that the appearance of its ironing table top has acquired a secondary meaning\u201d, but since \u201cthe general appearance and arrangement, as well as certain descriptive phases in defendant\u2019s advertisement, are confusingly similar to many of plaintiff\u2019s advertisements,\u201d it created \u201cthe possibility that plaintiff\u2019s prospective purchasers might be misled, and * * * the likelihood of confusion to the public,\u201d so as to warrant the court\u2019s grant of limited injunctive relief to restrain appellee\u2019s further use of advertising \u201cconfusingly similar\u201d to that adopted by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">On the primary issue of Claim l\u2019s validity, appellant concedes in brief that we are confronted with the comparatively simple proposition of \u201cwhether or not the use of flat expanded metal for this particular purpose (ironing board top) involved invention\u201d. It further con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>cedes that flat expanded metal, as such, did not originate with the patentee, John, but that this type metal, as well as ironing board frames, were old long before issuance of the patent in suit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Furthermore, appellant does not deny \u201cthat the qualities and characteristics of flat expanded metal that enabled it to so effectively solve these problems<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are \u2018inherent\u2019 \u201d in the material itself. Appellant insists, however, that such concessions are immaterial and in no way affect the validity of its patentee\u2019s invention because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-4\">\u201cIn not one of these earlier disclosures will be found the remotest suggestion of John\u2019s discovery that flat expanded metal will absorb or dissipate heat without buckling; in not one of them is there even a hint that flat expanded metal has properties that peculiarly adapt the material for an ironing table top; nowhere will be found the problems of localized heat application, the necessity for maintaining a perfectly flat ironing surface condition, the problem of surface condensation to prevent rotting, or the problem of adequate open ventilating space to permit steam escape, while also maintaining adequate smoothness of surface and strength to effect efficient operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">* * * # * \u201cThe one and only person to discover that flat expanded metal had these latent or inherent characteristics, so badly needed in the ironing table art, was Edward T. John, the inventor in the patent in suit, and if this Court so finds, as it should, then the claim in issue should be sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">With specific reference to the advantageous \u201clatent or inherent characteristics\u201d of flat expanded metal for use as an ironing table top, appellant further insists:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\">\u201cIts greatest advantages, however, reside in the two facts (1) that it has a free open area of about sixty per cent so as to provide ample ventilation for the downward escape of steam without any condensation forming on its upper surface, and (2) that it had the very important function or property of being able to absorb and/or dissipate the locally applied heat without bulging, buckling, or otherwise distorting the plane or flat surface condition of the sheet. These were essentially the new advantages, functions and results that were found to have so much merit and great value to the Clark Company, and which were recognized as an inventive contribution by the Patent Office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">We have carefully considered each of appellant\u2019s contentions in the light of the prior art, the physical exhibits, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the record testimony; yet we remain thoroughly convinced that none of them may be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Whether, assuming Claim l\u2019s validity, appellant might be entitled to prevail on the closer issue of infringement,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we think it unnecessary for us to decide. Expressly pretermitting any holding upon that issue, we prefer to predicate our decision on what appears to us more solid ground, i. e. the proven invalidity of the patent in suit, both as anticipated in fact by the prior art, and for its failure, as a matter of law, to disclose that degree of novelty now required in order to vest a patentee with the statutory monopoly which an enforceable patent grants. See Great A. &amp; P. Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 71 S.Ct. 127, 95 L.Ed. 162; Jeoffroy Mfg., Inc., v. Graham, 5 Cir., 206 F.2d 772, 776; Robinson v. Digaetano, 5 Cir., 212 F.2d 1. Considering appellant\u2019s contentions as to validity in the light of its own admissions, as well as against the background of the prior patents cited, the patented and accused structures, and the other evidence, we have no doubt the Trial Court correctly held that, even taking into consideration the fact that we are viewing John\u2019s alleged contribution in the light of hindsight, the prior art cited, and particularly the trade circulars and publications</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">relied upon,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> at least inferentially suggested the substitution of fiat expanded metal in ironing board tops as a \u201clogical extension\u201d of prior knowledge, which use as the Trial Court noted, should have been reasonably apparent to \u201ca skilled man assigned to the task of designing a ventilated top ironing table.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Appellant\u2019s insistence that the failure of other experts to use flat expanded metal for such purpose prior to issuance of the John patent in 1942 is practically conclusive of the validity of John\u2019s contribution, is not sound, particularly in the light of the showing that such material, with all its inherent advantages for such use, was not developed and marketed commercially, or extensively advertised, until about 1935 or 1936. Its further insistence that the presumption of validity of the patent in suit is increased by several factors, i. e. issuance by the Patent Office after consideration of the most pertinent pri- or art,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> commercial success, and recognition by the trade, is also ineffective to establish validity here. We think it too well settled to require citation of authority that, while all such facts and circumstances may properly be relied upon to reinforce ultimate conclusions as to validity in close or doubtful cases, they are never in themselves determinative, either singly or in the aggregate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>nor may they serve independently to breathe life into a patent which, like Claim 1 here, is otherwise basically lacking in patentable invention. Moreover, like the district court, we reject appellant\u2019s assertion that, \u201cin dissipating localized heat without distortion, the flat expanded metal performs an additional and different function in the combination claimed than it had ever performed out of it.\u201d We think this latter contention is substantially refuted by testimony revealing that the patentee, John, as an engineer, was bound to admit his knowledge of the familiar principle \u201cthat metal expands when it is heated\u201d, and logically must have known that any available metal with open spaces or holes in it which provided room for heat expansion, as well as the other claimed advantage of added ventilation for steam escape, would not be subject to an inordinate amount of buckling or other heat distortion. In fact, John\u2019s own testimony fairly shows that his awareness of this problem prompted his prior use of woven wire screen to prevent buckling, and that his subsequent and allegedly novel inventive contribution in using flat expanded metal in place of woven wire mesh screen was just \u201ca logical extension of the same idea.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It further seems to us that, irrespective of whether the Trial Court correctly viewed the prior art and John's earlier filed patent No. 2,320,607 as establishing \u201cthat woven wire, expanded metal lath and flat expanded metal are fully equivalent materials\u201d for ironing table top use, the evidence does fairly support appellee\u2019s assertion that flat expanded metal, like any other metal with openings in its surface known to the prior art, has certain inherent advantages for ventilation and heat resistant purposes, the effectiveness of which varies directly according to the extent of open area provided and the degree of heat applied. While John may have been the first to apply these known variable factors to the production of a more efficient ironing table top made of flat expanded metal, we agree with appellee and the District Court that his successful experimentation is more appropriately characterized as skilled artisan-ship of the trade, rather than true invention. Without belaboring further facts and principles which we think clearly support the Trial Court\u2019s holding,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we think its ultimate conclusion as to the invalidity of Claim 1 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>John patent must be sustained. Great A. &amp; P. Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., supra; Sinclair &amp; Carroll Company v. Interchemical Corp., 325 U.S. 327, 65 S.Ct. 1143, 89 L.Ed. 1644; Texas-Miller Hat Corp. v. Switzer Bros., Inc., 5 Cir., 201 F.2d 824, 825; A. O. Smith Corp. v. Affiliated Gas Equipment, Inc., 5 Cir., 205 F.2d 654; Johnston Formation Testing Corp. v. Halliburton, 5 Cir., 88 F.2d 270, 272; Richie v. Lewis-Browning Mfg. Co., Inc., 5 Cir., 196 F.2d 434; see also General Electric Co. v. Jewel Incandescent Lamp Co., 326 U.S. 242, 66 S.Ct. 81, 90 L.Ed. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">We further agree with the appellee and district court that appellant failed to prove it had acquired any such secondary meaning from the alleged distinctive appearance of its ironing table as would justify any broad injunctive relief based on its charge of unfair competition, both for the reason that it has permitted its device to be sold under other trade-names and trade-marks and through other outlets to such an extent that it could not have been associated exclusively in the public mind with appellant as the source, and for the addi-</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">tional reason that the novel appearance of the flat expanded metal top of appellant\u2019s ironing table, being functional and a result of a well known manufacturing process, may not acquire any secondary meaning which would render it subject to exclusive appropriation by anyone in the trade. See Application of Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Co., 204 F.2d 287, 40 C.C.P.A., Patents, 990; Mastercraft-ers Clock &amp; Radio Co. v. Yacheron Watches, Inc., D.C.N.Y., 119 F.Supp. 209; Lektro-Shave Corp. v. General Shaver Corporation, 2 Cir., 92 F.2d 435; Smith, Kline &amp; French Laboratories v. Waldman, D.C.E.D.Pa., 69 F.Supp. 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Finally, and with sole reference to appellee\u2019s cross-appeal, we think it clear that since appellant has never alleged or seriously contended that the publication of the disputed material actually constituted unfair competition and since we further view the evidence as failing affirmatively to establish that appellant. has acquired any trade-mark rights or secondary meaning in the merely descriptive words and terms employed in appellee\u2019s advertising,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> these particular findings of the Trial Court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>its conclusion based thereon, which actually grant only nominal rather than any substantial relief, must be reversed, together with that portion of the judgment taxing one-fourth of the costs against appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">The judgment is hereby affirmed on the main appeal, and reversed on the cross-appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-7\">. The failure to join the manufacturer of the accused device as a party defendant in this suit is not material, in view of appellant\u2019s option under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271 to charge with infringement \u201cwhoever without authority <em>ma\u00edces, uses or sells </em>any patented invention,\u201d etc. (Emphasis ours.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\">. Elat expanded metal is defined in appellant\u2019s brief, \u201cas a sheet of metal that has been slit, stretched and flattened in such a manner that it is left with alternately staggered rows of profusely distributed diamond-shaped openings, presenting substantial free open area, without removing material from tlxe sheet, and the stretching and flattening operations are such as to create tension within the material giving it more supporting strength than would be present in a sheet of metal having a corresponding amount of free open area but in which the openings are formed by punching or otherwise removing material from the sheet.\u201d Elat expanded metal is not only fire proof, but has a smooth surface and tension properties resulting from the cold stretching process by which it is made, which increases its strength. It is also of light weight and comparatively inexpensive to make.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b364-6\">. In addition to its holding that appellee\u2019s table did not infringe upon the express language of the Claim, the Trial Court further noted that \u201cClaim 1 of the patent in suit is not' entitled to any range of equivalency such as would bring the defendant\u2019s structure within the terms of such a claim,\u201d citing this Court\u2019s decisions in Price-Trawick v. Gas Lift Corp., 5 Cir., 101 F.2d 134; Hughes v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 5 Cir., 88 F.2d 817; Texas Rubber &amp; Specialty Corp. v. D. &amp; M. Machine Works, 5 Cir., 81 F.2d 206.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b365-6\">. In brief, appellant admits that, \u201cThere is nothing in the John patent in suit, nor in its file wrapper, nor in this entire record, even remotely suggesting that John invented flat expanded metal as such. It is disclosed for use as shelving in the earlier patents to Clark, 1,259,210 of 1918, Griffith, 1,961,144 of 1934, and Mack, 2,141,400 of 3938; and for use as grills and partitions in Miller, 2,038,306 of 1936, and Otte, 2,018,085 of 1935. Flat expanded metal was also freely available in 1935 or 1936 * * *, and John himself testified that he had seen and knew about flat expanded metal prior to his invention.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\">. The particular problems resulting from the use of solid or perforated metal ironing table tops, as disclosed by the prior art, were dearly demonstrated by counsel for appellant upon the oral argument. Their demonstration revealed that, when a sufficiently heated iron is applied to an ironing pad covering such solid or perforated metal top, the top will buckle or bulge in the particular spot to which the iron is applied. Obviously, this buckling or distortion disrupted that flat, smooth surface needed for an efficient ironing operation. In addition, the briefs reveal that other problems were encountered to a greater or lesser degree in the use of wooden and other type metal ironing tables revealed by the prior art, such as warping or cracking, inadequate ventilation to provide steam escape, lack of required strength, undesirably rough surface, higher costs of manufacture, etc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b366-5\">. Assuming Claim l\u2019s validity, we think it might reasonably be urged that the structural differences relied upon by the Trial Court and appellee between appellant\u2019s and appellee\u2019s devices are insufficient to avoid infringement under a reasonable application of the doctrine of equivalents. See Jeoffroy Mfg., Inc., v. Graham, 5 Cir., 206 F.2d 772, 778.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b366-6\">. The advertising circulars and publications cited, which were not considered by the Patent Office, suggested uses for flat expanded metal in lieu of woven wire, perforated metal, etc., as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">\u201cIf the needs of your business require woven <em>xoire </em>mesh, <em>perforated metal </em>or wire rod panels for manufacturing and maintenance uses, you can profit by the convenience and economy of Red Top Econo Mesh. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">\u201cWhether or not an open mesh material is used in the product you make, examine these Shelf-X samples * * * Larger samples for experimental purposes will be gladly furnished without cost as well as an engineering design service. Let us show you how you can do a better job with Shelf-X.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-12\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ai6-dedup-0\">\u201cShelf-X makes a better product where a rigid, open mesh material is required * * * Easy to fabricate * * * Flat smooth surface * * * Attractive design * * * Economical * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b366-14\">. Appellee forcibly contends, and the Trial Court found, that this claimed presumption of the patent\u2019s validity arising from its due issuance by the Patent Office is here upset by the failure of the Patent Office to consider the most pertinent prior art references. See Jacuzzi Brothers, Inc., v. Berkeley Pump Co., 9 Cir., 191 F.2d 632, and Jeoffroy Mfg., Inc., v. Graham, supra, note 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b367-4\">. The patentee, John, testified;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">\u201cQ. And then you thought of the woven wire screen, in order to prevent that buckling? A. To prevent the buckling and to provide ventilation from the lower side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">\u201cQ. Now, did that woven wire screen prevent buckling and provide ventilation? A. I believe it did to some extent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">\u201cQ. Now, just when did you think about using fiat expanded inetal in place of the woven wire screen? A. I couldn\u2019t give you an exact date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">\u201cQ. Do you remember any of the circumstances that caused you to think about that? A.

At that time had you seen expanded metal? A. Oh, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b367-11\">.

Although appellee\u2019s advertisement does use certain common descriptive words also employed by appellant, such as \u201call steel\u201d, \u201cventilated\u201d and \u201crigid\u201d, and further uses ordinary sales language imply<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>ing that its table \u201cmakes ironing easier, safer, faster, better\u201d, etc., in a manner similar to that employed by appellant, we think it clear even from a cursory inspection of these two advertising exhibits that there is no such similarity or possibility of deception of the buying public exhibited therein which could ordinarily result from their simultaneous use as would justify the grant of any injunctive relief, particularly since appellee\u2019s trademark, \u201cMurray Steel-Top\u201d, and the additional identifying phrase, \u201cProduct of Murray Metal Products Company\u201d, are prominently displayed both at the top and bottom of appellee\u2019s advertisement, in a way which substantially distinguishes it from appellant\u2019s product.
