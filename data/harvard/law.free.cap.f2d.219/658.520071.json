The case, which arose out of a grade crossing accident, was tried to the court who made full findings of fact. Those findings depend upon his acceptance of one line of testimony which was inconsistent with the evidence given for the plaintiff. This is the type of case where Rule 52(a), 28 U.S.C., is, by its own terms, especially applicable. The court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous. There is no disputed proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-22\">The judgment of the district court, 122 F.Supp. 481, will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
