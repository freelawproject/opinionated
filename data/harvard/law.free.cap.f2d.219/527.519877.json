The question presented is whether a corporation engaged in ordinary business activities for profit is entitled to exemption from income tax under \u00a7 101(6) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A., solely by reason of the fact that its profits are payable to religious, charitable or educational enterprises.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Petitioner was organized under the laws of Arizona in March, 1947. Its in-corporators and directors are Ralph H. Eaton and wife and-one Kent. It has no capital stock and its articles prohibit the issuance of any. The articles state that the purpose of the corporation is to foster and promote religious, charitable and educational enterprises, and that it does not contemplate pecuniary gain or profit to the members thereof. Clearly, however, the corporation itself was not intended to operate and did not operate as a religious, educational or charitable institution. What was purposed was only that the profits from its various business activities would be turned over to such institutions. In a word, petitioner is a \u201cfeeder\u201d corporation whose principal activities have not the remotest connection with any religious, charitable or educational enterprise. The record shows that it engaged actively and exclusively in various commercial or business enterprises, namely farming, selling of real estate lots, the selling of sport clothes, and in a construction business.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">At the beginning petitioner adopted a list of 26 named beneficiaries engaged in charitable or religious work to whom its funds would, at its discretion, be made available. Later seven additional named beneficiaries were added to its list. These lists were compiled after investigation of each of the organizations. All of the latter had to be and were engaged in activities which carried out the purposes and ideas for which petitioner had been established. None of them had any private, beneficial or personal interest in the petitioner. During the period in controversy petitioner had net income in excess of $80,000 and made contributions to beneficiaries in the total amount of $6,550. The good faith or the benign objective of petitioner\u2019s founders is not questioned, nor is it disputable that land and other valuable property interests, plus personal services, were donated to petitioner by the Eatons. Nevertheless we may note the obvious possibility that petitioner\u2019s net earnings may in the future inure to private individuals or heirs of its founders. There is no prohibition in the corporate articles against the ultimate reversion of its undistributed earnings or assets in event petitioner is liquidated at the end of its corporate life of 25 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">Petitioner\u2019s reliance is on \u00a7 101(6) of the Code. During the tax years in question that statute provided in material part as follows: \u201cExemptions from tax on corporations. The following organizations shall be exempt from taxation under this chapter\u2014 * * * (6) Corporations, and any community chest, fund, or foundation, organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, * * * no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>any private shareholder or individual * # -X- <em>\u00bb </em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The Ninth Circuit has not gone overboard in its application of this statute. Cf. Bear Gulch Water Co. v. Commissioner, 116 F.2d 975. In the more recent case of Squire v. Students Book Corporation, 9 Cir., 191 F.2d 1018, 1020, we held that an incorporated bookstore which was owned or entirely controlled by Washington State College and whose earnings were devoted solely to the purposes of that institution was exempt under \u00a7 101(6). We observed that the court had not committed itself to the ultimate destination test frequently applied elsewhere. We said that \u201cResolution of the case before us does not depend wholly on the ultimate destination of the taxpayer\u2019s profits. The business enterprise in which taxpayer is engaged obviously bears a close and intimate relationship to the functioning of the College itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">A number of the circuits have given the statute very broad or liberal scope, applying in cases more or less analogous to the present what is known as the ultimate destination test. At this late date no useful purpose would be served by dwelling on those decisions. The bulk of them are cited and to a degree analyzed by the Fourth Circuit in United States v. Community Services, 189 F.2d 421, 424, certiorari denied 342 U.S. 932, 72 S.Ct. 375, 96 L.Ed. 694, where the ultimate destination test was rejected. The court, speaking through Judge Do-bie, thought that the taxpayer involved was in eifeet organized and operated for two purposes: (1) to engage in commercial business for profit, and (2) to turn over the profits realized from those commercial activities to charitable organizations. It said that \u201cthe second purpose is charitable; the first purpose clearly is not. To qualify for the exemption here, the corporation must be \u2018organized and operated <em>exclusively </em>for <em>* * </em>* charitable <em>* </em>* * purposes.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">In the case before us it would appear that none of the activities in which petitioner actually engaged was charitable or religious. All were of a business or commercial nature. But assuming the function of turning over the profits was an activity or operation it certainly was not the principal one. We agree with the Fourth Circuit that the word \u201cexclusively\u201d as used in the statute must be given effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\">. Congress in tlie Revenue Act of 3950 has in eifeet amended the section to exclude expressly the right to exemption of feeder corporations such as petitioner. The legislation is quoted in footnote 1 of this court\u2019s opinion in Squire v. Students Book Corp., 9 Cir., 191 F.2d 1018, at page 1020.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
