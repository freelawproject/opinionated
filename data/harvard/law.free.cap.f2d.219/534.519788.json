They insist, though, that the section was not applicable to this case because the United States did not establish that the lienor, the violator Linwood, had a record or reputation. This is the way ap-pellees state the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-12\">\u201cThus in the instant case there is solely one issue to be determined by the court: Has the United States established that Joe Marvin Linwood had such a reputation within the contemplation of Section 3617(b) (3) Title 18, United States Code. If so, then the applications for remission should be denied, since the required inquiry was not made. If not, therefore, the applications for remission may be granted since in that event an inquiry was not required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">In support of this contention, appellees insist that the answer of the government\u2019s witness, N. W. Yick, to the inquiry whether he knew the reputation of Linwood, \u201cHis reputation ever since I have known him, which has been over a period of some two years or better, of being an illicit whiskey dealer in a major way\u201d was sufficient proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-14\">The United States replies that no contrary proof was offered by the appel-lees, that the district judge did not find to the contrary of or otherwise discredit this testimony, but that, on the contrary, he decided the case in favor of lienors, not because Linwood did not have a reputation but because he thought that since claimants had testified that they did not know, and had not heard, that Linwood had a reputation, they were relieved from making the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-15\">This will not do. Upon the record in this case, the section invoked by the United States applies, and since claimants confessedly did not comply with it, they were not entitled to mitigation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-16\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to deny the claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-11\">.
