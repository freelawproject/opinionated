The former Collector of Internal Revenue having resigned, this suit was properly brought against the United States under the authority of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1346(a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-20\">The tax was assessed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue under the provisions of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3460.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The movements involved were between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Pan American Refining Corporation\u2019s fee-owned, fence-enclosed tract of some 500 acres, through pipe lines owned by Pan American laid on rights of way acquired as easements some 1% to 2% miles through a highly industrialized area of Texas City, Texas, to a leased dock-site of 1% acres (held under 50-year lease by Pan American), such movements being both incoming crude from ship and barge and outgoing refined products loaded on ship and barge.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">The Government based its right to tax these movements on the proposition that (1) this was \u201ctransportation of crude petroleum and liquid products thereof by pipe line\u201d within the language of \u00a7 3460(a); (2) that, since no charge for transportation was actually made (since the movement was entirely handled by Pan American and not by any carrier) the movements came within paragraph (2) of \u00a7 3460(a). The Commissioner rejected the idea that the movements were exempt under \u00a7 3460(c) as being within the term \u201cany movement through lines of pipe within the premises of a refinery * * * not a continuation of a taxable transportation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The taxpayer contended, and the trial judge agreed, that the movements were not taxable, relying principally on the amendment to the statute enacted in 1942, but also on the finding that the movements here in question were not \u201csubstantially similar to those by pipe line carriers.\u201d These two circumstances, i. e., the exemption created in \u00a7 3460(c) and the finding of fact that the movements were not \u201csubstantially similar,\u201d the court found to require a distinction from the case of McKeever v. Fontenot, 5 Cir., 104 F.2d 326, and to cause it to follow the holding in Republic Oil Refining Co. v. Granger, 3 Cir., 198 F.2d 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">The facts with respect to the physical lay-out of the properties, their acquisition as a part of an integrated plan, their connections and operations were fully and ably set out by the court below in its well-considered opinion <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and will not be repeated fully here. However, it is necessary for an understanding of our discussion that some of these facts be repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">In 1933 appellee, having determined to build a refinery having access to deep water transportation, purchased a tract of land in fee consisting of some 400 to 500 acres situated 1% to <em>2y2 </em>miles from the harbor line at Texas City, Texas. It also leased a tract of 1.01 acres along the waterfront referred to as \u201cdocksite\u201d and acquired easement rights over the property in between, called the \u201ceasement corridor.\u201d All three types of property were acquired, as the trial court found, as an integral part of appellee\u2019s program to construct and operate its refinery. On the fee property it constructed a large refinery, erected storage tanks, loading and unloading facilities on the dock-site and laid pipe lines to the refinery through which crude was transported to the refinery and refined products from the refinery to the docks where they were delivered on shipboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">Delivery of crude from the tankers was accepted as complete at the dock, and in turn, delivery of the finished products was also made and accepted only from the dock. Appellee constructed facilities at the dock-site for pumping the crude from barges which had no pumping power, but the tankers propelled with their own pumps, by use of an appropriate connection, the crude through ap-pellee\u2019s pipe lines to the refinery tanks, an average of some two miles from the dock.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Some 2,000 feet northeast of appellee\u2019s refinery Stone Oil Company, another corporation, also erected a refinery and was allowed to connect its pipe line to ap-pellee\u2019s in the corridor about mid-way between the docks and refinery, which allowed it to use appellee\u2019s pipes for the same purpose of receiving crude and shipping its finished products. In 1948 appellee bought the Stone Refinery. Transportation taxes upon all crude and refined products transported through the corridor for the years 1942-47 and a part of 1943 were paid by appellee under protest and this suit for refund followed on the contention that the tax was not due.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">During the trial the Government conceded that movements between the main fenced-in single tract originally occupied by Pan American and the Stone tract, some 2,000 feet distant, were not subject to the tax. These movements were in all respects similar to the movements to .the doeksite which the Commissioner claims to be taxable except for the greater length of the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Prior to the amendment of 1942, which added the exemption in paragraph (c), the test of taxability, when the movement was by the refiner and not by a carrier, was based on the courts\u2019 construction and application of Treasury Regulation 42, Art. 26, paraphrased \u201c * * * \u2018all transportation\u2019 shall include transportation by private owner whenever the movement is substantially similar to movements which pipe line carriers usually undertake and perform, if the movement is not merely local or incidental to another business or related business engaged in by the person so transporting, such as to the producer or refiner of said oil.\u201d The courts\u2019 opinions construing this Regulation had finally settled upon a formula that the transportation was taxed if it was \u201csubstantially similar to movements which pipe line carriers usually undertake and perform\u201d and if it was not a step in the \u201crefinery process.\u201d [104 F.2d 328.]</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">In McKeever v. Fontenot, supra, the taxpayer owned a solid body of land fronting on the Mississippi River on which a large refinery was built, including tanks into which the crude was pumped from tankers, barges, etc. The transportation tax, Sec. 731, Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3460, 3461, was imposed only on the finished petroleum products from storage tanks (some 37 in number) to vessels at the wharf, distances ranging from 3,600 to 5,500 feet. In that case we construed the applicable Act of 1932 and the Treasury regulations made thereunder, particularly No. 42, discussed above. We noted as determinative in that case that the lower court had found the movements from storage tanks to vessels were \u201csubstantially similar to [those] by pipe line carriers,\u201d and \u201cwere not incidental to the refining of oil, but were movements which took place after all refinery processes had been completed and were movements toward market.\u201d We concluded that the facts sustained the lower court\u2019s findings that the transportation was \u201csubstantially similar to\u201d those by pipe line carriers. Based on this finding we affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment that the transportation from the storage tank to the ship loading platform was taxable even though the pipe lines there involved were located entirely on the fee-owned contiguous tract occupied by the refinery. The distance involved was a maximum of approximately one mile.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\"> Here, however, the trial court made an opposite finding of fact as to the movements of the Texas City refinery of appellee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, even if, as the Government here contends, there had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>no liberalization of the definition of \u201ctransportation\u201d by reason of the enactment of paragraph (c) by the amendment of 142, it is highly questionable whether this court could hold that the movements here in issue were taxable, in the face of the express findings by the trial court. The court\u2019s findings in these respects were clearly supported by the evidence. In fact, it is quite difficult to comprehend how a carrier other than the refinery company itself could handle this type of movement. To be sure, movements of equal or even less distance unquestionably can be handled by common carriers, but that is quite different from a movement, as is here involved, between several installations of the refinery owner. As the trial court said, it was not \u201cthe type of service normally and customarily performed by common carrier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">Next we turn our attention to the express exemption contained in paragraph (c). In its zeal to discover a congressional purpose and a construction supporting the taxability of movements of the type here involved, the Government finds itself in a serious inconsistency, arguing extensively both in its brief and in oral argument that the exemption paragraph enacted as paragraph (c) was intended as a further restriction rather than as a liberalization of the definition of \u201ctransportation.\u201d The Government nevertheless concedes, and rightly so we think, in its reply brief that \u201cthe movements involved in the McKeever case, supra, would now be exempt because they took place entirely within the area in which refining occurred.\u201d This concession is completely inconsistent with the other argument which in effect is that in order to be excluded the movement must satisfy the requirements of the former Treasury Regulations as construed by the courts to mean that they were not \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to movements which pipeline carriers usually undertake and that they were \u201cincidental to the refinery processes\u201d and that they must also be found to take place \u201cwithin the premises of a refinery.\u201d Since, in the McKee-ver case, the court specifically found that the movements there constituted \u201ctransportation\u201d under the existing statute and regulations, then, if the movements involved in McKeever would now be exempt, as conceded by the Government, it must follow that this exemption would arise only because such movements as are \u201cwithin the premises of a refinery\u201d were intended by the amendment to be excluded even though they constituted \u201ctransportation\u201d as otherwise contemplated in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">However, we think it clear, without reference to the Government\u2019s concession, that the amendment was intended to liberalize the definition of \u201ctransportation.\u201d No legislative history, in the usual sense, is available to aid the courts in construing the language of paragraph (e). This leaves the court with the duty of taking the language and giving to each of the phrases contained in the amendment the ordinary meaning in the light of existing legislation and existing court interpretations of the statute. It would have been difficult for Congress more clearly to have expressed the intent to remove from taxable transactions all movements of oil through lines of pipe within the premises of the refinery than by the choice of the language embodied in paragraph (c). The exemption paragraph specifically refers to and thus defines the very term \u201ctransportation\u201d which had theretofore been the subject of numerous court decisions, the language being \u201cFor the purposes of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>section, the term \u2018transportation\u2019 shall not include any movement through lines of pipe within the premises of a refinery * * It is difficult to see how it can seriously be argued that this exemption should be construed to mean that even though a movement was through lines of pipe within the premises of refinery, it would nevertheless constitute \u201ctransportation\u201d for the purpose of this section unless it was also exempt under the standards of construction then current by virtue of existing Treasury Regulations and court decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Moreover, it is clear that the Treasury Department, acting through the Acting Secretary, considered that this amendment worked a liberalization in the definition of \u201ctransportation.\u201d Although the Government, in its brief, stated, \u201cThe Congressional history of Section 3460(c) provides very little explanation of the reason for the adoption of the amendment,\u201d the brief devoted five pages to the thesis that the introduction by individual members of Congress of proposed amendments that might have had an even more liberalizing effect, establishes some sort of legislative history to which weight should be given in our construction of the language of the Act which was finally passed. We agree with the Government\u2019s initial statement that there is no significant legislative history to aid in the construction of this legislation. In its recitation, however, the Government\u2019s brief includes a letter addressed by the Acting Secretary of the Treasury to the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives, which we deem quite significant if the views of the depart- \u25a0 ment having the duty of administering the statute involved were necessary as an aid to our construction of the meaning of the law. The Acting Secretary\u2019s letter <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> clearly shows that in the opinion of the Treasury Department the definition of \u201ctransportation\u201d was working inequities in the light of the McKeever decision, and that such inequities should be eliminated. Such a view is of course inconsistent with a contention that there was no intent to modify the definition of \u201ctransportation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">We should now consider whether even though the movements here involved would not be exempt under the statute prior to the 1942 amendment, the movements are nevertheless exempt by virtue of paragraph (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Republic Oil Refining Co. v. Granger, 198 F.2d 161, has held that similar movements are exempt by reason of their falling within the language of paragraph (c). In fact the movements involved in the Republic case are in the same neighborhood as, and actually parallel, the movements that are here in question, since the Republic Oil Refinery Company is a neighbor in Texas City of Appellee. More than ordinary consideration should therefore be given to the decision of that court. On this phase of the question, very little more need be said beyond the carefully reasoned opinion of Judge Hastie, speaking for the majority of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">It must be conceded we think that the words \u201cwithin the premises of a refinery\u201d have no definite legal meaning. We agree with the opinion of the Third Circuit that technical rules applying to real estate holdings are not controlling. However, all parties here concede that the easement corridors occupied by appellee\u2019s pipe line are appurtenant to the fee-owned property, and there can be no question but that the docksite held under a fifty-year lease loses none of its characteristics as \u201cpremises\u201d merely because it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>held under lease instead of being owned in fee. The Government\u2019s contention, therefore, on this branch of the case, as is clearly indicated by its concession relating to the McKeever type situation, comes to this: If the refinery installation comprises a single contiguous, plainly marked tract of land to which the taxpayer owns full rights to possession, movements of petroleum products from ship to refinery and from storage tank to ship are exempt from taxation, even though the closest installation dealing with the actual refining function is as much as 5500 feet from the ship; whereas if the machinery and equipment relating strictly to the refinery function is on a well defined contiguous tract, which is at a distance from the ship of more than would be represented by the \u201ccrossing of rights-of-way, streets, highways, railroads, levees, or narrow bodies of water,\u201d such movements are taxable, if such movements take place along easements connecting the tract to refinery owned docks, even though tract, easement and dock were all acquired and developed for the purpose of establishing a refinery having access to deep water. We think that within the context of the statute as it stood before the McKeever decision, the language adopted by Congress in paragraph (c) was not intended to create such an unnatural distinction but was intended rather to exclude from the term \u201ctransportation\u201d local movements controlled by a refinery as a part of its integrated refining and loading operation so long as they occur in its premises, however owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The difficulty of applying any different standard is apparent from the lack of uniformity in treatment by the Commissioner. It will be noted that in the McKeever case the Commissioner did not seek to tax the inflow of petroleum products, although no logical distinction can be perceived why this would not be \u201ctransportation\u201d in the same way as was the delivery from refinery to ship which was taxed in McKeever. It will also be noted that in this case below the Commissioner conceded that movements between the fee-owned tract originally occupied by Pan American and the fee-owned tract originally owned by Stone Refining Company, a distance of some 2000 feet, were exempt from the tax, after appellee bought the Stone property. These movements were through pipe lines along easement corridors identical with the movements along the easement corridors from the main Pan American fee-owned tract to the docksite, and as the trial judge properly found the exemption of this movement by the Commissioner was clearly inconsistent with his insistence on the taxability of the other movements. The rule announced in the Republic case and as applied by the trial court here, makes possible a more uniform application of the statute than would be possible under the construction urged on us by the Government. This is also of persuasive effect in supporting our opinion that the judgment of the trial court clearly carried out the intent of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">DAWKINS, District Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-9\">. \u201c\u00a7 8460.

Undoubtedly this is true, and I suspect that bad plaintiff and its neighbor Republic been unable to acquire the necessary easements between their fee premises and the water front, some common carrier pipe line, with the right of eminent domain, would have made these services available. But the fact that under other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>circumstances some common carriers do furnish the service is not sufficient to convince me that it is the type of service normally and customarily performed by common carrier. On the contrary, I find that it is normal and customary for such transportation as is in issue here to be handled by the taxpayer, or one in its position, as an incidental part of its over-all refining operation; it is more economical and practical for it to be handled by ordinary refinery personnel; and that the services of a common carrier are availed of only when the circumstances demand it.

The proposed legislation would eliminate existing inequities, yet, if certain slight alterations in language are made, would retain well-defined standards for administration of the tax on transportation by pipe line.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
