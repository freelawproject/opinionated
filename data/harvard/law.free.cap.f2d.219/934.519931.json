Its purpose is to transport taxpayer up and down stairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">The critical tax year is 1948. On November 24, 1947 petitioner, then sixty-four, suffered an attack of coronary thrombosis with definite damage to the anterior artery. She was hospitalized the same day and so confined until January 15, 1948 when she was removed to her home. During the early part of 1948 she had marked insomnia and anxiety neurosis coupled with depression. She had no bedroom or bath on the first floor of her home. Her physician, Dr. Lawrence Wechsler, who had treated her since 1937, prescribed for her a complete slow down program. He does not pretend in his testimony that this could or would cure thrombosis but he does say regarding the effect of such treatment upon people so afflicted that \u201cThey can live their life for many, many years, but they must live it on a lower plane. Whether they eat or drink or walk, you see, they must, as I say, live their life on a lower plane.\u201d As part of this method of keeping her alive he did not wish her to climb stairs and tried to persuade her to move to a one floor dwelling. Petitioner, living alone and attached to her home, refused. The doctor then advised her to have a stair elevator installed, not as a cure for the condition but to avoid another acute attack by preventing her from running up and down stairs. Parenthetically it is pleasing to note that Dr. Wechsler\u2019s program would seem to have been successful to date.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Whether a particular expenditure qualifies as a medical expense depends upon \u201cthe present existence or the imminent probability of * * * illness\u201d and proof that such expenditure was <em>\u201cincurred primarily for </em>the prevention or mitigation of the particular * * * illness.\u201d Stringham v. Commissioner, 1949, 12 T.C. 580, 584, affirmed 6 Cir., 1950, 183 F.2d 579. See Havey v. Commissioner, 1949, 12 T.C. 409. This inclinator was installed solely to alleviate the thrombosis condition. With neither bathroom nor bedroom on the first floor of the Hollander home and with this elderly woman living alone, the necessity of her going from one floor to the other is apparent. The use, therefore, of the inclinator had a directly beneficial effect with respect to both present mitigation of taxpayer\u2019s serious illness and future avoidance of a crisis provoking source with respect to it. It has helped importantly to enable her to live with less physical effort; as her doctor described it, \u201con a lower plane\u201d. In caring for herself she was forced to move about her house. By means of the stair elevator she has been saved from a very real source of strain on her heart which could and probably would have caused a recurrence of the acute stage of the disease. Dr. Wech-sler by his slowing down treatment was striving to prevent that perhaps fatal consequence. Under such circumstances the Commissioner\u2019s argument that the inclinator was not \u201cproximately related\u201d to the imminent recurrence of petitioner\u2019s thrombosis has no merit whatsoever. The argument, if it ever had any weight, now flies in the face of the Tax Court\u2019s specific finding of fact that Dr. Wechsler\u2019s purpose in having petitioner obtain the inclinator \u201cwas to prevent her from doing any further damage to her heart.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">As we understand it, the Tax Court\u2019s position, unlike that of the Commissioner,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is that regardless of the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>'.stances the cost of an inclinator cannot 'be a medical expense because an inclinator is by its inherent nature a capital item. We now address ourselves to that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">The Tax- Court, inferentially at least, seems to agree that the contraption involved adds nothing to the value of the house. Aside from its appearance it clutters up the stairs to a considerable degree. From the photograph of it, Exhibit No. 1 in evidence, it is difficult to imagine adults using it unless forced \u25a0to do so by illness but at the same time 'it could be a dangerously attractive nuisance to children. A witness who has had the exclusive agency for the sale of inclinators in Western Pennsylvania since 1929 testified at the Tax Court hearing that \u201cthe inclinator is purchased by people who are unable to walk stairs or forbidden to walk stairs\u201d, and that to his knowledge he had never installed an inclinator in the home of a family in robust health.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">The Tax Court\u2019s sole reason for holding the inclinator to be a capital item of a personal nature and its cost not a medical expense is apparently that the inclinator had a useful life and a period of benefit to this petitioner extending far beyond 1948. The Commissioner\u2019s own regulations, however, include a medical deduction for \u201cartificial teeth \u25a0or limbs.\u201d Regulations 118, Section 39.23(x)-l. The 1954 edition of \u201cHow To Prepare Your Income Tax Return\u201d ' which is prepared by the Internal Revenue Service as an aid to taxpayers lists eyeglasses, artificial teeth and braces as allowable. medical and dental expenses; the 1953 edition also listed crutches, hearing aids \u201cand similar items\u201d; and a special Treasury Department pamphlet, \u201cYour Federal Income Tax\u201d (1953 ed.), included Seeing Eye dogs. And the Tax Court itself has allowed medical expense deductions for elastic stockings and eyeglasses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> All of these items can have a useful life and period of benefit to the particular taxpayer extending far beyond the year of deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">.The Tax Court relied upon Estate of Hayne v. Commissioner, 1954, 22 T.C. 113. While that opinion rests on alternative theories, the facts there are radically different from the present situation. As the court said in the Hayne opinion, \u201cThe use of the elevator was not intended to have and had no beneficial effect upon the mitigation or cure of the paralytic condition of the decedent. Its primary function was to solve a transportation problem, resulting from wishes of the decedent to get out of his room, which were merely incidental to the illness.\u201d The other decision cited by the Tax Court, Seymour v. Commissioner, 1950, 14 T.C. 1111, concerned the cost of putting an oil burner into a home. The court disallowed that as a medical expense because it was \u201ca permanent improvement in petitioner\u2019s property.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>It seems to us that we are here dealing with a true medical expense under the letter and spirit of the Code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The cost of the inclinator was directly within the definition of medical care as given in Section 23 (x). It was an amount \u201cpaid for the * * * mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body * * It should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">The decision of the Tax Court will be reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-10\">.

Though we express no opinion on the va- ' lidity of the Hayne and Seymour decisions it should be noted that both the elevator in the H\u00e1yne case and the oil burner in the Seymour case appear, at first glance at least, to fall within the specific exception provided by Section 24(a) (2) of tbe Internal Revenue Code of 1939, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-13\">\u201c\u00a7 24.
