Appellant\u2019s assumption that the question is presented is based on its further assumption that on December 31, 1941, W. D. Cole and E. S. Cole each made a gift to his wife of only $25,000.00 of his capital investment in the partnership, and the latter assumption is not borne out by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-22\">The evidence discloses that on December 31, 1941, the partnership had total assets of $239,989.75; that $125, 000.00 was carried on the books as the total invested capital, and over $100,-000.00 was carried as accounts payable to members of the firm, but actually used as working capital. On that day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>gifts were made to the wives <em>by </em>the husbands. The firm accountant, after examining the articles of partnership, advised them to return each gift for tax purposes at the sum of $25,000.00 and to enter a credit upon the company\u2019s books to each wife in such sum. That advice seems to have been the source of the confusion. Actually, each gift consisted of a two-tenths interest in the partnership assets, rather than of the sum of $25,000.00. That is conclusively shown by the legal documents which were the effective instruments of transfer of title. As to the real properties, a deed of that date conveyed to the wives - \u201ceach a two-tenth (2/10) interest.\u201d As to the personal properties, there was no separate bill of sale, but the \u201cArticles of Partnership\u201d entered into on the same date recited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-4\">\u201c(2) By agreement of all parties hereto Mrs. Maude Franks Cole and Mrs. Gwynneth Dunn Cole have now been admitted to said partnership, each owning an undivided two-tenths interest in said partnership.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">It follows that the district court did not err as claimed by the appellant, and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"A35\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-13\">. Pursuant to Rule 75(d), Fed.Rules Civ. Proc., 28 U.S.C.A., the appellant designated only the following points on which it intended to rely on this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-14\">\u201c1. The Court erred in rendering the final judgment in each of the above cases which was dated and entered November 3, 1953, in that the Court refused to enter judgment in each of the above cases predicated upon reallocation of the partnership interest or earnings for each of the wives as contended by the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-24\">\u201c2. The Court erred in refusing to reallocate the interest or earnings of each of the wives in the partnership in accordance with tlie principles enunciated in the case of Weiss v. Johnson [2 Cir.], 206 F.2d 350.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
