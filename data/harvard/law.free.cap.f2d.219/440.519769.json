The case is here for the second time. See Smith v. Acadia Overseas Freighters, 3 Cir., 1953, 202 F.2d 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-21\">It is now clear that the duty owed to a stevedore, so far as seaworthiness is concerned, is the same as that owed to members of the crew. Alaska Steamship Co., Inc. v. Petterson, 1954, 347 U.S. 396, 74 S.Ct. 601, 98 L.Ed. 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-22\">But the district judge found as a fact that the extension ladder which it is alleged hurt the plaintiff\u2019s finger was one with which he could find nothing wrong. He concludes \u201cconsequently, so far as this ladder is concerned, I can find no element of unseaworthiness.\u201d This finding is supported by direct' testimony as we read the record, and testimony which is worthy of credence. See McAllister v. United States, 1954, 348 U.S. 19, 75 S.Ct. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-23\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
