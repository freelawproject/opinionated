Swift &amp; Co., 186 Miss. 803, 191 So. 423; Capps v. Postal Telegraph-Cable Co., 197 Miss. 118, 19 So.2d 491; Downing v. City of Jackson, 199 Miss. 464, 24 So.2d 661; and Powelson v. National Airlines, Miss., 71 So.2d 467; holding that where a claim is based on, or arises out of, an illegal transaction, the illegality pervades and taints it and defeats all recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Appellee, in opposition, citing authorities <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and pointing out that in order for plaintiff to be barred of his action the unlawful act must be at once the source of both his criminal responsibility and his civil right, insists that the facts of this case do not bring it within the invoked principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">We agree with the appellee that this is so. In the Meador case, note 3, supra, the principle is thus stated by the Supreme Court of Mississippi:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">\u201cFor a plaintiff to be barred of an action for negligent injury under the principle of public policy implicit in the maxim ex dolo malo non oritur actio, his injury must have been suffered while and as a proximate result of committing an illegal act. The unlawful act must be at once the source of both his criminal responsibility and his civil right. The injury must be traceable to his own breach of the law and such breach must be an integral and essential part of his case. Where the violation of law is merely a condition and not a contributing cause of the injury, a recovery may be permitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">The district judge, in the part of his opinion dealing with this receipt, makes this crystal clear, when he states: that certain goods purchased by plaintiff and shipped to General, though placed in the area designated as Lawrence Warehouse, were not placed under warehouse receipts at that time; that some six months later this was discovered and on December 26, 1951, a receipt was issued for the portion of the goods then in the warehouse; and that this receipt not being satisfactory to plaintiff\u2019s accountant, the receipt previously issued was released and a receipt covering the entire shipment was issued on Dec. 28, 1951, at which time both parties knew a portion of .the goods was missing. After pointing out that the plaintiff had not previously requested a receipt for the goods and that there was no need for a receipt in connection with their financing as they were plaintiff\u2019s goods and not General\u2019s, the court goes on to find in effect that the receipt was not necessary to plaintiff\u2019s recovery and that the proofs showing the actual delivery of the goods and a shortage of $2555.12, he was entitled to recover this shortage.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-15\">Of the claims of appellant and appellee that the fact findings on the issues dealt with in the court\u2019s opinion were clearly erroneous, it is sufficient to say that we are of the clear opinion that none of them are well founded. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>the contrary, under the rule governing this court in the review of such findings, we must conclude not that they are, but that they are not, contrary to the truth and right of the case. Sanders v. Leech, 5 Cir., 158 F.2d 486, 487; Special Service Co. v. Delaney, 5 Cir., 172 F.2d 16, at page 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">In view, however, of appellant\u2019s earnest insistence that, in awarding appellee $7703.33 on account of shortages of merchandise under warehouse receipts purchased by plaintiff from the bank, it failed to credit appellant with $2000 of goods delivered on plaintiff\u2019s order and with $500 on account of miscalculations, we think we should say that a careful examination of the record convinces us that we ought not to overturn the court\u2019s conclusions. Indeed, we agree with the court\u2019s view that the defendant did not sustain its burden in the face of the fact that \u201cthe goods were not to be found, there were no signed releases, there was no record showing delivery to anyone of the goods defendant claims were released upon oral instructions, and where the goods and proceeds went remains as yet a matter of conjecture\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The judgment was right throughout. It is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-27\">. Nasif v. Lawrence Warehouse Company, D.C., 122 F.Supp. 562.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b585-10\">.
