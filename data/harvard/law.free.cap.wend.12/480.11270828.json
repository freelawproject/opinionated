Thus, where, in an action of debt upon a recognizance, all the issues were found for the plaintiff, except one upon a plea of <em>plene administravit, </em>which was found for the defendant, <em>it was held </em>that the plaintiff was entitled so costs upon the whole record; and was not liable to costs upon the issue found in favor of the defendant.</p><p id=\"b480-8\">This case is like the last proceding, of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Haddock, </em>except that the defendant put in a plea <em>o\u00ed plene adminis-travit, </em>and a verdict was found upon it in his favor. The defendant insisted upon the authority of the case of <em>Osterhaut </em>v. <em>Hardenburgh, administrator, </em>&amp;c., 19 Johns. R. 266, that he was entitled to <em>judgment for costs </em>upon the issue found in his favor ; but The Court held that the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment of assets <em>guando acciderint, </em>and to costs <em>de bonis testat\u00f3ris, </em>and under the provisions of the revised statutes, 2 R. S. 617, \u00a7 26, were not liable to costs to the defendant upon the issue found in his favor.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
