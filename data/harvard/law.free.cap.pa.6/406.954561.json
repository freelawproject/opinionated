Ejectment by Robert Sturgeon and six others in right of their wives, who, with said Robert, were the heirs at law of Jeremiah Sturgeon. A verdict passed for the plaintiffs, subject to the opinion of the court. The evidence was turned into a case stated, and the court (Grier, P. J.) thereupon gave judgment for defendant. Jeremiah Sturgeon, by his will in 1813 and 1815, devised as follows: \u2014 \u201c I will, or bequeath, unto my wife Mary, all my personal estate, together with the two lots and buildings thereon erected, whereon I iioav live, during her natural life or widowhood, she maintaining my younger children. And, if my wife can lease the Avhole, or any part, of the said lots to advantage for her and the children, I do authorize her so to do, or to sell the buildings and keep the ground on ground-rent.\u201d In the event of the marriage of his wife, he directed an equal distribution of his estate among his children, giving a specific lot to one of them for life, after the death or marriage of his wife \u2014 remainder to her children. The will then continued: \u201c The two lots, in the reserve tract, and the in-lots in the toAvn of Allegheny, No. 7 and 8, shall ,be leased, or sold, as my executors may think best, and all the residue of my lands which I own shall. be sold, or leased, as my executors may think most advantageous or beneficial for the legatees concerned.\u201d Testator nominated his wife and R. B. executors.

No other consideration appeared from the paper book.

Mary, the widow, in consideration of having the sum of $6000 made up to her by the other parties, as the price of her purpart, and receiving $100 from each of them to enable her to pay her debts, agreeing to release her life-estate to them, and they mutually agreeing to exchange releases among themselves. The agreement then proceeded to give an absolute release by the parties thereto to the said Mary, who further agreed to release all interest in the lands remaining unsold to the other parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-6\">Mary Sturgeon, the widow, having died, this ejectment was brought; and the judgment of the court assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-7\"><em>Dunlop </em>and <em>Bakeivell, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ate\">The conveyance is not under the power, and is of a greater estate than the grantor held, which was for life only.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AU2\">The devise before us is an obscure one ; but the legal construction of it is, that it did not give the widow, who was devisee for life, a power to part with the ground. The devisor gave her, while she lived, the personal property and the two lots with the buildings on them, and also power to sell the buildings and lease the ground. \u201cAnd, if my wife,\u201d said he, \u201c can <em>lease </em>the whole, or any part, of the said lots to advantage for her and the children, I do authorize h\u00e9r so to do, or to sell the buildings and <em>keep </em>the ground on ground-rent.\u201d What need of a special power to sell the. buildings, if she could sell the ground on which they stood? or why distinguish between.them for any purpose whatever ? A sale is not the less so because it is a sale on ground-rent; and a special power to sell, coupled with it, would be superfluous and absurd. But she was at liberty to <em>sell </em>the buildings and <em>keep </em>the ground on ground-rent \u2014 a provision which shows she had separate powers which were intended to be exhibited in contrast. The difficulty-is in the word ground-rent, which we use to signify the <em>redditus, </em>or render, reserved in a perpetual lease ; but the devisor was little skilled in the use of terms, and, in a clause immediately preceding the word, he spoke of the power as simply a power to lease. It is difficult to see how the words \u201ckeep the ground\u201d cbuld be satisfied by raising half the value from it for present purposes, and keeping the value of the residue for the family in the shape of a fee-farm rent. It must be admitted, however, that the actual intention of the testator is by no means clear.</p>\n<p id=\"AtZ\">On the other hand, the deed of family settlement bars, for the present, all who, executed it. It is true, that neither the mother\u2019s grantee, nor the defendants who \u25a0 claim by title derived from him, are party to it; but it is a plain agreement between the heirs, made in consideration of a valuable property received on the foot of it, to prevent the mother from being called to account for what she had done in respect to the estate. She was to be \u201creleased from all responsibility\u201d \u2014 to whom ? To any person. Though the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>parties used words of release, the contract is evidently an agreement. There seems to have been a doubt about the' extent of the power, and the agreement was intended to b\u00e9 a confirmation, of, her execution of. it. It was an act of family repose. But she was bound by a covenant of general warranty which passed with the ground to the defendants; and which would be broken .by a recovery in this ejectment; the consequence of which would be an immediate liability of her personal representative to the extent of her assets, including the property received by th.e plaintiffs. To prevent this circuity,' their agreement bars them, on the principle that a release of one joint obligor bars an action against the other. They were bound to .protect her in the only.way they could \u2014 by not pressing their title against the defendants. The agreement was a family settlement and ratification of past transactions, which a chancellor would enforce in all its relations for the sake of peace. ' It consequently bars Robert Sturgeon forever, and the husband of each daughter '; but not his wife, or her heirs, after his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">Judgment affirmed!</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
