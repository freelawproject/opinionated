And whenever the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>said account shall exceed $1500, the said auditor-general shall charge such officer fifty per cent, on the amount of said excess.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-4\">\u201c The Commonwealth claims of the defendant, who is the prothonotary of the Supreme Court arid Nisi Prius, $2141 16, which, it is alleged, is, fifty per cent, on the excess of his fees received by him, over $1500 per year. The Commonwealth gave in evidence the settlement made by the auditor-general and state treasurer of this account, on the 3d December, 1845, by which it appears that the above balance is due the Commonwealth; and it is from this settlement the defendant has appealed. There is no dispute about the amount of fees received; but the defendant claims to be allowed for clerk-hire and stationery, and that before the Comiponwealth can charge 50 per cent, on the excess, these necessary expenses should be deducted. The defendant, in sending in his yearly statements from 1st October, 1842, to 1st October, 1845, rendered his account for clerk-hire each year, and promptly remitted 50 per \u2022 cent, on the excess; and the question in dispute is, whether the defendant is entitled to be allowed the necessary expenses of clerks out of the excess over $1500. If he is, then there is nothing due the Commonwealth; if he is not, the balance, as stated, is due, and for it the Commonwealth is entitled to a-verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-5\">\u201c I am of the opinion, on a reference to the act of Assembly, that the auditor-general was right in disallowing the clerk-hire and stationery account. This may operate very hard on the'defendant; for it appears that it- is. necessary for him to have three clerks to aid him in properly discharging the duties of this important office, and that he has paid those clerks from $1200 to $1450 per .year. But the act of Assembly is clear and plain; and when so, the court cannot go beyond it, however hard the case may be \u2014 the legislature alone can afford relief. The defendant also contends that the act of 10th March, 1810, was repealed by the act of Assembly, 29th April, 1844, entitled\u2018An act to reduce the state debt, &amp;e.;\u2019 Pamph. Laws, 499. That under this act the legislature taxed all salaries and emoluments of office two per cent., and declared that \u2018all laws heretofore passed for levying taxes for state purposes are hereby repealed,\u2019 and that this repeal would affect at least a part of the claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-6\">\u2018\u2018This presents a very important question, for if it repeals all laws that bring in a revenue for state purposes, it must depreciate the revenue of the state in each year vastly. Large amounts are received yearly from the tax on offices, including prothonotaries, recorders, &amp;c., and tax on writs, and tavern and retailers\u2019 licenses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>&amp;c.; and if the repealing part of the act of\u2019 29th April, 1844, repeals the act of 10th March, 1810, entitled \u2018An act taxing certain officers,\u2019 I cannot see why it does not repeal all the -acts of Assembly by which revenue is secured to the state, and, if so, the act of 1844 would have an effect directly opposite to what was evidently intended by the legislature. Instead of its being \u00a3 An act to' reduce the state debt,\u2019 a\u00e1 it purports to be, it cuts off a large amount of the means of doing s.o. The language used is strong, and, at first, it would appear to repeal all laws imposing taxes for state purposes. The words are, \u00a3 All laws- heretofore passed, levying taxes, for state purposes, are hereby repealed.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-4\">\u00a3\u00a3 The language is certainly broad enough to include the repeal of the act of 6th April, 1830, which imposes a tax on writs, and from which a large revenue is derived. The title of this act is &lt; Ah act for the levy and collection of taxes upon proceedings in courts, &amp;e.\u2019 Notwithstanding no one has supposed that the tax on writs was repealed by the act of 29th April, 1844, and yet the title is for the levy and collection of taxes, &amp;c., and certain it is for state purposes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-5\">\u201c The repealing clause in the act of 1844, was, to say the least of it, carelessly drawn, and little considered by the legislature, for the words seem fairly to embrace that act, and to repeal it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AH4\">i \u00a3\u00a3 Yet I cannot for a moment believe that such was the intention of the legislature. The intention of the legislature has a controlling influence in the construction of statutes passed by them. It is one of the best tests to be applied, when from the words you are in doubt as to the meaning. In 3840, the history of our state furnishes abundant proof that our state was vastly in debt; and before that period we had gone on and borrowed money to pay the interest. Our legislature became convinced of the importance of providing in a more rational manner a fund to pay the interest, and to reduce the debt, if possible. On the 11th June, 1840, they passed an act, entitled \u00a3 An act to create an additional revenue, &amp;c.\u2019 In this act the legislature laid an additional tax on various articles not before taxed for state purposes. <em>In </em>this act they begin to use all the machinery used heretofore for the <em>raising and collecting county rates and levies, </em>-and on salaries and emoluments of office they laid a tax <em>of </em>one per cent, upon every dollar of the value thereof, and such additional rates and levies \u00a3 wore to be assessed and collected as county rates and levies are now collected.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-6\">\u2022\u00a3\u00a3 The following year, to wit: \u2014 1841, further provisions were made by the legislature \u00a3to provide revenue, &amp;c.,\u2019 to meet the demands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>of the treasurer. (See Pamph. Laws, page 807 and 310.) It is provided that in lieu of the taxes, imposed by the act of 11th June, 1840, upon salaries and emoluments of office, there shall be assessed and collected two per cent. Then followed the act of 29th April, 1844, (Pamph. Laws, 499,) entitled \u00abAn act to reduce the-state debt, &amp;c.\u2019 This act includes many articles for taxation for state purposes not before taxed, and requires the tax to be assessed and collected with the county rates and levies. The 34th section contains the repealing clause now under consideration \u2014 \u00abAll laws heretofore passed for levying taxes for state purposes are hereby'repealed.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-5\">\u00ab\u00abBy the whole course of legislation, from 1840, down, the legislature was evidently aiming to increase the taxes to meet the emergencies of the occasion: and with this object in view, when they said in the act of 1844, that \u00abAll laws heretofore, passed for <em>levying </em>taxes, &amp;c.,for state purposes, are hereby repealed,\u2019 they only meant such laws as were passed on the 11th June, 1840,'and 12th April, 1841, wherein, for the first time, they-began to make use of township and county officers for the <em>levying </em>the tax, and for collecting it as the county rates and levies were collected. I am therefore of the opinion that the 34th section of the act of 1844 does not repeal the act of 10th. March, 1810, (McKinney, 812,) entitled \u00abAn act taxing certain officers.\u2019 This construction is favored, also, by the proviso to this sam\u00e9 section, which provides, \u00abThat su'ch laws shall still be in force for the collection of all taxes due or <em>assessed by </em>virtue of such laws. This proviso is a clear indication. that the legislature had no idea of repealing any law in relation to revenues of the state, excepting those laws where the revenue was raised and collected with the county rates and levies by assessment, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-7\">\u00ab\u00abThe Commonwealth is entitled to recover.\u2019.\u2019 \u25a0 \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-8\">To this opinion and charge the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-9\">The jury returned a verdict for $2199 72, in favour of the plaintiff; whereupon the defendant sued out this writ of error, and assigned the following errors here:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-10\">1st.

The court ought to have charged the jury to find a verdict for the defendant, for the reasons stated in the appeal, from' the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>settlement of the accounts by the auditor-general and state treasurer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b116-3\"><em>Mg Oormiele </em>and <em>Meredith, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3g\">The question is, whether the plaintiff in error, under the act of 1810, should not be allowed for clerk-hire and stationery, out of the amount of fees received by him, before the Commonwealth can claim fifty per cent, on the excess over $1500. Is this act, for the purposes of taxation, \u2019to be construed on' the net or gross amount of fees received ? The act of 5th April, 1842, section 7, (Paraph. Laws, 238,) requiring the public officers of Philadelphia county to file in the office of the county treasurer a written statement, under oath, &amp;c., of the gross receipts and expenditures of their several offices, for clerk-hire, stationery, &amp;c., does not include the prothonotary of the Supreme Court; nor does the act of 21st April, 1846, section 10, (Dunlop, 968 :) and the necessary implication therefore is, that such officer was to be taxed only for the net amount of fees received. It is agreed, on all hands, that the prothonotary of the Supreme Court is to have $150Q; but under the construction of the act of 1810 contended for, he would not, after paying clerk-hire, stationery, &amp;c., receive $800, the-sum he pays one of his clerks. To discharge his official duties in a proper manner, and to subserve the interests of the public, it is proved that the plaintiff in error must have three clerks: and they must be paid.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-4\">The public has nothing to'do with expenditures of offices. They contended, that the repealing clause of the act of 29th April, 1844, section 34, (Purdon, 1102,) repealed the act of 1810. The act of 1810 charges a tax of fifty per cent, on the excess of fees received over $1500. The act of 29th April, 1844, charges <em>two per cent. </em>on the emoluments of office. The different taxes imposed by those acts on prothonotaries, &amp;c., are not cumulative. The plaintiff in error, the prothonotary of the Supreme Court at Philadelphia,\u2019 has paid the tax of <em>two </em>per cent, on the emoluments of his office, and is willing to continue to do so ; but declines, unless this court deter-, mine otherwise, to pay fifty per cent, <em>more, </em>under what he considers a repealed act; and the construction of which, for the purposes of taxation, <em>if not repealed, </em>must and should be upon the net, and not the gross amount of the excess of fees received over $1500.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b116-5\"><em>Lesley, </em>and <em>Ohampneys, </em>Attorney-general, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AV9\">contended, 1st, <em>that the act of 10th March, </em>1810, <em>does not authorize prothonotaries, $c., to charge the state with their office expenses.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-6\">That act directs that they shall keep \u201c a fair and accurate ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>count of the <em>fees,\" </em>(not the expenses,) of their office, using the language of the act of 5th December, 1801, (Pamph.

The first is, Avhether the prothonotaries can lawfully retain the amount of clerk-hire for conducting their offices, and $&gt;1500, and fifty per cent, of the surplus over these sums, if any such surplus should be received.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The court are of opinion that they cannot, and that each prothonotary can retain only $1500, and that he must account to the Commonwealth for fifty per cent, of the surplus fees above that sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">A strong and persuasive argument in favour of this position is to be found in the fact, that successive accounting officers of the government, since the year 1810, when the law on the subject was enacted, and the successive prothonotaries in every county in the state, have so understood the law, and acted upon that construction of its provisions. The concentrated and pervading consent of intelligent minds in every part of the Commonwealth, for a period of thirty-seven years, is entitled to much weight, and cannot be lightly disregarded by this court. The plain words of the statute can hardly be wrested to any other meaning by the most active ingenuity; \u201c and whenever the amount of any of the said accounts shall exceed the sum of fifteen hundred dollars, the auditor-general shall charge the officers, respectively, fifty per cent, on the amount of such excess.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The argument of the- defendant below is, that the auditor-general must settle the account, and that there wrnuld be no account to settle unless clerk-hire was to be allowed. But the allowance of such credit would give to the auditor-general a discretion, which is not-vested in him by law. The law requires the prothonotary to furnish <em>an account </em>of all the fees received by him, on oath; and that is the account which is to be settled. Has the officer exhibited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>a true account? Has lie charged the proper fees? Has he exhibited an account of the fees received by himself, and by <em>those employed by him in his office ? \u25a0 </em>These are the matters to be adjusted in settling the account of fees received by him, according to the statute. When the account is thus settled, the.auditor-general is to allow him $1500,.and to. charge him fifty <em>per .cent, </em>of the surplus received by him. If the auditor-general was required to allow him for clerk-hire, why not allow him also for the expense of fuel,- of lightj and-of washing and Sweeping his office? All these things would imply a discretion in the- auditor-general, which, . for wise reasons, is not giv.en to him. The officer could- easily, exr tinguish*all surplus by extravagant charges. If the legislature had intended that such allowance should be made .before the excess began to run, they would have so expressed .it'. If clerk-hire was to. be allowed for conducting the office, and the other expenses of light and fuel, which we see no reason to distinguish from the other expenses, the $1500 wou\u00edd be converted into a mere annual sinecure.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The next question to be disposed of is, whether the act of 10th March, 1810, requiring prothonotaries to pay fifty per cent, into the treasury for the use of the Commonwealth, has been repealed by the act of 29th April, 1844. The clause in the last act which is alleged to have -this effect, is in the following Words, at the end. of the thirty-fourth section, to wit: \u00ab and upon all other property heretofore made taxable for state purposes, or that are made so by the thirty-second section of this act, three mills on every dollar of the value. All other laws heretofore passed for'laying taxes for state purposes are hereby repealed: provided that the said laws-shall still be in force for the collection of all taxes, due or assessed, by virtue, of such laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AaU\">It is not to be disguised, that if the fees above .$1500 are to be viewed as <em>subjects of taxation, eo nomine,, </em>within the mind of the legislature, anterior to the law of 1844, and at the passage thereof, that the pre-existing tax, if it can be so called, of fifty per Cent., is fairly embraced.' by' the words of the 34th section, and of course repealed. But I apprehend the law of 1810 -cannot be considered as assessing or levying a tax properly so called.. The law, is entitled \u00ab An act taxing certain offices,\u201d but would much more appropriately have been called an act fixing the compensation of' certain officers; for that it- is, in effect and substance. \u201c Whenever .the amount of said accounts shall exceed fifteen hundred'dollars, the auditor-general shall charge the said officers respectively, fifty per \u25a0cent, on the amount of such excess, which sum, so charged, shall be paid by them into the treasury.\u201d Fees are not necessarily the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>property of the officer; they are so only when they ar'e given to him as such, and for compensation. In several instances the fees are the property of the Commonwealth, whilst the salary of the officers is fixed, by law. That is, in substance, the amount of the act of 1810. He (the officer) is to receive $1500, if the receipts of the office amount to that sum; and for all above he. is to receive one-half, and the other half is to be the property of the Commonwealth, which he is bound to pay into the treasury, on pain of being guilty of a misdemeanor in office if he declines or refuses. This, then, has not the quality of. a tax. It is neither assessed, levied, nor collected, in the usual acceptance of the term;, and we cannot suppose that the legislature had this law in view, as a law imposing a state tax, but that it was viewed by them as a law fixing the amount of compensation of the officers, and requiring them to pay the excess beyond that compensation into the treasury, as money belonging to the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">It would be, extremely difficult to imagine any tenable reason as existing in 1844, for repealing the law. At that time the object and clear design was to add to the resources and available means of the Commonwealth. This law afforded considerable revenue, and gave no trouble in the collection. It had not been complained of as oppressive, and gave to officers throughout the Commonwealth an adequate compensation; greater, in all probability, in very many of the counties, than that allowed, to the auditor-general, or any other of the heads of departments. Why, then, could the legislature have intended to repeal it ? We will not impute to them the inconsistency. I think they viewed the law in the same aspect in which I view fit: that is, as a law fixing and defining the compensation of the officer, and not -properly a law assessing or levying, a tax. It is not, therefore, within the repealing clause. I can perceive distinctly enough that the legislature would violate no canon of established construction, in viewing the act of 1810 as a law fixing compensation. But I cannot impute to them an intent to repeal the act, without supposing them to have been guilty of carelessness or inadvertence; and I think the words used in the statute of 1844 leave the act of 1810 intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The third error assigned is disposed of by considering the two first, the last being compounded of the two former.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
