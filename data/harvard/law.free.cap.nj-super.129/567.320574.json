All but one of the issues presented here were dealt with at the-trial level in two opinions by Judge Larner. <em>Albigese v. Jer</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>sey City, </em>127 <em>N. J. Super. </em>101 (Law Div. 1974) and <em>Wood-cliff Management v. North Bergen, </em>127 <em>N. J. Super. </em>123 (Law Div. 3974). The latter has not been appealed, and decided an issue relative to the rent rollback provisions of the ordinance which was not raised at the trial level but which is raised here in both of the cases now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Substantially for the reasons set forth by Judge Lamer in <em>Woodcliff Management v. North Bergen, supra, </em>we modify the judgments under review to the end that any rent rollback in these matters be calculated in accordance with the decision in that case, and as so modified the judgments are affirmed essentially for the reasons set forth in <em>Albigese v. Jersey City, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The ordinance in question was effective March 12, 1973 and by its own terms was to remain in effect \u201cfor a period not to exceed one year from said effective date * * * unless specifically extended by the Municipal Council by Resolution extending said term from year to year.\u201d The additional issue presented to us, not ripe at the time of the decisions below, is whether the municipality has power to extend this ordinance by resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">It is a recognized tenet of municipal law that the term \u201cordinance\u201d encompasses matters legislative in character, while the term \u201cresolution\u201d refers to matters administrative or procedural in nature. <em>McLaughlin v. Millville, </em>110 <em>N. J. Super. </em>200 (Law Div. 1970); <em>O\u2019Keefe v. Dunn, </em>89 <em>N. J. Super. </em>383, 388 (Law Div. 1965), affirmed o. b. 47 <em>N. J. </em>210 (1966); <em>Woodhull v. Manahan, </em>85 <em>N. J. Super. </em>157, 164 (App. Div. 1964), aff\u2019d 43 <em>N. J. </em>445 (1964); 5 <em>McQuillin, Municipal Corporations, </em>\u00a7 15.02 and \u00a7 16.42 (3969).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\"> Unquestionably, the ordinance before us represents an exercise of legislative power. Thus, its enactment by ordinance and not by resolution was required. Amendment or reenactment of legislation required initially to be enacted by ordinance must be accomplished by the same moans and may not be done by resolution. <em>Kessler v. Passaic, </em>113 <em>N. J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number><em>Super. </em>59 (Law Div. 1971). As was stated in <em>Chasis v. </em>Tumulty, 8 <em>N. J. </em>147 (1951) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\">Where the law requires a proceeding to be instituted by an ordinance it cannot be effected by resolution merely; the latter, wanting the solemnities of the former, is not regarded as a legal equivalent, [at 153]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Hence, the municipality\u2019s extension of the rent stabilization ordinance by resolution is invalid. Obviously, the municipality did not acquire a power denied to it by incorporating in the original enactment the provision for an extension by resolution rather than by the adoption of a new ordinance. That portion of the initial ordinance was invalid. See <em>Hilton Acres v. Klein, </em>64 <em>N. J. Super. </em>281, 295-296 (App. Div. 1960), mod. on other grounds 35 <em>N. J. </em>570 (1961). We add that to require extension only by ordinance in a matter of public importance sudh as this serves the salutary objectives of public notice and participation and affords the opportunity for unhurried deliberation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
