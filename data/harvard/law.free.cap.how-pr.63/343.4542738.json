J. F. Halt, J., and a jury, it resulted in a judgment for the defendant. From the judgment the plaintiff appealed to the general term, and that court reversed the judgment, and ordered a new trial, with costs to abide the event. From this the defendant appealed to the court of appeals, which court reversed the general term and affirmed the trial term. Upon this the defendant presented his bill of costs on appeal to the general term to the clerk for taxation, which he, at the instance of the plaintiff, refused to do, claiming that the defendant was not entitled to the costs on the appeal to the general term. From this an appeal was taken to the special term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b368-6\"><em>Jacob </em>Fromme, for defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aud2\">in support of the appeal, cited 2 Hill, 357; 5 <em>Weekly Dig., </em>391; 8 <em>id., </em>145; 8 <em>Hun, </em>524; 70 <em>N. </em>Y., 795; 84 <em>N.

The action has ended. The <em>event\u2014i. e., </em>the result of the litigation \u2014 was that the defendant obtained judgment. The costs of the appeal to the general term <em>abided\u2014i. e., </em>depended upon \u2014 the final result of the litigation. When that result was reached- the party who prevailed became entitled to the costs of the appeal to the general term. The costs of that appeal belong, therefore, to the defendant, the party finally prevailing in the litigation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
