The action was revived against C. as administrator of B., deceased:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b94-9\"><em>Held, </em>that the action was properly revived, and C.\u2019s equity of redemption cut off by the decree <em>(Affirming 8. 0., </em>62 <em>Sow., </em>397).</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b94-10\"><em>First Department, General Term, March, </em>1882.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b94-11\"><em>Before </em>Davis, <em>P.

Boylan, both as administrator of Felix Boylan and individually. This circum. stance is a controlling one, while the judgment record stands in its present form.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">jSfo irregularity appears upon which the judgment can be adjudged void, and even if there were an irregularity in the form it cannot be corrected by us to the prejudice of the plaintiff ; and would not be at special term on motion of Boylan for such a purpose as to enable him to assert that he, as a subsequent purchaser, is not affected by the <em>lis pendens </em>in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The order should be affirmed, with ten dollars costs, besides disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
