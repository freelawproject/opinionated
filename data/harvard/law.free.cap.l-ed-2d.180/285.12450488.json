To supplement the bare text, this Court created the exclusionary rule, a deterrent</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">[564 U.S. 232]</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">sanction that bars the prosecution from introducing evidence obtained by way of a Fourth Amendment violation. The question here is whether to apply this sanction when the police conduct a search in compliance with binding precedent that is later overruled. Because suppression would do nothing to deter police misconduct in these circumstances, and because it would come at a high cost to both the truth and the public safety, we hold that searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b332-17\">The question presented arises in this case as a result of a shift in our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence on searches of automobiles incident to arrests of recent occupants.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-18\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b332-19\">Under this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 89 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>S. Ct. 2034, 23 L. Ed. 2d 685 (1969), a police officer who makes a lawful arrest may conduct a warrantless search of the arrestee\u2019s person and the area \u201cwithin his immediate control.\u201d Id., at 763, 89 S. Ct. 2034, 23 L. Ed. 2d 685 (internal quotation marks omitted). This rule \u201cmay be stated clearly enough,\u201d but in the early going after <em>Chimel </em>it proved difficult to apply, particularly in cases that involved searches \u201cinside [of] automobile [s] after the arrestees [we] re no longer in [them].\u201d See <em>New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 458-459, 101 S. Ct. 2860, 69 L. Ed. 2d 768 (1981). A number of courts upheld the constitutionality of vehicle searches that were \u201csubstantially contemporaneous\u201d with occupants\u2019 arrests.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Other courts disapproved of automobile searches incident to arrests, at least absent some continuing threat that the arrestee might gain access to the vehicle and \u201cdestroy evidence or grab a</p>\n<p id=\"Aa4P\">[564 U.S. 233]</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">weapon.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>this Court granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. See <em>id., </em>at 459-460, 101 S. Ct. 2860, 69 L. Ed. 2d 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">In <em>Belton, </em>a police officer conducting a traffic stop lawfully arrested four occupants of a vehicle and ordered the arrestees to line up, unhandcuffed, along the side of the thruway. <em>Id., </em>at 456, 101 S. Ct. 2860, 69 L. Ed. 2d 76; see Brief for Petitioner in <em>New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>O. T. 1980, No. 80-328, p. 3. The officer then searched the vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment and found cocaine inside a jacket that lay on the backseat. <em>Belton, </em>453 U.S., at 456, 101 S. Ct. 2860, 69 L. Ed. 2d 76. This Court upheld the search as reasonable incident to the occupants\u2019 arrests. In an opinion that repeatedly stressed the need for a \u201cstraightforward,\u201d \u201cworkable rule\u201d to guide police conduct, the Court announced \u201cthat when a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 459-460, 101 S. Ct. 2860, 69 L. Ed. 2d 76 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">For years, <em>Belton </em>was widely understood to have set down a simple, bright-line rule. Numerous courts read the decision to authorize automobile searches incident to arrests of recent occupants, regardless of whether the arrestee in any particular case was within reaching distance of the vehicle at the time of the search. See <em>Thornton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>541 U.S. 615, 628, 124 S. Ct. 2127, 158 L. Ed. 2d 905 (2004) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (collecting cases). Even after the arrestee had stepped out of the vehicle and had been subdued by police, the prevailing understanding was that <em>Belton </em>still authorized a substantially contemporaneous search of the automobile\u2019s passenger compartment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">[564 U.S. 234]</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">Not every court, however, agreed with this reading of <em>Belton. </em>In <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number><em>Gant, </em>216 Ariz. 1, 162 P.3d 640 (2007), the Arizona Supreme Court considered an automobile search conducted after the vehicle\u2019s occupant had been arrested, handcuffed, and locked in a patrol car. The court distinguished <em>Belton </em>as a case in which \u201cfour unsecured\u201d arrestees \u201cpresented an immediate risk of loss of evidence and an obvious threat to [a] lone officer\u2019s safety.\u201d 216 Ariz., at 4, 162 P.3d, at 643. The court held that where no such \u201cexigencies exis[t]\u201d\u2014where the arrestee has been subdued and the scene secured\u2014the rule of <em>Belton </em>does not apply. 216 Ariz., at 4, 162 P.3d, at 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">This Court granted certiorari in <em>Gant, </em>see 552 U.S. 1230, 89 S. Ct. 2034, 23 L. Ed. 2d 685 (2008), and affirmed in a 5-to-4 decision. <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Gant, </em>556 U.S. 332, 129 S. Ct. 1710, 173 L. Ed. 2d 485 (2009). Four of the Justices in the majority agreed with the Arizona Supreme Court that <em>Bel-ton\u2019s </em>holding applies only where \u201cthe arrestee is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search.\u201d 556 U.S., at 343, 129 S. Ct. 1710, 173 L. Ed. 2d 485. The four dissenting Justices, by contrast, understood <em>Belton </em>to have explicitly adopted the simple, bright-line rule stated in the <em>Belton </em>Court\u2019s opinion. 556 U.S., at 357-358, 129 S. Ct. 1710, 173 L. Ed. 2d 485 (opinion of Alito, J.); see <em>Belton, supra, </em>at 460, 101 S. Ct. 2860, 69 L. Ed. 2d 76 (\u201c[W]e hold that when a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile\u201d (footnote omitted)). To limit <em>Belton </em>to cases involving unsecured arrestees, the dissenters thought, was to overrule the decision\u2019s clear holding. <em>Gant, supra, </em>at 357-358, 129 S. Ct. 1710, 173 L. Ed. 2d 485. Justice Scalia, who provided the fifth vote to affirm in <em>Gant, </em>agreed with the dissenters\u2019 understanding of <em>Belton\u2019s </em>holding. 556 U.S., at 351-352, 129 S. Ct. 1710, 173 L. Ed. 2d 485 (concurring opinion). Justice Scalia favored a more explicit and complete overruling of <em>Belton, </em>but he joined what became the majority opinion to avoid \u201ca 4-to-1-to-4\u201d disposition. 556 U.S., at 354, 129 S. Ct. 1710, 173 L. Ed. 2d 485. As a result, the Court adopted a new, two-part rule under which an automobile</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">[564 U.S. 235]</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">search incident to a recent occupant\u2019s arrest is constitutional (1) if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the vehicle during the search, or (2) if the police have reason to believe that the vehicle contains \u201cevidence relevant to the crime of arrest.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 343, 129 S. Ct. 1710, 173 L. Ed. 2d 485 (citing <em>Thornton, supra, </em>at 632, 124 S. Ct. 2127, 158 L. Ed. 2d 905 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">The search at issue in this case took place a full two years before this Court announced its new rule in <em>Gant. </em>On an April evening in 2007, police officers in Greenville, Alabama, conducted a routine traffic stop that eventually resulted in the arrests of driver Stella Owens (for driving while intoxicated) and passenger Willie Davis (for giving a false name to police). The police handcuffed both Owens and Davis, and they placed the arrest-ees in the back of separate patrol cars. The police then searched the passenger compartment of Owens\u2019 vehicle and found a revolver inside Davis\u2019 jacket pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Davis was indicted in the Middle District of Alabama on one count of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). In his motion to suppress the revolver, Davis acknowledged that the officers\u2019 search fully complied with \u201cexisting Eleventh Circuit precedent.\u201d App. 13-15. Like most courts, the Eleventh Circuit had long read <em>Belton </em>to establish a bright-line rule authorizing substantially contemporaneous vehicle searches incident to arrests of recent occupants. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>71 F.3d 819, 822, 824-827 (CA11 1996) (upholding automobile search conducted after the defendant had been \u201cpulled from the vehicle, handcuffed, laid on the ground, and placed under arrest\u201d). Davis recognized that the District Court was obligated to follow this precedent, but he raised a Fourth Amendment challenge to preserve \u201cthe issue for review\u201d on appeal. App. 15. The District Court denied the motion, and Davis was convicted on the firearms charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">[564 U.S. 236]</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">While Davis\u2019 appeal was pending, this Court decided <em>Gant. </em>The Eleventh Circuit, in the opinion below, applied <em>Gant\u2019s </em>new rule and held that the vehicle search incident to Davis\u2019 arrest \u201cviolated [his] Fourth Amendment rights.\u201d 598 F.3d 1259, 1263 (CA11 2010). As for whether this constitutional violation warranted suppression, the Eleventh Circuit viewed that as a separate issue that turned on \u201cthe potential of exclusion to deter wrongful police conduct.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1265 (quoting <em>Herring </em>v. <em>United States, </em>555 U.S. 135, 137, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d 496 (2009); internal quotation marks omitted). The court concluded that \u201cpenalizing the [arresting] officer\u201d for following binding appellate precedent would do nothing to \u201cde-te[r] . . . Fourth Amendment violations.\u201d 598 F.3d, at 1265-1266 (bracketing and internal quotation marks omitted). It therefore declined to apply the exclusionary rule and affirmed Davis\u2019 conviction. We granted certiorari. 562 U.S. 1002, 131 S. Ct. 502; 178 L. Ed. 2d 368 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The Fourth Amendment protects the \u201cright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d The Amendment says nothing about suppressing evidence obtained in violation of this command. That rule\u2014the exclusionary rule\u2014is a \u201cprudential\u201d doctrine, <em>Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>524 U.S. 357, 363, 118 S. Ct. 2014, 141 L. Ed. 2d 344 (1998), created by this Court to \u201ccompel respect for the constitutional guaranty.\u201d <em>Elkins </em>v. <em>United States, </em>364 U.S. 206, 217, 80 S. Ct. 1437, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1669 (1960); see <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>232 U.S. 383, 34 S. Ct. 341, 58 L. Ed. 652 (1914); <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (1961). Exclusion is \u201cnot a personal constitutional right,\u201d nor is it designed to \u201credress the injury\u201d occasioned by an unconstitutional search. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 486, 96 S. Ct. 3037, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1067 (1976); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Janis, </em>428 U.S. 433, 454, n. 29, 96 S. Ct. 3021, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1046 (1976) (exclusionary rule \u201cunsupportable as reparation or compensatory dispensation to the injured criminal\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). The rule\u2019s sole purpose, we have repeatedly held, is to deter future Fourth</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">[564 U.S. 237]</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Amendment violations. <em>E.g., Herring, supra, </em>at 141, and n. 2, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d 496; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 909, 921, n. 22, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1984); <em>Elkins, supra, </em>at 217, 80 S. Ct. 1437, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1669 (\u201ccalculated to prevent, not to repair\u201d). Our cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>have thus limited the rule\u2019s operation to situations in which this purpose is \u201cthought most efficaciously served.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 348, 94 S. Ct. 613, 38 L. Ed. 2d 561 (1974). Where suppression fails to yield \u201cappreciable deterrence,\u201d exclusion is \u201cclearly . . . unwarranted.\u201d <em>Janis, supra, </em>at 454, 96 S. Ct. 3021, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Real deterrent value is a \u201cnecessary condition for exclusion,\u201d but it is not \u201ca sufficient\u201d one. <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>547 U.S. 586, 596, 126 S. Ct. 2159, 165 L. Ed. 2d 56 (2006). The analysis must also account for the \u201csubstantial social costs\u201d generated by the rule. <em>Leon, supra, </em>at 907, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677. Exclusion exacts a heavy toll on both the judicial system and society at large. <em>Stone, </em>428 U.S., at 490-491, 96 S. Ct. 3037, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1067. It almost always requires courts to ignore reliable, trustworthy evidence bearing on guilt or innocence. <em>Ibid., </em>And its bottom-line effect, in many cases, is to suppress the truth and set the criminal loose in the community without punishment. See <em>Herring, supra, </em>at 141, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d 496. Our cases hold that society must swallow this bitter pill when necessary, but only as a \u201clast resort.\u201d <em>Hudson, supra, </em>at 591, 126 S. Ct. 2159, 165 L. Ed. 2d 56. For exclusion to be appropriate, the deterrence benefits of suppression must outweigh its heavy costs. See <em>Herring, supra, </em>at 141, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d 496; <em>Leon, supra, </em>at 910, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Admittedly, there was a time when our exclusionary-rule cases were not nearly so discriminating in their approach to the doctrine. \u201cExpansive dicta\u201d in several decisions, see <em>Hudson, supra, </em>at 591, 126 S. Ct. 2159, 165 L. Ed. 2d 56, suggested that the rule was a self-executing mandate implicit in the Fourth Amendment itself. See <em>Olmstead </em>v. <em>United States, </em>277 U.S. 438, 462, 48 S. Ct. 564, 72 L. Ed. 944 (1928) (remarking on the \u201cstriking outcome of the <em>Weeks </em>case\u201d that \u201cthe Fourth Amendment, although not referring to or limiting the use of evidence in courts, really forbade its introduction\u201d); <em>Mapp, supra, </em>at 655, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (\u201c[A]ll evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">[564 U.S. 238]</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">that same authority, inadmissible in a state court\u201d). As late as our 1971 decision in <em>Whiteley </em>v. <em>Warden, Wyo. State Penitentiary, </em>401 U.S. 560, 568-569, 91 S. Ct. 1031, 28 L. Ed. 2d 306, the Court \u201ctreated identification of a Fourth Amendment violation as synonymous with application of the exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>514 U.S. 1, 13, 115 S. Ct. 1185, 131 L. Ed. 2d 34 (1995). In time, however, we came to acknowledge the exclusionary rule for what it undoubtedly is\u2014a \u201cjudicially created remedy\u201d of this Court\u2019s own making. <em>Calandra, supra, </em>at 348, 94 S. Ct. 613, 38 L. Ed. 2d 561. We abandoned the old, \u201creflexive\u201d application of the doctrine, and imposed a more rigorous weighing of its costs and deterrence benefits. <em>Evans, supra, </em>at 13, 115 S. Ct. 1185, 131 L. Ed. 2d 34; see, <em>e.g., Calandra, supra; Janis, supra; Stone, supra; INS </em>v. <em>Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 104 S. Ct. 3479, 82 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1984); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Havens, </em>446 U.S. 620, 100 S. Ct. 1912, 64 L. Ed. 2d 559 (1980). In a line of cases beginning with <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677, we also recalibrated our cost-benefit analysis in exclusion cases to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>focus the inquiry on the \u201cflagrancy of the police misconduct\u201d at issue. <em>Id., </em>at 909, 911, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">The basic insight of the <em>Leon </em>line of cases is that  the deterrence benefits of exclusion \u201cvar[y] with the culpability of the law enforcement conduct\u201d at issue. <em>Herring, </em>555 U.S., at 143, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d 496. When the police exhibit \u201cdeliberate,\u201d \u201creckless,\u201d or \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d disregard for Fourth Amendment rights, the deterrent value of exclusion is strong and tends to outweigh the resulting costs. <em>Id., </em>at 144, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d 496. But when the police act with an objectively \u201creasonable good-faith belief\u2019 that their conduct is lawful, <em>Leon, supra, </em>at 909, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (internal quotation marks omitted), or when their conduct involves only simple, \u201cisolated\u201d negligence, <em>Herring, supra, </em>at 137, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d 496, the \u201c \u2018deterrence rationale loses much of its force,\u2019 \u201d and exclusion cannot \u201cpay its way,\u201d <em>Leon, supra, </em>at 919, 908, n. 6, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Peltier, </em>422 U.S. 531, 539, 95 S. Ct. 2313, 45 L. Ed. 2d 374 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The Court has over time applied this \u201cgood-faith\u201d exception across a range of cases. <em>Leon </em>itself, for example, held that the exclusionary rule does not apply when the police conduct a search in \u201cobjectively reasonable reliance\u201d on a</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">[564 U.S. 239]</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">warrant later held invalid. 468 U.S., at 922, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677. The error in such a case rests with the issuing magistrate, not the police officer, and \u201cpunish [ing] the errors of judges\u201d is not the office of the exclusionary rule. <em>Id., </em>at 916, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677; see also <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>468 U.S. 981, 990, 104 S. Ct. 3424, 82 L. Ed. 2d 737 (1984) (companion case declining to apply exclusionary rule where warrant held invalid as a result of judge\u2019s clerical error).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Other good-faith cases have sounded a similar theme. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Krull, </em>480 U.S. 340, 107 S. Ct. 1160, 94 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1987), extended the good-faith exception to searches conducted in reasonable reliance on subsequently invalidated statutes. <em>Id., </em>at 349-350, 107 S. Ct. 1160, 94 L. Ed. 2d 364 (\u201clegislators, like judicial officers, are not the focus of the rule\u201d). In <em>Evans, supra, </em>the Court applied the good-faith exception in a case where the police reasonably relied on erroneous information concerning an arrest warrant in a database maintained by judicial employees. <em>Id., </em>at 14, 115 S. Ct. 1185, 131 L. Ed. 2d 34. Most recently, in <em>Herring, supra, </em>we extended <em>Evans </em>in a case where <em>police </em>employees erred in maintaining records in a warrant database, \u201c[isolated,\u201d \u201cnonrecurring\u201d police negligence, we determined, lacks the culpability required to justify the harsh sanction of exclusion. 555 U.S., at 137, 144, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">The question in this case is whether to apply the exclusionary rule when the police conduct a search in objectively reasonable reliance on binding judicial precedent. At the time of the search at issue here, we had not yet decided <em>Gant, </em>556 U.S. 332, 129 S. Ct. 1710, 173 L. Ed. 2d 485, and the Eleventh Circuit had interpreted our decision in <em>Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 101 S. Ct. 2860, 69 L. Ed. 2d 768, to establish a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>bright-line rule authorizing the search of a vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment incident to a recent occupant\u2019s arrest. <em>Gonzalez, </em>71 F.3d, at 825. The search incident to Davis\u2019 arrest in this case followed the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s <em>Gonzalez </em>precedent to the letter. Although the search turned out to be unconstitutional under <em>Gant, </em>all agree that the officers\u2019 conduct was in strict compliance with then-binding Circuit law and was not</p>\n<p id=\"AFVn\">[564 U.S. 240]</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">culpable in any way. See Brief for Petitioner 49 (\u201csuppression\u201d in this case would \u201cimpl[y] no assignment of blame\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Under our exclusionary-rule precedents, this acknowledged absence of police culpability dooms Davis\u2019 claim.  Police practices trigger the harsh sanction of exclusion only when they are deliberate enough to yield \u201cmeaningful!]\u201d deterrence, and culpable enough to be \u201cworth the price paid by the justice system.\u201d <em>Herring, </em>555 U.S., at 144, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d 496. The conduct of the officers here was neither of these things. The officers who conducted the search did not violate Davis\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights deliberately, recklessly, or with gross negligence. <em>See ibid. </em>Nor does this case involve any \u201crecurring or systemic negligence\u201d on the part of law enforcement. <em>Ibid. </em>The police acted in strict compliance with binding precedent, and their behavior was not wrongful. Unless the exclusionary rule is to become a strict-liability regime, it can have no application in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Indeed, in 27 years of practice under <em>Leon\u2019s </em>good-faith exception, we have \u201cnever applied\u201d the exclusionary rule to suppress evidence obtained as a result of nonculpable, innocent police conduct. <em>Herring, supra, </em>at 144, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d 496. If the police in this case had reasonably relied on a warrant in conducting their search, see <em>Leon, supra, </em>or on an erroneous warrant record in a government database, <em>Herring, supra, </em>the exclusionary rule would not apply. And if Congress or the Alabama Legislature had enacted a statute codifying the precise holding of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Gonzalez,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">[564 U.S. 241]</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">would swiftly conclude that \u201c \u2018[penalizing the officer for the [legislature\u2019s] error . . . cannot logically contribute to the deterrence of Fourth Amendment violations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Krull, </em>480 U.S., at 350, 107 S. Ct. 1160, 94 L. Ed. 2d 364. The same should be true of Davis\u2019 attempt here to \u201c \u2018[p]enaliz[e] the officer for the [appellate judges\u2019] error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">About all that exclusion would deter in this case is conscientious police work.  Responsible law enforcement officers will take care to learn \u201cwhat is required of them\u201d under Fourth Amendment precedent and will conform their conduct to these rules. <em>Hudson, </em>547 U.S., at 599, 126 S. Ct. 2159, 165 L. Ed. 2d 56. But by the same token, when binding appellate precedent specifically <em>authorizes </em>a particular police practice, well-trained officers will and should use that tool to fulfill their crime-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>detection and public-safety responsibilities. An officer who conducts a search in reliance on binding appellate precedent does no more than \u201c \u2018ac[t] as a reasonable officer would and should act\u2019 \u201d under the circumstances. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S., at 920, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (quoting <em>Stone, </em>428 U.S., at 539-540, 96 S. Ct. 3037, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1067 (White, J., dissenting)). The deterrent effect of exclusion in such a case can only be to discourage the officer from \u201c \u2018do[ing] his duty.\u2019 \u201d 468 U.S., at 920, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">That is not the kind of deterrence the exclusionary rule seeks to foster. We have stated before, and we reaffirm today, that  the harsh sanction of exclusion \u201cshould not be applied to deter objectively reasonable law enforcement activity.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 919, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677. Evidence obtained during a search conducted in reasonable reliance on binding precedent is not subject to the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent and Davis argue that, although the police conduct in this case was in no way culpable, other considerations should prevent the good-faith exception from applying. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">[564 U.S. 242]</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">The principal argument of both the dissent and Davis is that the exclusionary rule\u2019s availability to enforce new Fourth Amendment precedent is a retroactivity issue, see <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 107 S. Ct. 708, 93 L. Ed. 2d 649 (1987), not a good-faith issue. They contend that applying the good-faith exception where police have relied on overruled precedent effectively revives the discarded retroactivity regime of <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618, 85 S. Ct. 1731, 14 L. Ed. 2d 601 (1965). See <em>post, </em>at 254-256, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 305-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">In <em>Linkletter, </em>we held that the retroactive effect of a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure should be determined on a case-by-case weighing of interests. For each new rule, <em>Linkletter </em>required courts to consider a three-factor balancing test that looked to the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the new rule, \u201creliance\u201d on the old rule by law enforcement and others, and the effect retroactivity would have \u201con the administration of justice.\u201d 381 U.S., at 636, 85 S. Ct. 1731, 14 L. Ed. 2d 601. After \u201cweighting] the merits and demerits in each case,\u201d courts decided whether and to what extent a new rule should be given retroactive effect. <em>Id., </em>at 629, 85 S. Ct. 1731, 14 L. Ed. 2d 601. In <em>Linkletter </em>itself, the balance of interests prompted this Court to conclude that <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081\u2014which incorporated the exclusionary rule against the States\u2014should not apply retroactively to cases already final on direct review. 381 U.S., at 639-640, 85 S. Ct. 1731, 14 L. Ed. 2d 601. The next year, we extended <em>Linkletter </em>to retroactivity determinations in cases on direct review. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>384 U.S. 719, 733, 86 S. Ct. 1772, 16 L. Ed. 2d 882 (1966) (holding that <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), and <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U.S. 478, 84 S. Ct. 1758, 12 L. Ed. 2d 977 (1964), applied retroactively only to trials commenced after the decisions were released).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">Over time, <em>Linkletter </em>proved difficult to apply in a consistent, coherent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>way. Individual applications of the standard \u201cproduced strikingly divergent results,\u201d <em>Danforth </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>552 U.S. 264, 273, 128 S. Ct. 1029, 169 L. Ed. 2d 859 (2008), that many saw as \u201cincompatible\u201d and \u201cinconsistent,\u201d <em>Desist </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 244, 258, 89 S. Ct. 1030, 22 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1969) (Harlan, J., dissenting). Justice Harlan in particular,</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">[564 U.S. 243]</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">who had endorsed the <em>Linkletter </em>standard early on, offered a strong critique in which he argued that \u201cbasic judicial\u201d norms required full retroactive application of new rules to all cases still subject to direct review. 394 U.S., at 258-259, 89 S. Ct. 1030, 22 L. Ed. 2d 248; see <em>also Mackey </em>v. <em>United States, </em>401 U.S. 667, 675-702, 91 S. Ct. 1160, 28 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Eventually, and after more than 20 years of toil under <em>Linkletter, </em>the Court adopted Justice Harlan\u2019s view and held that newly announced rules of constitutional criminal procedure must apply \u201cretroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception.\u201d <em>Griffith, supra, </em>at 328, 107 S. Ct. 708, 93 L. Ed. 2d 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The dissent and Davis argue that applying the good-faith exception in this case is \u201cincompatible\u201d with our retroactivity precedent under <em>Griffith. </em>See <em>post, </em>at 254, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 305; Reply Brief for Petitioner 3-7. We think this argument conflates what are two distinct doctrines.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Our retroactivity jurisprudence is concerned with whether, as a categorical matter, a new rule is available on direct review as a <em>potential </em>ground for relief. Retroactive application under <em>Griffith </em>lifts what would otherwise be a categorical bar to obtaining redress for the government\u2019s violation of a newly announced constitutional rule. See <em>Danforth, supra, </em>at 271, n. 5, 128 S. Ct. 1029, 169 L. Ed. 2d 859 (noting that it may \u201cmake more sense to speak in terms of the \u2018redressabiiity\u2019 of violations of new rules, rather than the \u2018retroactivity\u2019 of such new rules\u201d). Retroactive application does not, however, determine what \u201cappropriate remedy\u201d (if any) the defendant should obtain. See <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Nevada, </em>511 U.S. 79, 84, 114 S. Ct. 1280, 128 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1994) (noting that it \u201cdoes not necessarily follow\u201d from retroactive application of a new rule that the defendant will \u201cgain . . . relief\u2019). Remedy is a separate, analytically distinct issue. Cf. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>496 U.S. 167, 189, 110 S. Ct. 2323, 110 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1990) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[T]he Court has never equated its retroactivity principles with remedial principles\u201d). As a result, the retroactive application of a new rule of substantive Fourth</p>\n<p id=\"ajz-dedup-0\">[564 U.S. 244]</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">Amendment law <em>raises </em>the question whether a suppression remedy applies; it does not answer that question. See <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S., at 906, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (\u201cWhether the exclusionary sanction is appropriately imposed in a particular case . . . is \u2018an issue separate from the question whether the Fourth Amendment rights of the party seeking to invoke the rule were violated by police conduct\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">When this Court announced its decision in <em>Gant, </em>Davis\u2019s conviction had not yet become final on direct review. <em>Gant </em>therefore applies retroactively to this case. Davis may invoke its newly announced rule of substantive Fourth Amendment law as a basis for seeking relief. See <em>Griffith, supra, </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>326, 328, 107 S. Ct. 708, 93 L. Ed. 2d 649. The question, then, becomes one of remedy, and on that issue Davis seeks application of the exclusionary rule. But exclusion of evidence does not automatically follow from the fact that a Fourth Amendment violation occurred. See <em>Evans, </em>514 U.S., at 13-14, 115 S. Ct. 1185, 131 L. Ed. 2d 34. The remedy is subject to exceptions and applies only where its \u201cpurpose is effectively advanced.\u201d <em>Krull, </em>480 U.S., at 347, 107 S. Ct. 1160, 94 L. Ed. 2d 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">The dissent and Davis recognize that at least some of the established exceptions to the exclusionary rule limit its availability in cases involving new Fourth Amendment rules. Suppression would thus be inappropriate, the dissent and Davis acknowledge, if the inevitable-discovery exception were applicable in this case. See <em>post, </em>at 254, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 305; Reply Brief for Petitioner 22 (\u201cDoctrines such as inevitable discovery, independent source, attenuated basis, [and] standing . . . sharply limit the impact of newly-announced rules\u201d). The good-faith exception, however, is no less an established limit on the <em>remedy </em>of exclusion than is inevitable discovery. Its application here neither contravenes <em>Griffith </em>nor denies retroactive effect to <em>Gant.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">[564 U.S. 245]</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">It is true that, under the old retro-activity regime of <em>Linkletter, </em>the Court\u2019s decisions on the \u201cretroactivity problem in the context of the exclusionary rule\u201d did take into account whether \u201claw enforcement officers reasonably believed in good faith\u201d that their conduct was in compliance with governing law. <em>Peltier, </em>422 U.S., at 535-537, 95 S. Ct. 2313, 45 L. Ed. 2d 374. As a matter of retroactivity analysis, that approach is no longer applicable. See <em>Griffith, </em>479 U.S. 314, 107 S. Ct. 708, 93 L. Ed. 2d 649. It does not follow, however, that reliance on binding precedent is irrelevant in applying the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule. When this Court adopted the good-faith exception in <em>Leon, </em>the Court\u2019s opinion explicitly relied on <em>Peltier </em>and imported its reasoning into the good-faith inquiry. See 468 U.S., at 918-919, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677. That reasonable reliance by police was once a factor in our retroactivity cases does not make it any less relevant under our <em>Leon </em>line of cases.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Davis also contends that applying the good-faith exception to searches conducted in reliance on binding precedent will stunt the development of Fourth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">[564 U.S. 246]</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">law. With no possibility of suppression, criminal defendants will have no incentive, Davis maintains, to request that courts overrule precedent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">This argument is difficult to reconcile with our modern understanding of the role of the exclusionary rule. We have never held that facilitating the overruling of precedent is a relevant consideration in an exclusionary-rule case. Rather, we have said time and again that  the <em>sole </em>purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter misconduct by law enforcement. See, <em>e.g., Sheppard, </em>468 U.S., at 990, 104 S. Ct. 3424, 82 L. Ed. 2d 737 (\u201c \u2018adopted to deter unlawful searches by police\u2019 \u201d); <em>Evans, supra, </em>at 14, 115 S. Ct. 1185, 131 L. Ed. 2d 34 (\u201chistorically designed as a means of deterring police misconduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">We have also repeatedly rejected efforts to expand the focus of the exclusionary rule beyond deterrence of culpable police conduct. In <em>Leon, </em>for example, we made clear that \u201cthe exclusionary rule is designed to deter police misconduct rather than to punish the errors of judges.\u201d 468 U.S., at 916, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677; see <em>id., </em>at 918, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (\u201cIf exclusion of evidence obtained pursuant to a subsequently invalidated warrant is to have any deterrent effect ... it must alter the behavior of individual law enforcement officers or the policies of their departments\u201d). <em>Krull </em>too noted that \u201clegislators, like judicial officers, are not the focus\u201d of the exclusionary rule. 480 U.S., at 350, 107 S. Ct. 1160, 94 L. Ed. 2d 364. And in <em>Evans, </em>we said that the exclusionary rule was aimed at deterring \u201cpolice misconduct, not mistakes by court employees.\u201d 514 U.S., at 14, 115 S. Ct. 1185, 131 L. Ed. 2d 34. These cases do not suggest that the exclusionary rule should be modified to serve a purpose other than deterrence of culpable law enforcement conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">[564 U.S. 247]</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">And in any event, applying the good-faith exception in this context will not prevent judicial reconsideration of prior Fourth Amendment precedents. In most instances, as in this case, the precedent sought to be challenged will be a decision of a federal court of appeals or state supreme court. But a good-faith exception for objectively reasonable reliance on binding precedent will not prevent review and correction of such decisions. This Court reviews criminal convictions from 12 Federal Courts of Appeals, 50 state courts of last resort, and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. If one or even many of these courts uphold a particular type of search or seizure, defendants in jurisdictions in which the question remains open will still have an undiminished incentive to litigate the issue. This Court can then grant cer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>tiorari, and the development of Fourth Amendment law will in no way be stunted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Davis argues that Fourth Amendment precedents of <em>this </em>Court will be effectively insulated from challenge under a good-faith exception for reliance on appellate precedent. But this argument is overblown. For one thing, it is important to keep in mind that this argument applies to an exceedingly small set of cases. Decisions overruling this Court\u2019s Fourth Amendment precedents are rare. Indeed, it has been more than 40 years since the Court last handed down a decision of the type to which Davis refers. <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 89 S. Ct. 2034, 23 L. Ed. 2d 685 (overruling <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rabinowitz, </em>339 U.S. 56, 70 S. Ct. 430, 94 L. Ed. 653 (1950), and <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>331 U.S. 145, 67 S. Ct. 1098, 91 L. Ed. 1399 (1947)). And even in those cases, Davis points out that</p>\n<p id=\"aik-dedup-2\">[564 U.S. 248]</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">no fewer than eight separate doctrines may preclude a defendant who successfully challenges an existing precedent from getting any relief. Brief for Petitioner 50. Moreover, as a practical matter, defense counsel in many cases will test this Court\u2019s Fourth Amendment precedents in the same way that <em>Belton </em>was tested in Gant\u2014by arguing that the precedent is distinguishable. See Brief for Respondent in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Gant, </em>O. T. 2008, No. 07-542, pp. 22-29.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">At most, Davis\u2019 argument might suggest that\u2014to prevent Fourth Amendment law from becoming ossified\u2014the petitioner in a case that results in the overruling of one of this Court\u2019s Fourth Amendment precedents should be given the benefit of the victory by permitting the suppression of evidence in that one case. Such a result would undoubtedly be a windfall to this one random litigant. But  the exclusionary rule is \u201cnot a personal constitutional right.\u201d <em>Stone, </em>428 U.S., at 486, 96 S. Ct. 3037, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1067. It is a \u201cjudicially created\u201d sanction, <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S., at 348, 94 S. Ct. 613, 38 L. Ed. 2d 561, specifically designed as a \u201cwindfall\u201d remedy to deter future Fourth Amendment violations. See <em>Stone, supra, </em>at 490, 96 S. Ct. 3037, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1067. The good-faith exception is a judicially created exception to this judicially created rule. Therefore, in a future case, we could, if necessary, recognize a limited exception to the good-faith exception for a defendant who obtains a judgment overruling one of our Fourth Amendment precedents. Cf. Friendly, The Bill of Rights as a Code of Criminal Procedure, 53 Cal. L.

Davis contends that a criminal defendant will lack Article III standing to challenge an existing Fourth Amendment precedent if the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule precludes the defendant from obtaining relief based on police conduct that conformed to that precedent. This argument confuses weakness on the merits with absence of Article III standing. See <em>ASARCO Inc. </em>v. <em>Kadish, </em>490 U.S. 605, 624, 109 S. Ct. 2037, 104 L. Ed. 2d 696 (1989) (standing does not \u201c \u2018depen[d] on the merits of [a claim]\u2019 \u201d). And as a practical matter, the argument is also overstated. In many instances, as in <em>Gant, </em>see 556 U.S., at 341, 129 S. Ct. 1710, 173 L. Ed. 2d 485, defendants will not simply concede that the police conduct conformed to the precedent; they will argue instead that the police conduct did not fall within the scope of the precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"A5ns\">In any event, even if some criminal defendants will be unable to challenge some precedents for the reason that Davis suggests, that provides no good reason for refusing to apply the good-faith exception. As noted, the exclusionary rule is not a personal right, see <em>Stone, </em>428 U.S., at 486, 490, 96 S. Ct. 3037, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1067, and therefore the rights of these defendants will not be impaired. And because (at least in almost all instances) the precedent can be challenged by others, Fourth Amendment case law will not be insulated from reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b344-8\">SEPARATE OPINIONS</p>\n<author id=\"pAKhda\">Justice Sotomayor,</author>\n<p id=\"Amgy\">concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Under our precedents, the primary purpose of the exclusionary rule is \u201cto deter future Fourth Amendment violations.\u201d Ante, at 236-237, 180 L.

Accordingly, we have held, application of the exclusionary rule is unwarranted when it \u201c \u2018does not result in appreciable deterrence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>514 U.S. 1, 11, 115 S.

In the circumstances of this case, where \u201cbinding appellate precedent specifically <em>authorize[d] </em>a particular police practice,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 241, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 296\u2014in accord with the holdings of nearly every other court in the country\u2014application of the exclusionary rule cannot reasonably be expected to yield appreciable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>deterrence. I am thus compelled to conclude that the exclusionary rule does not apply in this case and to agree with the Court\u2019s disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">This case does not present the markedly different question whether the exclusionary rule applies when the law governing the constitutionality of a particular search is unsettled. As we previously recognized in deciding whether to apply a Fourth Amendment holding retroactively, when police decide to conduct a search or seizure in the absence of case law (or other authority) specifically sanctioning such action, exclusion of the evidence obtained may deter Fourth Amendment violations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">\u201cIf, as the Government argues, all rulings resolving unsettled Fourth Amendment questions should be nonretroactive, then, in close cases, law enforcement officials would have little incentive to err on the side of constitutional behavior. Official awareness of the dubious</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlZe\">[564 U.S. 251]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">constitutionality of a practice would be counterbalanced by official certainty that, so long as the Fourth Amendment law in the area remained unsettled, evidence obtained through the questionable practice would be excluded only in the one case definitively resolving the unsettled question.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>457 U.S. 537, 561, 102 S. Ct. 2579, 73 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1982) (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The Court of Appeals recognized as much in limiting its application of the good-faith exception it articulated in this case to situations where its \u201cprecedent on a given point [is] unequivocal.\u201d 598 F.3d 1259, 1266 (CA11 2010); see <em>id., </em>at 1266-1267 (\u201c[W]e do not mean to encourage police to adopt a \u2018 \u201clet\u2019s-wait-until-it\u2019s-decided approach\u201d \u2019 to \u2018unsettled\u2019 questions of Fourth Amendment law\u201d (quoting <em>Johnson, </em>457 U.S., at 561, 102 S. Ct. 2579, 73 L. Ed. 2d 202)). Whether exclusion would deter Fourth Amendment violations where appellate precedent does not specifically authorize a certain practice and, if so, whether the benefits of exclusion would outweigh its costs are questions unanswered by our previous decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">The dissent suggests that today\u2019s decision essentially answers those questions, noting that an officer who conducts a search in the face of unsettled precedent \u201cis no more culpable than an officer who follows erroneous \u2018binding precedent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Post, </em>at 258, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 308 (opinion of Breyer, J.). The Court does not address this issue. In my view, whether an officer\u2019s conduct can be characterized as \u201cculpable\u201d is not itself dispositive. We have never refused to apply the exclusionary rule where its application would appreciably deter Fourth Amendment violations on the mere ground that the officer\u2019s conduct could be characterized as nonculpable. Rather, an officer\u2019s culpability is relevant because it may inform the overarching inquiry whether exclusion would result in appreciable deterrence. See <em>ante, </em>at 238, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 295 (\u201cThe basic insight of the <em>Leon </em>line of cases is that the deterrence benefits of exclusion var[y] with the culpability of the law enforcement conduct at issue\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original)); see</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">[564 U.S. 252]</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">also, <em>e.g., Herring, </em>555 U.S., at 143, 129 S.

Ct. 3405, 82 L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Ed. 2d 677 (1984) (\u201c \u2018Where the official action was pursued in complete good faith, . . . the deterrence rationale loses much of its force\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>417 U.S. 433, 447, 94 S. Ct. 2357, 41 L. Ed. 2d 182 (1974))). Whatever we have said about culpability, the ultimate questions have always been, one, whether exclusion would result in appreciable deterrence and, two, whether the benefits of exclusion outweigh its costs. See, <em>e.g., ante, </em>at 236-237, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 293-294; <em>Herring, </em>555 U.S., at 141, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d 496; <em>Krull, </em>480 U.S., at 347, 107 S. Ct. 1160, 94 L. Ed. 2d 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">As stated, whether exclusion would result in appreciable deterrence in the circumstances of this case is a different question from whether exclusion would appreciably deter Fourth Amendment violations when the governing law is unsettled. The Court\u2019s answer to the former question in this case thus does not resolve the latter one.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b346-5\">Justice Breyer,</author>\n<p id=\"AIzc\">with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In 2009, in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Gant, </em>556 U.S. 332, 129 S. Ct. 1710, 173 L. Ed. 2d 485, this Court held that a police search of an automobile without a warrant violates the Fourth Amendment if the police have previously removed the automobile\u2019s occupants and placed them securely in a squad car. The present case involves these same circumstances, and it was pending on appeal when this Court decided <em>Gant. </em>Because <em>Gant </em>represents a \u201cshift\u201d in the Court\u2019s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, <em>ante, </em>at 1, we must decide <em>whether </em>and <em>how Gant\u2019s </em>new rule applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">I agree with the Court about <em>whether Gant\u2019s </em>new rule applies. It does apply. Between 1965, when the Court decided <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618, 85 S. Ct. 1731, 14 L. Ed. 2d 601, and 1987, when it decided <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 107 S. Ct. 708, 93 L. Ed. 2d 649, that conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">[564 U.S. 253]</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">would have been more difficult to reach. Under <em>Linkletter, </em>the Court determined a new rule\u2019s retro-activity by looking to several different factors, including whether the new rule represented a \u201cclear break\u201d with the past and the degree of \u201creliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards.\u201d <em>Desist </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 244, 248-249, 89 S. Ct. 1030, 22 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1969) (internal quotation marks omitted) (also citing \u201cthe purpose to be served by the new standards\u201d and \u201cthe effect on the administration of justice\u201d as factors (internal quotation marks omitted)). And the Court would often not apply the new rule to identical cases still pending on appeal. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">After 22 years of struggling with its <em>Linkletter </em>approach, however, the Court decided in <em>Griffith </em>that <em>Linkletter </em>had proved unfair and unworkable. It then substituted a clearer approach, stating that \u201ca new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a \u2018clear break\u2019 with the past.\u201d 479 U.S., at 328, 107 S. Ct. 708, 93 L. Ed. 2d 649. The Court today, following <em>Griffith, </em>concludes that <em>Gant\u2019s </em>new rule applies here. And to that extent I agree with its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">The Court goes on, however, to decide <em>how Gant\u2019s </em>new rule will apply. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>And here it adds a fatal twist. While conceding that, like the search in <em>Gant, </em>this search violated the Fourth Amendment, it holds that, unlike Gant, this defendant is not entitled to a remedy. That is because the Court finds a new \u201cgood faith\u201d exception which prevents application of the normal remedy for a Fourth Amendment violation, namely, suppression of the illegally seized evidence. <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>232 U.S. 383, 34 S. Ct. 341, 58 L. Ed. 652 (1914); <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (1961). Leaving Davis with a right but not a remedy, the Court \u201ckeep[s] the word of promise to our ear\u201d but \u201cbreak[s] it to our hope.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">[564 U.S. 254]</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">At this point I can no longer agree with the Court. A new \u201cgood faith\u201d exception and this Court\u2019s retroactivity decisions are incompatible. For one thing, the Court\u2019s distinction between (1) retroactive application of a new rule and (2) availability of a remedy is highly artificial and runs counter to precedent. To determine that a new rule is retroactive <em>is </em>to determine that, at least in the normal case, there is a remedy. As we have previously said, the \u201csource of a \u2018new rule\u2019 is the Constitution itself, not any judicial power to create new rules of law\u201d; hence, \u201c[w]hat we are actually determining when we assess the \u2018retroactivity\u2019 of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly announced right, but whether a violation of the right that occurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will entitle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.\u201d <em>Danforth </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>552 U.S. 264, 271, 128 S. Ct. 1029, 169 L. Ed. 2d 859 (2008). The Court\u2019s \u201cgood faith\u201d exception (unlike, say, inevitable discovery, a remedial doctrine that applies only upon occasion) creates \u201ca categorical bar to obtaining redress\u201d in <em>every </em>case pending when a precedent is overturned. <em>Ante, </em>at 243, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">For another thing, the Court\u2019s holding recreates the very problems that led the Court to abandon <em>Linkletter\u2019s </em>approach to retroactivity in favor of <em>Griffith\u2019s. </em>One such problem concerns workability. The Court says that its exception applies where there is \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d police \u201creliance on binding appellate precedent.\u201d Ante, at 232, 249-250, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 290, 302. But to apply the term \u201cbinding appellate precedent\u201d often requires resolution of complex questions of degree. Davis conceded that he faced binding <em>anti-Gant </em>precedent in the Eleventh Circuit. But future litigants will be less forthcoming. <em>Ante, </em>at 248, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 301. Indeed, those litigants will now have to create distinctions to show that previous circuit precedent was not \u201cbinding\u201d lest they find relief foreclosed even if they win their constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">[564 U.S. 255]</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">At the same time, Fourth Amendment precedents frequently require courts to \u201cslosh\u201d their \u201cway through the factbound morass of \u2018reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 383, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007). Suppose an officer\u2019s conduct is consistent with the language of a Fourth Amendment rule that a court of appeals announced in a case with clearly distinguishable facts? Suppose the case creating the relevant precedent did not directly announce any general rule but involved highly analogous facts? What about a rule that all other jurisdictions, but not the defendant\u2019s jurisdiction, had previously accepted? What rules can be developed for determining when, where, and how these different kinds of precedents do, or do not, count as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>relevant \u201cbinding precedent\u201d? The Linkletter-like result is likely complex legal argument and police force confusion. <em>See Mackey </em>v. <em>United States, </em>401 U.S. 667, 676, 91 S. Ct. 1148, 28 L. Ed. 2d 388 (1971) (opinion of Harlan, J.) (describing trying to follow <em>Linkletter </em>decisions as \u201calmost as difficult\u201d as trying to follow \u201cthe tracks made by a beast of prey in search of its intended victim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Another such problem concerns fairness. Today\u2019s holding, like that in <em>Linkletter, </em>\u201cviolates basic norms of constitutional adjudication.\u201d <em>Griffith, </em>479 U.S., at 322, 107 S. Ct. 708, 93 L. Ed. 2d 649. It treats the defendant in a case announcing a new rule one way while treating similarly situated defendants whose cases are pending on appeal in a different way. See <em>ante, </em>at 248-249, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 301-302. Justice Harlan explained why this approach is wrong when he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">\u201cWe cannot release criminals from jail merely because we think one case is a particularly appropriate one [to announce a constitutional doctrine] .... Simply fishing one case from the stream of appellate review, using it as a vehicle for pronouncing new constitutional standards, and then permitting a stream of similar cases subsequently to flow by unaffected by that new rule constitute an indefensible departure from [our ordinary] model of judicial review.\u201d <em>Mackey, supra, </em>at 679, 91 S. Ct. 1148, 28 L. Ed. 2d 388.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">[564 U.S. 256]</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">And in <em>Griffith, </em>the Court \u201cembraced to a significant extent the comprehensive analysis presented by Justice Harlan.\u201d 479 U.S., at 322, 107 S. Ct. 708, 93 L. Ed. 2d 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Of course, the Court may, as it suggests, avoid this unfairness by refusing to apply the exclusionary rule even to the defendant in the very case in which it announces a \u201cnew rule.\u201d But that approach would make matters worse. What would then happen in the lower courts? How would courts of appeals, for example, come to reconsider their prior decisions when other circuits\u2019 cases lead them to believe those decisions may be wrong? Why would a defendant seek to overturn any such decision? After all, if the (incorrect) circuit precedent is clear, then even if the defendant wins (on the constitutional question), he loses (on relief). See <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 301, 87 S. Ct. 1967, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1199 (1967). To what extent then could this Court rely upon lower courts to work out Fourth Amendment differences among themselves\u2014 through circuit reconsideration of a precedent that other circuits have criticized? See <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>514 U.S. 1, 23, n. 1, 115 S. Ct. 1185, 131 L. Ed. 2d 34 (1995) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">Perhaps more important, the Court\u2019s rationale for creating its new \u201cgood faith\u201d exception threatens to undermine well-settled F ourth Amendment law. The Court correctly says that <em>pre-Gant </em>Eleventh Circuit precedent had held that a Gant-type search was constitutional; hence the police conduct in this case, consistent with that precedent, was \u201cinnocent.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 240, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 296. But the Court then finds this fact sufficient to create a new \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule. It reasons that the \u201csole purpose\u201d of the exclusionary rule \u201cis to deter future Fourth Amendment violations,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 236-237, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 293. The \u201cdeterrence benefits of exclusion vary with the culpability of the law en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>forcement conduct at issue,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 238, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 295 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Those benefits are sufficient to justify exclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">[564 U.S. 257]</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">where \u201cpolice exhibit deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent disregard for Fourth Amendment rights,\u201d <em>ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). But those benefits do not justify exclusion where, as here, the police act with \u201csimple, isolated negligence\u201d or an \u201cobjectively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is lawful,\u201d <em>ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">If the Court means what it says, what will happen to the exclusionary rule, a rule that the Court adopted nearly a century ago for federal courts, <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>232 U.S. 383, 34 S. Ct. 341, 58 L. Ed. 652, and made applicable to state courts a half century ago through the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081? The Court has thought of that rule not as punishment for the individual officer or as reparation for the individual defendant but more generally as an effective way to secure enforcement of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s commands. <em>Weeks, supra, </em>at 393, 34 S. Ct. 341, 58 L. Ed. 652 (without the exclusionary rule, the Fourth Amendment would be \u201cof no value,\u201d and \u201cmight as well be stricken from the Constitution\u201d). This Court has deviated from the \u201csuppression\u201d norm in the name of \u201cgood faith\u201d only a handful of times and in limited, atypical circumstances: where a magistrate has erroneously issued a warrant, Un<em>ited States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1984); where a database has erroneously informed police that they have a warrant, <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Evans, supra, Herring </em>v. <em>United States, </em>555 U.S. 135, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d 496 (2009); and where an unconstitutional statute purported to authorize the search, <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Krull, </em>480 U.S. 340, 107 S. Ct. 1160, 94 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1987). See <em>Herring, supra, </em>at 142, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d 496 (\u201cgood faith\u201d exception inaptly named).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The fact that such exceptions are few and far between is understandable. Defendants frequently move to suppress evidence on Fourth Amendment grounds. In many, perhaps most, of these instances the police, uncertain of how the Fourth Amendment applied to the particular factual circumstances they faced, will have acted in objective good faith. Yet, in a significant percentage of these instances, courts will</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">[564 U.S. 258]</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">find that the police were wrong. And, unless the police conduct falls into one of the exceptions previously noted, courts have required the suppression of the evidence seized. 1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 1.3, pp. 103-104 (4th ed. 2004) (\u201cgood faith\u201d exception has not yet been applied to warrantless searches and seizures beyond the \u201crather special situations\u201d of <em>Evans, Herring, </em>and <em>Krull). See </em>Valdes, Frequency and Success: An Empirical Study of Criminal Law Defenses, Federal Constitutional Evidentiary Claims, and Plea Negotiations, 153 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1709, 1728 (2005) (suppression motions are filed in approximately 7% of criminal cases; approximately 12% of suppression motions are successful); LaFave, <em>supra, </em>at 64 (\u201cSurely many more Fourth Amendment violations result from carelessness than from intentional constitutional violations\u201d); Stewart, The Road to <em>Mapp v. Ohio </em>and Beyond: The Origins, Development and Future of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the Exclusionary Rule in Search-and-Seizure Cases, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1365, 1389 (1983) (\u201c[T]he vast majority of fourth amendment violations ... [are] motivated by commendable zeal, not condemnable malice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">But an officer who conducts a search that he believes complies with the Constitution but which, it ultimately turns out, falls just outside the Fourth Amendment\u2019s bounds is no more culpable than an officer who follows erroneous \u201cbinding precedent.\u201d Nor is an officer more culpable where circuit precedent is simply suggestive rather than \u201cbinding,\u201d where it only describes how to treat roughly analogous instances, or where it just does not exist. Thus, if the Court means what it now says, if it would place determinative weight upon the culpability of an individual officer\u2019s conduct, and if it would apply the exclusionary rule only where a Fourth Amendment violation was \u201cdeliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent,\u201d then the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception will swallow the exclusionary rule. Indeed, our broad dicta in Herring\u2014dicta the Court repeats and expands upon today\u2014may already be leading</p>\n<p id=\"apv-dedup-0\">[564 U.S. 259]</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">lower courts in this direction. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Julius, </em>610 F.3d 60, 66-67 (CA2 2010) (assuming war-rantless search was unconstitutional and remanding for District Court to \u201cperform the cost/benefit analysis required by Herring\u201d and to consider \u201cwhether the degree of police culpability in this case rose beyond mere . . . negligence\u201d before ordering suppression); Un<em>ited States </em>v. <em>Master, </em>614 F.3d 236, 243 (CA6 2010) (\u201c[T]he <em>Herring </em>Court\u2019s emphasis seems weighed more toward preserving evidence for use in obtaining convictions, even if illegally seized . . . unless the officers engage in \u2018deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent conduct\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Herring, supra, </em>at 144, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d 496)). Today\u2019s decision will doubtless accelerate this trend.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Any such change (which may already be underway) would affect not \u201can exceedingly small set of cases,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 247, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 301, but a very large number of cases, potentially many thousands each year. See Valdes, <em>supra, </em>at 1728. And since the exclusionary rule is often the only sanction available for a Fourth Amendment violation, the Fourth Amendment would no longer protect ordinary Americans from \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d See <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>338 U.S. 25, 41, 69 S. Ct. 1359, 93 L. Ed. 1782 (1949) (Murphy, J., dissenting) (In many circumstances, \u201cthere is but one alternative to the rule of exclusion. That is no sanction at all\u201d), overruled by <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra; Herring, supra, </em>at 152, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d 496 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (the exclusionary rule is \u201can essential auxiliary\u201d to the Fourth Amendment). It would become a watered-down Fourth Amendment, offering its protection against only those searches and seizures that are <em>egregiously </em>unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">In sum, I fear that the Court\u2019s opinion will undermine the exclusionary rule. And I believe that the Court wrongly departs from <em>Griffith </em>regardless. Instead I would follow <em>Griffith, </em>apply <em>Gant\u2019s </em>rule retroactively to this case, and require</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">[564 U.S. 260]</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">suppression of the evidence. Such an approach is consistent with our precedent, and it would indeed affect no more than \u201can exceedingly small set of cases.\" <em>Ante, </em>at 247, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"Axak\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
