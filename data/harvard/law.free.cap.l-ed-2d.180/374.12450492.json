The District Court and the Court of Appeals approved the certification of a class comprising about one and a half million plaintiffs, current and former female employees of petitioner Wal-Mart who allege that the discretion exercised by their local supervisors over pay and promotion matters violates Title VII by discriminating against women. In addition to injunc-tive and declaratory relief, the plaintiffs seek an award of backpay. We consider whether the certification of the plaintiff class was consistent with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">Petitioner Wal-Mart is the Nation\u2019s largest private employer. It operates four types of retail stores throughout the country: Discount Stores, Super-centers, Neighborhood Markets, and Sam\u2019s Clubs. Those stores are divided into seven nationwide divisions, which in turn comprise 41 regions of 80 to 85 stores apiece. Each store has between 40 and 53 separate departments and 80 to 500 staff positions. In all, Wal-Mart operates approximately 3,400 stores and employs more than 1 million people.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-14\">[564 U.S. 343]</p>\n<p id=\"b427-17\">Pay and promotion decisions at Wal-Mart are generally committed to local managers\u2019 broad discretion, which is exercised \u201cin a largely subjective manner.\u201d 222 F.R.D. 137, 145 (ND Cal. 2004). Local store managers may increase the wages of hourly employees (within limits) with only limited corporate oversight. As for salaried employees, such as store managers and their deputies, higher corporate authorities have discretion to set their pay within preestablished ranges.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-18\">Promotions work in a similar fashion. Wal-Mart permits store managers to apply their own subjective criteria when selecting candidates as \u201csupport managers,\u201d which is the first step on the path to management. Admission to Wal-Mart\u2019s management training program, however, does require that a candidate meet certain objective criteria, including an above-average performance rating, at least one year\u2019s tenure in the applicant\u2019s current position, and a willingness to relocate. But except for those requirements, regional and district managers have discretion to use their own judgment when selecting candidates for management training. Promotion to higher <em>office\u2014e.g., </em>assistant manager, co-manager, or store manager\u2014is similarly at the discretion of the employee\u2019s superiors after prescribed objective factors are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-19\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b427-20\">The named plaintiffs in this lawsuit, representing the 1.5 million <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>members of the certified class, are three current or former Wal-Mart employees who allege that the company discriminated against them on the basis of their sex by denying them equal pay or promotions, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 255, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-1 <em>et </em>seq.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">[564 U.S. 344]</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Betty Dukes began working at a Pittsburg, California, Wal-Mart in 1994. She started as a cashier, but later sought and received a promotion to customer service manager. After a series of disciplinary violations, however, Dukes was demoted back to cashier and then to greeter. Dukes concedes she violated company policy, but contends that the disciplinary actions were in fact retaliation for invoking internal complaint procedures and that male employees have not been disciplined for similar infractions. Dukes also claims two male greeters in the Pittsburg store are paid more than she is.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Christine Kwapnoski has worked at Sam\u2019s Club stores in Missouri and California for most of her adult life. She has held a number of positions, including a supervisory position. She claims that a male manager yelled at her frequently and screamed at female employees, but not at men. The manager in question \u201ctold [her] to \u2018doll up,\u2019 to wear some makeup, and to dress a little better.\u201d App. 1003a.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The final named plaintiff, Edith Arana, worked at a Wal-Mart store in Duarte, California, from 1995 to 2001. In 2000, she approached the store manager on more than one occasion about management training, but was brushed off. Arana concluded she was being denied opportunity for advancement because of her sex. She initiated internal complaint procedures, whereupon she was told to apply directly to the district manager if she thought her store manager was being unfair. Arana, however, decided against that and never applied for management training again. In 2001, she was fired for failure to comply with Wal-Mart\u2019s timekeeping policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">These plaintiffs, respondents here, do not allege that Wal-Mart has any express corporate policy against the advancement of women. Rather, they claim that their local managers\u2019 discretion over pay and promotions is exercised disproportionately in favor of men, leading to an unlawful disparate impact on female employees, see 42 U.S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">[564 U.S. 345]</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">\u00a7 2000e-2(k). And, respondents say, because Wal-Mart is aware of this effect, its refusal to cabin its managers\u2019 authority amounts to disparate treatment, see \u00a7 2000e-2(a). Their complaint seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, punitive damages, and backpay. It does not ask for compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">Importantly for our purposes, respondents claim that the discrimination to which they have been subjected is common to <em>all </em>Wal-Mart\u2019s female employees. The basic theory of their case is that a strong and uniform \u201ccorporate culture\u201d permits bias against women to infect, perhaps subconsciously, the discretionary de-cisionmaking of each one of Wal-Mart\u2019s thousands of managers\u2014 thereby making every woman at the company the victim of one common discriminatory practice. Respondents therefore wish to litigate the Title VII claims of all female employees at Wal-Mart\u2019s stores in a nationwide class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Class certification is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. Under Rule 23(a), the party seeking certification must demonstrate, first, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">\u201c(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">\u201c(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">\u201c(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">\u201c(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Second, the proposed class must satisfy at least one of the three requirements listed in Rule 23(b). Respondents rely on Rule 23(b)(2), which applies when \u201cthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">[564 U.S. 346]</p>\n<p id=\"ahd-dedup-0\">declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">Invoking these provisions, respondents moved the District Court to certify a plaintiff class consisting of \u201c\u2018[a] 11 women employed at any Wal-Mart domestic retail store at any time since December 26, 1998 who have been or may be subjected to Wal-Mart\u2019s challenged pay and management track promotions policies and practices.\u2019 \u201d 222 F.R.D., at 141-142 (quoting Plaintiffs Motion for Class Certification in Case No. 3:01-cv-02252-CRB (ND Cal.), Doc. 99, p. 37). As evidence that there were indeed \u201cquestions of law or fact common to\u201d all the women of Wal-Mart, as Rule 23(a)(2) requires, respondents relied chiefly on three forms of proof: statistical evidence about pay and promotion disparities between men and women at the company, anecdotal reports of discrimination from about 120 of Wal-Mart\u2019s female employees, and the testimony of a sociologist, Dr. William Bielby, who conducted a \u201csocial framework analysis\u201d of Wal-Mart\u2019s \u201cculture\u201d and personnel practices, and concluded that the company was \u201cvulnerable\u201d to gender discrimination. 603 F.3d 571, 601 (CA9 2010) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">Wal-Mart unsuccessfully moved to strike much of this evidence. It also offered its own countervailing statistical and other proof in an effort to defeat Rule 23(a)\u2019s requirements</p>\n<p id=\"AHmN\">[564 U.S. 347]</p>\n<p id=\"b429-14\">of commonality, typicality, and adequate representation. Wal-Mart further contended that respondents\u2019 monetary claims for backpay could not be certified under Rule 23(b)(2), first because that Rule refers only to injunctive and declaratory relief, and second because the backpay claims could not be manageably tried as a class without depriving Wal-Mart of its right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>present certain statutory defenses. With one limitation not relevant here, the District Court granted respondents\u2019 motion and certified their proposed class.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">A divided en banc Court of Appeals substantially affirmed the District Court\u2019s certification order. 603 F.3d 571. The majority concluded that respondents\u2019 evidence of commonality was sufficient to \u201craise the common question whether Wal-Mart\u2019s female employees nationwide were subjected to a single set of corporate policies (not merely a number of independent discriminatory acts) that may have worked to unlawfully discriminate against them in violation of Title VII.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 612 (emphasis deleted). It also agreed with the District Court that the named plaintiffs\u2019 claims were sufficiently typical of the class as a whole to satisfy Rule 23(a)(3), and that they could serve as adequate class representatives, see Rule 23(a)(4). <em>Id., </em>at 614-615. With respect to the Rule 23(b)(2) question, the Ninth Circuit held that respondents\u2019 backpay claims could be certified as part of a (b)(2) class because they did not \u201cpredominat[e]\u201d over the requests for declaratory and injunctive relief, meaning they were not \u201csuperior in strength, influence, or authority\u201d to</p>\n<p id=\"Aj6Z\">[564 U.S. 348]</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">the non-monetary claims. <em>Id., </em>at 616 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Finally, the Court of Appeals determined that the action could be man-ageably tried as a class action because the District Court could adopt the approach the Ninth Circuit approved in <em>Hilao </em>v. <em>Estate of Marcos, </em>103 F.3d 767, 782-787 (1996). There compensatory damages for some 9,541 class members were calculated by selecting 137 claims at random, referring those claims to a special master for valuation, and then extrapolating the validity and value of the untested claims from the sample set. See 603 F.3d, at 625-626. The Court of Appeals \u201cs[aw] no reason why a similar procedure to that used in <em>Hilao </em>could not be employed in this case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 627. It would allow Wal-Mart \u201cto present individual defenses in the randomly selected \u2018sample cases,\u2019 thus revealing the approximate percentage of class members whose unequal pay or non-promotion was due to something other than gender discrimination.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>n. 56 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">We granted certiorari. 562 U.S. 1091, 131 S. Ct. 795, 178 L. Ed. 2d 530 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">The class action is \u201can exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>individual named parties only.\u201d <em>Califano </em>v. <em>Yamasaki, </em>442 U.S. 682, 700-701, 99 S. Ct. 2545, 61 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1979). In order to justify a departure from that rule, \u201ca class representative must be part of the class and \u2018possess the same interest and suffer the same injury\u2019 as the</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">[564 U.S. 349]</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">class members.\u201d <em>East Tex. Motor Freight System, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>431 U.S. 395, 403, 97 S. Ct. 1891, 52 L. Ed. 2d 453 (1977) (quoting <em>Schlesinger </em>v. <em>Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, </em>418 U.S. 208, 216, 94 S. Ct. 2925, 41 L. Ed. 2d 706 (1974)). Rule 23(a) ensures that the named plaintiffs are appropriate representatives of the class whose claims they wish to litigate. The Rule\u2019s four requirements\u2014numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequate representation\u2014\u201ceffectively \u2018limit the class claims to those fairly encompassed by the named plaintiff\u2019s claims.\u2019 \u201d <em>General Telephone Co. of Southwest </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>457 U.S. 147, 156, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1982) (quoting <em>General Telephone Co. of Northwest </em>v. <em>EEOC, </em>446 U.S. 318, 330, 100 S. Ct. 1698, 64 L. Ed. 2d 319 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The crux of this case is  commonality\u2014the rule requiring a plaintiff to show that \u201cthere are questions of law or fact common to the class.\u201d Rule 23(a)(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That language is easy to misread, since \u201c[a]ny competently crafted class complaint literally raises common \u2018questions.\u2019 \u201d Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 97, 131-132 (2009). For example: Do all of us plaintiffs indeed work for Wal-Mart? Do our managers have discretion over pay? Is that an unlawful employment practice? What remedies should we get? Reciting these questions is not sufficient to obtain class certification.  Commonality</p>\n<p id=\"A2lA\">[564 U.S. 350]</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class members \u201chave suffered the same injury,\u201d <em>Falcon, supra, </em>at 157, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740. This does not mean merely that they have all suffered a violation of the same provision of law.  Title VII, for example, can be violated in many ways\u2014by intentional discrimination, or by hiring and promotion criteria that result in disparate impact, and by the use of these practices on the part of many different superiors in a single company. Quite obviously, the mere claim by employees of the same company that they have suffered a Title VII injury, or even a disparate-impact Title VII injury, gives no cause to believe that all their claims can productively be litigated at once. Their claims must depend upon a common contention\u2014for example, the assertion of discriminatory bias on the part of the same supervisor. That common contention, moreover, must be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution\u2014which means that determination of its truth or fal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>sity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\">\u201cWhat matters to class certification ... is not the raising of common \u2018questions\u2019\u2014even in droves\u2014but, rather, the capacity of a class-wide proceeding to generate common <em>answers </em>apt to drive the resolution of the litigation. Dissimilarities within the proposed class are what have the potential to impede the generation of common answers.\u201d Nagareda, <em>supra, </em>at 132.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Rule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading standard. A party seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with the Rule\u2014that is, he must be prepared to prove that there are <em>in fact </em>sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or fact, etc. We recognized in <em>Falcon </em>that \u201csometimes it may be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question,\u201d 457 U.S., at 160, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740, and that certification is proper only if \u201cthe trial court is satisfied, after a</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">[564 U.S. 351]</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 161, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740; see <em>id., </em>at 160, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740 (\u201c[A]ctual, not presumed, conformance with Rule 23(a) remains . . . indispensable\u201d). Frequently that \u201crigorous analysis\u201d will entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiffs underlying claim. That cannot be helped. \u201c \u2018[T]he class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiffs cause of action.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 160, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740 (quoting <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>v. <em>Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 469, 98 S. Ct. 2454, 57 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1978); some internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nor is there anything unusual about that consequence: The necessity of touching aspects of the merits in order to resolve</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">[564 U.S. 352]</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">preliminary matters, <em>e.g., </em>jurisdiction and venue, is a familiar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>feature of litigation. See <em>Szabo </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Machines, Inc., </em>249 F.3d 672, 676-677 (CA7 2001) (Easterbrook, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">In this case, proof of commonality necessarily overlaps with respondents\u2019 merits contention that Wal-Mart engages in a <em>pattern or practice </em>of discrimination.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That is so because,  in resolving an individual\u2019s Title VII claim, the crux of the inquiry is \u201cthe reason for a particular employment decision,\u201d <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, </em>467 U.S. 867, 876, 104 S. Ct. 2794, 81 L. Ed. 2d 718 (1984). Here respondents wish to sue about literally millions of employment decisions at once. Without some glue holding the alleged <em>reasons </em>for all those decisions together, it will be impossible to say that examination of all the class members\u2019 claims for relief will produce a common answer to the crucial question <em>why was I disfavored.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">This Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Falcon </em>describes how the commonality issue must be approached. There an employee who claimed that he was deliberately denied a promotion on account of race obtained certification of a class comprising all employees wrongfully denied promotions and all applicants wrongfully denied jobs. 457 U.S., at 152, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740. We rejected that composite class for lack of commonality and typicality, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">\u201cConceptually, there is a wide gap between (a) an individual\u2019s claim that he has been denied a promotion [or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">[564 U.S. 353]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-10\">higher pay] on discriminatory grounds, and his otherwise unsupported allegation that the company has a policy of discrimination, and (b) the existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same injury as that individual, such that the individual\u2019s claim and the class claims will share common questions of law or fact and that the individual\u2019s claim will be typical of the class claims.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 157-158, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-11\"><em>Falcon </em>suggested two ways in which that conceptual gap might be bridged. First, if the employer \u201cused a biased testing procedure to evaluate both applicants for employment and incumbent employees, a class action on behalf of every applicant or employee who might have been prejudiced by the test clearly would satisfy the commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a).\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 159, n. 15, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740. Second, \u201c[s]ignificant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination conceivably could justify a class of both applicants and employees if the discrimination manifested itself in hiring and promotion practices in the same general fashion, such as through entirely subjective decisionmaking processes.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We think that statement precisely describes respondents\u2019 burden in this case. The first manner of bridging the gap obviously has no application here; Wal-Mart has no testing procedure or other companywide evaluation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>method that can be charged with bias. The whole point of permitting discretionary decisionmaking is to avoid evaluating employees under a common standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The second manner of bridging the gap requires \u201c[s]ignificant proof\u2019 that Wal-Mart \u201coperated under a general policy of discrimination.\u201d That is entirely absent here. Wal-Mart\u2019s announced policy forbids sex discrimination, see App. 1567a-1596a, and as the District Court recognized the company imposes penalties for denials of equal employment opportunity, 222 F.R.D., at 154. The only evidence of a \u201cgeneral policy of discrimination\u201d respondents produced was the testimony of Dr. William Bielby, their sociological</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">[564 U.S. 354]</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">expert. Relying on \u201csocial framework\u201d analysis, Bielby testified that Wal-Mart has a \u201cstrong corporate culture,\u201d that makes it \u201cvulnerable\u201d to \u201cgender bias.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 152. He could not, however, \u201cdetermine with any specificity how regularly stereotypes play a meaningful role in employment decisions at Wal-Mart. At his deposition . . . Dr. Bielby conceded that he could not calculate whether 0.5 percent or 95 percent of the employment decisions at Wal-Mart might be determined by stereotyped thinking.\u201d 222 F.R.D. 189, 192 (ND Cal. 2004). The parties dispute whether Bielby\u2019s testimony even met the standards for the admission of expert testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and our <em>Daubert </em>case, see <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The District Court concluded that <em>Daubert </em>did not apply to expert testimony at the certification stage of class-action proceedings. 222 F.R.D., at 191. We doubt that is so, but even if properly considered, Bielby\u2019s testimony does nothing to advance respondents\u2019 case. \u201c[WJhether 0.5 percent or 95 percent of the employment decisions at Wal-Mart might be determined by stereotyped thinking\u201d is the essential question on which respondents\u2019 theory of commonality depends. If Bielby admittedly has no answer to that question, we can safely disregard</p>\n<p id=\"Ajec\">[564 U.S. 355]</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">what he has to say. It is worlds away from \u201c[s]ignificant proof\u2019 that Wal-Mart \u201coperated under a general policy of discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">The only corporate policy that the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence convincingly establishes is Wal-Mart\u2019s \u201cpolicy\u201d of <em>allowing discretion </em>by local supervisors over employment matters. On its face, of course, that is just the opposite of a uniform employment practice that would provide the commonality needed for a class action; it is a policy <em>against having </em>uniform employment practices.  It is also a very common and presumptively reasonable way of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>doing business\u2014one that we have said \u201cshould itself raise no inference of discriminatory conduct,\u201d <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust, </em>487 U.S. 977, 990, 108 S. Ct. 2777, 101 L. Ed. 2d 827 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">To be sure, we have recognized that,  \u201cin appropriate cases,\u201d giving discretion to lower-level supervisors can be the basis of Title VII liability under a disparate-impact theory\u2014since \u201can employer\u2019s undisciplined system of subjective decisionmaking [can have] precisely the same effects as a system pervaded by impermissible intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 990-991, 108 S. Ct. 2777, 101 L. Ed. 2d 827. But the recognition that this type of Title VII claim \u201ccan\u201d exist does not lead to the conclusion that every employee in a company using a system of discretion has such a claim in common. To the contrary, left to their own devices most managers in any corporation\u2014and surely most managers in a corporation that forbids sex discrimination\u2014would select sex-neutral, performance-based criteria for hiring and promotion that produce no actionable disparity at all. Others may choose to reward various attributes that produce disparate impact\u2014such as scores on general aptitude tests or educational achievements, see <em>Griggs </em>v. <em>Duke Power Co., </em>401 U.S. 424, 431-432, 91 S. Ct. 849, 28 L. Ed. 2d 158 (1971). And still other managers may be guilty of intentional discrimination that produces a sex-based disparity. In such a company, demonstrating the invalidity of one manager\u2019s use</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">[564 U.S. 356]</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">of discretion will do nothing to demonstrate the invalidity of another\u2019s. A party seeking to certify a nationwide class will be unable to show that all the employees\u2019 Title VII claims will in fact depend on the answers to common questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">Respondents have not identified a common mode of exercising discretion that pervades the entire company\u2014 aside from their reliance on Dr. Biel-by\u2019s social-framework analysis that we have rejected. In a company of Wal-Mart\u2019s size and geographical scope, it is quite unbelievable that all managers would exercise their discretion in a common way without some common direction. Respondents attempt to make that showing by means of statistical and anecdotal evidence, but their evidence falls well short.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">The statistical evidence consists primarily of regression analyses performed by Dr. Richard Drogin, a statistician, and Dr. Marc Bendick, a labor economist. Drogin conducted his analysis region by region, comparing the number of women promoted into management positions with the percentage of women in the available pool of hourly workers. After considering regional and national data, Drogin concluded that \u201cthere are statistically significant disparities between men and women at Wal-Mart . . . [and] these disparities . . . can be explained only by gender discrimination.\u201d 603 F.3d, at 604 (internal quotation marks omitted). Bendick compared workforce data from Wal-Mart and competitive retailers and concluded that Wal-Mart \u201cpromotes a lower percentage of women than its competitors.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-13\">Even if they are taken at face value, these studies are insufficient to establish that respondents\u2019 theory can be proved on a classwide basis. In <em>Falcon, </em>we held that  one named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>plaintiffs experience of discrimination was insufficient to infer that \u201cdiscriminatory treatment is typical of [the employer\u2019s employment] practices.\u201d 457 U.S., at 158, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740. A similar failure of inference arises here. As Judge Ikuta observed in her dissent, \u201c[information about disparities at the regional and national level does not establish the existence</p>\n<p id=\"AKGu\">[564 U.S. 357]</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">of disparities at individual stores, let alone raise the inference that a company-wide policy of discrimination is implemented by discretionary decisions at the store and district level.\u201d 603 F.3d, at 637. A regional pay disparity, for example, may be attributable to only a small set of Wal-Mart stores, and cannot by itself establish the uniform, store-by-store disparity upon which the plaintiffs\u2019 theory of commonality depends.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">There is another, more fundamental, respect in which respondents\u2019 statistical proof fails. Even if it established (as it does not) a pay or promotion pattern that differs from the nationwide figures or the regional figures in <em>all </em>of Wal-Mart\u2019s 3,400 stores, that would still not demonstrate that commonality of issue exists. Some managers will claim that the availability of women, or qualified women, or interested women, in their stores\u2019 area does not mirror the national or regional statistics. And almost all of them will claim to have been applying some sex-neutral, performance-based criteria\u2014whose nature and effects will differ from store to store.  In the landmark case of ours which held that giving discretion to lower-level supervisors can be the basis of Title VII liability under a disparate-impact theory, the plurality opinion <em>conditioned </em>that holding on the corollary that merely proving that the discretionary system has produced a racial or sexual disparity <em>is not enough. </em>\u201cT]he plaintiff must begin by identifying the specific employment practice that is challenged.\u201d <em>Watson, supra, </em>at 994, 108 S. Ct. 2777, 101 L. Ed. 2d 827; accord, <em>Wards Cove Packing Co. </em>v. <em>Atonio, </em>490 U.S. 642, 656, 109 S. Ct. 2115, 104 L. Ed. 2d 733 (1989) (approving that statement), superseded by statute on other grounds, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(k). That is all the more necessary when a class of plaintiffs is sought to be certified. Other than the bare existence of delegated discretion, respondents have identified no \u201cspecific employment practice\u201d\u2014much less one that ties all their 1.5 million claims together. Merely showing that Wal-Mart\u2019s policy of discretion has produced an overall sex-based disparity does not suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">[564 U.S. 358]</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Respondents\u2019 anecdotal evidence suffers from the same defects, and in addition is too weak to raise any inference that all the individual, discretionary personnel decisions are discriminatory. In <em>Teamsters </em>v. <em>United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 52 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1977), in addition to substantial statistical evidence of companywide discrimination, the Government (as plaintiff) produced about 40 specific accounts of racial discrimination from particular individuals. See <em>id., </em>at 338, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 52 L. Ed. 2d 396. That number was significant because the company involved had only 6,472 employees, of whom 571 were minorities, <em>id., </em>at 337, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 52 L. Ed. 2d 396, and the class itself consisted of around 334 persons, <em>United States </em>v. <em>T. I. M. E.-D. C., Inc., </em>517 F.2d 299, 308 (CA5 1975), overruled on other grounds, <em>Teamsters, supra. </em>The 40 anecdotes thus represented roughly one account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>for every eight members of the class. Moreover, the Court of Appeals noted that the anecdotes came from individuals \u201cspread throughout\u201d the company who \u201cfor the most part\u201d worked at the company\u2019s operational centers that employed the largest numbers of the class members. 517 F.2d, at 315, and n. 30. Here, by contrast, respondents filed some 120 affidavits reporting experiences of discrimination\u2014 about 1 for every 12,500 class members\u2014relating to only some 235 out of Wal-Mart\u2019s 3,400 stores. 603 F.3d, at 634 (Ikuta, J., dissenting). More than half of these reports are concentrated in only 6 States (Alabama, California, Florida, Missouri, Texas, and Wisconsin); half of all States have only one or two anecdotes; and 14 States have no anecdotes about Wal-Mart\u2019s operations at all. <em>Id., </em>at 634-635, and n. 10. Even if every single one of these accounts is true, that would not demonstrate  that the entire company \u201coperate [s] under a general policy of discrimination,\u201d <em>Falcon, </em>457 U.S., at 159, n. 15, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740, which is what respondents must show to certify a companywide class.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">[564 U.S. 359]</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The dissent misunderstands the nature of the foregoing analysis. It criticizes our focus on the dissimilarities between the putative class members on the ground that we have \u201cblend[ed]\u201d Rule 23(a)(2)\u2019s commonality requirement with Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s inquiry into whether common questions \u201cpredominate\u201d over individual ones. See <em>post, </em>at 374-376, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 404-406 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). That is not so. We quite agree that [18] for purposes of Rule 23(a)(2) \u201c \u2018[e]ven a single [common] question\u2019 \u201d will do, <em>post, </em>at 376, n. 9, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 406 (quoting Nagareda, The Preexistence Principle and the Structure of the Class Action, 103 Colum. L. Rev. 149, 176, n. 110 (2003)). We consider dissimilarities not in order to determine (as Rule 23(b)(3) requires) whether common questions <em>predominate, </em>but in order to determine (as Rule 23(a)(2) requires) whether there <em>is </em>\u201c[e]ven a single [common] question.\u201d And there is not here. Because respondents provide no convincing proof of a compa-nywide discriminatory pay and promotion policy, we have concluded that they have not established the existence of any common question.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">In sum, we agree with Chief Judge Kozinski that the members of the class</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">\u201cheld a multitude of jobs, at different levels of Wal-Mart\u2019s hierarchy, for variable lengths of time, in 3,400 stores, sprinkled across 50 states, with a kaleido<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>scope of supervisors (male and female), subject to a variety of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApRn\">[564 U.S. 360]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">regional policies that all differed ....

They have little in common but their sex and this lawsuit.\u201d 603 F.3d, at 652 (dissenting opinion).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">We also conclude that respondents\u2019 claims for backpay were improperly certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). Our opinion in <em>Ticor Title Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>511 U.S. 117, 121, 114 S. Ct. 1359, 128 L. Ed. 2d 33 (1994) <em>(per curiam), </em>expressed serious doubt about  whether claims for monetary relief may be certified under that provision. We now hold that they may not, at least where (as here) the monetary relief is not incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Rule 23(b)(2) allows class treatment when \u201cthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\u201d One possible reading of this provision is that it applies <em>only </em>to requests for such injunctive or declaratory relief and does not authorize the class certification of monetary claims at all. We need not reach that broader question in this case, because we think that, at a minimum, claims for <em>individualized </em>relief (like the backpay at issue here) do not satisfy the Rule. The key to the (b)(2) class is \u201cthe indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted\u2014the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.\u201d Nagareda, 84 N. Y. U. L. Rev., at 132. In other words, Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class. It does not authorize class certification when each individual class member would be entitled to a <em>different </em>injunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant. Similarly, it does not</p>\n<p id=\"A1sd\">[564 U.S. 361]</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">authorize class certification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">That interpretation accords with the history of the Rule.  Because Rule 23 \u201cstems from equity practice\u201d that predated its codification, <em>Amchem Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>521 U.S. 591, 613, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1997), in determining its meaning we have previously looked to the historical models on which the Rule was based, <em>Ortiz </em>v. <em>Fibreboard Corp., </em>527 U.S. 815, 841-845, 119 S. Ct. 2295, 144 L. Ed. 2d 715 (1999). As we observed in <em>Amchem, </em>\u201c[c] ivil rights cases against parties charged with unlawful, class-based discrimination are prime examples\u201d of what (b)(2) is meant to capture. 521 U.S., at 614, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689. In particular, the Rule reflects a series of decisions involving challenges to racial segregation\u2014conduct that was remedied by a single classwide order. In none of the cases cited by the Advisory Committee as examples of (b)(2)\u2019s antecedents did the plaintiffs combine any claim for individualized relief with their classwide injunction. See Advisory Committee\u2019s Note, 28 U.S.C. App., pp. 1260-1261 (1964 ed., Supp. II) (citing cases); <em>e.g., Potts </em>v. <em>Flax, </em>313 F.2d 284, 289, n. 5 (CA5 1963); <em>Brunson </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of School Dist. No. 1, Clarendon Cty., </em>311 F.2d 107, 109 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>(CA4 1962) <em>(per curiam,); Frasier </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Univ. of N.C., </em>134 F. Supp. 589, 593 (MDNC 1955) (three-judge court), aff'd, 350 U.S. 979, 76 S. Ct. 467, 100 L. Ed. 848 (1956) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Permitting the combination of individualized and classwide relief in a (b)(2) class is also inconsistent with the structure of Rule 23(b). Classes certified under (b)(1) and (b)(2) share the most traditional justifications for class treatment\u2014that individual adjudications would be impossible or unworkable, as in a (b)(1) class,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or that the relief sought must perforce</p>\n<p id=\"Au_V\">[564 U.S. 362]</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">affect the entire class at once, as in a (b)(2) class. For that reason these are also mandatory classes: The Rule provides no opportunity for (b)(1) or (b)(2) class members to opt out, and does not even oblige the District Court to afford them notice of the action.  Rule 23(b)(3), by contrast, is an \u201cadventuresome innovation\u201d of the 1966 amendments, <em>Amchem, </em>521 U.S., at 614, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (internal quotation marks omitted), framed for situations \u201cin which \u2018class-action treatment is not as clearly called for,\u2019\u201d <em>id., </em>at 615, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (quoting Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes, 28 U.S.C. App., p. 697 (1994 ed.)). It allows class certification in a much wider set of circumstances but with greater procedural protections. Its only prerequisites are that \u201cthe questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\u201d Rule 23(b)(3). And unlike (b)(1) and (b)(2) classes, the (b)(3) class is not mandatory; class members are entitled to receive \u201cthe best notice that is practicable under the circumstances\u201d and to withdraw from the class at their option. See Rule 23(c)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Given that structure, we think it clear that  individualized monetary claims belong in Rule 23(b)(3). The procedural protections attending the (b)(3) class\u2014predominance, superiority, mandatory notice, and the right to opt out\u2014are missing from (b)(2) not because the Rule considers them unnecessary, but because it considers them unnecessary <em>to a (b)(2) class. </em>When a class seeks an indivisible injunction benefiting all its members at once, there is no reason to undertake a case-specific inquiry into whether class issues predominate or whether class action is a superior method of adjudicating</p>\n<p id=\"Ad4h\">[564 U.S. 363]</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">the dispute. Predominance and superiority are self-evident. But with respect to each class member\u2019s individualized claim for money, that is not so\u2014which is precisely why (b)(3) requires the judge to make findings about predominance and superiority before allowing the class. Similarly,  (b)(2) does not require that class members be given notice and opt-out rights, presumably because it is thought (rightly or wrongly) that notice has no purpose when the class is mandatory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>and that depriving people of their right to sue in this manner complies with the Due Process Clause. In the context of a class action predominantly for money damages we have held that absence of notice and opt out violates due process. See <em>Phillips Petroleum Co. </em>v. <em>Shutts, </em>472 U.S. 797, 812, 105 S. Ct. 2965, 86 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1985). While we have never held that to be so where the monetary claims do not predominate, the serious possibility that it may be so provides an additional reason not to read Rule 23(b)(2) to include the monetary claims here.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Against that conclusion, respondents argue that their claims for backpay were appropriately certified as part of a class under Rule 23(b)(2) because those claims do not \u201cpredominate\u201d over their requests for injunctive and declaratory relief. They rely upon  the Advisory Committee\u2019s statement that Rule 23(b)(2) \u201cdoes not extend to cases in which the appropriate final relief relates <em>exclusively or predominantly </em>to money damages.\u201d 28 U.S.C. App., p. 1260 (1964 ed., Supp. II) (emphasis added). The negative implication, they argue, is that it <em>does </em>extend to cases in which the appropriate final relief relates only partially and nonpredominantly to money damages. Of course it is the Rule itself, not the Advisory Committee\u2019s description of it, that governs. And a mere negative inference does not in our view suffice to establish a disposition that has no basis in the Rule\u2019s text, and that does obvious violence to the Rule\u2019s structural features.  The mere \u201cpredominance\u201d of a proper (b)(2) injunctive claim</p>\n<p id=\"Ak5X\">[564 U.S. 364]</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">does nothing to justify elimination of Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s procedural protections: It neither establishes the superiority of <em>class </em>adjudication over <em>individual </em>adjudication nor cures the notice and opt-out problems. We fail to see why the Rule should be read to nullify these protections whenever a plaintiff class, at its option, combines its monetary claims with a request\u2014even a \u201cpredominating request\u201d\u2014for an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Respondents\u2019 predominance test, moreover, creates perverse incentives for class representatives to place at risk potentially valid claims for monetary relief. In this case, for example, the named plaintiffs declined to include employees\u2019 claims for compensatory damages in their complaint. That strategy of including only backpay claims made it more likely that monetary relief would not \u201cpredominate.\u201d But it also created the possibility (if the predominance test were correct) that individual class members\u2019 compensatory-damages claims would be <em>precluded </em>by litigation they had no power to hold themselves apart from. If it were determined, for example, that a particular class member is not entitled to backpay because her denial of increased pay or a promotion was <em>not </em>the product of discrimination, that employee might be collaterally estopped from independently seeking compensatory damages based on that same denial. That possibility underscores the need for plaintiffs with individual monetary claims to decide <em>for themselves </em>whether to tie their fates to the class representatives\u2019 or go it alone\u2014a choice Rule 23(b)(2) does not ensure that they have.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The predominance test would also require the District Court to reevaluate the roster of class members continually. The Ninth Circuit recognized the necessity for this when it concluded that those plaintiffs no longer employed by Wal-Mart lack standing to seek injunctive or declaratory relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>against its employment practices. The Court of Appeals\u2019 response to that difficulty, however, was not to eliminate <em>all </em>former employees from the certified class, but to eliminate only those who had left the company\u2019s employ by the date</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">[564 U.S. 365]</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">the complaint was filed. That solution has no logical connection to the problem, since those who have left their Wal-Mart jobs <em>since </em>the complaint was filed have no more need for prospective relief than those who left beforehand. As a consequence, even though  the validity of a (b)(2) class depends on whether \u201cfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class <em>as a whole,\u201d </em>Rule 23(b)(2) (emphasis added), about half the members of the class approved by the Ninth Circuit have no claim for injunctive or declaratory relief at all. Of course, the alternative (and logical) solution of excising plaintiffs from the class as they leave their employment may have struck the Court of Appeals as wasteful of the District Court\u2019s time. Which indeed it is, since if a backpay action were properly certified for class treatment under <em>(b)(3), </em>the ability to litigate a plaintiffs backpay claim as part of the class would not turn on the irrelevant question whether she is still employed at Wal-Mart. What follows from this, however, is not that some arbitrary limitation on class membership should be imposed but that the backpay claims should not be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Finally, respondents argue that their backpay claims are appropriate for a (b)(2) class action because a backpay award is equitable in nature. The latter may be true, but it is irrelevant.  The Rule does not speak of \u201cequitable\u201d remedies generally but of injunctions and declaratory judgments. As Title VII itself makes pel-lucidly clear, backpay is neither. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g)(2)(B)(i) and (ii) (distinguishing between declaratory and injunctive relief and the payment of \u201cbackpay,\u201d see \u00a7 2000e-5(g)(2)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">In <em>Allison </em>v. <em>Citgo Petroleum Corp., </em>151 F.3d 402, 415 (CA5 1998), the Fifth Circuit held that a (b)(2) class would permit the certification of monetary relief that is \u201cincidental to requested injunctive or declaratory relief,\u201d which it defined</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">[564 U.S. 366]</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">as \u201cdamages that flow directly from liability to the class <em>as a whole </em>on the claims forming the basis of the injunctive or declaratory relief.\u201d In that court\u2019s view, such \u201cincidental damages should not require additional hearings to resolve the disparate merits of each individual\u2019s case; it should neither introduce new and substantial legal or factual issues, nor entail complex individualized determinations.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We need not decide in this case whether there are any forms of \u201cincidental\u201d monetary relief that are consistent with the interpretation of Rule 23(b)(2) we have announced and that comply with the Due Process Clause. Respondents do not argue that they can satisfy this standard, and in any event they cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">Contrary to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s view, Wal-Mart is entitled to individualized determinations of each employee\u2019s eligibility for backpay.  Title VII includes a detailed remedial scheme. If a plaintiff prevails in showing that an employer has discriminated against him in violation of the statute, the court \u201cmay enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful employment practice, and order such affirmative action as may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>appropriate, [including] reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without back pay ... or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.\u201d \u00a7 2000e-5(g)(1). But if the employer can show that it took an adverse employment action against an employee for any reason other than discrimination, the court cannot order the \u201chiring, reinstatement, or promotion of an individual as an employee, or the payment to him of any back pay.\u201d \u00a7 2000e-5(g)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">We have established a procedure for trying pattern-or-practice cases that gives effect to these statutory requirements. When the plaintiff seeks individual relief such as reinstatement or backpay after establishing a pattern or practice of discrimination, \u201ca district court must usually conduct additional proceedings ... to determine the scope of individual relief.\u201d <em>Teamsters, </em>431 U.S., at 361, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 52 L. Ed. 2d 396. At this phase, the burden of proof will shift to the company, but it</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">[564 U.S. 367]</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">will have the right to raise any individual affirmative defenses it may have, and to \u201cdemonstrate that the individual applicant was denied an employment opportunity for lawful reasons.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 362, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 52 L. Ed. 2d 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The Court of Appeals believed that it was possible to replace such proceedings with Trial by Formula. A sample set of the class members would be selected, as to whom liability for sex discrimination and the backpay owing as a result would be determined in depositions supervised by a master. The percentage of claims determined to be valid would then be applied to the entire remaining class, and the number of (presumptively) valid claims thus derived would be multiplied by the average backpay award in the sample set to arrive at the entire class recovery\u2014without further individualized proceedings. 603 F.3d, at 625-627. We disapprove that novel project.  Because the Rules Enabling Act forbids interpreting Rule 23 to \u201cabridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072(b); see <em>Ortiz, </em>527 U.S., at 845, 119 S. Ct. 2295, 144 L. Ed. 2d 715, a class cannot be certified on the premise that Wal-Mart will not be entitled to litigate its statutory defenses to individual claims. And because the necessity of that litigation will prevent backpay from being \u201cincidental\u201d to the classwide injunction, respondents\u2019 class could not be certified even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that \u201cincidental\u201d monetary relief can be awarded to a 23(b)(2) class.</p>\n<p id=\"pAyJ9\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"55\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAU4AAAA3AQAAAABLcp55AAAAoUlEQVR4nO2UMQrDMBAET8F18IMCyc+Sx/gRKfIZp3DtdIHIlgvfWWtYgRtBirtuuNGy2EIhycGZTkdNEVf/Rt39Xw6mzg/YcqjTVdI6l0/KQyFqanrjaQ6qhnHM2wJY1+cASQXQRt8r1KNgXaW5QRAHUwfccjC1a2BbAG107qEehe27tm3OKYGeff0giEI0Nd5hSyHWuVnBnzdXXXW1iroAfl7sUdd6g08AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"334\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">SEPARATE OPINION</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-13\">.

Rule 23(b)(1) allows a class to be maintained where \u201cprosecuting separate actions by or against individual class members would create a risk of\u2019 either \u201c(A) inconsistent or varying adjudications,\u2019\u2019 or \u201c(B) adjudications . . . that, as a practical matter, would be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the individual adjudications or would substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests.\u2019\u2019 Rule 23(b)(3) states that a class may be maintained where \u201cquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,\u2019\u2019 and a class action would be \u201csuperior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\u2019\u2019 The applicability of these provisions to the plaintiff class is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b430-12\">. The District Court excluded backpay claims based on promotion opportunities that had not been publicly posted, for the reason that no applicant data could exist for such positions. 222 F.R.D. 137, 182 (ND Cal. 2004). It also decided to afford class members notice of the action and the right to opt out of the class with respect to respondents\u2019 punitive-damages claim. <em>Id., </em>at 173.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b430-13\">. To enable that result, the Court of Appeals trimmed the (b)(2) class in two ways: First, it remanded that part of the certification order which included respondents\u2019 punitive-damages claim in the (b)(2) class, so that the District Court might consider whether that might cause the monetary relief to predominate. 603 F.3d, at 621. Second, it accepted in part Wal-Mart\u2019s argument that since class members whom it no longer employed had no standing to seek injunctive or declaratory relief, as to them monetary claims must predominate. It excluded from the certified class \u201cthose putative class members who were no longer Wal-Mart employees <em>at the time Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was filed,\" id., </em>at 623 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b431-11\">. We have previously stated in this context that \u201c[t]he commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) tend to merge. Both serve as guideposts for determining whether under the particular circumstances maintenance of a class action is economical and whether the named plaintiff s claim and the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence. Those requirements therefore also tend to merge with the adequacy-of-representation requirement, although the latter requirement also raises concerns about the competency of class counsel and conflicts of interest.\u201d <em>General Telephone Co. of Southwest </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>457 U.S. 147, 157-158, n. 13, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1982). In light of our disposition of the commonality question, however, it is unnecessary to resolve whether respondents have satisfied the typicality and adequate-representation requirements of Rule 23(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b432-11\">.  A statement in one of our prior cases, <em>Eisen </em>v. <em>Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, </em>417 U.S. 156, 177, 94 S. Ct. 2140, 40 L. Ed. 2d 732 (1974), is sometimes mistakenly cited to the contrary: \u201cWe find nothing in either the language or history of Rule 23 that gives a court any authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether it may be maintained as a class action.\u2019\u2019 But in that case, the judge had conducted a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit, not in order to determine the propriety of certification under Rules 23(a) and (b) (he had already done that, see <em>id., </em>at 165, 94 S. Ct. 2140, 40 L. Ed. 2d 732), but in order to shift the cost of notice required by Rule 23(c)(2) from the plaintiff to the defendants. To the extent the quoted statement goes beyond the permissibility of a merits inquiry for any other pretrial purpose, it is the purest dictum and is contradicted by our other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">Perhaps the most common example of considering a merits question at the Rule 23 stage arises in class-action suits for securities fraud. Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s requirement that \u201cquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members\u2019\u2019 would often be an insuperable barrier to class certification, since each of the individual investors would have to prove reliance on the alleged misrepresentation. But the problem dissipates if the plaintiffs can establish the applicability of the so-called \u201cfraud on the market\u2019\u2019 presumption, which says that all traders who purchase stock in an efficient market are presumed to have relied on the accuracy of a company\u2019s public statements. To invoke this presumption, the plaintiffs seeking 23(b)(3) certification must prove that their shares were traded on an efficient market, <em>Erica P. John Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>Halliburton Co., </em>563 U.S. 804, 809, 131 S. Ct. 2179, 180 L.

In a pattern-or-practice case, the plaintiff tries to \u201cestablish by a preponderance of the evidence that . . . discrimination was the company\u2019s standard operating procedure!,] the regular rather than the unusual practice.\u2019\u2019 <em>Teamsters </em>v. <em>United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 336, 97 S.

If he succeeds, that showing will support a rebuttable inference that all class members were victims of the discriminatory practice, and will justify \u201can award of prospective relief,\u2019\u2019 such as \u201can injunctive order against continuation of the discriminatory practice.\u2019\u2019 <em>Teamsters, supra, </em>at 361, 97 S.

The final question they were to ask and answer: \u201cIs this person going to be successful in our business?\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). It is hardly surprising that for many managers, the ideal candidate was someone with characteristics similar to their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">We have held that \u201cdiscretionary employment practices\u201d can give rise to Title VII claims, not only when such practices are motivated by discriminatory intent but also when they produce discriminatory results. See <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust, </em>487 U.S. 977, 988, 991, 108 S. Ct. 2777, 101 L. Ed. 2d 827 (1988). But see <em>ante, </em>at 357, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 394 (\u201c[P] roving that [a] discretionary system has produced a... disparity <em>is not enough.\u201d). </em>In <em>Watson, </em>as here, an employer had given its managers large authority over promotions. An employee sued the bank under Title VII, alleging that the \u201cdiscretionary promotion system\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">[564 U.S. 374]</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">caused a discriminatory effect based on race. 487 U.S., at 984, 108 S. Ct. 2777, 101 L. Ed. 2d 827 (internal quotation marks omitted). Four different supervisors had declined, on separate occasions, to promote the employee. <em>Id., </em>at 982, 108 S. Ct. 2777, 101 L. Ed. 2d 827. Their reasons were subjective and unknown. The employer, we noted, \u201chad not developed precise and formal criteria for evaluating candidates\u201d; \u201c [i]t relied instead on the subjective judgment of supervisors.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Aware of \u201cthe problem of subconscious stereotypes and prejudices,\u201d we held that the employer\u2019s \u201cundisciplined system of subjective decision-making\u201d was an \u201cemployment practice] \u201d that \u201cmay be analyzed under the disparate impact approach.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 990-991, 108 S. Ct. 2777, 101 L. Ed. 2d 827. See also <em>Wards Cove Packing Co. </em>v. <em>Atonio, </em>490 U.S. 642, 657, 109 S. Ct. 2115, 104 L. Ed. 2d 733 (1989) (recognizing \u201cthe use of\u2018subjective decision making\u2019 \u201d as an \u201cemployment practic[e]\u201d subject to disparate-impact attack).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">The plaintiffs\u2019 allegations state claims of gender discrimination in the form of biased decisionmaking in both pay and promotions. The evidence reviewed by the District Court adequately demonstrated that resolving those claims would necessitate examination of particular policies and practices alleged to affect, adversely and globally, women employed at Wal-Mart\u2019s stores. Rule 23(a)(2), setting a necessary but not a sufficient criterion for class-action certification, demands nothing further.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">The Court gives no credence to the key dispute common to the class: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>whether Wal-Mart\u2019s discretionary pay and promotion policies are discriminatory. See <em>ante, </em>at 349, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 389 (\u201cReciting\u201d questions like \u201cIs [giving managers discretion over pay] an unlawful employment practice?\u201d \u201cis not sufficient to obtain class certification.\u201d). \u201cWhat matters,\u201d the Court asserts, \u201cis not the raising of common \u2018questions,\u2019 \u201d but whether there are \u201c[d]issimilarities within the proposed</p>\n<p id=\"AA6q\">[564 U.S. 375]</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">class\u201d that \u201chave the potential to impede the generation of common answers.\u201d Ante, at 350, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 390 (quoting Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 97, 132 (2009); some internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The Court blends Rule 23(a)(2)\u2019s threshold criterion with the more demanding criteria of Rule 23(b)(3), and thereby elevates the (a)(2) inquiry so that it is no longer \u201ceasily satisfied,\u201d 5 J. Moore et al., Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 23.23[2], p. 23-72 (3d ed. 2011).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rule 23(b)(3) certification requires, in addition to the four 23(a) findings, determinations that \u201cquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members\u201d and that \u201ca class action is superior to other available methods for . . . adjudicating the controversy.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">[564 U.S. 376]</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">The Court\u2019s emphasis on differences between class members mimics the Rule 23(b)(3) inquiry into whether common questions \u201cpredominate\u201d over individual issues. And by asking whether the individual differences \u201cimpede\u201d common adjudication, <em>ante, </em>at 350, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 390 (internal quotation marks omitted), the Court duplicates 23(b)(3)\u2019s question whether \u201ca class action is superior\u201d to other modes of adjudication. Indeed, Professor Nagareda, whose \u201cdissimilarities\u201d inquiry the Court endorses, developed his position in the context of Rule 23(b)(3). See 84 N. Y. U. L. Rev., at 131 (Rule 23(b)(3) requires \u201csome decisive degree of similarity across the proposed class\u201d because it \u201cspeaks of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>common \u2018questions\u2019 that \u2018predominate\u2019 over individual ones\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cThe Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry\u201d is meant to \u201ctes [t] whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.\u201d <em>Amchem Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>521 U.S. 591, 623, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1997). If courts must conduct a \u201cdissimilarities\u201d analysis at the Rule 23(a)(2) stage, no mission remains for Rule 23(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Because Rule 23(a) is also a prerequisite for Rule 23(b)(1) and Rule 23(b)(2) classes, the Court\u2019s \u201cdissimilarities\u201d position is far reaching. Individual differences should not bar a Rule 23(b)(1) or Rule 23(b)(2) class, so long as the Rule 23(a) threshold is met. See <em>id., </em>at 623, n. 19, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (Rule 23(b)(1)(B) \u201cdoes not have a predominance requirement\u201d); <em>Yamasaki, </em>442 U.S., at 701, 99 S. Ct. 2545, 61 L. Ed. 2d 176 (Rule 23(b)(2) action in which the Court noted that \u201c[i]t is unlikely that differences in the factual background of each claim will affect the outcome of the legal</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">[564 U.S. 377]</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">issue\u201d). For example, in <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Bowman Transp. Co., </em>424 U.S. 747, 96 S. Ct. 1251, 47 L. Ed. 2d 444 (1976), a Rule 23(b)(2) class of African-American truckdriv-ers complained that the defendant had discriminatorily refused to hire black applicants. We recognized that the \u201cqualification [s] and performance\u201d of individual class members might vary. <em>Id., </em>at 772, 96 S. Ct. 1251, 47 L. Ed. 2d 444 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cGeneralizations concerning such individually applicable evidence,\u201d we cautioned, \u201ccannot serve as a justification for the denial of [injunctive] relief to the entire class.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">The \u201cdissimilarities\u201d approach leads the Court to train its attention on what distinguishes individual class members, rather than on what unites them. Given the lack of standards for pay and promotions, the majority says, \u201cdemonstrating the invalidity of one manager\u2019s use of discretion will do nothing to demonstrate the invalidity of another\u2019s.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 355-356, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">Wal-Mart\u2019s delegation of discretion over pay and promotions is a policy uniform throughout all stores. The very nature of discretion is that people will exercise it in various ways. A system of delegated discretion, <em>Watson </em>held, is a practice actionable under Title VII when it produces discriminatory outcomes. 487 U.S., at 990-991, 108 S. Ct. 2777, 101 L. Ed. 2d 827; see <em>supra, </em>at 373-374, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 404. A finding that Wal-Mart\u2019s pay and promotions practices in fact violate the law would be the first step in the usual order of proof for plaintiffs seeking individual remedies for companywide discrimination. <em>Teamsters </em>v. <em>United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 359, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 52 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1977); see <em>Albemarle Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>422 U.S. 405, 415-423, 95 S. Ct. 2362, 45 L. Ed. 2d 280 (1975). That each individual employee\u2019s unique circumstances will ultimately determine whether she is en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>titled to backpay or damages, \u00a7 2000e-5(g)(2)(A) (barring backpay if a plaintiff \u201cwas refused . . . advancement . . . for any reason other than discrimination\u201d), should not factor into the Rule 23(a)(2) determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">[564 U.S. 378]</p>\n<p id=\"pAqAW\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"46\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASoAAAAuAQAAAAC3p2kgAAAApUlEQVR4nO2TOw4CMQxEJ1FqPjUUHGUPwMG4ArfJdhxjLwFVyFBYwi6mWGm1EhLr7s2MlTiKEzGjxjwnBWyxJbEWJQUWe0VHwQp3e+eHKxIyALRbaJSQAaDU6o6ERAA4l8ktASNIkhNDCag26TFOpcBi9+hIIMl+2vsxCmoBgH65er8Ee7dhcEdCIgA+2+HrKLA9Td0NDWv83l2UFPz+Am6xP4x9ADG8eTwqW0TJAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"298\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The Court errs in importing a \u201cdissimilarities\u201d notion suited to Rule 23(b)(3) into the Rule 23(a) commonality inquiry. I therefore cannot join Part II of the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-14\">. The plaintiffs requested Rule 23(b)(3) certification as an alternative, should their request for (b)(2) certification fail.

Rule 23(a) lists three other threshold requirements for class-action certification: \u201c(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable\u201d; \u201c(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\u201d The numerosity requirement is clearly met and Wal-Mart does not contend otherwise. As the Court does not reach the typicality and adequacy requirements, <em>ante, </em>at 349, n. 5, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 389,1 will not discuss them either, but will simply record my agreement with the District Court\u2019s resolution of those issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b443-16\">. The Court suggests Rule 23(a)(2) must mean more than it says. See <em>ante, </em>at 349-350, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 389-390. If the word \u201cquestions\u201d were taken literally, the majority asserts, plaintiffs could pass the Rule 23(a)(2) bar by \u201c[r]eciting . . . questions\u201d like \u201cDo all of us plaintiffs indeed work for Wal-Mart?\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 349, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 389. Sensibly read, however, the word \u201cquestions\u201d means disputed issues, not any utterance crafted in the grammatical form of a question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b445-13\">. The majority purports to derive from <em>Teamsters </em>v. <em>United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 52 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1977), a rule that a discrimination claim, if accompanied by anecdotes, must supply them in numbers proportionate to the size of the class. <em>Ante, </em>at 358, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 394-395. <em>Teamsters, </em>the Court acknowledges, see <em>ante, </em>at 358, n. 9, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 395, instructs that statistical evidence alone may suffice, 431 U.S., at 339, 97 S.
