I, \u00a7 9, cl. 3, when applied</p>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">[564 U.S. 933]</p>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">to juveniles adjudicated as delinquent before SORNA\u2019s enactment. We conclude that the Court of Appeals had no authority to enter that judgment because it had no live controversy before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b855-16\">Respondent Juvenile Male was 13 years old when he began sexually abusing a 10-year-old boy on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana. The abuse continued for approximately two years, until respondent was 15 and his victim 12. In 2005, respondent was charged in the District of Montana with delinquency under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5031 <em>et seq. </em>Respondent pleaded \u201ctrue\u201d to charges that he knowingly engaged in sexual acts with a child under 12, which would have been a federal crime had respondent been an adult. See \u00a7\u00a7 2241(c), 1153(a). The court sentenced respondent to two years of juvenile detention, followed by juvenile supervision until his 21st birthday. Respondent was to spend the first six months of his postconfinement supervision in a prerelease center. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Juvenile Male, </em>560 U.S. 558, 559, 130 S. Ct. 2518, 177 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2010) <em>(per curiam).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-18\">In 2006, while respondent remained in juvenile detention, Congress enacted SORNA. 120 Stat. 590. Under SORNA, a sex offender must \u201cregister, and keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction\u201d where the offender resides, is employed, or attends school. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16913(a). This registration requirement extends to certain juveniles adjudicated as delinquent for serious sex offenses. \u00a7 16911(8). In addition, an interim rule issued by the Attorney General mandates that SORNA\u2019s requirements apply retroactively to sex offenders convicted before the statute\u2019s enactment. 72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (2007) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>(codified at 28 CFR pt. 72 (2010)); see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16913(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">[564 U.S. 934]</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">In July 2007, the District Court determined that respondent had failed to comply with the requirements of his prerelease program. The court revoked respondent\u2019s juvenile supervision, imposed an additional 6-month term of detention, and ordered that the detention be followed by supervision until respondent\u2019s 21st birthday. 560 U.S., at 559, 130 S. Ct. 2518, 177 L. Ed. 2d 64. At the Government\u2019s urging, and over respondent\u2019s objection, the court also imposed a \u201cspecial conditio [n]\u201d of supervision requiring respondent to register and keep current as a sex offender. <em>Id., </em>at 560, 130 S. Ct. 2518, 177 L. Ed. 2d 64 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Pet. for Cert. 9 (noting the Government\u2019s argument in the District Court that respondent should be required to register under SORNA \u201c \u2018at least until\u2019 \u201d his release from juvenile supervision on his 21st birthday).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">On appeal to the Ninth Circuit, respondent challenged this \u201cspecial conditio[n]\u201d of supervision. He requested that the Court of Appeals \u201creverse th[e] portion of his sentence requiring Sex Offender Registration and remand with instructions that the district court . . . strik[e] Sex Offender Registration as a condition of juvenile supervision.\u201d Opening Brief for Defendant-Appellant in No. 07-30290 (CA9), p. 25. Then, in May 2008, with his appeal still pending in the Ninth Circuit, respondent turned 21, and the juvenile-supervision order requiring him to register as a sex offender expired. 560 U.S., at 560, 130 S. Ct. 2518, 177 L. Ed. 2d 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">Over a year after respondent\u2019s 21st birthday, the Court of Appeals handed down its decision. 581 F.3d 977 (CA9 2009), amended, 590 F.3d 924 (2010). No party had raised any issue of mootness in the Ninth Circuit, and the Court of Appeals did not address the issue <em>sua sponte. </em>The court\u2019s opinion discussed only the merits and concluded that applying SORNA to juvenile delinquents who committed their offenses \u201cbefore SORNA\u2019s passage violates the Ex Post</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">[564 U.S. 935]</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">Facto Clause.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 927. On that basis, the court vacated the District Court\u2019s condition of supervision requiring sex-offender registration and reporting. <em>Id., </em>at 942. The United States petitioned for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">While that petition was pending, this Court entered a <em>per curiam </em>opinion in this case certifying a preliminary question of Montana law to the Montana Supreme Court. 560 U.S. 558, 130 S. Ct. 2518, 177 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2010). The opinion noted that a \u201cthreshold issue of mootness\u201d might prevent us from reviewing the decision below on the merits. <em>Id., </em>at 560, 130 S. Ct. 2518, 177 L. Ed. 2d 64. We explained that, because respondent is \u201cno longer . . . subject\u201d to the District Court\u2019s \u201csex-offender-registration conditions,\u201d respondent must \u201cshow that a decision invalidating\u201d those conditions \u201cwould be sufficiently likely to redress \u2018collateral consequences adequate to meet Article Ill\u2019s injury-in-fact requirement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>(quoting <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 14, 118 S. Ct. 978, 140 L. Ed. 2d 43 (1998)). We noted that by the time of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision, \u201crespondent had become registered as a sex offender in Montana.\u201d 560 U.S., at 561, 130 S. Ct. 2518, 177 L. Ed. 2d 64 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, \u201c[p]erhaps the most likely potential \u2018collateral consequenc[e]\u2019 that might be remedied by a judgment in respondent\u2019s favor is the requirement that respondent remain registered as a sex offender under Montana law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 560-561, 130 S. Ct. 2518, 177 L. Ed. 2d 64. In order to ascertain whether a decision invalidating the District Court\u2019s registration conditions would enable respondent to remove his name from the Montana sex-offender registry, the Court certified the following question to the Montana Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-4\">\u201cIs respondent\u2019s duty to remain registered as a sex offender under Montana law contingent upon the validity of the conditions of his now-expired federal juvenile-supervision order that required him to register as a sex offender, or is the duty an independent requirement of Montana law that is unaffected by the validity or invalidity of the federal juvenile-supervision conditions?\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 561, 130 S. Ct. 2518, 177 L. Ed. 2d 64 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">[564 U.S. 936]</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The Montana Supreme Court has now responded to our certified question. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Juvenile Male, </em>2011 MT 104, 360 Mont. 317, 255 P.3d 110. Its answer is that respondent\u2019s \u201cstate law duty to remain registered as a sex offender is not contingent upon the validity of the conditions of his federal supervision order, but is an independent requirement of Montana law.\u201d Id., at 318, 255 P.3d, at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">It is a basic principle of Article III that a justiciable case or controversy must remain \u201cextant at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.\u201d <em>Arizonans for Official English </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>520 U.S. 43, 67, 117 S. Ct. 1055, 137 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[T]hroughout the litigation,\u201d the party seeking relief \u201c \u2018must have suffered, or be threatened with, an actual injury traceable to the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spencer, supra, </em>at 7, 118 S. Ct. 978, 140 L. Ed. 2d 43 (quoting <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Continental Bank Corp., </em>494 U.S. 472, 477, 110 S. Ct. 1249, 108 L. Ed. 2d 400 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">In criminal cases, this requirement means that a defendant wishing to continue his appeals after the expiration of his sentence must suffer some \u201ccontinuing injury\u201d or \u201ccollateral consequence\u201d sufficient to satisfy Article III. See <em>Spencer, </em>523 U.S., at 7-8, 118 S. Ct. 978, 140 L. Ed. 2d 43. When the defendant challenges his underlying <em>conviction, </em>this Court\u2019s cases have long presumed the existence of collateral consequences. <em>Id., </em>at 8, 118 S. Ct. 978, 140 L. Ed. 2d 43; see <em>Sibron </em>v. <em>New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 55-56, 88 S. Ct. 1889, 20 L. Ed. 2d 917 (1968). But when a defendant challenges only an expired <em>sentence, </em>no such presumption applies, and the defendant must bear the burden of identifying some ongoing \u201ccollateral consequenc[e]\u201d that is \u201ctraceable\u201d to the challenged portion of the sentence and \u201clikely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\u201d See <em>Spencer, supra, </em>at 7, 14, 118 S. Ct. 978, 140 L. Ed. 2d 43 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">[564 U.S. 937]</p>\n<p id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>At the time of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in this case, the District Court\u2019s order of juvenile supervision had expired, and respondent was no longer subject to the sex-offender-registration conditions that he sought to challenge on appeal. 560 U.S., at 560, 130 S. Ct. 2518, 177 L. Ed. 2d 64. As a result, respondent\u2019s challenge was moot before the Ninth Circuit unless he could \u201cshow that a decision invalidating\u201d the District Court\u2019s order would likely redress some collateral consequence of the registration conditions. <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Spencer, supra, </em>at 14, 118 S. Ct. 978, 140 L. Ed. 2d 43).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">As we noted in our prior opinion, one \u201cpotential collateral consequence that might be remedied\u201d by an order invalidating the registration conditions \u201cis the requirement that respondent remain registered\u201d under Montana law. 560 U.S., at 560-561, 130 S. Ct. 2518, 177 L. Ed. 2d 64 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). But as the Montana Supreme Court has now clarified, respondent\u2019s \u201cstate law duty to remain registered as a sex offender is not contingent upon the validity of the conditions of his federal supervision order,\u201d 360 Mont., at 318, 255 P.3d, at 111, and continues to apply regardless of the outcome in this case. True, a favorable decision in this case might serve as a useful precedent for respondent in a hypothetical lawsuit challenging Montana\u2019s registration requirement on <em>ex post facto </em>grounds. But this possible, indirect benefit in a future lawsuit cannot save <em>this </em>case from mootness. See <em>Camreta </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>563 U.S. 692, 712, 131 S. Ct. 2020, 179 L. Ed. 2d 1118 (2011); <em>Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Board of Trade of Chicago, </em>701 F.2d 653, 656 (CA7 1989) (Posner, J.) (\u201c[0]ne can never be certain that findings made in a decision concluding one lawsuit will not some day . . . control the outcome of another suit. But if that were enough to avoid mootness, no case would ever be moot\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Respondent also argues that this case \u201ccannot be considered moot in any practical sense\u201d because, under current law, respondent may have \u201can independent duty to register as a</p>\n<p id=\"Anqk\">[564 U.S. 938]</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">sex offender\u201d under SORNA itself. Brief in Opposition 6.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But  the duty to register under SORNA is not a <em>conse</em>quence\u2014collateral or otherwise\u2014of the District Court\u2019s special conditions of supervision. The statutory duty to register is, as respondent notes, an obligation that exists \u201cindependent\u201d of those conditions. That continuing obligation might provide grounds for a preenforcement challenge to SOR-NA\u2019s registration requirements. It does not, however, render the current controversy regarding the validity of respondent\u2019s sentence any less moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">Respondent further argues that this case falls within the established exception to mootness for disputes that are \u201c \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 8 (quoting <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>423 U.S. 147, 148-149, 96 S. Ct. 347, 46 L. Ed. 2d 350 (1975) <em>(per curiam)). </em> This exception, however, applies only where \u201c(1) the challenged action [is] in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be subject to the same action again.\u201d <em>Spencer, supra, </em>at 17, 118 S. Ct. 978, 140 L. Ed. 2d 43 (internal quotation marks omitted). At the very least, respondent cannot satisfy the second of these requirements. He has now turned 21, and he will never again be subject to an order imposing special conditions of juvenile supervision. See, <em>e.g., DeFunis </em>v. <em>Odegaard, </em>416 U.S. 312, 94 S. Ct. 1704, 40 L. Ed. 2d 164 (1974) <em>(per curiam). </em>The capable-of-repetition exception to mootness thus does not apply, and the Ninth Circuit lacked the authority under Article III to decide this case on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>are granted. The judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">[564 U.S. 939]</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b859-8\">Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor would remand the case to the Ninth Circuit for that court\u2019s consideration of mootness in the first instance.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b859-9\">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b856-12\">.
