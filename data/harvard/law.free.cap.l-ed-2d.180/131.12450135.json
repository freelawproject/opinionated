We consider whether \u00a7 282 requires an invalidity defense to be proved by clear and convincing evidence. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">Pursuant to its authority under the Patent Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8, Congress has charged the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) with the task of examining patent applications, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a)(1), and issuing</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">[564 U.S. 96]</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">patents if \u201cit appears that the applicant is entitled to a patent under the law,\u201d \u00a7 131. Congress has set forth the prerequisites for issuance of a patent, which the PTO must evaluate in the examination process. To receive patent protection a claimed invention must, among other things, fall within one of the express categories of patentable subject matter, \u00a7 101, and be novel, \u00a7 102, and nonobvious, \u00a7 103. Most relevant here, the on-sale bar of \u00a7 102(b) precludes patent protection for any \u201cinvention\u201d that was \u201con sale in this country\u201d more than one year prior to the filing of a patent application. See generally <em>Pfaff </em>v. <em>Wells Electronics, Inc., </em>525 U.S. 55, 67-68, 119 S. Ct. 304, 142 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1998). In evaluating whether these and other statutory conditions have been met, PTO examiners must make various factual determinations\u2014for instance, the state of the prior art in the field and the nature of the advancement embodied in the invention. See <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Zurko, </em>527 U.S. 150, 153, 119 S. Ct. 1816, 144 L. Ed. 2d 143 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-20\">Once issued, a patent grants certain exclusive rights to its holder, including the exclusive right to use the invention during the patent\u2019s duration. To enforce that right, a paten-tee can bring a civil action for infringement if another person \u201cwithout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any patented invention, within the United States.\u201d \u00a7 271(a); see also \u00a7 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Among other defenses under \u00a7 282 of the Patent Act of 1952 (1952 Act),  an alleged infringer may assert the invalidity of the patent\u2014that is, he may attempt to prove that the patent never should have issued in the first place. See \u00a7\u00a7 282(2), (3). A defendant may argue, for instance, that the claimed invention was obvious at the time and thus that one of the conditions of patentability was lacking. See \u00a7 282(2); see also \u00a7 103. \u201cWhile the ultimate question of patent validity is one of law,\u201d <em>Graham </em>v. <em>John Deere Co. of Kansas City, </em>383 U.S. 1, 17, 86 S. Ct. 684, 15 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1966) (citing <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. </em>v. <em>Supermarket Equipment Corp., </em>340 U.S. 147, 155, 71 S. Ct. 127, 95 L. Ed. 162 (1950) (Douglas, J., concurring)); see <em>post, </em>at 114, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 147 (Breyer, J., concurring),</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">[564 U.S. 97]</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">the same factual questions underlying the PTO\u2019s original examination of a patent application will also bear on an invalidity defense in an infringement action, see, <em>e.g., </em>383 U.S., at 17, 86 S. Ct. 684, 15 L. Ed. 2d 545 (describing the \u201cbasic factual inquiries\u201d that form the \u201cbackground\u201d for evaluating obviousness); <em>Pfaff, </em>525 U.S., at 67-69, 119 S. Ct. 304, 142 L. Ed. 2d 261 (same, as to the on-sale bar).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">In asserting an invalidity defense, an alleged infringer must contend with the first paragraph of \u00a7 282, which provides that \u201c[a] patent shall be presumed valid\u201d and \u201c [t]he burden of establishing invalidity ... rest[s] on the party asserting such invalidity.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the Federal Circuit\u2019s reading of \u00a7 282, a defendant seeking to overcome this presumption must persuade the factfinder of its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence. Judge Rich, a principal drafter of the 1952 Act, articulated this view for the court in <em>American Hoist &amp; Derrick Co. </em>v. <em>Sowa &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>725 F.2d 1350 (CA Fed. 1984). There, the Federal Circuit held that \u00a7 282 codified \u201cthe existing presumption of validity of patents,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 1359 (internal quotation marks omitted)\u2014what, until that point, had been a common-law presumption based on \u201cthe basic proposition that a government agency such as the [PTO] was presumed to do its job,\u201d <em>ibid. </em>Relying on this Court\u2019s pre-1952 precedent as to the \u201cforce of the presumption,\u201d <em>ibid. </em>(citing <em>Radio Corp. of America </em>v. <em>Radio Engineering Laboratories, Inc., </em>293 U.S. 1, 54 S. Ct. 752, 79 L. Ed. 163, (1934) <em>(RCA)), </em>Judge Rich concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">\u201c[Section] 282 creates a presumption that a patent is valid and imposes the burden of proving invalidity on the attacker. That burden is constant and never changes and is to convince the court of invalidity by clear evidence.\u201d 725 F.2d, at 1360.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">[564 U.S. 98]</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">In the nearly 30 years since <em>American Hoist, </em>the Federal Circuit has never wavered in this interpretation of \u00a7 282. See, <em>e.g., Greenwood </em>v. <em>Hattori Seiko Co., </em>900 F.2d 238, 240-241 (1990); <em>Ultra-Tex Surfaces, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hill Bros. Chemical Co., </em>204 F.3d 1360, 1367 (2000); <em>ALZA Corp. </em>v. <em>Andrx Pharmaceuticals, LLC, </em>603 F.3d 935, 940 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Respondents i4i Limited Partnership and Infrastructures for Information Inc. (collectively, i4i) hold the patent at issue in this suit. The i4i patent claims an improved method for editing computer documents, which stores a document\u2019s content separately from the metacodes associated with the document\u2019s structure. In 2007, i4i sued petitioner Microsoft Corporation for willful infringement, claiming that Microsoft\u2019s manufacture and sale of certain Microsoft Word products infringed i4i\u2019s patent. In addition to denying infringement, Microsoft counterclaimed and sought a declaration that i4i\u2019s patent was invalid and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Specifically and as relevant here, Microsoft claimed that the on-sale bar of \u00a7 102(b) rendered the patent invalid, pointing to i4i\u2019s prior sale of a software program known as S4. The parties agreed that, more than one year prior to the filing of the i4i patent application, i4i had sold S4 in the United States. They presented opposing arguments to the jury, however, as to whether that software embodied the invention claimed in i4i\u2019s patent. Because the software\u2019s source code had been destroyed years before the commencement of this litigation, the factual dispute turned largely on trial testimony by S4\u2019s two inventors\u2014also the named inventors on the i4i patent\u2014both of whom testified that S4 did not practice the key invention disclosed in the patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Relying on the undisputed fact that the S4 software was never presented to the PTO examiner, Microsoft objected to i4i\u2019s proposed instruction that it was required to prove its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence. Instead,</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">[564 U.S. 99]</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">\u201cif an instruction on the \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 burden were [to be] given,\u201d App. 124a, n. 8, Microsoft requested the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">\u201c \u2018Microsoft\u2019s burden of proving invalidity and unenforceability is by clear and convincing evidence. However, Microsoft\u2019s burden of proof with regard to its defense of invalidity based on prior art that the examiner did not review during the prosecution of the patent-in-suit is by preponderance of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">Rejecting the hybrid standard of proof that Microsoft advocated, the District Court instructed the jury that \u201cMicrosoft has the burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 195a.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">The jury found that Microsoft willfully infringed the i4i patent and that Microsoft failed to prove invalidity due to the on-sale bar or otherwise. Denying Microsoft\u2019s post-trial motions, the District Court rejected Microsoft\u2019s contention that the court improperly instructed the jury on the standard of proof. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 598 F.3d 831, 848 (2010). Relying on its settled interpretation of \u00a7 282, the court explained that it could \u201cdiscern [no] error\u201d in the jury instruction requiring Microsoft to prove its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Ibid. </em>We granted certiorari. 562 U.S. 1060, 131 S. Ct. 647, 178 L. Ed. 2d 476 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b180-14\">According to Microsoft, a defendant in an infringement action need only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>persuade the jury of an invalidity defense by a preponderance of the evidence. In the alternative, Microsoft insists that a preponderance standard must apply at least when an invalidity defense rests on evidence that was</p>\n<p id=\"Axo\">[564 U.S. 100]</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">never considered by the PTO in the examination process. We reject both contentions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Where Congress has prescribed the governing standard of proof, its choice controls absent \u201ccountervailing constitutional constraints.\u201d <em>Steadman </em>v. <em>SEC, </em>450 U.S. 91, 95, 101 S. Ct. 999, 67 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1981). The question, then, is whether Congress has made such a choice here.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">As stated, the first paragraph of \u00a7 282 provides that \u201c[a] patent shall be presumed valid\u201d and \u201c[t]he burden of establishing invalidity of a patent or any claim thereof shall rest on the party asserting such invalidity.\u201d Thus,  by its express terms, \u00a7 282 establishes a presumption of patent validity, and it provides that a challenger must overcome that presumption to prevail on an invalidity defense. But, while the statute explicitly specifies the burden of proof, it includes no express articulation of the standard of proof.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">[564 U.S. 101]</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">Our statutory inquiry, however, cannot simply end there.  We begin, of course, with \u201cthe assumption that the ordinary meaning of [the] language\u201d chosen by Congress \u201caccurately expresses the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Engine Mfrs. Assn. </em>v. <em>South Coast Air Quality Management </em>Dist., 541 U.S. 246, 252, 124 S. Ct. 1756, 158 L. Ed. 2d 529 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). But where Congress uses a common-law term in a statute, we assume the \u201cterm . . . comes with a common law meaning, absent anything pointing another way.\u201d <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>551 U.S. 47, 58, 127 S. Ct. 2201, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1045 (2007) <em>(citing Beck </em>v. <em>Prupis, </em>529 U.S. 494, 500-501, 120 S. Ct. 1608, 146 L. Ed. 2d 561 (2000)). Here, by stating that a patent is \u201cpresumed valid,\u201d \u00a7 282, Congress used a term with a settled meaning in the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Our decision in <em>RCA, </em>293 U.S. 1, 54 S. Ct. 752, 79 L. Ed. 163, is authoritative. There, tracing nearly a century of case law from this Court and others, Justice Cardozo wrote for a unanimous Court that \u201cthere is a presumption of validity, a presumption not to be overthrown except by clear and cogent evidence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 2, 54 S. Ct. 752, 79 L. Ed. 163. Although the \u201cforce\u201d of the presumption found \u201cvarying expression\u201d in this Court and elsewhere, <em>id., </em>at 7, 54 S. Ct. 752, 79 L. Ed. 163, Justice Cardozo explained, one \u201ccommon core of thought and truth\u201d unified the decisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\">\u201c[O]ne otherwise an infringer who assails the validity of a patent fair upon its face bears a heavy burden of persuasion, and fails unless his evidence has more than a dubious preponderance. If that is true where the assailant connects himself in some way with the title of the true inventor, it is so <em>a fortiori </em>where he is a stranger to the invention, without claim of title of his own. If it is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">[564 U.S. 102]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">true where the assailant launches his attack with evidence different, at least in form, from any theretofore produced in opposition to the patent, it is so a bit more clearly where the evidence is even verbally the same.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 8, 54 S. Ct. 752, 79 L. Ed. 163 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The common-law presumption, in other words, reflected the universal understanding that a preponderance standard of proof was too \u201cdubious\u201d a basis to deem a patent invalid. <em>Ibid.; </em>see also <em>id., </em>at 7, 54 S. Ct. 752, 79 L. Ed. 163 (\u201c[A] patent... is presumed to be valid until the presumption has been overcome by convincing evidence of error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Thus, by the time Congress enacted \u00a7 282 and declared that a patent is \u201cpresumed valid,\u201d the presumption of patent validity had long been a fixture of the common law. According to its settled meaning, a defendant raising an invalidity defense bore \u201ca heavy burden of persuasion,\u201d requiring proof of the defense by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Id., </em>at 8, 54 S. Ct. 752, 79 L. Ed. 163. That is, the presumption encompassed not only an allocation of the burden of proof but also an imposition of a heightened standard of proof. Under the general rule that a common-law term comes with its common-law meaning, we cannot conclude that Congress intended to \u201cdrop\u201d the heightened standard of proof from the presumption simply because \u00a7 282 fails to reiterate it expressly. <em>Neder </em>v. <em>United States, </em>527</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">[564 U.S. 103]</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">U.S. 1, 23, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1999); see also <em>id., </em>at 21, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35 (\u201c \u2018Where Congress uses terms that have accumulated settled meaning under . . . the common law, [we] must infer, unless the statute otherwise dictates, that Congress means to incorporate the established meaning of those terms\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Nationwide Mut. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Darden, </em>503 U.S. 318, 322, 112 S. Ct. 1344, 117 L. Ed. 2d 581 (1992))); <em>Standard Oil Co. of N.J. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>221 U.S. 1, 59, 31 S. Ct. 502, 55 L. Ed. 619 (1911) (\u201c[W]here words are employed in a statute which had at the time a well-known meaning at common law or in the law of this country they are presumed to have been used in that sense . . . \u201d). \u201cOn the contrary, we must <em>presume </em>that Congress intended to incorporate\u201d the heightened standard of proof, \u201cunless the statute otherwise dictates.\u201d <em>Neder, </em>527 U.S., at 23, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">We recognize that it may be unusual to treat a presumption as alone establishing the governing standard of proof. See, <em>e.g., </em>J. Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law 336-337 (1898) (hereinafter Thayer) (\u201cWhen ... we read that the contrary of any particular presumption must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, ... it is to be recognized that we have something superadded to the rule of presumption, namely, another rule as to the amount of evidence which is needed to overcome the presumption\u201d). But given how judges, including Justice Cardozo, repeatedly understood and explained the presumption of patent validity, we cannot accept Microsoft\u2019s argument that Congress used the words \u201cpresumed valid\u201d to adopt only a procedural device for \u201cshifting the burden of production,\u201d or for \u201cshifting both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 21-22 (emphasis deleted). Whatever the significance of a presumption in the abstract, basic principles of statutory construction require us to assume that Congress meant to incorporate \u201cthe cluster of ideas\u201d attached to the common-law term it adopted. <em>Beck, </em>529 U.S., at 501, 120 S. Ct. 1608, 146 L. Ed. 2d 561 (internal quotation marks omitted). And <em>RCA </em>leaves no doubt that attached to the common-law presumption of patent validity</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">[564 U.S. 104]</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">was an expression as to its \u201cforce,\u201d 293 U.S., at 7, 54 S. Ct. 752, 79 L. Ed. 163\u2014that is, the standard of proof required to overcome it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Resisting the conclusion that Congress adopted the heightened standard of proof reflected in our pre-1952 cases, Microsoft contends that those cases applied a clear-and-convincing standard of proof only in two limited circumstances, not in every case involving an invalidity defense. First, according to Microsoft, the heightened standard of proof applied in cases \u201cinvolving oral testimony of prior invention,\u201d simply to account for the unreliability of such testimony. Brief for Petitioner 25. Second, Microsoft tells us, the heightened standard of proof applied to \u201cinvalidity challenges based on priority of invention,\u201d where that issue had previously been litigated between the parties in PTO proceedings. <em>Id., </em>at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Squint as we may, we fail to see the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>qualifications that Microsoft purports to identify in our cases. They certainly make no appearance in RCA\u2019s explanation of the presumption of patent validity. <em>RCA </em>simply said, without qualification, \u201cthat one otherwise an infringer who assails the validity of a patent fair upon its face bears a heavy burden of persuasion, and fails unless his evidence has more than a dubious preponderance.\u201d 293 U.S., at 8, 54 S. Ct. 752, 79 L. Ed. 163; see also <em>id., </em>at 7, 54 S. Ct. 752, 79 L. Ed. 163 (\u201cA patent regularly issued, <em>and even more obviously </em>a patent issued after a hearing of all the rival claimants, is presumed</p>\n<p id=\"A_D\">[564 U.S. 105]</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">to be valid until the presumption has been overcome by convincing evidence of error\u201d (emphasis added)). Nor do they appear in any of our cases as express limitations on the application of the heightened standard of proof. Cf., <em>e.g., Smith </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>301 U.S. 216, 233, 57 S. Ct. 711, 81 L. Ed. 1049 (1937) (citing <em>RCA </em>for the proposition that a \u201cheavy burden of persuasion ... rests upon one who seeks to negative novelty in a patent by showing prior use\u201d); <em>Mumm </em>v. <em>Jacob E. Decker &amp; Sons, </em>301 U.S. 168, 171, 57 S. Ct. 675, 81 L. Ed. 983 (1937) (\u201cNot only is the burden to make good this defense upon the party setting it up, but his burden is a heavy one, as it has been held that every reasonable doubt should be resolved against him\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). In fact, Microsoft itself admits that our cases \u201ccould be read as announcing a heightened standard applicable to all invalidity assertions.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 30 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Furthermore, we cannot agree that Microsoft\u2019s proposed limitations are inherent\u2014even if unexpressed\u2014in our pre-1952 cases. As early as 1874 we explained that the burden of proving prior inventorship \u201crests upon [the defendant], and every reasonable doubt should be resolved against him,\u201d without tying that rule to the vagaries and manipulability of oral testimony. <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Ogden, </em>18 Wall. 120, 124, 21 L. Ed. 821 (1874). And, more than 60 years later, we applied that rule where the evidence in support of a prior-use defense included documentary proof\u2014not just oral testimony\u2014in a case presenting no priority issues at all. See <em>Smith, </em>301 U.S., at 221, 233, 57 S. Ct. 711, 81 L. Ed. 1049.

Cf., <em>e.g., </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">[564 U.S. 108]</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Reprising the more limited argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>ment that it pressed below, Microsoft argues in the alternative that a preponderance standard must at least apply where the evidence before the factfinder was not before the PTO during the examination process. In particular, it relies on <em>KSR Int\u2019l Co. </em>v. <em>Teleflex Inc., </em>550 U.S. 398, 127 S. Ct. 1727, 167 L. Ed. 2d 705 (2007), where we observed that, in these circumstances, \u201cthe rationale underlying the presumption\u2014that the PTO, in its expertise, has approved the claim\u2014 seems much diminished.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 426, 127 S. Ct. 1727, 167 L. Ed. 2d 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">That statement is true enough, although other rationales may animate the presumption in such circumstances. See <em>The Barbed Wire Patent, </em>143 U.S. 275, 292, 12 S. Ct. 443, 36 L. Ed. 154 (1892) (explaining that because the patentee \u201cfirst published this device; put it upon record; made use of it for a practical purpose; and gave it to the public . . . doubts . . . concerning the actual inventor . . . should be resolved in favor of the patentee\u201d); cf. Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>33 (arguing that even when the administrative correctness rationale has no relevance, the heightened standard of proof \u201cserves to protect the patent holder\u2019s reliance interests\u201d in disclosing an invention to the public in exchange for patent protection). The question remains, however, whether Congress has specified the applicable standard of proof. As established, Congress did just that by codifying the common-law presumption of patent validity and, implicitly, the heightened standard of proof attached to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Our pre-1952 cases never adopted or endorsed the kind of fluctuating standard of proof that Microsoft envisions. And they do not indicate, even in dicta, that anything less than a</p>\n<p id=\"AEvC\">[564 U.S. 109]</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">clear-and-convincing standard would ever apply to an invalidity defense raised in an infringement action. To the contrary, the Court spoke on this issue directly in <em>RCA, </em>stating that because the heightened standard of proof applied where the evidence before the court was \u201cdifferent\u201d from that considered by the PTO, it applied even more clearly where the evidence was identical. 293 U.S., at 8, 54 S. Ct. 752, 79 L. Ed. 163. Likewise, the Court\u2019s statement that a \u201cdubious preponderance\u201d will never suffice to sustain an invalidity defense, <em>ibid., </em>admitted of no apparent exceptions. Finally, this Court often applied the heightened standard of proof without any mention of whether the relevant prior-art evidence had been before the PTO examiner, in circumstances strongly suggesting it had not. See, <em>e.g., Smith, </em>301 U.S., at 227, 233, 57 S. Ct. 711, 81 L. Ed. 1049.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Nothing in \u00a7 282\u2019s text suggests that Congress meant to depart from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>that understanding to enact a standard of proof that would rise and fall with the facts of each case. Indeed, had Congress intended to drop the heightened standard of proof where the evidence before the jury varied from that before the PTO\u2014and thus to take the unusual and impractical step of enacting a variable standard of proof that must itself be adjudicated in each case, cf. <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer,</em></p>\n<p id=\"ABZ\">[564 U.S. no]</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">455 U.S. 745, 757, 102 S.

See <em>Jacuzzi Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Berkeley Pump Co., </em>191 F.2d 632, 634 (CA9 1951) (\u201clargely dissipated\u201d); <em>H. Schindler &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>C.

Co. </em>v. <em>Enterprise Cleaning Co., </em>81 F.2d 711, 716 (CA8 1936) (\u201cweakened\u201d). But we cannot read these cases to hold or even to suggest that a preponderance standard would apply in such circumstances, and we decline to impute such a reading to Congress. Instead, we understand these cases to reflect the same commonsense principle that the Federal Circuit has recognized throughout its existence\u2014 namely, that new evidence supporting an invalidity defense may \u201ccarry more weight\u201d in an infringement action than evidence previously considered by the <em>PTO, American Hoist, </em>725 F.2d, at 1360. As Judge Rich explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">[564 U.S. 111]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">\u201cWhen new evidence touching validity of the patent not considered by the PTO is relied on, the tribunal considering it is not faced with having to disagree with the PTO or with deferring to its judgment or with taking its expertise into account.

Cf. <em>KSR, </em>550 U.S., at 427, 127 S. Ct. 1727, 167 L. Ed. 2d 705. And, concomitantly, the challenger\u2019s burden to persuade the jury of its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence may be easier to sustain. In this respect, although we have no occasion to endorse any particular formulation, we note that a jury instruction on the effect of new evidence can, and when requested, most often should, be given. When warranted, the jury may be instructed to consider that it has heard evidence that the PTO had no opportunity to evaluate before granting the patent. When it is disputed whether the evidence presented to the jury differs from that evaluated by the PTO, the jury may be instructed to consider that question. In either case, the jury may be instructed to evaluate whether the evidence before it is materially new, and if so, to consider that fact when determining whether an invalidity defense has been proved by clear and convincing evidence. Cf., <em>e.g., Mendenhall </em>v. <em>Cedarapids, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1557, 1563-1564 (CA Fed. 1993); see also Brief for International Business Machines Corp. <em>as Amicus Curiae </em>31-37.

Now, in its reply brief in this Court, Microsoft insists that an instruction of this kind was warranted. Reply Brief for Petitioner 22-23. That argument, however, comes far too late, and we therefore refuse to consider it. See <em>Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>561 U.S. 63, 75-76, 130 S. Ct. 2772, 177 L.

Microsoft and its <em>amici </em>contend that the heightened standard of proof dampens innovation by unduly insulating \u201cbad\u201d patents from invalidity challenges. They point to the high invalidation rate as evidence that the PTO grants patent protection to too many undeserving \u201cinventions.\u201d They claim that <em>inter partes </em>reexamination proceedings before the PTO cannot fix the problem, as some grounds for invalidation (like the on-sale bar at issue here) cannot be raised in such proceedings. They question the deference that the PTO\u2019s expert determinations warrant, in light of the agency\u2019s resources and procedures, which they deem inadequate. And, they insist that the heightened standard of proof essentially causes juries to abdicate their role in reviewing invalidity claims raised in infringement actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">For their part, i4i and its <em>amici, </em>including the United States, contend that the heightened standard of proof properly limits the circumstances in which a lay jury overturns the considered judgment of an expert agency. They claim that the heightened standard of proof is an essential component of the patent \u201cbargain,\u201d see <em>Bonito Boats, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., </em>489 U.S. 141, 150-151, 109 S. Ct. 971, 103 L. Ed. 2d 118 (1989), and the incentives for inventors to disclose their innovations to the public in exchange for patent protection. They disagree with the notion that the patent issuance rate is above the</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">[564 U.S. 113]</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">optimal level. They explain that limits on the reexamination process reflect a judgment by Congress as to the appropriate degree of interference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>with patentees\u2019 reliance interests. Finally, they maintain that juries that are properly instructed as to the application of the clear-and-convincing-evidence standard can, and often do, find an invalidity defense established.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">We find ourselves in no position to judge the comparative force of these policy arguments. For nearly 30 years, the Federal Circuit has interpreted \u00a7 282 as we do today. During this period, Congress has often amended \u00a7 282, see, <em>e.g., </em>Pub. L. 104-141, \u00a7 2, 109 Stat. 352; Pub. L. 98-417, \u00a7 203, 98 Stat. 1603; not once, so far as we (and Microsoft) are aware, has it even considered a proposal to lower the standard of proof, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 10. Moreover, Congress has amended the patent laws to account for concerns about \u201cbad\u201d patents, including by expanding the reexamination process to provide for <em>inter partes </em>proceedings. See Optional Inter Par-tes Reexamination Procedure Act of 1999, 113 Stat. 1501A-567, codified at 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 311 <em>et seq. </em>Through it all, the evidentiary standard adopted in \u00a7 282 has gone untouched. Indeed, Congress has left the Federal Circuit\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 282 in place despite ongoing criticism, both from within the Federal Government and without.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Congress specified the applicable standard of proof in 1952 when it codified the common-law presumption of patent validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">[564 U.S. 114]</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Since then, it has allowed the Federal Circuit\u2019s correct interpretation of \u00a7 282 to stand.

A preliminary word on terminology is in order. As we have said, \u201c[t]he term \u2018burden of proof\u2019 is one of the \u2018slipperiest members of the family of legal terms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Weast, </em>546 U.S. 49, 56, 126 S. Ct. 528, 163 L. Ed. 2d 387 (2005) (quoting 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 342, p. 433 (5th ed. 1999) (alteration omitted)). Historically, the term has encompassed two separate burdens: the \u201cburden of persuasion\u2019\u2019 (specifying which party loses if the evidence is balanced), as well as the \u201cburden of production\u2019\u2019 (specifying which party must come forward with evidence at various stages in the litigation). 546 U.S., at 56, 126 S. Ct. 528, 163 L. Ed. 2d 387. Adding more confusion, the term \u201cburden of proof\u2019 has occasionally been used as a synonym for \u201cstandard of proof.\" <em>E.g., Grogan </em>v. <em>Garner, </em>498 U.S. 279, 286, 111 S. Ct. 654, 112 L. Ed. 2d 755 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">Here we use \u201cburden of proof\u2019 interchangeably with \u201cburden of persuasion\u2019\u2019 to identify the party who must persuade the jury in its favor to prevail. We use the term \u201cstandard of proof\u2019 to refer to the degree of certainty by which the factfinder must be persuaded of a factual conclusion to find in favor of the party bearing the burden of persuasion. See <em>Addington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418, 423, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 60 L. Ed. 2d 323 (1979). In other words, the term \u201cstandard of proof\u2019 specifies how difficult it will be for the party bearing the burden of persuasion to convince the jury of the facts in its favor. Various standards of proof are familiar\u2014beyond a reasonable doubt, by clear and convincing evidence, and by a preponderance of the evidence. See generally 21B C. Wright &amp; K. Graham, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 5122, pp. 405-411 (2d ed. 2005) (hereinafter Fed.

Microsoft objects that this reading of \u00a7 282 \u201cconflicts with the usual understanding of presumptions.\u2019\u2019 Reply Brief for Petitioner 4. In support, it relies on the \u201cunderstanding\u2019\u2019 reflected in Federal Rule of Evidence 301, which explains the ordinary effect of a presumption in federal civil actions. That Rule, however, postdates the 1952 Act by nearly 30 years, and it is not dispositive of how Congress in 1952 understood presumptions generally, much less the presumption of patent validity. In any event, the word \u201cpresumption\u201d has often been used when another term might be more accurate. See Thayer 335 (\u201cOften . . . maxims and ground principles get expressed in this form of a presumption perversely and inaccurately\u201d).

In a similar vein, Microsoft insists that there simply was no settled presumption of validity for Congress to codify in 1952. Microsoft points to a handful of District Court decisions, which \u201cquestioned] whether any presumption of validity was warranted,\u2019\u2019 or which \u201crequired the patentee to prove the validity of his patent by a preponderance of the evidence.\u2019\u2019 Brief for Petitioner 24 (emphasis deleted; brackets and internal quotation marks omitted); see, <em>e.g., Ginsberg </em>v. <em>Railway Express Agency, </em>Inc., 72 F. Supp. 43, 44 (SDNY 1947) (stating, in dicta, that \u201c[i] t may now well be said that no presumption whatever arises from the grant of patent\u2019\u2019); see also <em>post, </em>at 115\u2014116, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 148 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). <em>RCA </em>makes clear, however, that the presumption of patent validity had an established meaning traceable to the mid-19th century, 293 U.S. 1, 7-8, 54 S. Ct. 752, 79 L. Ed. 163 (1934); that some lower courts doubted its wisdom or even pretended it did not exist is of no moment. Microsoft may be correct that Congress enacted \u00a7 282 to correct lower courts that required the patentee to prove the validity of a patent. See <em>American Hoist &amp; Derrick Co. </em>v. <em>Sowa &amp; Sons, </em>Inc., 725 F.2d 1350, 1359 (CA Fed. 1984). But the language Congress selected reveals its intent not only to specify that the defendant bears the burden of proving invalidity but also that the evidence in support of the defense must be clear and convincing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b185-10\">. For those of us for whom it is relevant, the legislative history of \u00a7 282 provides additional evidence that Congress meant to codify the judge-made presumption of validity, not to set forth a new presumption of its own making. The accompanying House and Senate Reports both explain that \u00a7 282 \u201cintroduces a declaration of the presumption of validity of a patent, which is now a statement made by courts in decisions, but has had no expression in the statute.\u2019\u2019 H.

To the same effect, the Reviser\u2019s Note indicates that \u00a7 282\u2019s \u201cfirst paragraph declares the existing presumption of validity of patents.\u2019\u2019 Note following 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282 (1952 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">Prior to 1952, the existing patent laws already incorporated the sum and substance of the presumption as Microsoft would define it\u2014that is, they \u201cassigned] the burden of proving invalidity to the accused infringer,\u2019\u2019 Brief for Petitioner 14 (emphasis deleted). See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 69 (1946 ed.) (providing that a defendant in an infringement action \u201cmay plead\u2019\u2019 and \u201cprove on trial\u2019\u2019 the invalidity of the patent as a defense); see also Patent Act of 1870, ch. 230, \u00a7 61, 16 Stat. 208 (same); Patent Act of 1836, ch. 357, \u00a7 15, 5 Stat. 123 (similar); Patent Act of 1793, ch. XI, \u00a7 6, 1 Stat. 322 (similar); <em>Coffin, </em>18 Wall., at 124, 21 L. Ed. 821 (explaining that the Patent Act of 1836 \u201callowed a party sued for infringement to prove, among other defences, that the patentee was not the original and first inventor of the thing patented, or of a substantial and material part thereof claimed to be new\u2019\u2019 (internal quotation marks omitted)). The House and Senate Reports state, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>however, that \u00a7 282 established a principle that previously \u201chad no expression in the statute.\u2019\u2019 H. R. Rep., at 10; S. Rep., at 9. Thus, because the only thing missing from \u00a7 282\u2019s predecessor was the heightened standard of proof itself, Congress must have understood the presumption of patent validity to include the heightened standard of proof attached to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b186-13\">. Microsoft cites numerous Court of Appeals decisions as support for its claim that a preponderance standard must apply in the event that the evidence in the infringement action varies from that considered by the PTO. We see no hint of the hybrid standard of proof that Microsoft advocates in these cases. Indeed, in some of these cases it appears that the court even evaluated the evidence according to a heightened standard of proof. See <em>Jacuzzi Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Berkeley Pump Co., </em>191 F.2d 632, 634 (CA9 1951) (\u201cAlthough it is not expressly stated that th[e] conclusion [of invalidity] is based upon evidence establishing the thesis beyond a reasonable doubt, the Trial Court expressed no doubt. And the record shows that such conclusion was supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>substantial evidence\u201d); <em>Western Auto Supply Co. </em>v. <em>American-National Co., </em>114 F.2d 711, 713 (CA6 1940) (concluding that the patent was invalid where the court \u201centertain[ed] no doubt\u201d on the question).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b187-12\">. Not the least of the impracticalities of such an approach arises from the fact that whether a PTO examiner considered a particular reference will often be a question without a clear answer. In granting a patent, an examiner is under no duty to cite every reference he considers. 1 Dept, of Commerce, PTO, Manual of Patent Examining Procedure \u00a7 904.03, p. 900-51 (8th rev. ed. 2010) (\u201cThe examiner is not called upon to cite all references that may be available, but only the \u2018best.\u2019 Multiplying references, any one of which is as good as, but no better than, the others, adds to the burden and cost of prosecution and should therefore be avoided\u201d (emphasis deleted and citation omitted)); Manual of Patent Examining Procedure \u00a7 904.02, p. 129 (1st rev. ed. 1952) (same), http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/old/ElR3_900.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 6, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file); see also Brief for Respondents 45-46 (describing additional impracticalities). We see no indication in \u00a7 282 that Congress meant to require collateral litigation on such an inherently uncertain question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b189-16\">. See, <em>e.g., </em>FTC, To Promote Innovation: The Proper Balance of Competition and Patent Law and Policy 28 (Oct. 2003), http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/10/innovationrpt.pdf (recommending that \u201clegislation be enacted specifying that challenges to the validity of a patent be determined based on a preponderance of the evidence\u2019\u2019); Alsup, Memo to Congress: A District Judge\u2019s Proposal for Patent Reform, 24 Berkeley Tech.

I write separately because, given the technical but important nature of the invalidity question, I believe it worth emphasizing that in this area of law as in others the evidentiary standard of proof applies to questions of fact and not to questions of law. See, <em>e.g., Addington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418, 423, 99 S. Ct. 1804, 60 L. Ed. 2d 323 (1979). Thus a factfinder must use the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard where there are disputes about, say, when a product was first sold or whether a prior art reference had been published.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-15\">Many claims of invalidity rest, however, not upon factual disputes, but upon how the law applies to facts as given. Do the given facts show that the product was previously \u201cin public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>use\u201d? 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b). Do they show that the invention was \u201cnove[l]\u201d and that it was \u201cnon-obvious\u201d? \u00a7\u00a7 102, 103. Do they show that the patent applicant described his claims properly? \u00a7 112. Where the ultimate question of patent validity turns on the correct answer to legal questions\u2014 what these subsidiary legal standards mean or how they apply to the facts as given\u2014today\u2019s strict standard of proof has no application. See, <em>e.g., Graham </em>v. <em>John Deere Co. of Kansas City, </em>383 U.S. 1, 17, 86 S. Ct. 684, 15 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1966); <em>Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Chemque, Inc., </em>303 F.3d 1294, 1301</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">[564 U.S. 115]</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">(CA Fed. 2002); <em>Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling, Inc. </em>v. <em>Maersk Contractors USA, Inc., </em>617 F.3d 1296, 1305 (CA Fed. 2010); cf. <em>Markman </em>v. <em>Westview Instruments, Inc., </em>517 U.S. 370, 116 S. Ct. 1384, 134 L. Ed. 2d 577 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Courts can help to keep the application of today\u2019s \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard within its proper legal bounds by separating factual and legal aspects of an invalidity claim, say, by using instructions based on case-specific circumstances that help the jury make the distinction or by using interrogatories and special verdicts to make clear which specific factual findings underlie the jury\u2019s conclusions. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 49 and 51. By isolating the facts (determined with help of the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard), courts can thereby ensure the proper interpretation or application of the correct legal standard (without use of the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard). By preventing the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard from roaming outside its fact-related reservation, courts can increase the likelihood that discoveries or inventions will not receive legal protection where none is due.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b190-8\">Justice Thomas,</author>\n<p id=\"AFX7\">concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">I am not persuaded that Congress codified a standard of proof when it stated in the Patent Act of 1952 that \u201c[a] patent shall be presumed valid.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282; see <em>ante, </em>at 101, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 139. \u201c[W]here Congress borrows terms of art,\u201d this Court presumes that Congress \u201cknows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word . . . and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial mind.\u201d <em>Morissette </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 263, 72 S. Ct. 240, 96 L. Ed. 288 (1952). But I do not think that the words \u201c[a] patent shall be presumed valid\u201d so clearly conveyed a particular standard of proof to the judicial mind in 1952 as to constitute a term of art. See, <em>e.g., ante, </em>at 106, n. 7, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 142 (\u201c[S]ome lower courts doubted [the presumption\u2019s] wisdom or even pretended it did not exist\u201d); <em>Philip A. Hunt Co. </em>v. <em>Mallinckrodt Chemical Works, </em>72 F. Supp. 865, 869</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">[564 U.S. 116]</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">(EDNY 1947) (\u201c[T]he impact upon the presumption of many late decisions seems to have rendered it as attenuated ... as the shadow of a wraith\u201d); <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Beall Pipe &amp; Tank Corp., </em>90 F. Supp. 265, 268 (D Ore. 1948) (\u201c[T]he presumption of [patent] validity .. . is treated by the appellate courts as evanescent as a cloud\u201d); <em>American Hoist &amp; Derrick Co. </em>v. <em>Sowa &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>725 F.2d 1350, 1359 (CA Fed. 1984) (\u201c[I]n 1952, the case law was far from consistent\u2014even contradictory\u2014about the presumption\u201d); cf. <em>Bruesewitz </em>v. <em>Wyeth LLC, </em>562 U.S. 223, 255-258, 131 S. Ct. 1068, 179 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 1 (2011) (Congress\u2019 use of a word that is similar to a term of art does not codify the term of art). Therefore, I would not conclude that Congress\u2019 use of that phrase codified a standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Nevertheless, I reach the same outcome as the Court. Because \u00a7 282 is silent as to the standard of proof, it did not alter the common-law rule. See <em>ante, </em>at 100, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 139 (\u201c[Section 282] includes no express articulation of the standard of proof\u2019). For that reason, I agree with the Court that the heightened standard of proof set forth in <em>Radio Corp. of America </em>v. <em>Radio Engineering Laboratories, Inc., </em>293 U.S. 1, 54 S. Ct. 752, 79 L. Ed. 163 (1934)\u2014which has never been overruled by this Court or modified by Congress\u2014applies.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
