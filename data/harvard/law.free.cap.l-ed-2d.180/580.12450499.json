The question presented is whether federal drug regulations applicable to generic drug manufacturers directly conflict with, and thus pre-empt, these state-law claims. We hold that they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">Metoclopramide is a drug designed to speed the movement of food through the digestive system. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first approved metoclopramide tablets, under the brand name Reglan, in 1980. Five years later, generic manufacturers also began producing meto-clopramide. The drug is commonly used to treat digestive tract problems such as diabetic gastroparesis and gastroesophageal reflux disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-17\">Evidence has accumulated that long-term metoclopramide use can cause tardive dyskinesia, a severe neurological disorder. Studies have shown that up to 29% of patients who take metoclopramide for several years develop this condition. <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Wyeth, </em>462 F.3d 364, 370, n. 5 (CA5 2006); see also Shaffer, Butterfield, Pamer, &amp; Mackey, Tardive Dyskinesia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Risks and Metoclopramide Use Before and After U. S. Market Withdrawal of Cisapride, 44 J. Am. Pharmacists Assn. 661, 663 (2004) (noting 87 cases of metoclopramide-related tardive dyskinesia reported to the FDA\u2019s adverse event reporting system by mid-2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Accordingly, warning labels for the drug have been strengthened and clarified several times. In 1985, the label was modified to warn that \u201c[t]ar-dive dyskinesia . . . may develop in patients treated with metoclo-pramide,\u201d and the drug\u2019s package insert added that \u201c[t]herapy longer than 12 weeks has not been evaluated and cannot be recommended.\u201d Physician\u2019s Desk Reference 1635-1636 (41st ed. 1987); see also Brief for Petitioner PLIVA et al. 21-22 (hereinafter PLIVA Brief). In 2004, the brand-name Reglan manufacturer requested, and the FDA approved, a label change to add that \u201c[t]herapy should not exceed 12 weeks in duration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">[564 U.S. 610]</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>8 (hereinafter U.S. Brief). And in 2009, the FDA ordered a black box warning\u2014its strongest\u2014 which states: \u201cTreatment with meto-clopramide can cause tardive dyski-nesia, a serious movement disorder that is often irreversible. . . . Treatment with metoclopramide for longer than 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare cases.\u201d See Physician\u2019s Desk Reference 2902 (65th ed. 2011) (Warning Box).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Gladys Mensing and Julie Demahy, the plaintiffs in these consolidated cases, were prescribed Reglan in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Both received generic metoclopramide from their pharmacists. After taking the drug as prescribed for several years, both women developed tardive dyskinesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">In separate suits, Mensing and Demahy sued the generic drug manufacturers that produced the metoclo-pramide they took (Manufacturers). Each alleged, as relevant here, that long-term metoclopramide use caused her tardive dyskinesia and that the Manufacturers were liable under state tort law (specifically, that of Minnesota and Louisiana) for failing to provide adequate warning labels. They claimed that \u201cdespite mounting evidence that long term metoclo-pramide use carries a risk of tardive dyskinesia far greater than that indicated on the label,\u201d none of the Manufacturers had changed their labels to adequately warn of that danger. <em>Mensing </em>v. <em>Wyeth, Inc., </em>588 F.3d 603, 605 (CA8 2009); see also <em>Demahy </em>v. <em>Actavis, Inc., </em>593 F.3d 428, 430 (CA5 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">In both suits, the Manufacturers urged that federal law pre-empted the state tort claims. According to the Manufacturers, federal statutes and FDA regulations required them to use the same safety and efficacy labeling as their brand-name counterparts. This means, they argued, that it was impossible to simultaneously comply with both federal law and any state tort-law duty that required them to use a different label.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Eighth Circuits rejected the Manufacturers\u2019 arguments and held that Mensing</p>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">[564 U.S. 611]</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">and Demahy\u2019s claims were not pre-empted. See 588 F.3d, at 614; 593 F.3d, at 449. We granted certiorari, 562 U.S. 1104, 131 S. Ct. 817, 178 L. Ed. 2d 550 (2010), consolidated the cases, and now reverse each.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b629-15\">Pre-emption analysis requires us to compare federal and state law. We therefore begin by identifying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>state tort duties and federal labeling requirements applicable to the Manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">It is undisputed that  Minnesota and Louisiana tort law require a drug manufacturer that is or should be aware of its product\u2019s danger to label that product in a way that renders it reasonably safe. Under Minnesota law, which applies to Mensing\u2019s lawsuit, \u201cwhere the manufacturer ... of a product has actual or constructive knowledge of danger to users, the . . . manufacturer has a duty to give warning of such dangers.\u201d <em>Frey </em>v. <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., </em>258 N.W.2d 782, 788 (Minn. 1977). Similarly, under Louisiana law applicable to Demahy\u2019s lawsuit, \u201ca manufacturer\u2019s duty to warn includes a duty to provide adequate instructions for safe use of a product.\u201d <em>Stahl </em>v. <em>Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., </em>283 F.3d 254, 269-270 (CA5 2002); see also La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 9:2800.57 (West 2009). In both States, a duty to warn falls specifically on the manufacturer. See <em>Marks </em>v. <em>OHMEDA, Inc., </em>2003-1446, pp. 8-9 (La. App. 3 Cir. 3/31/04), 871 So. 2d 1148, 1155; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Badger Min. Corp., </em>676 N.W.2d 268, 274 (Minn. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Mensing and Demahy have pleaded that the Manufacturers knew or should have known of the high risk of tardive dyskinesia inherent in the long-term use of their product. They have also pleaded that the Manufacturers knew or should have known that their labels did not adequately warn of that risk. App. 437-438, 67-69, 94-96. The parties do</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">[564 U.S. 612]</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">not dispute that, if these allegations are true, state law required the Manufacturers to use a different, safer label.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">Federal law imposes far more complex drug labeling requirements. We begin with what is not in dispute.  Under the 1962 Drug Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 76 Stat. 780, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 <em>et seq., </em>a manufacturer seeking federal approval to market a new drug must prove that it is safe and effective and that the proposed label is accurate and adequate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See, <em>e.g., </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 355(b)(1), (d); <em>Wyeth </em>v. <em>Levine, </em>555 U.S. 555, 567, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51 (2009). Meeting those requirements involves costly and lengthy clinical testing. \u00a7\u00a7 355(b)(1)(A), (d); see also D. Beers, Generic and Innovator Drugs: A Guide to FDA Approval Requirements \u00a7 2.02[A] (7th ed. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-14\">Originally, the same rules applied to all drugs. In 1984, however, Congress passed the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, 98 Stat. 1585, commonly called the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.  Under this law, \u201cgeneric drugs\u201d can gain FDA approval simply by showing equivalence to a reference listed drug that has already been approved by the FDA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A). This allows manufacturers to develop generic drugs inexpensively, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>duplicating the clinical trials already performed on the equivalent brand-name drug. A generic drug application must also \u201cshow that the [safety and efficacy] labeling proposed ... is the same as the labeling approved</p>\n<p id=\"AWY-\">[564 U.S. 613]</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">for the [brand-name] drug.\u201d \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(v); see also \u00a7 355(j)(4)(G); Beers, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3.01, 3.03[A].</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">As a result, brand-name and generic drug manufacturers have different federal drug labeling duties. A brand-name manufacturer seeking new drug approval is responsible for the accuracy and adequacy of its label. See, <em>e.g., </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 355(b)(1), (d); <em>Wyeth, supra, </em>at 570-571, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51. A manufacturer seeking generic drug approval, on the other hand, is responsible for ensuring that its warning label is the same as the brand name\u2019s. See, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(v); \u00a7 355(j)(4)(G); 21 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 314.94(a)(8), 314.127(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The parties do not disagree. What is in dispute is whether, and to what extent, generic manufacturers may change their labels <em>after </em>initial FDA approval. Mensing and Demahy contend that federal law provided several avenues through which the Manufacturers could have altered their meto-clopramide labels in time to prevent the injuries here. The FDA, however, tells us that it interprets its regulations to require that the warning labels of a brand-name drug and its generic copy must always be the same\u2014thus, generic drug manufacturers have an ongoing federal duty of \u201csameness.\u201d U.S. Brief 16; see also 57 Fed. Reg. 17961 (1992) (\u201c[T]he [generic drug\u2019s] labeling must be the same as the listed drug product\u2019s labeling because the listed drug product is the basis for [generic drug] approval\u201d).  The FDA\u2019s views are \u201ccontrolling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation [s]\u201d or there is any other reason to doubt that they reflect the FDA\u2019s fair and considered judgment. <em>Auer </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>519 U.S. 452, 461, 462, 117 S. Ct. 905, 137 L. Ed. 2d 79 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">[564 U.S. 614]</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">First, Mensing and Demahy urge that the FDA\u2019s \u201cchanges-being-effected\u201d (CBE) process allowed the Manufacturers to change their labels when necessary. See Brief for Respondents 33-35; see also 593 F.3d, at 439-444; <em>Gaeta </em>v. <em>Perrigo Pharmaceuticals Co., </em>630 F.3d 1225, 1231 (CA9 2011); <em>Foster </em>v. <em>American Home Prods. Corp., </em>29 F.3d 165, 170 (CA4 1994).  The CBE process permits drug manufacturers to \u201cadd or strengthen a contraindication, warning, [or] precaution,\u201d 21 CFR \u00a7 314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A) (2006), or to \u201cadd or strengthen an instruction about dosage and administration that is intended to increase the safe use of the drug product,\u201d \u00a7 314.70(c)(6)(iii)(C). When making labeling changes using the CBE process, drug manufacturers need not wait for preapproval by the FDA, which ordinarily is necessary to change a label. <em>Wyeth, supra, </em>at 568, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51. They need only simultaneously file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>supplemental application with the FDA. 21 CFR \u00a7 314.70(c)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The FDA denies that the Manufacturers could have used the CBE process to unilaterally strengthen their warning labels. The agency interprets the CBE regulation to allow changes to generic drug labels only when a generic drug manufacturer changes its label to match an updated brand-name label or to follow the FDA\u2019s instructions. U.S. Brief 15,16, n. 7 (interpreting 21 CFR \u00a7 314.94(a)(8)(iv)); U.S. Brief 16, n. 8. The FDA argues that CBE changes unilaterally made to strengthen a generic drug\u2019s warning label would violate the statutes and regulations requiring a generic drug\u2019s label to match its brand-name counterpart\u2019s. <em>Id., </em>at 15-16; see also 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(4)(G); 21 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 314.94(a)(8)(iii), 314.150(b)(10) (approval may be withdrawn if the generic drug\u2019s label \u201cis no longer consistent with that for [the brand-name]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">We defer to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of its CBE and generic labeling regulations. Although Mensing and Demahy</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">[564 U.S. 615]</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">offer other ways to interpret the regulations, see Brief for Respondents 33-35, we do not find the agency\u2019s interpretation \u201cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,\u201d <em>Auer, supra, </em>at 461, 117 S. Ct. 905, 137 L. Ed. 2d 79 (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor do Mensing and Demahy suggest there is any other reason to doubt the agency\u2019s reading. We therefore conclude that the CBE process was not open to the Manufacturers for the sort of change required by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Next, Mensing and Demahy contend that the Manufacturers could have used \u201cDear Doctor\u201d letters to send additional warnings to prescribing physicians and other healthcare professionals. See Brief for Respondents 36; 21 CFR \u00a7 200.5. Again, the FDA disagrees, and we defer to the agency\u2019s views.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">The FDA argues that Dear Doctor letters qualify as \u201clabeling.\u201d U.S. Brief 18; see also 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(m); 21 CFR \u00a7 202.1(D(2). Thus, any such letters must be \u201cconsistent with and not contrary to [the drug\u2019s] approved . . . labeling.\u201d 21 CFR \u00a7 201.100(d)(1). A Dear Doctor letter that contained substantial new warning information would not be consistent with the drug\u2019s approved labeling. Moreover, if generic drug manufacturers, but not the brand-name manufacturer, sent such letters, that would inaccurately imply a therapeutic difference between the brand and generic drugs and thus could be impermissibly \u201cmisleading.\u201d U.S. Brief 19; see 21 CFR \u00a7 314.150(b)(3) (FDA may withdraw approval of a generic drug if \u201cthe labeling of the drug ... is false or misleading in any particular\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">As with the CBE regulation, we defer to the FDA. Mensing and Demahy offer no argument that the FDA\u2019s interpretation is plainly erroneous. <em>See Auer, supra, </em>at 461, 117 S. Ct. 905, 137 L. Ed. 2d 79. Accordingly, we conclude that federal law did not permit the Manufacturers to issue additional warnings through Dear Doctor letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">[564 U.S. 616]</p>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b632-15\">Though the FDA denies that the Manufacturers could have used the CBE process or Dear Doctor letters to strengthen their warning labels, the agency asserts that a different avenue existed for changing generic drug la<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>bels. According to the FDA, the Manufacturers could have proposed\u2014indeed, were required to propose\u2014 stronger warning labels to the agency if they believed such warnings were needed. U.S. Brief 20; 57 Fed. Reg. 17961. If the FDA had agreed that a label change was necessary, it would have worked with the brand-name manufacturer to create a new label for both the brand-name and generic drug. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The agency traces this duty to [6] 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352(f)(2), which provides that a drug is \u201cmisbranded . . . [u]n-less its labeling bears . . . adequate warnings against. .. unsafe dosage or methods or duration of administration or application, in such manner and form, as are necessary for the protection of users.\u201d See U.S. Brief 12. By regulation, the FDA has interpreted that statute to require that \u201clabeling shall be revised to include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a drug.\u201d 21 CFR \u00a7 201.57(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">According to the FDA, these requirements apply to generic drugs. As it explains, a \u201c \u2018central premise of federal drug regulation [is] that the manufacturer bears responsibility for the content of its label at all times.\u2019 \u201d U.S. Brief 12-13 (quoting <em>Wyeth, </em>555 U.S., at 570-571, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51). The FDA reconciles this duty to have adequate and accurate labeling with the duty of sameness in the following way: Generic drug manufacturers that become aware of safety problems must ask the agency to work toward strengthening the label that applies to both the generic and brand-name equivalent drug. U.S. Brief 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The Manufacturers and the FDA disagree over whether this alleged duty to request a strengthened label actually existed. The FDA argues that it explained this duty in the</p>\n<p id=\"AzJGZ\">[564 U.S. 617]</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">preamble to its 1992 regulations implementing the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Ibi<em>d.; </em>see 57 Fed. Reg. 17961 (\u201cIf a [generic drug manufacturer] believes new safety information should be added to a product\u2019s labeling, it should contact FDA, and FDA will determine whether the labeling for the generic and listed drugs should be revised\u201d). The Manufacturers claim that the FDA\u2019s 19-year-old statement did not create a duty, and that there is no evidence of any generic drug manufacturer ever acting pursuant to any such duty. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19-24; Reply Brief for Petitioner PLIVA et al. 18-22. Because we ultimately find pre-emption even assuming such a duty existed, we do not resolve the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">To summarize, the relevant state and federal requirements are these: State tort law places a duty directly on all drug manufacturers to adequately and safely label their products. Taking Mensing and Demahy\u2019s allegations as true, this duty required the Manufacturers to use a different, stronger label than the label they actually used. Federal drug regulations, as interpreted by the FDA, prevented the Manufacturers from independently changing their generic drugs\u2019 safety labels. But, we assume, federal law also required the Manufacturers to ask for FDA assistance in convincing the brand-name manufacturer to adopt a stronger label, so that all corresponding generic drug manufacturers could do so as well. We turn now to the question of pre-emption.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">The Supremacy Clause estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>lishes that federal law \u201cshall be the supreme Law of the Land . . . any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. Where state and federal law \u201cdirectly conflict,\u201d state law must give way. <em>Wyeth, supra, </em>at 583, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); see also <em>Crosby </em>v. <em>National Foreign Trade Council, </em>530 U.S. 363,</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">[564 U.S. 618]</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">372, 120 S.

We have held that state and federal law conflict where it is \u201cimpossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Freightliner Corp. </em>v. <em>Myrick, </em>514 U.S. 280, 287, 115 S. Ct. 1483, 131 L. Ed. 2d 385 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">We find impossibility here. It was not lawful under federal law for the Manufacturers to do what state law required of them. And even if they had fulfilled their federal duty to ask for FDA assistance, they would not have satisfied the requirements of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">If the Manufacturers had independently changed their labels to satisfy their state-law duty, they would have violated federal law. Taking Mensing and Demahy\u2019s allegations as true, state law imposed on the Manufacturers a duty to attach a safer label to their generic metoclopramide. Federal law, however, demanded that generic drug labels be the same at all times as the corresponding brand-name drug labels. See, <em>e.g., </em>21 CFR \u00a7 314.150(b)(10). Thus, it was impossible for the Manufacturers to comply with both their state-law duty to change the label and their federal-law duty to keep the label the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">[564 U.S. 619]</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">The federal duty to ask the FDA for help in strengthening the corresponding brand-name label, assuming such a duty exists, does not change this analysis. Although requesting FDA assistance would have satisfied the Manufacturers\u2019 federal duty, it would not have satisfied their state tort-law duty to provide adequate labeling. State law demanded a safer label; it did not instruct the Manufacturers to communicate with the FDA about the possibility of a safer label. Indeed, Mensing and Demahy deny that their state tort claims are based on the Manufacturers\u2019 alleged failure to ask the FDA for assistance in changing the labels. Brief for Respondents 53-54; cf. <em>Buckman Co. </em>v. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019Legal Comm., </em>531 U.S. 341, 121 S. Ct. 1012, 148 L. Ed. 2d 854 (2001) (holding that federal drug and medical device laws pre-empted a state tort-law claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>based on failure to properly communicate with the FDA).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Mensing and Demahy contend that, while their state-law claims do not turn on whether the Manufacturers asked the FDA for assistance in changing their labels, the Manufacturers\u2019 federal affirmative defense of pre-emption does. Mensing and Demahy argue that if the Manufacturers had asked the FDA for help in changing the corresponding brand-name label, they might eventually have been able to accomplish under federal law what state law requires. That is true enough. The Manufacturers \u201cfreely concede\u201d that they could have asked the FDA for help. PLIVA Brief 48. If they had done so, and if the FDA decided there was sufficient supporting information, and if the FDA undertook negotiations with the brand-name manufacturer, and if adequate label changes were decided on and implemented, then the Manufacturers would have started a Mouse Trap game that eventually led to a better label on generic metoclo-pr amide.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">[564 U.S. 620]</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">This raises the novel question whether conflict pre-emption should take into account these possible actions by the FDA and the brand-name manufacturer. Here, what federal law permitted the Manufacturers to do could have changed, even absent a change in the law itself, depending on the actions of the FDA and the brand-name manufacturer. Federal law does not dictate the text of each generic drug\u2019s label, but rather ties those labels to their brand-name counterparts. Thus, federal law would permit the Manufacturers to comply with the state labeling requirements if, and only if, the FDA and the brand-name manufacturer changed the brand-name label to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">Mensing and Demahy assert that when a private party\u2019s ability to comply with state law depends on approval and assistance from the FDA, proving pre-emption requires that party to demonstrate that the FDA would not have allowed compliance with state law. Here, they argue, the Manufacturers cannot bear their burden of proving impossibility because they did not even <em>try </em>to start the process that might ultimately have allowed them to use a safer label. Brief for Respondents 47. This is a fair argument, but we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">The question for \u201cimpossibility\u201d is whether the private party could independently do under federal law what state law requires of it. See <em>Wyeth, </em>555 U.S., at 573, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51 (finding no pre-emption where the defendant could \u201cunilaterally\u201d do what state law required). Accepting Mensing and Demahy\u2019s argument would render conflict pre-emption largely meaningless because it would make most conflicts between state and federal law illusory. We can often imagine that a third party or the Federal Government <em>might </em>do something that makes it lawful for a private party to accomplish under federal law what state law requires of it. In these cases, it is certainly possible that, had the Manufacturers asked the FDA for help, they might have eventually been able to strengthen their warning label. Of course, it is also <em>possible </em>that the Manufacturers could have convinced the FDA to</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">[564 U.S. 621]</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">reinterpret its regulations in a manner that would have opened the CBE process to them. Following Mensing and Demahy\u2019s argument to its logical conclusion, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>also <em>possible </em>that, by asking, the Manufacturers could have persuaded the FDA to rewrite its generic drug regulations entirely or talked Congress into amending the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">If these conjectures suffice to prevent federal and state law from conflicting for Supremacy Clause purposes, it is unclear when, outside of express pre-emption, the Supremacy Clause would have any force.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We do not read the Supremacy Clause to permit an approach to pre-emption that renders conflict pre-emption all but meaningless.  The Supremacy Clause, on its face, makes federal law \u201cthe supreme Law of the Land\u201d even absent an express statement by Congress. U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Moreover, the text of the Clause\u2014 that federal law shall be supreme, \u201cany Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding\u201d\u2014plainly contemplates conflict pre-emption by describing federal law as effectively repealing contrary state law. <em>Ibid.; </em>see Nelson, Preemption, 86 Va. L. Rev. 225, 234 (2000); <em>id., </em>at 252-253 (describing discussion of the Supremacy Clause in state ratification debates as concerning whether federal law could repeal state law, or vice versa). The phrase \u201cany [state law] to the Contrary notwithstanding\u201d is a <em>non ob-stante </em>provision. <em>Id., </em>at 238-240, nn. 43-45. Eighteenth-century legislatures used <em>non obstante </em>provisions to specify the degree to which a</p>\n<p id=\"A5m\">[564 U.S. 622]</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">new statute was meant to repeal older, potentially conflicting statutes in the same field. <em>Id., </em>at 238-240 (citing dozens of statutes from the 1770\u2019s and 1780\u2019s with similar provisions). <em>Anon obstante </em>provision \u201cin [a] new statute acknowledged that the statute might contradict prior law and instructed courts not to apply the general presumption against implied repeals.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 241-242; 4 M. Bacon, A New Abridgment of the Law \u00b6 19, p. 639 (4th ed. 1778) (\u201cAlthough two Acts of Parliament are <em>seemingly </em>repugnant, yet if there be no Clause of <em>non Ob-stante </em>in the latter, they shall if possible have such Construction, that the latter may not be a Repeal of the former by Implication\u201d). The <em>non ob-stante </em>provision in the Supremacy Clause therefore suggests that federal law should be understood to impliedly repeal conflicting state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">Further, the provision suggests that courts should not strain to find ways to reconcile federal law with seemingly conflicting state law. Traditionally, courts went to great lengths attempting to harmonize conflicting statutes, in order to avoid implied repeals. <em>Warder </em>v. <em>Arell, </em>2 Va. 282, 296 (1796) (opinion of Roane, J.) (\u201c[W]e ought to seek for such a construction as will reconcile [the statutes] together\u201d); <em>Ludlow\u2019s Heirs </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>3 Ohio 553, 564 (1828) (\u201c[I]f by any fair course of reasoning the two [statutes] can be reconciled, both shall stand\u201d); <em>Doolittle </em>v. <em>Bryan, </em>14 How. 563, 566, 14 L. Ed. 543 (1853) (requiring \u201cthe repugnance be quite plain\u201d before finding implied repeal). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>A <em>non obstante </em>provision thus was a useful way for legislatures to specify that they did not want courts distorting the new law to accommodate the old. Nelson, <em>supra, </em>at 240-242; see also J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 147, p. 199 (1891) (\u201c[W]hen there is inserted in a statute a provision [of <em>non obstante] . . </em>. [i]t is to be supposed that courts will be less inclined against recognizing repugnancy in applying such statutes\u201d); <em>Weston\u2019s Case, </em>3 Dyer 347a, 347b, 73 Eng. Rep. 780, 781 (K. B. 1575) (\u201c[W]hen there are two statutes, the one in appearance crossing the other, and no clause of <em>non obstante </em>is contained</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">[564 U.S. 623]</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">in the second statute ... the exposition ought to be that both should stand in force\u201d); G. Jacob, A New Law Dictionary (J. Morgan ed., 10th ed. 1782) (definition of \u201cstatute,\u201d \u00b6 6: \u201c[W]hen there is a seeming variance between two <em>statutes, </em>and no clause of <em>non obstante </em>in the latter, such construction shall be made that both may stand\u201d). The <em>non obstante </em>provision of the Supremacy Clause indicates that a court need look no further than \u201cthe ordinary meanin[g]\u201d of federal law, and should not distort federal law to accommodate conflicting state law. <em>Wyeth, </em>555 U.S., at 588, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">To consider in our pre-emption analysis the contingencies inherent in these cases\u2014in which the Manufacturers\u2019 ability to comply with state law depended on uncertain federal agency and third-party decisions\u2014 would be inconsistent with the <em>non obstante </em>provision of the Supremacy Clause. The Manufacturers would be required continually to prove the counterfactual conduct of the FDA and brand-name manufacturer in order to establish the supremacy of federal law. We do not think the Supremacy Clause contemplates that sort of contingent supremacy. The <em>non obstante </em>provision suggests that preemption analysis should not involve speculation about ways in which federal agency and third-party actions could potentially reconcile federal duties with conflicting state duties. When the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of federal law blocks a private party from independently accomplishing what state law requires, that party has established pre-emption.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">To be sure, whether a private party can act sufficiently independently under federal law to do what state law requires may sometimes be difficult to determine. But this is not such a case. Before the Manufacturers could satisfy state law, the FDA\u2014a federal agency\u2014had to undertake special effort permitting them to do so. To decide these cases, it is enough to hold that  when a party cannot satisfy its state duties without the Federal Government\u2019s special permission</p>\n<p id=\"auz-dedup-0\">[564 U.S. 624]</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">and assistance, which is dependent on the exercise of judgment by a federal agency, that party cannot independently satisfy those state duties for pre-emption purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">Here, state law imposed a duty on the Manufacturers to take a certain action, and federal law barred them from taking that action. The only action the Manufacturers could independently take\u2014asking for the FDA\u2019s help\u2014is not a matter of state-law concern. Mensing and Demahy\u2019s tort claims are pre-empted.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b637-15\"><em>Wyeth </em>is not to the contrary. In that case, as here, the plaintiff contended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>that a drug manufacturer had breached a state tort-law duty to provide an adequate warning label. <em>Id., </em>at 559-560, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51. The Court held that the lawsuit was not pre-empted because it was possible for Wyeth, a brand-name drug manufacturer, to comply with both state and federal law. <em>Id., </em>at 572-573, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, the CBE regulation, 21 CFR \u00a7 314.70(c)(6)(iii), permitted a brand-name drug manufacturer like Wyeth \u201cto unilaterally strengthen its warning\u201d without prior FDA approval. 555 U.S., at 573, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51; cf. <em>supra, </em>at 614-615, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 590. Thus, the federal regulations applicable to Wyeth allowed the company, of its own volition, to strengthen its label in compliance with its state tort duty.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">[564 U.S. 625]</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">We recognize that from the perspective of Mensing and Demahy, finding pre-emption here but not in <em>Wyeth </em>makes little sense. Had Mensing and Demahy taken Reglan, the brand-name drug prescribed by their doctors, <em>Wyeth </em>would control and their lawsuits would not be pre-empted. But because pharmacists, acting in full accord with state law, substituted generic metoclopramide instead, federal law pre-empts these lawsuits. See, <em>e.g., </em>Minn. Stat. \u00a7 151.21 (2010) (describing when pharmacists may substitute generic drugs); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 37:1241(A)( 17) (West 2007) (same). We acknowledge the unfortunate hand that federal drug regulation has dealt Mensing, Demahy, and others similarly situated.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>But \u201cit is not this Court\u2019s task to decide whether the statutory scheme established by Congress is unusual or even bizarre.\u201d <em>Cuomo </em>v. <em>Clearing House Assn., L. L. C., </em>557 U.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">[564 U.S. 626]</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">519, 556, 129 S. Ct. 2710, 174 L. Ed. 2d 464 (2009) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). It is beyond dispute that the federal statutes and regulations that apply to brand-name drug manufacturers are meaningfully different than those that apply to generic drug manufacturers. Indeed, it is the special, and different, regulation of generic drugs that allowed the generic drug market to expand, bringing more drugs more quickly and cheaply to the public. But different federal statutes and regulations may, as here, lead to different pre-emption results. We will not distort the Supremacy Clause in order to create similar pre-emption across a dissimilar statutory scheme.

Although an express statement on pre-emption is always preferable, the lack of such a statement does not end our inquiry.

Accordingly, the Court noted that Wyeth could have attempted to show, by \u201cclear evidence,\u2019\u2019 that the FDA would have rescinded any change in the label and thereby demonstrate that it would in fact have been impossible to do under federal law what state law required. <em>Wyeth, supra, </em>at 571, 129 S.

First, the FDA informs us that \u201c[a]s a practical matter, genuinely new information about drugs in long use (as generic drugs typically are) appears infrequently.\u201d U.S. Brief 34-35. That is because patent protections ordinarily prevent generic drugs from arriving on the market for a number of years after the brand-name drug appears. Indeed, situations like the one alleged here are apparently so rare that the FDA has no \u201cformal regulation\u201d establishing generic drug manufacturers\u2019 duty to initiate a label change, nor does it have any regulation setting out that label-change process. <em>Id., </em>at 20-21.

I cannot agree. We have traditionally held defendants claiming impossibility to a demanding standard: Until today, the mere possibility of impossibility had not been enough to establish pre-emption.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits\u2014and, the Court assumes, requires\u2014generic-drug manufacturers to propose a label change to the FDA when they believe that their labels are inadequate. If it agrees that the labels are inadequate, the FDA can initiate a change to the brand-name</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">[564 U.S. 627]</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">label, triggering a corresponding change to the generic labels. Once that occurs, a generic manufacturer is in full compliance with both federal law and a state-law duty to warn. Although generic manufacturers may be able to show impossibility in some cases, petitioners, generic manufacturers of metoclopramide (Manufacturers), have shown only that they <em>might </em>have been unable to comply with both federal law and their state-law duties to warn respondents Gladys Mensing and Julie Demahy. This, I would hold, is insufficient to sustain their burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-19\">The Court strains to reach the opposite conclusion. It invents new principles of pre-emption law out of thin air to justify its dilution of the impossibility standard. It effectively rewrites our decision in <em>Wyeth </em>v. <em>Levine, </em>555 U.S. 555, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L.

The dominant position of generic drugs in the prescription drug market is the result of a series of legislative measures, both federal and state.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">In 1984, Congress enacted the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, 98 Stat. 1585\u2014com-monly known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA)\u2014to \u201cmake available</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">[564 U.S. 628]</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">more low cost generic drugs by establishing a generic drug approval procedure,\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 98-857, pt. 1, p. 14 (1984). As the majority explains, to accomplish this goal the amendments establish an abbreviated application process for generic drugs. <em>Ante, </em>at 612-613, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 588-589; see also 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A). The abbreviated approval process implements the amendments\u2019 core principle that generic and brand-name drugs must be the \u201csame\u201d in nearly all respects: To obtain FDA approval, a generic manufacturer must ordinarily show, among other things, that its product has the same active ingredients as an approved brand-name drug; that \u201cthe route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the new drug are the same\u201d as the brand-name drug; and that its product is \u201cbioequivalent\u201d to the brand-name drug. \u00a7\u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(ii), (iii), (iv). By eliminating the need for generic manufacturers to prove their drugs\u2019 safety and efficacy independently, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments allow generic manufacturers to bring drugs to market much less expensively.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">The States have also acted to expand consumption of low-cost generic drugs. In the years leading up to passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, States enacted legislation authorizing pharmacists to substitute generic drugs when filling prescriptions for brand-name drugs. Christensen, Kirking, Ascione, Welage, &amp; Gaither, Drug Product Selection: Legal Issues, 41 J. Am. Pharmaceutical Assn. 868, 869 (2001). Currently, all States have some form of generic substitution law. See <em>ibid. </em>Some States require generic substitution in certain circumstances. Dept, of Health and Human Servs., ASPE Issue Brief: Expanding the Use of Generic Drugs 7 (2010) (hereinafter Expanding the Use of Generic Drugs);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> see, <em>e.g., </em>N. Y. Educ. Law Ann. \u00a7 6816-a (West 2010).

Some States require patient consent to substitution, and all States \u201callow the physician to specify that the brand name must be prescribed, although with different levels <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>of effort from the physician.\u201d Expanding the Use of Generic Drugs 7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">These legislative efforts to expand production and consumption of generic drugs have proved wildly successful. It is estimated that in 1984, when the Hatch-Waxman Amendments were enacted, generic drugs constituted 19 percent of drugs sold in this country. Congressional Budget Office, How Increased Competition From Generic Drugs Has Affected Prices and Returns in the Pharmaceutical Industry 27 (1998).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Today, they dominate the market. See Expanding the Use of Generic Drugs 2 (generic drugs constituted 75 percent of all dispensed prescription drugs in 2009). Ninety percent of drugs for which a generic version is available are now filled with generics. <em>Id., </em>at 3-4. In many cases, once generic versions of a drug enter the market, the brand-name manufacturer stops selling the brand-name drug altogether. See Brief for Marc T. Law et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>18 (citing studies showing that anywhere from one-third to one-half of generic drugs no longer have a marketed brand-name equivalent). Reflecting the success of their products, many generic manufacturers, including the Manufacturers and their <em>amici, </em>are huge, multinational companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">[564 U.S. 630]</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">In total, generic-drug manufacturers sold an estimated $66 billion of drugs in this country in 2009. See <em>id., </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">As noted, to obtain FDA approval a generic manufacturer must generally show that its drug is the same as an approved brand-name drug. It need not conduct clinical trials to prove the safety and efficacy of the drug. This does not mean, however, that a generic manufacturer has no duty under federal law to ensure the safety of its products. The FDA has limited resources to conduct postapproval monitoring of drug safety. See <em>Wyeth, </em>555 U.S., at 578, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51. Manufacturers, we have recognized, \u201chave superior access to information about their drugs, especially in the postmarketing phase as new risks emerge.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 578-579, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51. Federal law thus obliges drug manufacturers\u2014both brand-name and generic\u2014to monitor the safety of their products.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">Under federal law, generic manufacturers must \u201cdevelop written procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and reporting of postmar-keting adverse drug experiences\u201d to the FDA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 21 CFR \u00a7 314.80(b);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> see also \u00a7 314.98 (making \u00a7 314.80 applicable to generic manufacturers); Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>and n. 2 (hereinafter U.S. Brief). They must review all reports of adverse drug experiences received from \u201cany source.\u201d \u00a7 314.80(b). If a manufacturer receives a report of a serious and unexpected adverse drug experience, it must report the event to the FDA within 15 days and must \u201cpromptly investigate.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 314.80(c)(l)(i)-(ii); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. Most other adverse drug experiences must be reported on a quarterly</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">[564 U.S. 631]</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">or yearly basis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u00a7 314.80(c)(2). Generic manufacturers must also submit to the FDA an annual report summarizing \u201csignificant new information from the previous year that might affect the safety, effectiveness, or labeling of the drug product,\u201d including a \u201cdescription of actions the [manufacturer] has taken or intends to take as a result of this new information.\u201d \u00a7 314.81(b)(2)(i); see also \u00a7 314.98(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Generic manufacturers, the majority assumes, also bear responsibility under federal law for monitoring the adequacy of their warnings. I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that generic manufacturers are not permitted unilaterally to change their labels through the \u201cchanges-being-effected\u201d (CBE) process or to issue additional warnings through \u201cDear Doctor\u201d letters. See <em>ante, </em>at 613-615, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 589-590. According to the FDA, however, that generic manufacturers cannot disseminate additional warnings on their own does not mean that federal law permits them to remain idle when they conclude that their labeling is inadequate. FDA regulations require that labeling \u201cbe revised to include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a drug.\u201d 21 CFR \u00a7 201.57(e) (2006), currently</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">[564 U.S. 632]</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">codified at 21 CFR \u00a7 201.80(e) (2010); see also <em>Wyeth, </em>555 U.S., at 570-571, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51. The FDA construes this regulation to oblige generic manufacturers \u201cto seek to revise their labeling and provide FDA with supporting information about risks\u201d when they believe that additional warnings are necessary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> U.S. Brief 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>The Manufacturers disagree. They read the FDA regulation to require them only to ensure that their labels match the brand-name labels. See Brief for Petitioner PLIVA et al. 38-41. I need not decide whether the regulation in fact obliges generic manufacturers to approach the FDA to propose a label change. The majority assumes that it does. And even if generic manufacturers do not have a duty to propose label changes, two points remain undisputed. First, they do have a duty under federal law to monitor the safety of their products. And, second, they may approach the FDA to propose a label change when they believe a change is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">This brings me to the Manufacturers\u2019 pre-emption defense. State law obliged the Manufacturers to warn of dangers to users. See <em>Hines </em>v. <em>Remington Arms Co., </em>94-0455, p. 10</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">[564 U.S. 633]</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">(La. 12/8/94), 648 So. 2d 331, 337; <em>Frey </em>v. <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; </em>Co., 258 N.W.2d 782, 788 (Minn. 1977). The Manufacturers contend, and the majority agrees, that federal law pre-empts respondents\u2019 failure-to-warn claims because, under federal law, the Manufacturers could not have provided additional warnings to respondents without the exercise of judgment by the FDA. I cannot endorse this novel conception of impossibility preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">Two principles guide all preemption analysis. First, \u201c \u2018the purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone in every pre-emption case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wyeth, </em>555 U.S., at 565, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51 (quoting <em>Medtronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lohr, </em>518 U.S. 470, 485, 116 S. Ct. 2240, 135 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1996)). Second, \u201c \u2018[i]n all pre-emption cases, and particularly in those in which Congress has legislated ... in a field which the States have traditionally occupied, ... we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wyeth, </em>555 U.S., at 565, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51 (quoting <em>Lohr, </em>518 U.S., at 485, 116 S. Ct. 2240, 135 L. Ed. 2d 700; some internal quotation marks omitted; alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">These principles find particular resonance in these cases. The States have traditionally regulated health and safety matters. See <em>id., </em>at 485. Notwithstanding Congress\u2019 \u201ccertain awareness of the prevalence of state tort litigation\u201d against drug manufacturers, <em>Wyeth, </em>555 U.S., at 575, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51, Congress has not expressly pre-empted state-law tort actions against prescription drug manufacturers, whether brand-name or generic. To the contrary, when Congress amended the FDCA in 1962 to \u201cenlarg[e] the FDA\u2019s powers to \u2018protect the public health\u2019 and \u2018assure the safety, effectiveness, and reliability of drugs,\u2019 [it] took care to preserve state law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 567 (quoting 76 Stat. 780); see \u00a7 202, 76 Stat. 793 (\u201cNothing in the amendments made by this Act to the [FDCA] shall be construed as invalidating any provision of</p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">[564 U.S. 634]</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">State law which would be valid in the absence of such amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>ments unless there is a direct and positive conflict between such amendments and such provision of State law\u201d). Notably, although Congress enacted an express pre-emption provision for medical devices in 1976, see \u00a7 521, 90 Stat. 574, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a), it included no such provision in the Hatch-Waxman Amendments eight years later. Cf. <em>Wyeth, </em>555 U.S., at 567, 574-575, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51. Congress\u2019 \u201csilence on the issue ... is powerful evidence that [it] did not intend FDA oversight to be the exclusive means of ensuring drug safety and effectiveness.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 575, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Federal law impliedly pre-empts state law when state and federal law <em>\u201cconflict\u201d\u2014i.e., </em>when \u201cit is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal law\u201d or when state law \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Crosby </em>v. <em>National Foreign Trade Council, </em>530 U.S. 363, 372-373, 120 S. Ct. 2288, 147 L. Ed. 2d 352 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Manufacturers rely solely on the former ground of preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Impossibility pre-emption, we have emphasized, \u201cis a demanding defense.\u201d <em>Wyeth, </em>555 U.S., at 573, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51. Because pre-emption is an affirmative defense, a defendant seeking to set aside state law bears the burden to prove impossibility. See ibid.; <em>Silkwood </em>v. <em>Kerr-McGee Corp., </em>464 U.S. 238, 255, 104 S. Ct. 615, 78 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1984). To prevail on this defense, a defendant must demonstrate that \u201ccompliance with both federal and state [law] is a physical impossibility.\u201d <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>373 U.S. 132, 142-143, 83 S. Ct. 1210, 10 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1963); see also <em>Wyeth, </em>555 U.S., at 573, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51. In other words, there must be an \u201cinevitable collision\u201d between federal and state law. <em>Florida Lime, </em>373 U.S., at 143, 83 S. Ct. 1210 10 L. Ed. 2d 248. \u201cThe existence of a hypothetical or potential conflict is insufficient to warrant\u201d pre-emption of state law. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Norman Williams Co., </em>458 U.S. 654, 659, 102 S. Ct. 3294, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1042</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">[564 U.S. 635]</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">(1982); see also <em>Gade </em>v. <em>National Solid Wastes Management Assn., </em>505 U.S. 88, 110, 112 S. Ct. 2374, 120 L. Ed. 2d 73 (1992) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). In other words, the mere possibility of impossibility is not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">The Manufacturers contend that it was impossible for them to provide additional warnings to respondents Mensing and Demahy because federal law prohibited them from changing their labels unilaterally.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> They concede, however, that they could have asked the FDA to initiate a label change. If the FDA agreed that a label change was required, it could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>asked, and indeed pressured, the brand-name manufacturer to change its label, triggering a corresponding change to the Manufacturers\u2019 generic labels.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, had the Manufacturers invoked the available mechanism for initiating label changes, they may well have been able to change their labels in sufficient time to warn respondents. Having failed to do so, the Manufacturers cannot sustain their burden (at least not without further factual development) to demonstrate that it was impossible for them to comply with both federal and state law. At most, they have</p>\n<p id=\"AcYO\">[564 U.S. 636]</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">demonstrated only \u201ca hypothetical or potential conflict.\u201d <em>Rice, </em>458 U.S., at 659, 102 S. Ct. 3294, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Like the majority, the Manufacturers focus on the fact that they cannot change their labels unilaterally\u2014 which distinguishes them from the brand-name-manufacturer defendant in <em>Wyeth. </em>They correctly point out that in <em>Wyeth </em>we concluded that the FDA\u2019s CBE regulation authorized the defendant to strengthen its warnings before receiving agency approval of its supplemental application describing the label change. 555 U.S., at 568-571, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51; see also 21 CFR \u00a7 314.70(c)(6). But the defendant\u2019s label change was contingent on FDA acceptance, as the FDA retained \u201cauthority to reject labeling changes made pursuant to the CBE regulation.\u201d <em>Wyeth, </em>555 U.S., at 571, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51. Thus, in the long run, a brand-name manufacturer\u2019s compliance with a state-law duty to warn required action by two actors: The brand-name manufacturer had to change the label and the FDA, upon reviewing the supplemental application, had to agree with the change.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The need for FDA approval of the label change did not make compliance with federal and state law impossible in every case. Instead, because the defendant bore the burden to show impossibility, we required it to produce \u201cclear evidence that the FDA would not have approved a change to [the] label.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">I would apply the same approach in these cases. State law, respondents allege, required the Manufacturers to provide a strengthened warning about the dangers of long-term meto-clopramide use.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Just like the brand-name manufacturer</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">[564 U.S. 637]</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">in <em>Wyeth, </em>the Manufacturers had available to them a mechanism for attempting to comply with their state-law duty to warn. Federal law thus \u201caccommodated\u201d the Manufacturers\u2019 state-law duties. See <em>ante, </em>at 625, n. 8, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 596. It was not necessarily impossible for the Manufacturers to comply with both federal and state law because, had they approached the FDA, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>FDA may well have agreed that a label change was necessary. Accordingly, as in <em>Wyeth, </em>I would require the Manufacturers to show that the FDA would not have approved a proposed label change. They have not made such a showing: They do \u201cnot argue that [they] attempted to give the kind of warning required by [state law] but [were] prohibited from doing so by the FDA.\u201d <em>Wyeth, </em>555 U.S., at 572, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">This is not to say that generic manufacturers could never show impossibility. If a generic-manufacturer defendant proposed a label change to the FDA but the FDA rejected the proposal, it would be impossible for that defendant to comply with a state-law duty to warn. Likewise, impossibility would be established if the FDA had not yet responded to a generic manufacturer\u2019s request for a label change at the time a plaintiffs injuries arose. A generic manufacturer might also show that the FDA had itself considered whether to request enhanced warnings in light of the evidence on which a plaintiffs claim rests but had decided to leave the warnings as is. (The Manufacturers make just such an argument in these cases. See, <em>e.g., </em>Brief for Petitioner Actavis et al. 11.) But these are questions of fact to be established through discovery. Because the burden of proving impossibility falls on the defendant, I would hold that federal law does not render it impossible for generic manufacturers to comply with a state-law duty to warn as a categorical matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">This conclusion flows naturally from the overarching principles governing our pre-emption doctrine. See <em>supra, </em>at 633, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 601. Our \u201crespect for the States as \u2018independent sovereigns</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">[564 U.S. 638]</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">in our federal system\u2019 leads us to assume that \u2018Congress does not cavalierly pre-empt state-law causes of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wyeth, </em>555 U.S., at 565-566, n. 3, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51 (quoting <em>Lohr, </em>518 U.S., at 485, 116 S. Ct. 2240, 135 L. Ed. 2d 700). It is for this reason that we hold defendants asserting impossibility to a \u201cdemanding\u201d standard. <em>Wyeth, </em>555 U.S., at 573, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51. This presumption against pre-emption has particular force when the Federal Government has afforded defendants a mechanism for complying with state law, even when that mechanism requires federal agency action. (The presumption has even greater force when federal law requires defendants to invoke that mechanism, as the majority assumes in these cases.) In such circumstances, I would hold, defendants will usually be unable to sustain their burden of showing impossibility if they have not even attempted to employ that mechanism. Any other approach threatens to infringe the States\u2019 authority over traditional matters of state interest\u2014such as the failure-to-warn claims here\u2014when Congress expressed no intent to preempt state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">The majority concedes that the Manufacturers might have been able to accomplish under federal law what state law requires. <em>Ante, </em>at 619, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 593. To reach the conclusion that the Manufacturers have nonetheless satisfied their burden to show impossibility, the majority invents a new pre-emption rule: \u201cThe question for \u2018impossibility\u2019 is whether the private party could <em>independently </em>do under federal law what state law requires of it.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 620, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 603-604 (emphasis added). Because the Manu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>facturers could not have changed their labels without the exercise of judgment by the FDA, the majority holds, compliance with both state and federal law was impossible in these cases. <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">[564 U.S. 639]</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The majority\u2019s new test has no basis in our precedents. The majority cites only <em>Wyeth </em>in support of its test. As discussed above, however, <em>Wyeth </em>does not stand for the proposition that it is impossible to comply with both federal and state law whenever federal agency approval is required. To the contrary, label changes by brand-name manufacturers such as Wyeth are subject to FDA review and acceptance. See <em>supra, </em>at 636-637, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 603-604. And, even if <em>Wyeth </em>could be characterized as turning on the fact that the brand-name manufacturer could change its label unilaterally, the possibility of unilateral action was, at most, a sufficient condition for rejecting the impossibility defense in that case. <em>Wyeth </em>did not hold that unilateral action is a necessary condition in every case.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">With so little support in our case law, the majority understandably turns to other rationales. None of the rationales that it offers, however, makes any sense. First, it offers a <em>reductio ad. absurdum: </em>If the possibility of FDA approval of a label change is sufficient to avoid conflict in these cases, it warns, as a \u201clogical conclusion\u201d so too would be the possibility that the FDA might rewrite its regulations or that Congress might amend the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. <em>Ante, </em>at 621, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 594. The logic of this conclusion escapes me. Conflict analysis necessarily turns on existing law. It thus would be ridiculous to conclude that federal and state law do not conflict on the ground that the defendant could have asked a federal agency or Congress to change the law. Here, by contrast, the Manufacturers\u2019 compliance with their state-law duty to warn did not require them to ask for a change in federal law, as the majority itself recognizes. See <em>ante, </em>at 620, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 593 (\u201c[F]ederal law would permit the Manufacturers to comply with the state labeling requirements if, and only</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">[564 U.S. 640]</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">if, the FDA and the brand-name manufacturer changed the brand-name label to do so\u201d). The FDA already afforded them a mechanism for attempting to comply with their state-law duties. Indeed, the majority assumes that FDA regulations <em>required </em>the Manufacturers to request a label change when they had \u201creasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a drug.\u201d 21 CFR \u00a7 201.57(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">Second, the majority suggests that any other approach would render conflict pre-emption \u201cillusory\u201d and \u201cmeaningless.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 620, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 593. It expresses concern that, without a robust view of what constitutes conflict, the Supremacy Clause would not have \u201cany force\u201d except in cases of express preemption. <em>Ante, </em>at 621, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 594. To the extent the majority\u2019s purported concern is driven by its <em>reductio ad absurdum, </em>see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number><em>ibid., </em>n. 6, that concern is itself illusory, for the reasons just stated. To the extent the majority is concerned that our traditionally narrow view of what constitutes impossibility somehow renders conflict pre-emption as a whole meaningless, that concern simply makes no sense: We have repeatedly recognized that conflict preemption may be found, even absent impossibility, where state law \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Crosby, </em>530 U.S., at 373, 120 S. Ct. 2288, 147 L. Ed. 2d 352 (internal quotation marks omitted); see, <em>e.g., Geier </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., </em>529 U.S. 861, 886, 120 S. Ct. 1913, 146 L. Ed. 2d 914 (2000); <em>Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N. A. </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>517 U.S. 25, 31, 116 S. Ct. 1103, 134 L.

The majority\u2019s expansive view of impossibility is thus unnecessary to prevent conflict pre-emption from losing all meaning.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">[564 U.S. 641]</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Third, a plurality of the Court adopts the novel theory that the Framers intended for the Supremacy Clause to operate as a so-called <em>non obstante </em>provision. See <em>ante, </em>at 621-623, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 594-595 (citing Nelson, Preemption, 86 Va. L. Rev. 225 (2000)). According to the plurality, <em>non obstante </em>provisions in statutes \u201cinstruc[t] courts not to apply the general presumption against implied repeals.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 622, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 594 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>ibid, </em>(stating that when a statute contains a <em>non ob-stante </em>provision, \u201c \u2018courts will be less inclined against recognizing repug-nancy in applying such statutes\u2019 \u201d (quoting J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 147, p. 199 (1891))). From this understanding of the Supremacy Clause, the plurality extrapolates the principle that \u201ccourts should not strain to find ways to reconcile federal law with seemingly conflicting state law <em>.\u2019\u2019Ante, </em>at 622, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">This principle would have been news to the Congress that enacted the Hatch-Waxman Amendments in 1984: Our precedents hold just the opposite. For more than half a century, we have directed courts to presume that congressional action does <em>not </em>supersede \u201cthe historic police powers of the States . . . unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S. Ct. 1146, 91 L. Ed. 1447 (1947); see also <em>Gade, </em>505 U.S., at 111-112, 112 S. Ct. 2374, 120 L. Ed. 2d 73 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). We apply this presumption against preemption both where Congress has spoken to the pre-emption question and where it has not. See <em>Wyeth, </em>555 U.S., at 566, n. 3, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51. In the context of express pre-emption, we read federal statutes whenever possible not to pre-empt state law. See <em>Altria Group, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number><em>Good, </em>555 U.S. 70, 77, 129 S. Ct. 538, 172 L. Ed. 2d 398 (2008) (\u201c[W]hen the text of a pre-emption clause is susceptible of more than one plausible reading, courts ordinarily \u2018accept the reading that disfavors pre-emption\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Dow Agrosciences LLC, </em>544 U.S. 431, 449, 125 S. Ct. 1788, 161 L. Ed. 2d 687 (2005))); see also <em>Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., </em>505 U.S. 504, 518, 112 S. Ct. 2608, 120 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1992). And, when the claim is that federal law impliedly</p>\n<p id=\"Agjg\">[564 U.S. 642]</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">pre-empts state law, we require a \u201cstrong\u201d showing of a conflict \u201cto overcome the presumption that state and local regulation . . . can constitutionally coexist with federal regulation.\u201d <em>Hillsborough County </em>v. <em>Automated-Medical Laboratories, Inc., </em>471 U.S. 707, 716, 105 S. Ct. 2371, 85 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The plurality\u2019s new theory of the Supremacy Clause is a direct assault on these precedents.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Whereas we have long presumed that federal law does not pre-empt, or repeal, state law, the plurality today reads the Supremacy Clause to operate as a provision instructing courts <em>\u201cnot </em>to apply the general presumption against implied repeals.\u201d Ante, at 622, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 594 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). And whereas we have long required evidence of a \u201cclear and manifest\u201d purpose to pre-empt, <em>Rice, </em>331 U.S., at 230, 67 S. Ct. 1146, 91 L. Ed. 1447, the plurality now instructs courts to \u201clook no further than the ordinary meaning of federal law\u201d before concluding that Congress must have intended to cast aside state law, <em>ante, </em>at 623, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 595 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">That the plurality finds it necessary to resort to this novel theory of the Supremacy Clause\u2014a theory advocated by no party or <em>amici </em>in these cases\u2014is telling. Proper application of the longstanding presumption <em>against </em>pre-emption compels the conclusion that federal law does not render compliance with state law impossible merely because it requires an actor to seek federal agency approval. When federal law provides actors with a mechanism for attempting to comply with their state-law duties, \u201crespect for the States as \u2018independent sovereigns in our federal system\u2019 \u201d should require those actors to attempt to comply with state law before</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">[564 U.S. 643]</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">being heard to complain that compliance with both laws was impossible. <em>Wyeth, </em>555 U.S., at 565-566, n. 3, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51 (quoting <em>Lohr, </em>518 U.S., at 485, 116 S. Ct. 2240, 135 L. Ed. 2d 700).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">Today\u2019s decision leads to so many absurd consequences that I cannot fathom that Congress would have intended to pre-empt state law in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">First, the majority\u2019s pre-emption analysis strips generic-drug consumers of compensation when they are injured by inadequate warnings. \u201cIf Congress had intended to deprive injured parties of [this] long available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>form of compensation, it surely would have expressed that intent more clearly.\u201d <em>Bates, </em>544 U.S., at 449, 126 S. Ct. 1788, 161 L. Ed. 2d 687. Given the longstanding existence of product liability actions, including for failure to warn, \u201c[i]t is difficult to believe that Congress would, without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse for those injured by illegal conduct.\u201d <em>Silkwood, </em>464 U.S., at 251, 104 S. Ct. 615, 78 L. Ed. 2d 443; see also <em>Bruesewitz </em>v. <em>Wyeth LLC, </em>562 U.S. 223, 240, 131 S. Ct. 1068, 179 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2011) (noting our previously expressed \u201cdoubt that Congress would quietly preempt product-liability claims without providing a federal substitute\u201d). In concluding that Congress silently immunized generic manufacturers from all failure-to-warn claims, the majority disregards our previous hesitance to infer congressional intent to effect such a sweeping change in traditional state-law remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">As the majority itself admits, a drug consumer\u2019s right to compensation for inadequate warnings now turns on the happenstance of whether her pharmacist filled her prescription with a brand-name drug or a generic. If a consumer takes a brand-name drug, she can sue the manufacturer for inadequate warnings under our opinion in <em>Wyeth. </em>If, however, she takes a generic drug, as occurs 75 percent of the time, she now has no right to sue. The majority offers no reason to think\u2014apart from its new articulation of the impossibility standard\u2014that Congress would have intended such an arbitrary distinction. In some States, pharmacists must dispense</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">[564 U.S. 644]</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">generic drugs absent instruction to the contrary from a consumer\u2019s physician. Even when consumers can request brand-name drugs, the price of the brand-name drug or the consumers\u2019 insurance plans may make it impossible to do so. As a result, in many cases, consumers will have no ability to preserve their state-law right to recover for injuries caused by inadequate warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Second, the majority\u2019s decision creates a gap in the parallel federal-state regulatory scheme in a way that could have troubling consequences for drug safety. As we explained in <em>Wyeth, </em>\u201c[s]tate tort suits uncover unknown drug hazards and provide incentives for drug manufacturers to disclose safety risks promptly.\u201d 555 U.S., at 579, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51. Thus, we recognized, \u201cstate law offers an additional, and important, layer of consumer protection that complements FDA regulation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Today\u2019s decision eliminates the traditional state-law incentives for generic manufacturers to monitor and disclose safety risks. When a generic drug has a brand-name equivalent on the market, the brand-name manufacturer will remain incentivized to uncover safety risks. But brand-name manufacturers often leave the market once generic versions are available, see <em>supra, </em>at 629-630, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 599, meaning that there will be no manufacturer subject to failure-to-warn liability. As to those generic drugs, there will be no \u201cadditional. . . layer of consumer protection.\u201d <em>Wyeth, </em>555 U.S., at 579, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">Finally, today\u2019s decision undoes the core principle of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments that generic and brand-name drugs are the \u201csame\u201d in nearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>all respects.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See Brief for Rep. Henry A. Waxman as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>9. The majority pins the expansion of the generic-drug market on \u201cthe special, and different, regulation of generic drugs,\u201d which allows</p>\n<p id=\"AlGv\">[564 U.S. 645]</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">generic manufacturers to produce their drugs more cheaply. <em>Ante, </em>at 626, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 597. This tells only half the story. The expansion of the market for generic drugs has also flowed from the increased acceptance of, and trust in, generic drugs by consumers, physicians, and state legislators alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Today\u2019s decision introduces a critical distinction between brand-name and generic drugs. Consumers of brand-name drugs can sue manufacturers for inadequate warnings; consumers of generic drugs cannot. These divergent liability rules threaten to reduce consumer demand for generics, at least among consumers who can afford brand-name drugs. They may pose \u201can ethical dilemma\u201d for prescribing physicians. Brief for American Medical Association et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>29. And they may well cause the States to rethink their longstanding efforts to promote generic use through generic substitution laws. See Brief for National Conference of State Legislators as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>15 (state generic substitution laws \u201chave proceeded on the premise that . . . generic drugs are not, from citizens\u2019 perspective, materially different from brand ones, except for the lower price\u201d). These consequences are directly at odds with the Hatch-Waxman Amendments\u2019 goal of increasing consumption of generic drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Nothing in the Court\u2019s opinion convinces me that, in enacting the requirement that generic labels match their corresponding brand-name labels, Congress intended these absurd results. The Court certainly has not shown that such was the <em>\u201cclear and manifest </em>purpose of Congress.\u201d <em>Wyeth, </em>555 U.S., at 565, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). To the contrary, because federal law affords generic manufacturers a mechanism for attempting to comply with their state-law duties to warn, I would hold that federal law does not categorically pre-empt state-law failure-to-warn claims against generic manufacturers. Especially in light of the presumption against preemption, the burden should fall on generic manufacturers to show that compliance was impossible</p>\n<p id=\"aa4-dedup-0\">[564 U.S. 646]</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">on the particular facts of their case. By holding that the \u201cpossibility of <em>possibility </em>\u201d is insufficient to \u201cdefea[t]\u201d preemption in these cases, <em>ante, </em>at 625, n. 8, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 596, the Court contorts our pre-emption doctrine and exempts defendants from their burden to establish impossibility. With respect, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-14\">.

At the time respondents\u2019 cause of action arose, the PDA did not have authority to require a brand-name manufacturer to change its label. (It received that authority in 2007.
