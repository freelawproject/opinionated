The Federal Communications Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>sion (FCC or Commission) as <em>amicus </em>curiae<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contends that its regulations require the incumbent provider to do so if the facilities are to be used for interconnection: to link the incumbent provider\u2019s telephone network with the competitor\u2019s network for the mutual exchange of traffic. We defer to the Commission\u2019s views and reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act), 110 Stat. 56, imposed a number of duties on incumbent providers of local telephone service in order to facilitate market entry by competitors. <em>AT&amp;T Corp. </em>v. <em>Iowa Utilities Bd., </em>525 U.S. 366, 371, 119 S. Ct. 721, 142 L. Ed. 2d 834 (1999). The incumbent local exchange carriers (LECs) owned the local exchange networks: the physical equipment necessary to receive, properly route, and deliver phone calls among customers. <em>Verizon Communications Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>535 U.S. 467, 490, 122 S. Ct. 1646, 152 L. Ed. 2d 701 (2002). Before the 1996 Act, a new, competitive LEC could not compete with an incumbent</p>\n<p id=\"A4\">[564 U.S. 54]</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">carrier without basically replicating the incumbent\u2019s entire existing network. Ib<em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The 1996 Act addressed that barrier to market entry by requiring incumbent LECs to share their networks with competitive LECs in several ways, two of which are relevant here. First, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 251(c)(3) requires incumbent LECs to lease \u201con an unbundled <em>basis\u201d\u2014i.e., </em>a la carte\u2014 network elements specified by the Commission. This makes it easier for a competitor to create its own network without having to build every element from scratch. In identifying which network elements must be available for unbundled lease under \u00a7 251(c)(3), the Commission is required to consider whether access is \u201cnecessary\u201d and whether failing to provide access would \u201cimpair\u201d a com petitor\u2019s provision of service. \u00a7 251(d)(2). Second, \u00a7 251(c)(2) mandates that incumbent LECs \u201cprovide . . . interconnection\u201d between their networks and competitive LECs\u2019 facilities. This ensures that customers on a competitor\u2019s network can call customers on the incumbent\u2019s network, and vice versa. The interconnection duty is independent of the unbundling rules and not subject to impairment analysis. It is undisputed that both unbundled network elements and interconnection must be provided at cost-based rates. See \u00a7 252(d)(1); Brief for Petitioner in No. 10-313, p. 28; Brief for Petitioners in No. 10-329, p. 7; Brief for Respondent 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">These cases concern incumbent LECs\u2019 obligation to share existing \u201centrance facilities\u201d with competitive LECs.  Entrance facilities are the transmission facilities (typically wires or cables) that connect competitive LECs\u2019 networks with incumbent LECs\u2019 networks. The FCC recently adopted a regulation specifying that entrance facilities are not among the network elements that \u00a7 251(c)(3) requires incumbents to lease to competitors on an unbundled basis at cost-based rates. See 47 CFR \u00a7 51.319(e)(2)(i) (2005). The Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>sion noted, however, that it \u201cd[id] not alter the right of competitive LECs to obtain interconnection facilities pursuant</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">[564 U.S. 55]</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">to section 251(c)(2).\u201d <em>In re Unbundled Access to Network Elements, </em>20 FCC Rcd. 2533, 2611, \u00b6 140 (2005) <em>(Triennial Review Remand. Order).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The specific issue here is whether respondent, Michigan Bell Telephone Company, d/b/a AT&amp;T Michigan (AT&amp;T), must lease existing entrance facilities to competitive LECs at cost-based rates. The FCC interprets its regulations to require AT&amp;T to do so for the purpose of interconnection. We begin by reviewing the Commission\u2019s recent actions regarding entrance facilities and then explain the particular dispute that is before us today.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">In 2003, the FCC decided, contrary to its previous orders, that incumbent LECs were not obligated to provide cost-based unbundled access to entrance facilities under \u00a7 251(c)(3). <em>In re Review of Section 251 Unbundling Obligations of Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers, </em>18 FCC Rcd. 16978, 17202-17205, \u00b6\u00b6 365-367 (2003) <em>(Triennial Review Order). </em>Explaining that its previous approach had been \u201cmisguided\u201d and \u201coverly broad,\u201d <em>id., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 366, 365, the Commission concluded that entrance facilities were not subject to the unbundling requirement because they are not network elements at all. See <em>id., </em>\u00b6 366 (entrance facilities \u201cexist <em>outside </em>the incumbent LEC\u2019s local network\u201d). The Commission therefore did not conduct an impairment analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">The FCC emphasized, however, the limits of this ruling. Entrance facilities are used for two purposes: interconnection and backhauling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It expressly \u201cd[id] not alter\u201d an incumbent</p>\n<p id=\"Apt\">[564 U.S. 56]</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">LEC\u2019s obligation under \u00a7 251(c)(2) to provide \u201cfacilities in order to \u2018interconnect with the incumbent LEC\u2019s network.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 366 (brackets omitted). Thus, although the Commission specified that \u00a7 251(c)(3) did not require any unbundled leasing of entrance facilities, it determined in practical effect only that \u201cincumbent LECs [were not obligated] to un-bundle [entrance facilities] for the purpose of backhauling traffic.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">On direct review, the D. C. Circuit questioned the Commission\u2019s determination that entrance facilities are not network elements under \u00a7 251(c)(3), but found the agency rule-making record insufficient and remanded to the Commission for further consideration. See <em>United States Telecom Assn. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>359 F.3d 554, 586, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 925, 125 S. Ct. 313, 160 L. Ed. 2d 223 (2004). The court noted that if entrance facilities were in fact \u201c \u2018network elements,\u2019 \u201d then \u201can analysis of impairment would presumably follow.\u201d 359 F.3d, at 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">In 2005, the Commission responded. See <em>Triennial Review Remand. Order </em>\u00b6\u00b6 136-141. The Commission retreated from its view that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>entrance facilities are not network elements but adhered to its previous position that  cost-based unbundled access to them need not be provided under \u00a7 251(c)(3). <em>Id., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 137-138. Treating entrance facilities as network elements, the Commission concluded that competitive LECs are not impaired without access to them. <em>Ibid. </em>The Commission again emphasized that it \u201cd[id] not alter the right of competitive LECs to obtain interconnection facilities pursuant to section 251(c)(2).\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">In the wake of the <em>Triennial Review Remand Order, </em>AT&amp;T notified competitive LECs that it would no longer provide entrance facilities at cost-based rates for either backhauling or interconnection, but would instead charge higher</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">[564 U.S. 57]</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">rates. Competitive LECs complained to the Michigan Public Service Commission (PSC) that AT&amp;T was unlawfully abrogating their right to cost-based interconnection under \u00a7 251(c)(2). The Michigan PSC agreed with the competitive LECs and ordered AT&amp;T to continue providing entrance facilities for interconnection at cost-based rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">AT&amp;T challenged the Michigan PSC\u2019s ruling in the District Court, which, relying on the <em>Triennial Review Remand Order, </em>ruled in AT&amp;T\u2019s favor. The Michigan PSC and several competitive LECs, including petitioner Talk America, Inc., appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed over a dissent. <em>Michigan Bell Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Covad Communications Co., </em>597 F.3d 370 (2010). At the court\u2019s invitation, the FCC filed a brief as <em>amicus curiae, </em>arguing that the <em>Tiennial Review Remand Order </em>did not change incumbent LECs\u2019 interconnection obligations, including the obligation to lease entrance facilities for interconnection. The Sixth Circuit declined to defer to the FCC\u2019s views, 597 F.3d, at 375, n. 6, and also expressly disagreed with the Seventh and Eighth Circuits, <em>id., </em>at 384-386 (discussing <em>Illinois Bell Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Box, </em>526 F.3d 1069 (2008), <em>and Southwestern Bell Tel., L. P. </em>v. <em>Missouri Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>530 F.3d 676 (2008)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">We granted certiorari, 562 U.S. 1104, 131 S. Ct. 818, 178 L.

We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-14\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b148-15\">No statute or regulation squarely addresses whether an incumbent LEC must provide access to entrance facilities at cost-based rates as part of its interconnection duty</p>\n<p id=\"ACC\">[564 U.S. 58]</p>\n<p id=\"b148-16\">under \u00a7 251(c)(2).  According to the statute, each incumbent LEC has:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-18\">\u201cThe duty to provide, for the facilities and equipment of any requesting telecommunications carrier, interconnection with the local exchange carrier\u2019s network\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-19\">\u201c(A) for the transmission and routing of telephone exchange service and exchange access;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-20\">\u201c(B) at any technically feasible point within the carrier\u2019s network;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-21\">\u201c(C) that is at least equal in quality to that provided by the local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>exchange carrier to itself or to any subsidiary, affiliate, or any other party to which the carrier provides interconnection; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\">\u201c(D) on rates, terms, and conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement and the requirements of this section and section 252 of this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Nothing in that language expressly addresses entrance facilities. Nor does any regulation do so. See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>22, n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">AT&amp;T contends that the statute makes clear that an incumbent LEC need not provide access to <em>any </em>facilities\u2014much less entrance facilities\u2014to provide interconnection. The company points out that \u00a7 251(c)(2) does not mention incumbent LECs\u2019 facilities, but rather mandates only that incumbent LECs provide interconnection \u201cfor the facilities and equipment of any [competing] carrier.\u201d In contrast, AT&amp;T notes, \u00a7 251(c)(3) requires that incumbent LECs provide unbundled \u201caccess to [their] network elements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">We do not find the statute so clear.  Although \u00a7 251(c)(2) does not expressly require that incumbent LECs lease facilities to provide interconnection, it also does not expressly excuse them from doing so. The statute says nothing about what an incumbent LEC must do to \u201cprovide . . . interconnection.\u201d \u00a7 251(c)(2). \u201c[T]he facilities and equipment of</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">[564 U.S. 59]</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">any [competing] carrier\u201d identifies the equipment that an incumbent LEC must allow to interconnect, but it does not specify what the incumbent LEC must do to make the interconnection possible. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">In the absence of any unambiguous statute or regulation, we turn to the FCC\u2019s interpretation of its regulations in its <em>amicus </em>brief. See, <em>e.g., Chase Bank USA, N. A. </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em>562 U.S. 195, 207, 131 S. Ct. 871, 178 L. Ed. 2d 716 (2011). As we reaffirmed earlier this Term, we defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its regulations, even in a legal brief, unless the interpretation is \u201c \u2018plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s]\u2019 \u201d or there is any other \u201c \u2018reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency\u2019s fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 208, 209, 131 S. Ct. 871, 178 L. Ed. 2d 716 (quoting <em>Auer </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>519 U.S. 452, 461, 462, 117 S. Ct. 905, 137 L. Ed. 2d 79 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">The Commission contends that its regulations require AT&amp;T to provide access at cost-based rates to its existing entrance facilities for the purpose of interconnection. The Commission\u2019s interpretation proceeds in three steps. First,  an incumbent LEC must lease \u201ctechnically feasible\u201d facilities for interconnection. Second, entrance facilities are among the facilities that an incumbent must make available for interconnection, if technically feasible. Third, it is technically feasible to provide access to the particular entrance facilities at issue in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b149-14\">The Commission first contends that an incumbent LEC must lease, at cost-based rates, any requested facilities for obtaining interconnection with the incumbent LEC\u2019s network, unless it is technically infeasible to do so. Section 251(c)(2) mandates that an incumbent LEC provide interconnection, at cost-based rates, \u201cat any tech<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>nically feasible point within the carrier\u2019s network.\u201d The FCC has long construed \u00a7 251(c)(2) to require incumbent LECs to provide, at cost-based</p>\n<p id=\"a5l-dedup-0\">[564 U.S. 60]</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">rates, \u201cany technically feasible method of obtaining interconnection ... at a particular point.\u201d 47 CFR \u00a7 51.321(a) (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The requirement in \u00a7 51.321(a) to provide a \u201cmethod of obtaining interconnection,\u201d the Commission argues, encompasses a duty to lease an existing facility to a competing LEC. When the Commission originally promulgated \u00a7 51.321(a), it explained that incumbent LECs would be required to \u201cadapt their facilities to interconnection\u201d and to \u201caccept the novel use of, and modification to, [their] network facilities.\u201d <em>In re Implementation of Local Competition Provisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, </em>11 FCC Rcd. 15499, 15605, \u00b6 202 (1996) <em>(Local Competition Order). </em>Since then, as AT&amp;T and its <em>amici </em>concede, incumbent LECs have commonly leased certain facilities at cost-based prices to accommodate interconnection. See Brief for Respondent 28-29; Brief for United States Telecom Association et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>33-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">As additional support for its assertion that incumbent LECs are obligated to lease facilities, the FCC highlights  the examples in \u00a7 51.321(b) of \u201c[technically feasible methods of obtaining interconnection,\u201d which include \u201c[m]eet point interconnection arrangements.\u201d In a meet-point arrangement, an incumbent LEC \u201caccommodates]\u201d interconnection by building a transmission facility from its network to a designated point, where it connects with the competitor\u2019s corresponding transmission facility. <em>Local Competition Order </em>\u00b6 553. Compared to that requirement, the Commission argues, the obligation to lease existing facilities for interconnection is quite modest.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Next,  the Commission contends that existing entrance facilities are among the facilities that an incumbent LEC must lease for interconnection. According to the FCC, the <em>Triennial Review Remand Order </em>adopted a regulatory definition that reestablished that entrance facilities are part of</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">[564 U.S. 61]</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">an incumbent LEC\u2019s network. See \u00b6 137; see also 47 CFR \u00a7 51.319(e). The end of every entrance facility is therefore a \u201cpoint within [an incumbent] carrier\u2019s network\u201d at which a competing LEC could request interconnection, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 251(c)(2), and each entrance facility potentially provides a \u201ctechnically feasible method of obtaining interconnection,\u201d 47 CFR \u00a7 51.321(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">Finally, the FCC contends that providing access to the entrance facilities here for interconnection purposes is technically feasible.  Under the Commission\u2019s regulations, an incumbent LEC bears the burden of showing that a requested method or point of interconnection is technically infeasible. See 47 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 51.305(e), 51.321(d); see also \u00a7\u00a7 51.305(d), 51.321(c) (previously successful interconnection is \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of technical feasibility). AT&amp;T does not dispute technical feasibility here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The FCC\u2019s interpretation is not \u201cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the <em>regulation[s].\" Auer, supra, </em>at 461, 117 S. Ct. 905, 137 L. Ed. 2d 79 (internal quotation marks omitted). First, we disagree with AT&amp;T\u2019s argument that entrance facilities are not a part of</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">[564 U.S. 62]</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">incumbent LECs\u2019 networks. Indeed, the Commission\u2019s view on this question is more than reasonable; it is certainly not plainly erroneous. The <em>Triennial Review Remand Order </em>responded to the D. C. Circuit\u2019s decision questioning the Commission\u2019s earlier finding that entrance facilities are not network elements.  It revised the definition of dedicated transport\u2014a type of network element\u2014to include entrance facilities. <em>Triennial Review Remand Order </em>\u00b6\u00b6 136-137; see 47 CFR \u00a7 51.319(e)(1) (defining dedicated transport to include \u201cincumbent LEC transmission facilities . . . between wire centers or switches owned by incumbent LECs and switches owned by [competing] carriers\u201d). Given that revised definition, it is perfectly sensible to conclude that entrance facilities are a part of incumbent LECs\u2019 networks.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Second, we are not persuaded by AT&amp;T\u2019s argument that the Commission\u2019s views conflict with the definition of interconnection in \u00a7 51.5. That regulation provides:  \u201cInterconnection is the linking of two networks for the mutual exchange of traffic. This term does not include the transport and termination of traffic.\u201d AT&amp;T focuses on the definition\u2019s exclusion of \u201ctransport and termination of traffic.\u201d An entrance facility is a transport facility, AT&amp;T argues, and it makes no sense to require an incumbent LEC to furnish a transport facility for interconnection when the definition of interconnection expressly excludes transport.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">We think AT&amp;T reads too much into the exclusion of \u201ctransport.\u201d  The regulation cannot possibly mean that no transport can occur across an interconnection facility, as that would directly conflict with the statutory language. See \u00a7 251(c)(2) (requiring \u201cinterconnection . . . for the transmission and routing of [local] telephone exchange service\u201d). The very reason for interconnection is the \u201cmutual exchange of traffic.\u201d 47 CFR \u00a7 51.5; see also <em>Competitive Telecommunications Assn. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>117 F.3d 1068, 1071-1072 (CA8 1997) (\u201c[T]he transmission and routing of telephone exchange service\u201d is \u201cwhat the interconnection, the physical link, would be used for\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">[564 U.S. 63]</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">The better reading of the regulation is that it merely reflects that the \u201ctransport and termination of traffic\u201d is subject to different regulatory treatment than interconnection. Compensation for transport and termination\u2014that is, for delivering local telephone calls placed by another carrier\u2019s customer\u2014is governed by separate statutory provisions and regulations. See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 251(b)(5), 252(d)(2); 47 CFR \u00a7 51.701. The Commission explains that a competitive LEC typically pays one fee for inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>connection\u2014\u201cjust for having the link\u201d\u2014and then an additional fee for the transport and termination of telephone calls.

Entrance facilities, at least when used for the mutual exchange of traffic, seem to us to fall comfortably within the definition of interconnection.

Ct. 905, 137 L. Ed. 2d 79. We are not faced with a <em>post-hoc </em>rationalization by Commission counsel of agency action that is under judicial review. See <em>ibid.; </em>see also <em>Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 168-169, 83 S. Ct. 239, 9 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1962) (  \u201cThe courts may not accept appellate counsel\u2019s <em>post hoc </em>rationalizations for agency action; <em>[SEC v.] Chenery [Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 67 S. Ct. 1575, 91 L. Ed. 1995 (1947),] requires that an agency\u2019s discretionary order be upheld, if at all, on the same basis articulated in the order by the agency itself\u2019). And although the FCC concedes that it is advancing a novel interpretation of its longstanding interconnection regulations,  novelty alone is not a reason to refuse deference. The Commission explains that the issue in these cases did not arise until recently\u2014when it initially eliminated unbundled access to entrance facilities in the <em>Triennial Review Order. </em>Until then, the Commission says, a competitive LEC typically would elect to lease a cost-priced entrance facility under \u00a7 251(c)(3) since entrance facilities leased under \u00a7 251(c)(3) could be used for any pur<em>pose\u2014i.e., </em>both interconnection and backhauling\u2014but entrance facilities leased under \u00a7 251(c)(2) can be used only for interconnection. We see no reason to doubt this explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">AT&amp;T suggests that the Commission is attempting to require under \u00a7 251(c)(2) what courts have prevented it from requiring under \u00a7 251(c)(3) and what the Commission itself said was <em>not </em>required in the <em>Triennial Review Remand. Order. </em>Tr. of Oral Arg. 50 (\u201c[T]his is a rear guard effort to preserve [cost-based] pricing for things that the [C]ommission has said should no longer be available . . . at [such] pricing\u201d). We do not think that AT&amp;T is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">To begin with, AT&amp;T\u2019s accusation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>does not square with the regulatory history. The Commission was not compelled to eliminate the obligation to lease unbundled entrance facilities at cost-based rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">[564 U.S. 65]</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">It is true that, prior to the <em>Triennial Review </em>orders, the Commission twice unsuccessfully attempted to impose sweeping unbundling requirements on incumbent LECs. See <em>Local Competition Order </em>\u00b6 278; <em>In re Implementation of Local Competition Provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, </em>15 FCC Rcd. 3696, 3771-3904, \u00b6\u00b6 162-464 (1999); see also 47 CFR \u00a7 51.319 (1997); \u00a7 51.319 (2000). Each time, the Commission\u2019s efforts were rejected for taking an unreasonably broad view of \u201cimpair [ment]\u201d under \u00a7 251(d)(2). See <em>Iowa Utilities Bd., </em>525 U.S., at 392, 119 S. Ct. 721, 142 L. Ed. 2d 834; <em>United States Telecom Assn. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>290 F.3d 415, 421-428 (CADC 2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 940, 123 S. Ct. 1571, 155 L. Ed. 2d 344 (2003). In the <em>Triennial Review Order, </em>the Commission once again reinterpreted the \u201cimpair\u201d standard and revised the list of network elements that incumbents must provide unbundled to competitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The Commission\u2019s initial decision to eliminate the obligation to unbundle entrance facilities, however, was not a result of the narrower view of impairment mandated by this Court and the D. C. Circuit. Instead, the Commission determined that entrance facilities need not be provided on an unbundled basis under \u00a7 251(c)(3) on the novel ground that they are not network elements at all\u2014something no court had ever suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Moreover, since its initial decision to eliminate the unbundling obligation for entrance facilities, the Commission has been committed to that position. When the D. C. Circuit questioned the Commission\u2019s finding that entrance facilities are not network elements, the Commission responded by observing that the court \u201cdid not reject our conclusion that incumbent LECs need not unbundle entrance facilities, only the analysis through which we reached that conclusion.\u201d <em>Triennial Review Remand. Order </em>\u00b6 137. The Commission then found another way to support that same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">More importantly, AT&amp;T\u2019s characterization of what the Commission has done, and is doing, is inaccurate.  The <em>Triennial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">[564 U.S. 66]</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\"><em>Review </em>orders eliminated incumbent LECs\u2019 obligation under \u00a7 251(c)(3) to provide unbundled access to entrance facilities. But the FCC emphasized in both orders that it \u201cd[id] not alter\u201d the obligation on incumbent LECs under \u00a7 251(c)(2) to provide facilities for interconnection purposes. <em>Triennial Review Order </em>\u00b6 366; <em>Triennial Review Remand. Order </em>\u00b6 140. Because entrance facilities are used for back-hauling and interconnection purposes, the FCC effectively eliminated only unbundled access to entrance facilities for backhauling purposes\u2014a nuance it expressly noted in the first <em>Triennial Review </em>order. <em>Triennial Review Order </em>\u00b6 365. That distinction is neither unusual nor ambiguous.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In these cases, the Commission is simply explaining the interconnection obligation that it left undisturbed in the <em>T'iennial Review </em>orders. We see no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>conflict between the <em>Triennial Review </em>orders and the Commission\u2019s views expressed here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">We are not concerned that the <em>Triennial Review Remand Order </em>did not expressly distinguish between back-hauling and interconnection, though AT&amp;T makes much of that fact. AT&amp;T argues that the Commission\u2019s holding in the <em>Triennial Review Remand. Order </em>is broader than that in the <em>Trien-nial Review Order. </em>In AT&amp;T\u2019s view, the Commission</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">[564 U.S. 67]</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">concluded in the <em>Triennial Review Remand Order </em>that competitors are not impaired if they lack cost-based access to entrance facilities for backhauling <em>or </em>interconnection.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">There are two flaws with AT&amp;T\u2019s reasoning. First, as we have discussed, the <em>Triennial Review Remand-Order </em>reinstated the ultimate conclusion of the <em>Ti'iennial Review Order </em>and changed only \u201cthe analysis through which [it] reached that conclusion.\u201d Trie<em>nnial Review Remand-Order </em>\u00b6 137. Second,  unlike \u00a7 251(c)(3)\u2019s unbundling obligation, \u00a7 251(c)(2)\u2019s interconnection obligation does not require the Commission to consider impairment. As the dissent below observed, it would be surprising indeed if the FCC had taken the novel step of incorporating impairment into interconnection without comment. 597 F.3d, at 389 (opinion of Sutton, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"pAsi\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"55\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASkAAAA3AQAAAAB4SYFwAAAApUlEQVR4nO2UMQ7CMAxFX9wMDEiMlVhg5xIg9SAcgQMwlJtwLEZOUBWJATFgRntwpA4dQIq35/+SeEiSlAl1kSkWVK1qv6qNvhOCANx8EsL8sz0XW2vEIMDgggIIsPJPOoYMLE9HS2LIQNOeLYlBADp3TgFU9bNTqxB6Ad6Hva0vgKqOw8Y2CKEX4JHcNDEIsL5fLYlBgPxy48Qw7w1J9Yuu2t9qX+6pbI89jRNYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"297\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The FCC as <em>amicus curiae </em>has advanced a reasonable interpretation of its regulations, and we defer to its views.

A. </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em>562 U.S. 195, 203, 131 S. Ct. 871, 178 L. Ed. 2d 716 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b147-15\">. Although the parties and their <em>amici </em>disagree over the precise definition of backhauling, they all appear to agree that  backhauling is important to competitive LECs and occurs when a competitive LEC uses an entrance facility to transport traffic from a leased portion of an incumbent network to the competitor\u2019s own facilities. Backhauling does not involve the exchange of traffic between incumbent and competitive networks. See, <em>e.g., </em>Brief for Petitioners in No. 10-329, p. 25; Brief for United States Telecom Association et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>32. It thus differs from interconnection\u2014\u201cthe linking of two networks for the mutual exchange of traffic.\u2019\u2019 47 CFR \u00a7 51.5 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b148-22\">.

These cases concern only existing entrance facilities, and the Commission expressly declines to address whether it reads its regulations to require incumbent LECs to build new entrance facilities for interconnection. Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>25, n. 7. The Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>suggests here, as it has before, that additional considerations of cost or reasonableness might be appropriate if a competitive LEC were to request that an incumbent LEC build new entrance facilities for interconnection. <em>Ibid. </em>(noting that the Commission\u2019s Wireline Competition Bureau has declined to require an incumbent LEC to bear the entire cost of building new entrance facilities); see also <em>Local Competition Order </em>\u00b6 553 (explaining with respect to meet-point arrangements that \u201cthe parties and state commissions are in a better position than the Commission to determine the appropriate distance that would constitute the required reasonable accommodation of interconnection\"). We express no view on the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b152-13\">. There is no merit to AT&amp;T\u2019s assertion that the FCC is improperly amending  the list of \u201c[t]echnically feasible methods of obtaining interconnection\u201d set forth in 47 CFR \u00a7 51.321(b). By its own terms, that list is nonexhaustive. See \u00a7 51.321(b) (\u201c[t]echnically feasible methods of obtaining interconnection . . . include, but are not limited to,\u201d the listed examples); see also \u00a7 51.321(a) (\u201c[A]n incumbent LEC shall provide . . . <em>any </em>technically feasible method of obtaining interconnection\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b153-13\">. The Commission has long recognized that  a single facility can be used for different functions and that its regulatory treatment can vary depending on its use.

The parties and their <em>amici </em>dispute whether an incumbent LEC has any way of knowing how a competitive LEC is using an entrance facility. This technical factual dispute simply underscores the appropriateness of deferring to the FCC.  So long as the Commission is acting within the scope of its delegated authority and in accordance with prescribed procedures, it has greater expertise and stands in a better position than this Court to make the technical and policy judgments necessary to administer the complex regulatory program at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b154-12\">SEPARATE OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b154-13\">Justice Scalia,</author>\n<p id=\"AUE\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">I join the opinion of the Court. I would reach the same result even without benefit of the rule that we will defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations, a rule in recent years attributed to our opinion in <em>Auer </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>519 U.S. 452, 461, 117 S. Ct. 905, 137 L. Ed. 2d 79 (1997), though it first appeared in our jurisprudence more than half a century earlier, see <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., </em>325 U.S. 410, 65 S. Ct. 1215, 89 L. Ed. 1700 (1945). In this suit I have no need to rely on <em>Auer </em>deference, because I believe the FCC\u2019s interpretation is the fairest reading of the orders in question. Most cogently, \u00b6 140 of the <em>Triennial Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-16\">[564 U.S. 68]</p>\n<p id=\"b154-17\"><em>Remand. Order </em>serves no purpose unless one accepts (as AT&amp;T does not) the distinction between backhauling and interconnection that is referred to in footnotes to \u00b6\u00b6 138 and 141 of the order. 20 FCC Red. 2533, 2610-2612 (2005). The order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>would have been clearer, to be sure, if the distinction had been made in a footnote to \u00b6 140 itself, but the distinction is there, and without it \u00b6 140 has no point.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">It is comforting to know that I would reach the Court\u2019s result even without <em>Auer. </em>For while I have in the past uncritically accepted that rule, I have become increasingly doubtful of its validity. On the surface, it seems to be a natural corollary\u2014indeed, an <em>a fortiori </em>application\u2014of the rule that we will defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute it is charged with implementing, see <em>Chevron U. S. A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984). But it is not. When Congress enacts an imprecise statute that it commits to the implementation of an executive agency, it has no control over that implementation (except, of course, through further, more precise, legislation). The legislative and executive functions are not combined. But when an agency promulgates an imprecise rule, it leaves <em>to itself </em>the implementation of that rule, and thus the initial determination of the rule\u2019s meaning. And though the adoption of a rule is an exercise of the executive rather than the legislative power, a properly adopted rule has fully the effect of law. It seems contrary to fundamental principles of separation of powers to permit the person who promulgates a law to interpret it as well. \u201cWhen the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or in the same body of magistrates, there can be no liberty; because apprehensions may arise, lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws, to execute them in a tyrannical manner.\u201d Montesquieu, Spirit of the Laws bk. XI, ch. 6, pp. 151-152 (O. Piest ed., T. Nugent trans\u00ed. 1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Deferring to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute does not encourage Congress, out of a desire to expand its power,</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">[564 U.S. 69]</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">to enact vague statutes; the vagueness effectively cedes power to the Executive. By contrast, deferring to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own rule encourages the agency to enact vague rules which give it the power, in future adjudications, to do what it pleases. This frustrates the notice and predictability purposes of rulemaking, and promotes arbitrary government. The seeming inappropriateness of <em>Auer </em>deference is especially evident in cases such as these, involving an agency that has repeatedly been rebuked in its attempts to expand the statute beyond its text, and has repeatedly sought new means to the same ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">There are undoubted advantages to <em>Auer </em>deference. It makes the job of a reviewing court much easier, and since it usually produces affirmance of the agency\u2019s view without conflict in the Circuits, it imparts (once the agency has spoken to clarify the regulation) certainty and predictability to the administrative process. The defects of <em>Auer </em>deference, and the alternatives to it, are fully explored in Manning, Constitutional Structure and Judicial Deference to Agency Interpretations of Agency Rules, 96 Colum. L. Rev. 612 (1996). We have not been asked to reconsider <em>Auer </em>in the present cases. When we are, I will be receptive to doing so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
