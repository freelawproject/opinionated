The rules and standards for determining when a State does or does not have jurisdiction over an absent party have been unclear because of decades-old questions left open in <em>Asahi Metal Industry Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., </em>480 U.S. 102, 107 S. Ct. 1026, 94 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">Here, the Supreme Court of New Jersey, relying in part on <em>Asahi, </em>held that New Jersey\u2019s courts can exercise jurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer of a product so long as the manufacturer \u201cknows or reasonably should know that its products are distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead to those products being sold in any of the fifty states.\u201d <em>Nicastro </em>v. <em>McIntyre Machinery America, Ltd., </em>201 N.J. 48, 76, 77, 987 A.2d 575, 591, 592 (2010). Applying that test, the court concluded that a British manufacturer of scrap metal machines was subject to jurisdiction in New Jersey, even though at no time had it advertised in, sent goods to, or in any relevant sense targeted the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">That decision cannot be sustained. Although the New Jersey Supreme Court issued an extensive opinion with careful attention to this Court\u2019s cases and to its own precedent, the \u201cstream of commerce\u201d metaphor carried the decision far afield.  Due process protects the defendant\u2019s right not to be coerced except by lawful judicial power. As a general rule, the exercise of judicial power is not lawful unless the defendant \u201cpurposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Denckla, </em>357 U.S. 235, 253, 78 S. Ct. 1228, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1283 (1958). There may be exceptions, say, for instance,</p>\n<p id=\"AzQa\">[564 U.S. 878]</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">in cases involving an intentional tort. But the general rule is applicable in this products-liability case, and the so-called \u201cstream-of-commerce\u201d doctrine cannot displace it.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">This case arises from a products-liability suit filed in New Jersey state court. Robert Nicastro seriously injured his hand while using a metal-shearing machine manufactured by J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (J. McIntyre). The accident occurred in New Jersey, but the machine was manufactured in England, where J. McIntyre is incorporated and operates. The question here is whether the New Jersey courts have jurisdiction over J. McIntyre, notwithstanding the fact that the company at no time either marketed goods in the State or shipped them there. Nicastro was a plaintiff in the New Jersey trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>and is the respondent here; J. McIntyre was a defendant and is now the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">At oral argument in this Court, Nicastro\u2019s counsel stressed three primary facts in defense of New Jersey\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over J. McIntyre. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">First, an independent company agreed to sell J. McIntyre\u2019s machines in the United States. J. McIntyre itself did not sell its machines to buyers in this country beyond the U. S. distributor, and there is no allegation that the distributor was under J. McIntyre\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Second, J. McIntyre officials attended annual conventions for the scrap recycling industry to advertise J. McIntyre\u2019s machines alongside the distributor. The conventions took place in various States, but never in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">Third, no more than four machines (the record suggests only one, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 130a), including the machine that caused the injuries that are the basis for this suit, ended up in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">In addition to these facts emphasized by respondent, the New Jersey Supreme Court noted that J. McIntyre held both United States and European patents on its recycling technology.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">[564 U.S. 879]</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">201 N.J., at 55, 987 A.2d, at 579. It also noted that the U. S. distributor \u201cstructured [its] advertising and sales efforts in accordance with\u201d J. McIntyre\u2019s \u201cdirection and guidance whenever possible,\u201d and that \u201cat least some of the machines were sold on consignment to\u201d the distributor. <em>Id., </em>at 55, 56, 987 A.2d, at 579 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">In light of these facts, the New Jersey Supreme Court concluded that New Jersey courts could exercise jurisdiction over petitioner without contravention of the Due Process Clause. Jurisdiction was proper, in that court\u2019s view, because the injury occurred in New Jersey; because petitioner knew or reasonably should have known \u201cthat its products are distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead to those products being sold in any of the fifty states\u201d; and because petitioner failed to \u201ctake some reasonable step to prevent the distribution of its products in this State.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 77, 987 A.2d, at 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">Both the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s holding and its account of what it called \u201c [t]he stream-of-commerce doctrine of jurisdiction,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 80, 987 A.2d, at 594, were incorrect, however. This Court\u2019s <em>Asahi </em>decision may be responsible in part for that court\u2019s error regarding the stream of commerce, and this case presents an opportunity to provide greater clarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b815-14\">The Due Process Clause protects an individual\u2019s right to be deprived of life, liberty, or property only by the exercise of lawful power. Cf. <em>Giaccio </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>382 U.S. 399, 403, 86 S. Ct. 518, 15 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1966) (The Clause \u201cprotects] a person against having the Government impose burdens upon him except in accordance with the valid laws of the land\u201d). This is no less true with respect to the power of a sovereign to resolve disputes through judicial process than with respect to the power of a sovereign to prescribe rules of conduct for those within its sphere. See <em>Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Citizens for Better Environment, </em>523 U.S. 83, 94, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1998) (\u201c \u2018Jurisdiction is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>power to declare the</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">[564 U.S. 880]</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">law\u2019 \u201d). As a general rule, neither statute nor judicial decree may bind strangers to the State. Cf. <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin, </em>495 U.S. 604, 608-609, 110 S. Ct. 2105, 109 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1990) (opinion of Scalia, J.) (invoking \u201cthe phrase <em>coram non judice, </em>\u2018before a person not a judge\u2019\u2014 meaning, in effect, that the proceeding in question was not a <em>judicial </em>proceeding because lawful judicial authority was not present, and could therefore not yield a <em>judgment\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">A court may subject a defendant to judgment only when the defendant has sufficient contacts with the sovereign \u201csuch that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95 (1945) (quoting <em>Milliken </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>311 U.S. 457, 463, 61 S. Ct. 339, 85 L. Ed. 278 (1940)). Freeform notions of fundamental fairness divorced from traditional practice cannot transform a judgment rendered in the absence of authority into law. As a general rule, the sovereign\u2019s exercise of power requires some act by which the defendant \u201cpurposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws,\u201d <em>Hanson, </em>357 U.S., at 253, 78 S. Ct. 1228, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1283, though in some cases, as with an intentional tort, the defendant might well fall within the State\u2019s authority by reason of his attempt to obstruct its laws.  In products-liability cases like this one, it is the defendant\u2019s purposeful availment that makes jurisdiction consistent with \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">A person may submit to a State\u2019s authority in a number of ways. There is, of course, explicit consent. <em>E.g., Insurance Corp. of Ireland </em>v. <em>Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, </em>456 U.S. 694, 703, 102 S. Ct. 2099, 72 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1982). Presence within a State at the time suit commences through service of process is another example. See <em>Burnham, supra. </em>Citizenship or domicile\u2014or, by analogy, incorporation or principal place of business for corporations\u2014also indicates general submission to a State\u2019s powers. <em>Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">[564 U.S. 881]</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">v. <em>Brown, post, </em>p. 915, 131 S. Ct. 2846, 180 L. Ed. 2d 796. Each of these examples reveals circumstances, or a course of conduct, from which it is proper to infer an intention to benefit from and thus an intention to submit to the laws of the forum State. Cf. <em>Burger King Corp. </em>v. <em>Rudzewicz, </em>471 U.S. 462, 476, 105 S. Ct. 2174, 85 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1985). These examples support exercise of the general jurisdiction of the State\u2019s courts and allow the State to resolve both matters that originate within the State and those based on activities and events elsewhere. Heli<em>copteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>466 U.S. 408, 414, and n. 9, 104 S. Ct. 1868, 80 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1984). By contrast, those who live or operate primarily outside a State have a due process right not to be subjected to judgment in its courts as a general matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">There is also a more limited form of submission to a State\u2019s authority for disputes that \u201carise out of or are connected with the activities within the <em>state.\u201d International Shoe Co., supra, </em>at 319, 66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95. Where a defendant \u201cpurposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws,\u201d <em>Hanson, su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>pra, at 253, 78 S. Ct. 1228, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1283, it submits to the judicial power of an otherwise foreign sovereign to the extent that power is exercised in connection with the defendant\u2019s activities touching on the State. In other words, submission through contact with and activity directed at a sovereign may justify specific jurisdiction \u201cin a suit arising out of or related to the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum.\u201d Hel<em>icopteros, supra, </em>at 414, n. 8, 104 S. Ct. 1868, 80 L. Ed. 2d 404; see also <em>Goodyear, post, </em>at 919, 131 S. Ct. 2846, 180 L. Ed. 2d 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">The imprecision arising from <em>Asahi, </em>for the most part, results from its statement of the relation between jurisdiction and the \u201cstream of commerce.\u201d The stream of commerce, like other metaphors, has its deficiencies as well as its utility. It refers to the movement of goods from manufacturers through distributors to consumers, yet beyond that descriptive purpose its meaning is far from exact.  This Court has stated that a defendant\u2019s placing goods into the stream of commerce \u201cwith the expectation that they will be purchased</p>\n<p id=\"A03\">[564 U.S. 882]</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">by consumers in the forum State\u201d may indicate purposeful availment. <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>444 U.S. 286, 298, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1980) (finding that expectation lacking). But that statement does not amend the general rule of personal jurisdiction. It merely observes that a defendant may in an appropriate case be subject to jurisdiction without entering the forum\u2014itself an unexceptional proposition\u2014as where manufacturers or distributors \u201cseek to serve\u201d a given State\u2019s market. <em>Id., </em>at 295, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490. The principal inquiry in cases of this sort is whether the defendant\u2019s activities manifest an intention to submit to the power of a sovereign. In other words, the defendant must \u201cpurposefully avai[l] itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d <em>Hanson, supra, </em>at 253, 78 S. Ct. 1228, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1283; <em>Insurance Corp., supra, </em>at 704-705, 102 S. Ct. 2099, 72 L. Ed. 2d 492 (\u201c[AJctions of the defendant may amount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of the court\u201d). Sometimes a defendant does so by sending its goods rather than its agents. The defendant\u2019s transmission of goods permits the exercise of jurisdiction only where the defendant can be said to have targeted the forum; as a general rule, it is not enough that the defendant might have predicted that its goods will reach the forum State.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">In <em>Asahi, </em>an opinion by Justice Brennan for four Justices outlined a different approach. It discarded the central concept of sovereign authority in favor of considerations of fairness and foreseeability. As that concurrence contended, \u201cjurisdiction premised on the placement of a product into the stream of commerce [without more] is consistent with the Due Process Clause,\u201d for \u201c[a]s long as a participant in this process is aware that the final product is being marketed in the forum State, the possibility of a lawsuit there cannot come as a surprise.\u201d 480 U.S., at 117, 107 S. Ct. 1026, 94 L. Ed. 2d 92 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). It was the premise of the concurring opinion that the defendant\u2019s ability to anticipate suit renders the assertion of jurisdiction fair. In</p>\n<p id=\"Aclo\">[564 U.S. 883]</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">this way, the opinion made foreseeability the touchstone of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">The standard set forth in Justice Brennan\u2019s concurrence was rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>in an opinion written by Justice O\u2019Connor; but the relevant part of that opinion, too, commanded the assent of only four Justices, not a majority of the Court. That opinion stated: \u201cThe \u2018substantial connection\u2019 between the defendant and the forum State necessary for a finding of minimum contacts must come about by an action of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State. The placement of a product into the stream of commerce, without more, is not an act of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 112, 107 S. Ct. 1026, 94 L. Ed. 2d 92 (emphasis deleted; citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Since <em>Asahi </em>was decided, the courts have sought to reconcile the competing opinions. But Justice Brennan\u2019s concurrence, advocating a rule based on general notions of fairness and foreseeability, is inconsistent with the premises of lawful judicial power. This Court\u2019s precedents make clear that  it is the defendant\u2019s actions, not his expectations, that empower a State\u2019s courts to subject him to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The conclusion that  jurisdiction is in the first instance a question of authority rather than fairness explains, for example, why the principal opinion in <em>Burnham </em>\u201cconducted no independent inquiry into the desirability or fairness\u201d of the rule that service of process within a State suffices to establish jurisdiction over an otherwise foreign defendant. 495 U.S., at 621, 110 S. Ct. 2105, 109 L. Ed. 2d 631 (opinion of Scalia, J.). As that opinion explained, \u201c [t]he view developed early that each State had the power to hale before its courts any individual who could be found within its borders.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 610, 110 S. Ct. 2105, 109 L. Ed. 2d 631. Furthermore, were general fairness considerations the touchstone of jurisdiction, a lack of purposeful availment might be excused where carefully crafted judicial procedures could otherwise protect the defendant\u2019s interests, or where the plaintiff would suffer substantial hardship if forced to litigate in a foreign forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">[564 U.S. 884]</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">That such considerations have not been deemed controlling is instructive. See, <em>e.g., World-Wide Volkswagen, supra, </em>at 294, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">Two principles are implicit in the foregoing. First,  personal jurisdiction requires a forum-by-forum, or sovereign-by-sovereign, analysis. The question is whether a defendant has followed a course of conduct directed at the society or economy existing within the jurisdiction of a given sovereign, so that the sovereign has the power to subject the defendant to judgment concerning that conduct. Personal jurisdiction, of course, restricts \u201cjudicial power not as a matter of sovereignty, but as a matter of individual liberty,\u201d for due process protects the individual\u2019s right to be subject only to lawful power. <em>Insurance Corp., </em>456 U.S., at 702, 102 S. Ct. 2099, 72 L. Ed. 2d 492. But whether a judicial judgment is lawful depends on whether the sovereign has authority to render it.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">The second principle is a corollary of the first.  Because the United States is a distinct sovereign, a defendant may in principle be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States but not of any particular State. This is consistent with the premises and unique genius of our Constitution. Ours is \u201ca legal system unprecedented in form and design, establishing two orders of government, each with its own direct relationship, its own privity, its own set of mutual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>rights and obligations to the people who sustain it and are governed by it.\u201d <em>U. S. Term Limits, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>514 U.S. 779, 838, 115 S. Ct. 1842, 131 L. Ed. 2d 881 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring). For jurisdiction, a litigant may have the requisite relationship with the United States Government but not with the government of any individual State. That would be an exceptional case, however. If the defendant is a domestic domiciliary, the courts of its home State are available and can exercise general jurisdiction. And if another State were to assert jurisdiction in an inappropriate case, it would upset the federal balance, which posits that each State has a sovereignty that is not subject to unlawful intrusion by other States. Furthermore,</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">[564 U.S. 885]</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">foreign corporations will often target or concentrate on particular States, subjecting them to specific jurisdiction in those forums.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">It must be remembered, however, that although this case and <em>Asahi </em>both involve foreign manufacturers, the undesirable consequences of Justice Brennan\u2019s approach are no less significant for domestic producers. The owner of a small Florida farm might sell crops to a large nearby distributor, for example, who might then distribute them to grocers across the country. If foreseeability were the controlling criterion, the farmer could be sued in Alaska or any number of other States\u2019 courts without ever leaving town. And the issue of foreseeability may itself be contested so that significant expenses are incurred just on the preliminary issue of jurisdiction. Jurisdictional rules should avoid these costs whenever possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">The conclusion that the authority to subject a defendant to judgment depends on purposeful availment, consistent with Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion in <em>Asahi, </em>does not by itself resolve many difficult questions of jurisdiction that will arise in particular cases. The defendant\u2019s conduct and the economic realities of the market the defendant seeks to serve will differ across cases, and judicial exposition will, in common-law fashion, clarify the contours of that principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">In this case, petitioner directed marketing and sales efforts at the United States. It may be that, assuming it were otherwise empowered to legislate on the subject, the Congress could authorize the exercise of jurisdiction in appropriate courts. That circumstance is not presented in this case, however, and it is neither necessary nor appropriate to address here any constitutional concerns that might be attendant to that exercise of power. <em>See Asahi, </em>480 U.S., at 113, n., 107 S. Ct. 1026, 94 L. Ed. 2d 92. Nor is it necessary to determine what substantive law might apply were Congress to authorize jurisdiction in</p>\n<p id=\"A30s\">[564 U.S. 886]</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">a federal court in New Jersey. See <em>Hanson, </em>357 U.S., at 254, 78 S. Ct. 1228, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1283 (\u201cThe issue is personal jurisdiction, not choice of law\u201d). A sovereign\u2019s legislative authority to regulate conduct may present considerations different from those presented by its authority to subject a defendant to judgment in its courts. Here the question concerns the authority of a New Jersey state court to exercise jurisdiction, so it is petitioner\u2019s purposeful contacts with New Jersey, not with the United States, that alone are relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">Respondent has not established that J. McIntyre engaged in conduct purposefully directed at New Jersey. Recall that respondent\u2019s claim of ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>risdiction centers on three facts: The distributor agreed to sell J. McIntyre\u2019s machines in the United States; J. McIntyre officials attended trade shows in several States but not in New Jersey; and up to four machines ended up in New Jersey. The British manufacturer had no office in New Jersey; it neither paid taxes nor owned property there; and it neither advertised in, nor sent any employees to, the State. Indeed, after discovery the trial court found that the \u201cdefendant does not have a single contact with New Jersey short of the machine in question ending up in this state.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 130a. These facts may reveal an intent to serve the U. S. market, but they do not show that J. McIntyre purposefully availed itself of the New Jersey market.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">It is notable that the New Jersey Supreme Court appears to agree, for it could \u201cnot find that J.

The court nonetheless held that petitioner could be sued in New Jersey based on a \u201cstream-of-commerce theory of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As discussed, however,  the stream-of-commerce metaphor cannot supersede either the mandate of the Due Process Clause or the limits on judicial authority that Clause ensures.

The contrary judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b820-7\">Justice Breyer,</author>\n<p id=\"AeMK\">with whom Justice Alito joins, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">The Supreme Court of New Jersey adopted a broad understanding of the scope of personal jurisdiction based on its view that \u201c [t]he increasingly fast-paced globalization of the world economy has removed national borders as barriers to trade.\u201d <em>Nicastro </em>v. <em>McIntyre Machinery America, Ltd., </em>201 N.J. 48, 52, 987 A.2d 575, 577 (2010). I do not doubt that there have been many recent changes in commerce and communication, many of which are not anticipated by our precedents. But this case does not present any of those issues. So I think it unwise to announce a rule of broad applicability without full consideration of the modern-day consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">In my view, the outcome of this case is determined by our precedents. Based on the facts found by the New Jersey courts, respondent Robert Ni-castro failed to meet his burden to demonstrate that it was constitutionally proper to exercise jurisdiction over petitioner J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (British Manufacturer), a British firm that manufactures</p>\n<p id=\"Ah4r\">[564 U.S. 888]</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">scrap-metal machines in Great Britain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>sells them through an independent distributor in the United States (American Distributor). On that basis, I agree with the plurality that the contrary judgment of the Supreme Court of New Jersey should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">In asserting jurisdiction over the British Manufacturer, the Supreme Court of New Jersey relied most heavily on three primary facts as providing constitutionally sufficient \u201ccontacts\u201d with New Jersey, thereby making it fundamentally fair to hale the British Manufacturer before its courts: (1) The American Distributor on one occasion sold and shipped one machine to a New Jersey customer, namely, Mr. Nicastro\u2019s employer, Mr. Curcio; (2) the British Manufacturer permitted, indeed wanted, its independent American Distributor to sell its machines to anyone in America willing to buy them; and (3) representatives of the British Manufacturer attended trade shows in \u201csuch cities as Chicago, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Orlando, San Diego, and San Francisco.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 54-55, 987 A.2d, at 578-579. In my view, these facts do not provide contacts between the British firm and the State of New Jersey constitutionally sufficient to support New Jersey\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">None of our precedents finds that a single isolated sale, even if accompanied by the kind of sales effort indicated here, is sufficient. Rather, this Court\u2019s previous holdings suggest the contrary. The Court has held that a single sale to a customer who takes an accident-causing product to a different State (where the accident takes place) is not a sufficient basis for asserting jurisdiction. See <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>444 U.S. 286, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1980). And the Court, in separate opinions, has strongly suggested that a single sale of a product in a State does not constitute an adequate basis for asserting jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant, even if that defendant places his goods in the</p>\n<p id=\"AObQ\">[564 U.S. 889]</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">stream of commerce, fully aware (and hoping) that such a sale will take place. See <em>Asahi Metal Industry Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., </em>480 U.S. 102, 111, 112, 107 S. Ct. 1026, 94 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1987) (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.) (requiring \u201csomething more\u201d than simply placing \u201ca product into the stream of commerce,\u201d even if defendant is \u201cawar[e]\u201d that the stream \u201cmay or will sweep the product into the forum State\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 117, 107 S. Ct. 1026, 94 L. Ed. 2d 92 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (jurisdiction should he where a sale in a State is part of \u201cthe regular and anticipated flow\u201d of commerce into the State, but not where that sale is only an \u201cedd[y],\u201d <em>i.e., </em>an isolated occurrence); <em>id.., </em>at 122, 107 S. Ct. 1026, 94 L. Ed. 2d 92 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (indicating that \u201cthe volume, the value, and the hazardous character\u201d of a good may affect the jurisdictional inquiry and emphasizing Asahi\u2019s \u201cregular course of dealing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">Here, the relevant facts found by the New Jersey Supreme Court show no \u201cregular . . . flow\u201d or \u201cregular course\u201d of sales in New Jersey; and there is no \u201csomething more,\u201d such as special state-related design, advertising, advice, marketing, or anything else. Mr. Nicastro, who here bears the burden of proving jurisdiction, has shown no specific effort by the British Manufacturer to sell in New Jersey. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>He has introduced no list of potential New Jersey customers who might, for example, have regularly attended trade shows. And he has not otherwise shown that the British Manufacturer \u201cpurposefully avail[ed] itself of the privilege of conducting activities\u201d within New Jersey, or that it delivered its goods in the stream of commerce \u201cwith the expectation that they will be purchased\u201d by New Jersey users. <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, supra, </em>at 297-298, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">There may well have been other facts that Mr. Nicastro could have demonstrated in support of jurisdiction. And the dissent considers some of those facts. See <em>post, </em>at 895, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 783 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.) (describing the size and scope of New Jersey\u2019s scrap-metal business). But the plaintiff bears</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">[564 U.S. 890]</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">the burden of establishing jurisdiction, and here I would take the facts precisely as the New Jersey Supreme Court stated them. <em>Insurance Corp. of Ireland </em>v. <em>Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, </em>456 U.S. 694, 709, 102 S. Ct. 2099, 72 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1982); <em>Blakey </em>v. <em>Continental Airlines, Inc., </em>164 N.J. 38, 71, 751 A.2d 538, 557 (2000); see 201 N.J., at 54-56, 987 A.2d, at 578-579; App. to Pet. for Cert. 128a-137a (trial court\u2019s \u201creasoning and finding(s)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Accordingly, on the record present here, resolving this case requires no more than adhering to our precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">I would not go further. Because the incident at issue in this case does not implicate modern concerns, and because the factual record leaves many open questions, this is an unsuitable vehicle for making broad pronouncements that refashion basic jurisdictional rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">The plurality seems to state strict rules that limit jurisdiction where a defendant does not \u201cinten[d] to submit to the power of a sovereign\u201d and cannot \u201cbe said to have targeted the forum.\u201d Ante, at 882, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 775. But what do those standards mean when a company targets the world by selling products from its Web site? And does it matter if, instead of shipping the products directly, a company consigns the products through an intermediary (say, Amazon.com) who then receives and fulfills the orders? And what if the company markets its products through popup advertisements that it knows will be viewed in a forum? Those issues have serious commercial consequences but are totally absent in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-13\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b822-14\">But though I do not agree with the plurality\u2019s seemingly strict no-jurisdiction rule, I am not persuaded by the absolute approach adopted by the New Jersey Supreme Court and urged by respondent and his <em>amici. </em>Under that view,</p>\n<p id=\"b822-15\">[564 U.S. 891]</p>\n<p id=\"b822-16\">a producer is subject to jurisdiction for a products-liability action so long as it \u201cknows or reasonably should know that its products are distributed through a nationwide distribution system that <em>might </em>lead to those products being sold in any of the fifty states.\u201d 201 N.J., at 76-77, 987 A.2d, at 592 (emphasis added). In the context of this case, I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-17\">For one thing, to adopt this view would abandon the heretofore accepted inquiry of whether, focusing upon the relationship between \u201cthe defendant, the <em>forum, </em>and the litiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>tion,\u201d it is fair, in light of the defendant\u2019s contacts <em>with that </em>forum, to subject the defendant to suit there. <em>Shaffer </em>v. <em>Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186, 204, 97 S. Ct. 2569, 53 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1977) (emphasis added). It would ordinarily rest jurisdiction instead upon no more than the occurrence of a product-based accident in the forum State. But this Court has rejected the notion that a defendant\u2019s amenability to suit \u201ctravel [s] with the chattel.\u201d <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 U.S., at 296, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">For another, I cannot reconcile so automatic a rule with the constitutional demand for \u201cminimum contacts\u201d and \u201cpurposeful!] avail[ment],\u201d each of which rests upon a particular notion of defendant-focused fairness. <em>Id., </em>at 291, 297, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490 (internal quotation marks omitted). A rule like the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s would permit every State to assert jurisdiction in a products-liability suit against any domestic manufacturer who sells its products (made anywhere in the United States) to a national distributor, no matter how large or small the manufacturer, no matter how distant the forum, and no matter how few the number of items that end up in the particular forum at issue. What might appear fair in the case of a large manufacturer which specifically seeks, or expects, an equal-sized distributor to sell its product in a distant State might seem unfair in the case of a small manufacturer (say, an Appalachian potter) who sells his product (cups and saucers) exclusively to a large distributor, who resells a single item (a coffee mug) to a buyer from a distant</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">[564 U.S. 892]</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">State (Hawaii). I know too little about the range of these or in-between possibilities to abandon in favor of the more absolute rule what has previously been this Court\u2019s less absolute approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">Further, the fact that the defendant is a foreign, rather than a domestic, manufacturer makes the basic fairness of an absolute rule yet more uncertain. I am again less certain than is the New Jersey Supreme Court that the nature of international commerce has changed so significantly as to require a new approach to personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">It may be that a larger firm can readily \u201calleviate the risk of burdensome litigation by procuring insurance, passing the expected costs on to customers, or, if the risks are too great, severing its connection with the State.\u201d <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, supra, </em>at 297, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490. But manufacturers come in many shapes and sizes. It may be fundamentally unfair to require a small Egyptian shirtmaker, a Brazilian manufacturing cooperative, or a Kenyan coffee farmer, selling its products through international distributors, to respond to products-liability tort suits in virtually every State in the United States, even those in respect to which the foreign firm has no connection at all but the sale of a single (allegedly defective) good. And a rule like the New Jersey Supreme Court suggests would require every product manufacturer, large or small, selling to American distributors to understand not only the tort law of every State, but also the wide variance in the way courts within different States apply that law. See, <em>e.g., </em>Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin, T. Cohen, Tort Trials and Verdicts in Large Counties, 2001, p. 11 (NCJ 206240, 2004) (reporting percentage of plaintiff winners in tort trials among 46 populous counties, ranging from 17.9% (Worcester, Mass.) to 69.1% (Milwaukee, Wis.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">At a minimum, I would not work such a change to the law in the way either the plurality or the New Jersey Supreme Court suggests without a better understanding of the relevant</p>\n<p id=\"AFsW\">[564 U.S. 893]</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">contemporary commercial circumstances. Insofar as such considerations are relevant to any change in present law, they might be presented in a case (unlike the present one) in which the Solicitor General participates. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. in <em>Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>O. T. 2010, No. 10-76, pp. 20-22 (Government declining invitation at oral argument to give its views with respect to issues in this case).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">This case presents no such occasion, and so I again reiterate that I would adhere strictly to our precedents and the limited facts found by the New Jersey Supreme Court. And on those grounds, I do not think we can find jurisdiction in this case. Accordingly, though I agree with the plurality as to the outcome of this case, I concur only in the judgment of that opinion and not its reasoning.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b824-7\">Justice Ginsburg,</author>\n<p id=\"axg-dedup-0\">with whom Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">A foreign industrialist seeks to develop a market in the United States for machines it manufactures. It hopes to derive substantial revenue from sales it makes to United States purchasers. Where in the United States buyers reside does not matter to this manufacturer. Its goal is simply to sell as much as it can, wherever it can. It excludes no region or State from the market it wishes to reach. But, all things considered, it prefers to avoid products liability litigation in the United States. To that end, it engages a U. S. distributor to ship its machines stateside. Has it succeeded in escaping personal jurisdiction in a State where one of its products is sold and causes injury or even death to a local user?</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">Under this Court\u2019s pathmarking precedent in <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 66 S.

Ed. 95 (1945), and subsequent decisions, one would expect the answer to be unequivocally, \u201cNo.\u201d But instead, six Justices of this Court, in divergent opinions, tell us that the manufacturer has avoided the jurisdiction of our state courts, except perhaps in States where its products are sold in sizeable quantities.

In promoting McIntyre UK\u2019s products at conventions and demonstration sites and in trade journal advertisements, McIntyre America looked to McIntyre UK for direction and guidance. <em>Ibid. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>To achieve McIntyre UK\u2019s objective, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cto sell [its] machines to customers throughout the United States,\u201d 399 N.J. Super., at 548, 945 A.2d, at 97, \u201cthe two companies were acting closely in concert with each other,\u201d <em>ibid- </em>McIntyre UK never instructed its distributor to avoid certain States or regions of the country; rather, as just</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">[564 U.S. 898]</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">noted, the manufacturer engaged McIntyre America to attract customers \u201cfrom anywhere in the United States.\u201d App. 161a.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">In sum, McIntyre UK\u2019s regular attendance and exhibitions at ISRI conventions was surely a purposeful step to reach customers for its products \u201canywhere in the United States.\u201d At least as purposeful was McIntyre UK\u2019s engagement of McIntyre America as the conduit for sales of McIntyre UK\u2019s machines to buyers \u201cthroughout the United States.\u201d Given McIntyre UK\u2019s endeavors to reach and profit from the United States market as a whole, Nicastro\u2019s suit, I would hold, has been brought in a forum entirely appropriate for the adjudication of his claim. He alleges that McIntyre UK\u2019s shear machine was defectively designed or manufactured and, as a result, caused injury to him at his workplace. The machine arrived in Nicastro\u2019s New Jersey workplace not randomly or fortuitously, but as a result of the U. S. connections and distribution system that McIntyre UK deliberately arranged.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On what sensible view of the allocation of adjudicatory authority could the place of Nicastro\u2019s injury within the United States be deemed off limits for his products liability claim against a foreign manufacturer who targeted the United States (including all the States that constitute the Nation) as the territory it sought to develop?</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">[564 U.S. 899]</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">A few points on which there should be no genuine debate bear statement at the outset. First, all agree, McIntyre UK surely is not subject to general (all-purpose) jurisdiction in New Jersey courts, for that foreign-country corporation is hardly \u201cat home\u201d in New Jersey. See <em>Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. </em>v. <em>Brown, post, </em>at 919-920, 926-929, 131 S. Ct. 2846, 180 L. Ed. 2d 796. The question, rather, is one of specific jurisdiction, which turns on an \u201caffiliatio[n] between the forum and the underlying controversy.\u201d <em>Goodyear Dunlop, post, </em>at 919, 131 S. Ct. 2846, 180 L. Ed. 2d 796 (quoting von Mehren &amp; Trautman, Jurisdiction To Adjudicate: A Suggested Analysis, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 1121, 1136 (1966) (hereinafter von Mehren &amp; Trautman) (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also <em>Goodyear Dunlop, post, </em>at 923-924, 131 S. Ct. 2846, 180 L. Ed. 2d 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">Second, no issue of the fair and reasonable allocation of adjudicatory authority among States of the United States is present in this case. New Jersey\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>whose dangerous product caused a workplace injury in New Jersey does not tread on the domain, or diminish the sovereignty, of any other State. Indeed, among States of the United States, the State in which the injury occurred would seem most suitable for litigation of a products liability tort claim. See <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>444 U.S. 286, 297, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1980) (if a manufacturer or distributor endeavors to develop a market for a product in several States, it is reasonable \u201cto subject it to suit in one of those States if its allegedly defective [product] has there been the source of injury\u201d); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(a)-(b) (in federal-court suits, whether resting on diversity or federal-question jurisdiction, venue is proper in the judicial district \u201cin which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Third, the constitutional limits on a state court\u2019s adjudicatory authority derive from considerations of due process, not state sovereignty. As the Court clarified in <em>Insurance</em></p>\n<p id=\"AmgB\">[564 U.S. 900]</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\"><em>Corp. of Ireland </em>v. <em>Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, </em>456 U.S. 694, 102 S. Ct. 2099, 72 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-7\">\u201cThe restriction on state sovereign power described in <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. . . . </em>must be seen as ultimately a function of the individual liberty interest preserved by the Due Process Clause. That Clause is the only source of the personal jurisdiction requirement and the Clause itself makes no mention of federalism concerns. Furthermore, if the federalism concept operated as an independent restriction on the sovereign power of the court, it would not be possible to waive the personal jurisdiction requirement: Individual actions cannot change the powers of sovereignty, although the individual can subject himself to powers from which he may otherwise be protected.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 703, n. 10, 102 S. Ct. 2099, 72 L. Ed. 2d 492.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">See also <em>Shaffer </em>v. <em>Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186, 204, and n. 20, 97 S. Ct. 2569, 53 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1977) (recognizing that \u201cthe mutually exclusive sovereignty of the States [is not] the central concern of the inquiry into personal jurisdiction\u201d). But see <em>ante, </em>at 882, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 775 (plurality opinion) (asserting that \u201csovereign authority,\u201d not \u201cfairness,\u201d is the \u201ccentral concept\u201d in determining personal jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">Finally, in <em>International Shoe </em>itself, and decisions thereafter, the Court has made plain that legal fictions, notably \u201cpresence\u201d and \u201cimplied consent,\u201d should be discarded, for they conceal the actual bases on which jurisdiction rests. See 326 U.S., at 316, 318, 66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95; <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Chase &amp; Gilbert, Inc., </em>45 F.2d 139, 141 (CA2 1930) (L. Hand, J.) (\u201cnothing is gained by [resort to words that] concea[l] what we do\u201d). \u201c[T]he relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation\u201d determines whether due process permits the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant, <em>Shaffer, </em>433 U.S., at 204, 97 S. Ct. 2569, 53 L. Ed. 2d 683, and \u201cfictions of implied consent\u201d or \u201ccorporate presence\u201d do not advance the proper inquiry, <em>id., </em>at 202, 97 S. Ct. 2569, 53 L. Ed. 2d 683. See also <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Superior Court of Cal., County of</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-11\">[564 U.S. 901]</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\"><em>Marin, </em>495 U.S. 604, 618, 110 S. Ct. 2105, 109 L.

Quite the contrary, the Court has explained, a forum can exercise jurisdiction when its contacts with the controversy are sufficient; invocation of a fictitious consent, the Court has repeatedly said, is unnecessary and unhelpful. See, <em>e.g., Burger King Corp. </em>v. <em>Rudzewicz, </em>471 U.S. 462, 472, 105 S. Ct. 2174, 85 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1985) (Due Process Clause permits \u201cforum ... to assert specific jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant who has not consented to suit there\u201d); <em>McGee </em>v. <em>International Life Ins.Co., </em>355 U.S. 220, 222, 78 S. Ct. 199, 2 L. Ed. 2d 223 (1957) (\u201c[T]his Court [has] abandoned \u2018consent,\u2019 \u2018doing business,\u2019 and \u2018presence\u2019 as the standard for measuring the extent of state judicial power over [out-of-state] corporations.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">[564 U.S. 902]</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">This case is illustrative of marketing arrangements for sales in the United States common in today\u2019s commercial world.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A foreign-country manufacturer engages a U. S. company to promote and distribute the manufacturer\u2019s products, not in any particular State, but anywhere and everywhere in the United States the distributor can attract purchasers. The product proves defective and injures a user in the State where the user lives or works. Often, as here, the manufacturer will have liability insurance covering personal injuries caused by its products. See Cupp, Redesigning Successor Liability, 1999 U. Ill. L. Rev. 845, 870-871 (noting the ready availability of products liability insurance for manufacturers and citing a study showing, \u201cbetween 1986 and 1996, [such] insurance cost manufacturers, on average, only sixteen cents for each $100 of product sales\u201d); App. 129a-130a.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">When industrial accidents happen, a long-arm statute in the State where the injury occurs generally permits assertion of jurisdiction, upon giving proper notice, over the foreign manufacturer. For example, the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>statute might provide, as does New York\u2019s long-arm statute, for the \u201cexercise [of] personal jurisdiction over any non-domiciliary . . . who . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-4\">\u201ccommits a tortious act without the state causing injury to person or property within the state, ... if he . . . expects or should reasonably expect the act to have consequences in the state and derives substantial revenue</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-5\">[564 U.S. 903]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-6\">from interstate or international commerce.\u201d N.Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a7 302(a)(3)(h) (West 2008).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Or, the State might simply provide, as New Jersey does, for the exercise of jurisdiction \u201cconsistent with due process of law.\u201d N.J. Ct. Rule 4:4\u20144(b)( 1) (2011).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">The modern approach to jurisdiction over corporations and other legal entities, ushered in by <em>International Shoe, </em>gave prime place to reason and fairness. Is it not fair and reasonable, given the mode of trading of which this case is an example, to require the international seller to defend at the place its products cause injury?<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Do not litigational convenience<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and choice-of-law considerations<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> point in that direction?</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">[564 U.S. 904]</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">On what measure of reason and fairness can it be considered undue to require McIntyre UK to defend in New Jersey as an incident of its efforts to develop a market for its industrial machines anywhere and everywhere in the United States? <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Is not the burden on McIntyre UK to defend in New Jersey fair, <em>i.e., </em>a reasonable cost of transacting business internationally, in comparison to the burden on Nicastro to go to Nottingham, England, to gain recompense for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>an injury he sustained using McIntyre\u2019s product at his workplace in Saddle Brook, New Jersey?</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">McIntyre UK dealt with the United States as a single market. Like most foreign manufacturers, it was concerned not with the prospect of suit in State X as opposed to State Y, but rather with its subjection to suit anywhere in the United States. See Hay, Judicial Jurisdiction Over Foreign-Country Corporate Defendants\u2014 Comments on Recent Case Law, 63 Ore. L. Rev. 431, 433 (1984) (hereinafter Hay). As a McIntyre UK officer wrote in an e-mail to McIntyre America: \u201cAmerican law\u2014who needs it?!\u201d App. 129a-130a (e-mail dated April 26, 1999, from Sally Johnson to Mary Gaither). If McIntyre UK is answerable in the United States at all, is it not \u201cperfectly appropriate to permit the exercise of that jurisdiction ... at the place of injury\u201d? See Hay 435; Degnan &amp; Kane, The Exercise of Jurisdiction Over and Enforcement of Judgments Against Alien Defendants, 39</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">[564 U.S. 905]</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Hastings L. J. 799, 813-815 (1988) (noting that \u201c[i]n the international order,\u201d the State that counts is the United States, not its component States,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and that the fair place of suit within the United States is essentially a question of venue).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">In sum, McIntyre UK, by engaging McIntyre America to promote and sell its machines in the United States, \u201cpurposefully availed itself\u2019 of the United States market nationwide, not a market in a single State or a discrete collection of States. McIntyre UK thereby availed itself of the market of all States in which its products were sold by its exclusive distributor. \u201cTh[e] \u2018purposeful availment\u2019 requirement,\u201d this Court has explained, simply \u201censures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of \u2018random,\u2019 \u2018fortuitous,\u2019 or \u2018attenuated\u2019 contacts.\u201d <em>Burger King, </em>471 U.S., at 475, 105 S. Ct. 2174, 85 L. Ed. 2d 528. Adjudicatory authority is appropriately exercised where \u201cactions by the defendant <em>himself\u2019 </em>give rise to the affiliation with the forum. <em>Ibid. </em>How could McIntyre UK not have intended, by its actions targeting a national market, to sell products in the fourth-largest destination for imports among all States of the United States and the largest scrap metal market? See <em>supra, </em>at 895, 902, n. 6, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 783, 787. But see <em>ante, </em>at 886, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 777 (plurality opinion) (manufacturer\u2019s purposeful efforts to sell its products nationwide are \u201cnot . . . relevant\u201d to the personal jurisdiction inquiry).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">[564 U.S. 906]</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">Courts, both state and federal, confronting facts similar to those here, have rightly rejected the conclusion that a manufacturer selling its products across the USA may evade jurisdiction in any and all States, including the State where its defective product is distributed and causes injury. They have held, instead, that it would undermine principles of fundamental fairness to insulate the foreign manufacturer from accountabil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>ity in court at the place within the United States where the manufacturer\u2019s products caused injury. See, <em>e.g., Tobin </em>v. <em>Astra Pharmaceutical Prods., Inc., </em>993 F.2d 528, 544 (CA6 1993); A. <em>Uberti &amp; C. </em>v. <em>Leonardo, </em>181 Ariz. 565, 573, 892 P.2d 1354, 1362 (1995).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">While this Court has not considered in any prior case the now-prevalent pattern presented here\u2014a foreign-country manufacturer enlisting a U. S. distributor to develop a market in the United States for the manufacturer\u2019s products\u2014none of the Court\u2019s decisions tug against the judgment made by the New Jersey Supreme Court. McIntyre contends otherwise, citing <em>World-Wide Volkswagen </em>and <em>Asahi Metal Industry Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., </em>480 U.S. 102, 107 S. Ct. 1026, 94 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\"><em>World-Wide Volkswagen </em>concerned a New York car dealership that sold solely in the New York market, and a New York distributor who supplied retailers in three States only: New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey. 444 U.S., at 289, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490. New York residents had purchased an Audi from the New York dealer and were driving the new vehicle through Oklahoma en route to Arizona. On the road in Oklahoma, another car struck the Audi in the rear, causing a fire which severely burned the Audi\u2019s occupants. <em>Id., </em>at 288, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490. Rejecting the Oklahoma courts\u2019 assertion of jurisdiction over the</p>\n<p id=\"A4Fc\">[564 U.S. 907]</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">New York dealer and distributor, this Court observed that the defendants had done nothing to serve the market for cars in Oklahoma. <em>Id., </em>at 295-298, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490. Jurisdiction, the Court held, could not be based on the <em>customer\u2019s </em>unilateral act of driving the vehicle to Oklahoma. <em>Id., </em>at 298, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490; see <em>Asahi, </em>480 U.S., at 109, 107 S. Ct. 1026, 94 L. Ed. 2d 92 (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.) <em>(World-Wide Volkswagen </em>\u201crejected the assertion that a <em>consumer\u2019s </em>unilateral act of bringing the defendant\u2019s product into the forum State was a sufficient constitutional basis for personal jurisdiction over the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">Notably, the foreign manufacturer of the Audi in <em>World-Wide Volkswagen </em>did not object to the jurisdiction of the Oklahoma courts and the U. S. importer abandoned its initially stated objection. 444 U.S., at 288, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490, and n. 3. And most relevant here, the Court\u2019s opinion indicates that an objection to jurisdiction by the manufacturer or national distributor would have been unavailing. To reiterate, the Court said in <em>World-Wide Volkswagen </em>that, when a manufacturer or distributor aims to sell its product to customers in several States, it is reasonable \u201cto subject it to suit in [any] one of those States if its allegedly defective [product] has there been the source of injury.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 297, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\"><em>Asahi </em>arose out of a motorcycle accident in California. Plaintiff, a California resident injured in the accident, sued the Taiwanese manufacturer of the motorcycle\u2019s tire tubes, claiming that defects in its product caused the accident. The tube <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>manufacturer cross-claimed against Asahi, the Japanese maker of the valve assembly, and Asahi contested the California courts\u2019 jurisdiction. By the time the case reached this Court, the injured plaintiff had settled his case and only the indemnity claim by the Taiwanese company against the Japanese valve-assembly manufacturer remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">The decision was not a close call. The Court had before it a foreign plaintiff, the Taiwanese manufacturer, and a foreign defendant, the Japanese valve-assembly maker, and the indemnification dispute concerned a transaction between</p>\n<p id=\"A_ip\">[564 U.S. 908]</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">those parties that occurred abroad. All agreed on the bottom line: The Japanese valve-assembly manufacturer was not reasonably brought into the California courts to litigate a dispute with another foreign party over a transaction that took place outside the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Given the confines of the controversy, the dueling opinions of Justice Brennan and Justice O\u2019Connor were hardly necessary. How the Court would have \u201cestimate [d] .. . the inconveniences,\u201d <em>International Shoe, </em>326 U.S., at 317, 66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95 (internal quotation marks omitted), had the injured Californian originally sued Asahi is a debatable question. Would this Court have given the same weight to the burdens on the foreign defendant had those been counterbalanced by the burdens litigating in Japan imposed on the local California plaintiff? Cf. <em>Calder </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>465 U.S. 783, 788, 104 S. Ct. 1482, 79 L. Ed. 2d 804 (1984) (a plaintiffs contacts with the forum \u201cmay be so manifold as to permit jurisdiction when it would not exist in their absence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">In any event, Asahi, unlike McIntyre UK, did not itself seek out customers in the United States, it engaged no distributor to promote its wares here, it appeared at no trades-hows in the United States, and, of course, it had no Web site advertising its products to the world. Moreover, Asahi was a component-part manufacturer with \u201clittle control over the final destination of its products once they were delivered into the stream of commerce.\u201d <em>A. Uberti, </em>181 Ariz., at 572, 892 P.2d, at 1361. It was important to the Court in <em>Asahi </em>that \u201cthose who use Asahi components in their final products, and sell those products in California, [would be] subject to the application of California tort law.\u201d 480 U.S., at 115, 107 S. Ct. 1026, 94 L. Ed. 2d 92 (majority opinion). To hold that <em>Asahi </em>controls this case would, to put it bluntly, be dead wrong.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">[564 U.S. 909]</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">The Court\u2019s judgment also puts United States plaintiffs at a disadvantage in comparison to similarly situated complainants elsewhere in the world. Of particular note, within the European Union, in which the United Kingdom is a participant, the jurisdiction New Jersey would have exercised is not at all exceptional. The European Regulation on Jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>and the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments provides for the exercise of specific jurisdiction \u201cin matters relating to tort... in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred.\u201d Council Reg. 44/2001, Art. 5, 2001 O. J. (L. 12) 4.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The European Court of Justice has interpreted this prescription to authorize jurisdiction either where the harmful act occurred or at the place of injury. See <em>Handelskwekerij G. J. Bier B. V. </em>v. <em>Mines de Potasse d'Alsace S. A., </em>1976 E. C. R. 1735, 1748-1749.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The commentators who gave names to what we now call \u201cgeneral jurisdiction\u201d and \u201cspecific jurisdiction\u201d anticipated that when the latter achieves its full growth, considerations of liti-gational convenience and the respective situations of the parties would determine when it is appropriate to subject</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">[564 U.S. 910]</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">a defendant to trial in the plaintiffs community.
