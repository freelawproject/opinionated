This requirement is commonly referred to as \u201closs causation.\u201d The question presented in this case is whether securities fraud plaintiffs must also prove loss causation in order to obtain class certification. We hold that they need not.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Petitioner Erica P. John Fund, Inc. (EPJ Fund), is the lead plaintiff in a putative securities fraud class action filed against Halliburton Co. and one of its executives (collectively Halliburton). The suit was brought on behalf of all investors who purchased Halliburton common stock between June 3, 1999, and December 7, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-17\">EPJ Fund alleges that Halliburton made various misrepresentations designed to inflate its stock price, in violation of \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-5. See 48 Stat. 891, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b); 17 CFR \u00a7240.10b-5 (2010). The</p>\n<p id=\"b71-18\">[563 U.S. 808]</p>\n<p id=\"b71-19\">complaint asserts that Halliburton deliberately made false statements about (1) the scope of its potential liability in asbestos litigation, (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>its expected revenue from certain construction contracts, and (3) the benefits of its merger with another company. EPJ Fund contends that Halliburton later made a number of corrective disclosures that caused its stock price to drop and, consequently, investors to lose money.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">After defeating a motion to dismiss, EPJ Fund sought to have its proposed class certified pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. The parties agreed, and the District Court held, that EPJ Fund satisfied the general requirements for class actions set out in Rule 23(a): The class was sufficiently numerous, there were common questions of law or fact, the claims of the representative parties were typical, and the representative parties would fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The District Court also found that the action could proceed as a class action under Rule 23(b)(3), but for one problem: Circuit precedent required securities fraud plaintiffs to prove \u201closs causation\u201d in order to obtain class certification. <em>Id., </em>at 4a, and n. 2 (citing <em>Oscar Private Equity Invs. </em>v. <em>Allegiance Telecom, Inc., </em>487 F.3d 261, 269 (CA5 2007)). As the District Court explained, loss causation is the \u201c \u2018causal connection between the material misrepresentation and the [economic] loss\u2019 \u201d suffered by investors. App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a, and n. 3 (quoting <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Broudo, </em>544 U.S. 336, 342, 125 S. Ct. 1627, 161 L. Ed. 2d 577 (2005)). After reviewing the alleged misrepresentations and corrective disclosures, the District Court concluded that it could not certify the class in this case because EPJ Fund had \u201cfailed to establish loss causation with respect to any\u201d of its claims. App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a. The court made clear, however, that absent \u201cthis stringent loss causation requirement,\u201d it would have granted EPJ Fund\u2019s certification request. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">[563 U.S. 809]</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of class certification. See 597 F.3d 330 (CA5 2010). It confirmed that, \u201c [i]n order to obtain class certification on its claims, [EPJ Fund] was required to prove loss causation, i.e., that the corrected truth of the former falsehoods actually caused the stock price to fall and resulted in the losses.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 334. Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals concluded that EPJ Fund had failed to meet the \u201crequirements for proving loss causation at the class certification stage.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">We granted EPJ Fund\u2019s petition for certiorari, 562 U.S. 1127, 131 S. Ct. 856, 178 L. Ed. 2d 622 (2011), to resolve a conflict among the Circuits as to whether securities fraud plaintiffs must prove loss causation in order to obtain class certification. Compare 597 F.3d, at 334 (case below), with <em>In re Salomon Analyst Metromedia Litigation, </em>544 F.3d 474, 483 (CA2 2008) (not requiring investors to prove loss causation at class certification stage); <em>Schleicher </em>v. <em>Wendt, </em>618 F.3d 679, 687 (CA7 2010) (same); <em>In re DVI, Inc. Securities Litigation, </em>639 F.3d 623, 636-637 (CA3 2011) (same; decided after certiorari was granted).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">EPJ Fund contends that the Court of Appeals erred by requiring proof of loss causation for class certification. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">As noted, the sole dispute here is whether EPJ Fund satisfied the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>requisites of Rule 23(b)(3).  In order to certify a class under that Rule, a court must find \u201cthat the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3). Considering whether \u201cquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate\u201d begins, of course, with the elements of the underlying cause of action.  The elements of a private securities fraud claim based</p>\n<p id=\"AcEk\">[563 U.S. 810]</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">on violations of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 are: \u201c\u2018(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scien-ter; (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. </em>v. <em>Siracusano, ante, </em>at 37-38, 131 S. Ct. 1309, 179 L. Ed. 2d 398 (quoting <em>Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC </em>v. <em>Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., </em>552 U.S. 148, 157, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Whether common questions of law or fact predominate in a securities fraud action often turns on the element of reliance. The courts below determined that EPJ Fund had to prove the separate element of loss causation in order to establish that reliance was capable of resolution on a common, classwide basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\u201cReliance by the plaintiff upon the defendant\u2019s deceptive acts is an essential element of the \u00a7 10(b) private cause of action.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 159, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627. This is because proof of reliance ensures that there is a proper \u201cconnection between a defendant\u2019s misrepresentation and a plaintiffs injury.\u201d <em>Basic Inc. </em>v. <em>Levinson, </em>485 U.S. 224, 243, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1988). The traditional (and most direct) way a plaintiff can demonstrate reliance is by showing that he was aware of a company\u2019s statement and engaged in a relevant <em>transaction\u2014e.g., </em>purchasing common stock\u2014based on that specific misrepresentation. In that situation, the plaintiff plainly would have relied on the company\u2019s deceptive conduct. A plaintiff unaware of the relevant statement, on the other hand, could not establish reliance on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">We recognized in <em>Basic, </em>however, that limiting proof of reliance in such a way \u201cwould place an unnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary burden on the Rule 10b-5 plaintiff who has traded on an impersonal market.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 245, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194. We also observed that \u201c  [Requiring proof of individualized reliance from each member of the proposed plaintiff class effectively would\u201d prevent such plaintiffs \u201cfrom proceeding with a class action, since individual issues\u201d would \u201coverwhelm [ ] the common <em>ones.\u201dId., </em>at 242, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">[563 U.S. 811]</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">The Court in <em>Basic </em>sought to alleviate those related concerns by permitting plaintiffs to invoke a re-buttable presumption of reliance based on what is known as the \u201cfraud-on-the-market\u201d theory. According to that theory, \u201cthe market price of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepresentations.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 246, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194. Because the market \u201ctransmits information to the investor in the processed form of a market price,\u201d we can assume, the Court explained, that an investor re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>lies on public misstatements whenever he \u201cbuys or sells stock at the price set by the market.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 244, 247, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Stoneridge, supra, </em>at 159, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627; <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, </em>544 U.S., at 341-342, 125 S. Ct. 1627, 161 L. Ed. 2d 577. The Court also made clear that the presumption was just that, and could be rebutted by appropriate evidence. See <em>Basic, supra, </em>at 248, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">It is undisputed that securities fraud plaintiffs must prove certain things in order to invoke <em>Basic\u2019s </em>re-buttable presumption of reliance. It is common ground, for example, that plaintiffs must demonstrate that the alleged misrepresentations were publicly known (else how would the market take them into account?), that the stock traded in an efficient market, and that the relevant transaction took place \u201cbetween the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed.\u201d <em>Basic, </em>485 U.S., at 248, n. 27, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194; <em>id., </em>at 241-247, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194; see also <em>Stoneridge, supra, </em>at 159, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">According to the Court of Appeals, EPJ Fund also had to establish loss causation at the certification stage to \u201ctrigger the fraud-on-the-market presumption.\u201d 597 F.3d, at 335 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>ibid. </em>(EPJ Fund must \u201cestablish a causal link between the alleged falsehoods and its losses in order to invoke the fraud-on-the-market presumption\u201d). The court determined that, in order to invoke a rebuttable presumption of reliance, EPJ Fund needed to prove that the decline in Halliburton\u2019s stock was</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">[563 U.S. 812]</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">\u201cbecause of the correction to a prior misleading statement\u201d and \u201cthat the subsequent loss could not otherwise be explained by some additional factors revealed then to the market.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 336 (emphasis deleted). This is the loss causation requirement as we have described it. See <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, supra, </em>at 342, 125 S. Ct. 1627, 161 L. Ed. 2d 577; see also 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u\u20144(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 requirement is not justified by <em>Basic </em>or its logic. To begin,  we have never before mentioned loss causation as a precondition for invoking <em>Basic\u2019s </em>rebuttable presumption of reliance. The term \u201closs causation\u201d does not even appear in our <em>Basic </em>opinion. And for good reason: Loss causation addresses a matter different from whether an investor relied on a misrepresentation, presumptively or otherwise, when buying or selling a stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">We have referred to the element of reliance in a private Rule 10b-5 action as \u201ctransaction causation,\u201d not loss causation. <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, supra, </em>at 341-342, 125 S. Ct. 1627, 161 L. Ed. 2d 577 (citing <em>Basic, supra, </em>at 248-249, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194). Consistent with that description, when considering whether a plaintiff has relied on a misrepresentation, we have typically focused on facts surrounding the investor\u2019s decision to engage in the transaction. See <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, supra, </em>at 342, 125 S. Ct. 1627, 161 L. Ed. 2d 577. Under <em>Basic\u2019s </em>fraud-on-the-market doctrine, an investor presumptively relies on a defendant\u2019s misrepresentation if that \u201cinformation is reflected in [the] market price\u201d of the stock at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>the relevant transaction. See <em>Basic, supra, </em>at 247, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Loss causation, by contrast, requires a plaintiff to show that a misrepresentation that affected the integrity of the market price <em>also </em>caused a subsequent economic loss. As we made clear in <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, </em>the fact that a stock\u2019s \u201cprice on the date of purchase was inflated because of [a] misrepresentation\u201d does not necessarily mean that the misstatement is the cause of a later decline in value. 544 U.S., at 342, 125 S. Ct. 1627, 161 L. Ed. 2d 577 (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted). We observed that the drop could instead be the</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">[563 U.S. 813]</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">result of other intervening causes, such as \u201cchanged economic circumstances, changed investor expectations, new industry-specific or firm-specific facts, conditions, or other events.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 342-343, 125 S. Ct. 1627, 161 L. Ed. 2d 577. If one of those factors were responsible for the loss or part of it, a plaintiff would not be able to prove loss causation to that extent. This is true even if the investor purchased the stock at a distorted price, and thereby presumptively relied on the misrepresentation reflected in that price.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">According to the Court of Appeals, however, an inability to prove loss causation would prevent a plaintiff from invoking the rebuttable presumption of reliance. Such a rule contravenes <em>Basic\u2019s </em>fundamental premise\u2014that an investor presumptively relies on a misrepresentation so long as it was reflected in the market price at the time of his transaction. The fact that a subsequent loss may have been caused by factors other than the revelation of a misrepresentation has nothing to do with whether an investor relied on the misrepresentation in the first place, either directly or presumptively through the fraud-on-the-market theory. Loss causation has no logical connection to the facts necessary to establish the efficient market predicate to the fraud-on-the-market theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">The Court of Appeals erred by requiring EPJ Fund to show loss causation as a condition of obtaining class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">Halliburton concedes that securities fraud plaintiffs should not be required to prove loss causation in order to invoke <em>Basic\u2019s </em>presumption of reliance or otherwise achieve class certification. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26-29. Halliburton nonetheless defends the judgment below on the ground that the Court of Appeals did not actually require plaintiffs to prove \u201closs causation\u201d as we have used that term. See <em>id., </em>at 27 (\u201cit\u2019s not loss causation as this Court knows it in <em>Dura\u201d). </em>According to Halliburton, \u201closs causation\u201d was</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">[563 U.S. 814]</p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">merely \u201cshorthand\u201d for a different analysis. Brief for Respondents 18. The lower court\u2019s actual inquiry, Halliburton insists, was whether EPJ Fund had demonstrated \u201cprice impact\u201d\u2014that is, whether the alleged misrepresentations affected the market price in the first place. See, <em>e.g., id., </em>at 16-19, 24-27, 50-51; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 27 (stating that the Court of Appeals\u2019 \u201ctest is simply price impact\u201d and that EPJ Fund\u2019s \u201conly burden under the Fifth Circuit case law was to show price impact\u201d).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>\u201cPrice impact\u201d simply refers to the effect of a misrepresentation on a stock price. Halliburton\u2019s theory is that if a misrepresentation does not affect market price, an investor cannot be said to have relied on the misrepresentation merely because he purchased stock at that price. If the price is unaffected by the fraud, the price does not reflect the fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">We do not accept Halliburton\u2019s wishful interpretation of the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion. As we have explained, loss causation is a familiar and distinct concept in securities law; it is not price impact. While the opinion below may include some language consistent with a \u201cprice impact\u201d approach, see, <em>e.g., </em>597 F.3d, at 336, we simply cannot ignore the Court of Appeals\u2019 repeated and explicit references to \u201closs causation,\u201d see <em>id., </em>at 334 (three times), 334, n. 2, 335 (twice), 335, n. 10 (twice), 335, n. 11, 336, 336, n. 19, 336, n. 20, 337, 338, 341 (twice), 341, n. 46, 342, n. 47, 343, 344 (three times).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Whatever Halliburton thinks the Court of Appeals meant to say, what it said was loss causation: \u201c[EPJ Fund] was required to prove loss causation, i.e., that the corrected</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">[563 U.S. 815]</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">truth of the former falsehoods actually caused the stock price to fall and resulted in the losses.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 334; see <em>id., </em>at 335 (\u201cwe require plaintiffs to establish loss causation in order to trigger the fraud-on-the-market presumption\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). We take the Court of Appeals at its word. Based on those words, the decision below cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"pAm9\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"41\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAATgAAAApAQAAAACJ+QhNAAAAlUlEQVR4nO2UsQ0CMQxFXz4FlBQMcIPcAOzBAowAu10JO1zBALQIKaG0C1sKQnRx9/y+5aRxaXSV+mIjN3KWq74TgwDeXsXwj/e168MaCQioixtMQIDW1S2IQUA530wlIIDT0+2KoTTgtXUqBgHcL07FIIDjzqkYBLT9bCYBAXWaTCUgYDMfTCXw1X87qjdXxp38KfcBotI3CU52rt0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"311\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">Because we conclude the Court of Appeals erred by requiring EPJ Fund to prove loss causation at the certification stage, we need not, and do not, address any other question about <em>Basic, </em>its presumption, or how and when it may be rebutted.
