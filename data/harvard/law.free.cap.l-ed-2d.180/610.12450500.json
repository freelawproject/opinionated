Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314 (2009), this Court held that  a forensic laboratory report stating that a suspect substance was cocaine ranked as testimonial for purposes of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause. The report had been created specifically to serve as evidence in a criminal proceeding. Absent stipulation, the Court ruled, the prosecution may not introduce such a report without offering a live witness competent to testify to the truth of the statements made in the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">In the case before us, petitioner Donald Bullcoming was arrested on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>charges of driving while intoxicated (DWI). Principal evidence against Bullcoming was a forensic laboratory report certifying that Bullcoming\u2019s blood-alcohol concentration was well above the threshold for aggravated DWI. At trial, the prosecution did not call as a witness the analyst who signed the certification. Instead, the State called another analyst who was familiar with the laboratory\u2019s testing procedures, but had neither participated in nor observed the test on Bullcoming\u2019s blood sample. The New Mexico Supreme Court determined that, although the blood-alcohol analysis was \u201ctestimonial,\u201d the Confrontation Clause did not require the certifying analyst\u2019s in-court testimony. Instead,</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">[564 U.S. 652]</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">New Mexico\u2019s high court held, live testimony of another analyst satisfied the constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The question presented is whether the Confrontation Clause permits the prosecution to introduce a forensic laboratory report containing a testimonial certification\u2014made for the purpose of proving a particular fact\u2014 through the in-court testimony of a scientist who did not sign the certification or perform or observe the test reported in the certification. We hold that surrogate testimony of that order does not meet the constitutional requirement. The accused\u2019s right is to be confronted with the analyst who made the certification, unless that analyst is unavailable at trial, and the accused had an opportunity, pretrial, to cross-examine that particular scientist.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">In August 2005, a vehicle driven by petitioner Donald Bullcoming rear ended a pickup truck at an intersection in Farmington, New Mexico. When the truckdriver exited his vehicle and approached Bullcoming to exchange insurance information, he noticed that Bullcoming\u2019s eyes were bloodshot. Smelling alcohol on Bull-coming\u2019s breath, the truckdriver told his wife to call the police. Bullcoming left the scene before the police arrived, but was soon apprehended by an officer who observed his performance of field sobriety tests. Upon failing the tests, Bullcoming was arrested for driving a vehicle while \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d (DWI), in violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 66-8-102 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">Because Bullcoming refused to take a breath test, the police obtained a warrant authorizing a blood-alcohol analysis. Pursuant to the warrant, a sample of Bullcoming\u2019s blood was drawn at a local hospital. To determine Bullcoming\u2019s blood-alcohol concentration (BAC), the police sent the sample to the New Mexico Department of Health, Scientific Laboratory</p>\n<p id=\"ast-dedup-0\">[564 U.S. 653]</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">Division (SLD). In a standard SLD form titled \u201cReport of Blood Alcohol Analysis,\u201d participants in the testing were identified, and the forensic analyst certified his finding. App. 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">SLD\u2019s report contained in the top block \u201cinformation ... filled in by [the] arresting officer.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(capitalization omitted). This information included the \u201creason [the] suspect [was] stopped\u201d (the officer checked \u201cAccident\u201d), and the date (\u201c8.14.05\u201d) and time (\u201c18:25 PM\u201d) the blood sample was drawn. <em>Ibid, </em>(capitalization omitted). The arresting officer also affirmed that he had arrested Bullcom-ing and witnessed the blood draw. <em>Ibid. </em>The next two blocks contained certifications by the nurse who drew Bullcoming\u2019s blood and the SLD in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>take employee who received the blood sample sent to the laboratory. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Following these segments, the report presented the \u201ccertificate of analyst,\u201d <em>ibid, </em>(capitalization omitted), completed and signed by Curtis Cay-lor, the SLD forensic analyst assigned to test Bullcoming\u2019s blood sample. <em>Id., </em>at 62, 64-65. Caylor recorded that the BAC in Bullcoming\u2019s sample was 0.21 grams per hundred milliliters, an inordinately high level. <em>Id., </em>at 62. Cay-lor also affirmed that \u201c[t]he seal of th[e] sample was received intact and broken in the laboratory,\u201d that \u201cthe statements in [the analyst\u2019s block of the report] are correct,\u201d and that he had \u201cfollowed the procedures set out on the reverse of th[e] report.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Those \u201cprocedures\u201d instructed analysts, <em>inter alia, </em>to \u201cretai[n] the sample container and the raw data from the analysis,\u201d and to \u201cnot[e] any circumstance or condition which might affect the integrity of the sample or otherwise affect the validity of the analysis.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 65. Finally, in a block headed \u201ccertificate of reviewer,\u201d the SLD examiner who reviewed Caylor\u2019s analysis certified that Caylor was qualified to conduct the BAC test, and that the \u201cestablished procedure\u201d for handling and analyzing Bullcoming\u2019s sample \u201cha[d] been followed.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 62 (capitalization omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">[564 U.S. 654]</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">SLD analysts use gas chromato-graph machines to determine BAC levels. Operation of the machines requires specialized knowledge and training. Several steps are involved in the gas chromatograph process, and human error can occur at each step.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">[564 U.S. 655]</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Caylor\u2019s report that Bullcoming\u2019s BAC was 0.21 supported a prosecution for aggravated DWI, the thresh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>old for which is a BAC of 0.16 grams per hundred milliliters, \u00a7 66-8-102(D)(1). The State accordingly charged Bullcoming with this more serious crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The case was tried to a jury in November 2005, after our decision in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004), but before <em>Melendez-Diaz. </em>On the day of trial, the State announced that it would not be calling SLD analyst Curtis Caylor as a witness because he had \u201cvery recently [been] put on unpaid leave\u201d for a reason not revealed. 2010-NMSC-007, \u00b6 8, 147 N.M. 487, 492, 226 P.3d 1, 6 (internal quotation marks omitted); App. 58. A startled defense counsel objected. The prosecution, she complained, had never disclosed, until trial commenced, that the witness \u201cout there . . . [was] not the analyst [of Bullcom-ing\u2019s sample].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 46. Counsel stated that, \u201chad [she] known that the analyst [who tested Bullcoming\u2019s blood] was not available,\u201d her opening, indeed, her entire defense \u201cmay very well have been dramatically different.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 47. The State, however, proposed to introduce Caylor\u2019s finding as a \u201cbusiness record\u201d during the testimony of Gerasimos Razatos, an SLD scientist who had neither observed nor reviewed Caylor\u2019s analysis. <em>Id., </em>at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Bullcoming\u2019s counsel opposed the State\u2019s proposal. <em>Id., </em>at 44-45. Without Caylor\u2019s testimony, defense counsel maintained, introduction of the analyst\u2019s finding would violate Bull-coming\u2019s Sixth Amendment right \u201cto be confronted with</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">[564 U.S. 656]</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">the witnesses against him.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The trial court overruled the objection, <em>id., </em>at 46-47, and admitted the SLD report as a business record, <em>id., </em>at 44-46, 57.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury convicted Bullcoming of aggravated DWI, and the New Mexico Court of Appeals upheld the conviction, concluding that \u201cthe blood alcohol report in the present case was non-testimonial and prepared routinely with guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d 2008-NMCA-097, \u00b6 17, 144 N.M. 546, 552, 189 P.3d 679, 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">While Bullcoming\u2019s appeal was pending before the New Mexico Supreme Court, this Court decided <em>Melendez-Diaz. </em>In that case, \u201c[t]he Massachusetts courts [had] admitted into evidence affidavits reporting the results of forensic analysis which showed that material seized by the police and connected to the defendant was cocaine.\u201d 557 U.S., at 307, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314. Those affidavits, the Court held, were \u201c \u2018testimonial,\u2019 rendering the affiants \u2018witnesses\u2019 subject to the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">In light of <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>the New Mexico Supreme Court acknowledged that the blood-alcohol report intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>duced at Bullcoming\u2019s trial qualified as testimonial evidence. Like the affidavits in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>the court observed, the report was \u201cfunctionally identical to live, in-court testimony, doing precisely what a witness does on direct examination.\u201d 147 N.M., at 494, 226 P.3d, at 8 (quoting <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">[564 U.S. 657]</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">U.S., at 310-311, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless, for two reasons, the court held that admission of the report did not violate the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">First, the court said certifying analyst Caylor \u201cwas a mere scrivener,\u201d who \u201csimply transcribed the results generated by the gas chromatograph machine.\u201d 147 N.M., at 494-495, 226 P.3d, at 8-9. Second, SLD analyst Razatos, although he did not participate in testing Bullcoming\u2019s blood, \u201cqualified as an expert witness with respect to the gas chromatograph machine.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 495, 226 P.3d, at 9. \u201cRazatos provided live, in-court testimony,\u201d the court stated, \u201cand, thus, was available for cross-examination regarding the operation of the . . . machine, the results of [Bullcoming\u2019s] BAC test, and the SLD\u2019s established laboratory procedures.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Razatos\u2019 testimony was crucial, the court explained, because Bullcoming could not cross-examine the machine or the written report. <em>Id., </em>at 496, 226 P.3d, at 10. But \u201c[Bullcoming\u2019s] right of confrontation was preserved,\u201d the court concluded, because Razatos was a qualified analyst, able to serve as a surrogate for Caylor. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">We granted certiorari to address this question: Does the Confrontation Clause permit the prosecution to introduce a forensic laboratory report containing a testimonial certification, made in order to prove a fact at a criminal trial, through the in-court testimony of an analyst who did not sign the certification or personally perform or observe the performance of the test reported in the certification. 561 U.S. 1058, 131 S. Ct. 62, 177 L. Ed. 2d 1152 (2010). Our answer is in line with controlling precedent:  As a rule, if an out-of-court statement is testimonial in nature, it may not be introduced against the accused at trial unless the witness who made the statement is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity to confront that witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">[564 U.S. 658]</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">Because the New Mexico Supreme Court permitted the testimonial statement of one witness, <em>i.e., </em>Caylor, to enter into evidence through the in-court testimony of a second person, <em>i.e., </em>Razatos, we reverse that court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b661-13\">The Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause confers upon the accused, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, ... the right... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d In a pathmarking 2004 decision, <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>we overruled <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980), which had interpreted the Confrontation Clause to allow admission of absent witnesses\u2019 testimonial statements based on a judicial determination of reliability. See <em>id., </em>at 448 U.S., at 66, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597. Rejecting <em>Roberts\u2019 </em>\u201camorphous notions of \u2018reliability,\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S., at 61, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177, <em>Crawford </em>held that  fidelity to the Confrontation Clause permitted admission of \u201ctestimonial statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>of witnesses absent from trial. . . only where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 59, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. See <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S. 344-354, 131 S. Ct. 1143, 179 L. Ed. 2d 93 (2011) (\u201c[F]or testimonial evidence to be admissible, the Sixth Amendment \u2018demands what the common law required: unavailability [of the witness] and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S., at 68, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177)). <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>relying on <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>rationale, refused to create a \u201cforensic evidence\u201d exception to this rule. 557 U.S., at 317-321, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   An analyst\u2019s certification prepared in connection with a criminal investigation or prosecution, the Court held, is \u201ctestimonial,\u201d and</p>\n<p id=\"A-Jx\">[564 U.S. 659]</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">therefore within the compass of the Confrontation Clause. <em>Id., </em>at 321-324, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The State in the instant case never asserted that the analyst who signed the certification, Curtis Caylor, was unavailable. The record showed only that Caylor was placed on unpaid leave for an undisclosed reason. See <em>supra, </em>at 655, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 618. Nor did Bullcoming have an opportunity to cross-examine Caylor. <em>Crawford. </em>and <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>therefore, weigh heavily in Bullcoming\u2019s favor. The New Mexico Supreme Court, however, although recognizing that the SLD report was testimonial for purposes of the Confrontation Clause, considered SLD analyst Razatos an adequate substitute for Caylor. We explain first why Razatos\u2019 appearance did not meet the Confrontation Clause requirement. We next address the State\u2019s argument that the SLD report ranks as \u201cnontestimonial,\u201d and therefore \u201c[was] not subject to the Confrontation Clause\u201d in the first place. Brief for Respondent 7 (capitalization omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The New Mexico Supreme Court held surrogate testimony adequate to satisfy the Confrontation Clause in this case because analyst Caylor \u201csimply transcribed the resul[t] generated by the gas chromatograph machine,\u201d presenting no interpretation and exercising no independent judgment. 226 P.3d, at 8. Bullcoming\u2019s \u201ctrue \u2018accuser,\u2019 \u201d the court said, was the machine, while testing analyst Caylor\u2019s role was that of \u201cmere scrivener.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 9. Caylor\u2019s certification, however,</p>\n<p id=\"A4oI\">[564 U.S. 660]</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">reported more than a machine-generated number. See <em>supra, </em>at 653, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">Caylor certified that he received Bullcoming\u2019s blood sample intact with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>the seal unbroken, that he checked to make sure that the forensic report number and the sample number \u201ccorrespond [ed],\u201d and that he performed on Bullcoming\u2019s sample a particular test, adhering to a precise protocol. App. 62-65. He further represented, by leaving the \u201c[r]emarks\u201d section of the report blank, that no \u201ccircumstance or condition . . . affect[ed] the integrity of the sample or . . . the validity of the analysis.\u201d Id., at 62, 65. These representations, relating to past events and human actions not revealed in raw, machine-produced data, are meet for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">The potential ramifications of the New Mexico Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning, furthermore, raise red flags. Most witnesses, after all, testify to their observations of factual conditions or events, <em>e.g., </em>\u201cthe light was green,\u201d \u201cthe hour was noon.\u201d Such witnesses may record, on the spot, what they observed. Suppose a police report recorded an objective fact\u2014Bullcom-ing\u2019s counsel posited the address above the front door of a house or the readout of a radar gun. See Brief for Petitioner 35. Could an officer other than the one who saw the number on the house or gun present the information in court\u2014so long as that officer was equipped to testify about any technology the observing officer deployed and the police department\u2019s standard operating procedures? As our precedent makes plain, the answer is emphatically \u201cNo.\u201d See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 826, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224 (2006) (Confrontation Clause may not be \u201cevaded by having a note-taking police [officer] recite the . . . testimony of the declarant\u201d (emphasis deleted)); <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S., at 334, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe Court made clear in <em>Davis </em>that it will not permit the testimonial statement of one witness to enter into evidence through the in-court testimony of a second.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">[564 U.S. 661]</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The New Mexico Supreme Court stated that the number registered by the gas chromatograph machine called for no interpretation or exercise of independent judgment on Caylor\u2019s part. 147 N.M., at 494-495, 226 P.3d, at 8-9. We have already explained that Caylor certified to more than a machine-generated number. See <em>supra, </em>at 653, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 617. In any event, the comparative reliability of an analyst\u2019s testimonial report drawn from machine-produced data does not overcome the Sixth Amendment bar. This Court settled in <em>Crawford' </em>that  the \u201cobviou[s] rehab [ility]\u201d of a testimonial statement does not dispense with the Confrontation Clause. 541 U.S., at 62, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177; see <em>id., </em>at 61, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (Clause \u201ccommands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing [the evidence] in the crucible of cross-examination\u201d). Accordingly, the  analysts who write reports that the prosecution introduces must be made available for confrontation even if they possess \u201cthe scientific acumen of Mme. Curie and the veracity of Mother Teresa.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S., at 319-320, n. 6, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Recognizing that admission of the blood-alcohol analysis depended on \u201clive, in-court testimony [by] a qualified analyst,\u201d 147 N.M., at 496, 226 P.3d, at 10, the New Mexico Supreme Court believed that Razatos could substitute for Caylor because Razatos \u201cqualified as an expert witness with respect to the gas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>chromatograph machine and the SLD\u2019s laboratory procedures,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 9. But surrogate testimony of the kind Razatos was equipped to give could not convey what Caylor knew or observed about the events his certification concerned, <em>i.e., </em>the particular test and testing process he employed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor could such surrogate</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">[564 U.S. 662]</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">testimony expose any lapses or lies on the certifying analyst\u2019s part.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Significant here, Razatos had no knowledge of the reason why Caylor had been placed on unpaid leave. With Caylor on the stand, Bullcoming\u2019s counsel could have asked questions designed to reveal whether incompetence, evasiveness, or dishonesty accounted for Cay-lor\u2019s removal from his workstation. Notable in this regard, the State never asserted that Caylor was \u201cunavailable\u201d; the prosecution conveyed only that Caylor was on uncompensated leave. Nor did the State assert that Razatos had any \u201cindependent opinion\u201d concerning Bullcoming\u2019s BAC. See Brief for Respondent 58, n. 15. In this light, Caylor\u2019s live testimony could hardly be typed \u201ca hollow formality,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 677, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">More fundamentally, as this Court stressed in <em>Crawford, </em> \u201c[t]he text of the Sixth Amendment does not suggest any open-ended exceptions from the confrontation requirement to be developed by the courts.\u201d 541 U.S., at 54, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. Nor is it \u201cthe role of courts to extrapolate from the words of the [Confrontation Clause] to the values behind it, and then to enforce its guarantees only to the extent they serve (in the courts\u2019 views) those underlying values.\u201d <em>Giles </em>v. <em>California, </em>554 U.S. 353, 375, 128 S. Ct. 2678, 171 L. Ed. 2d 488 (2008) (plurality). Accordingly, the Clause does not tolerate dispensing with confrontation simply because the court believes that questioning one witness about another\u2019s testimonial statements provides a fair enough opportunity for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">A recent decision involving another Sixth Amendment right\u2014the right to counsel\u2014is instructive. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. 140, 126 S. Ct. 2557, 165 L. Ed. 2d 409 (2006), the Government</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">[564 U.S. 663]</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">argued that illegitimately denying a defendant his counsel of choice did not violate the Sixth Amendment where \u201csubstitute counsel\u2019s performance\u201d did not demonstrably prejudice the defendant. <em>Id., </em>at 144-145, 126 S. Ct. 2557, 165 L. Ed. 2d 409. This Court rejected the Government\u2019s argument. \u201c[T]rue enough,\u201d the Court explained, \u201cthe purpose of the rights set forth in [the Sixth] Amendment is to ensure a fair trial; but it does not follow that the rights can be disregarded so long as the trial is, on the whole, fair.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 145, 126 S. Ct. 2557, 165 L. Ed. 2d 409. If a \u201cparticular guarantee\u201d of the Sixth Amendment is violated, no substitute procedure can cure the violation, and \u201c[n]o additional showing of prejudice is required to make the violation \u2018complete.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 146, 126 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Ct. 2557, 165 L. Ed. 2d 409. If representation by substitute counsel does not satisfy the Sixth Amendment, neither does the opportunity to confront a substitute witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">In short, when the State elected to introduce Caylor\u2019s certification, Cay-lor became a witness Bullcoming had the right to confront. Our precedent cannot sensibly be read any other way. See <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S., at 334, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (Court\u2019s holding means \u201cthe . . . analyst who must testify is the person who signed the certificate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">We turn, finally, to the State\u2019s contention that SLD\u2019s blood-alcohol analysis reports are nontestimonial in character, therefore no Confrontation Clause question even arises in this case. <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>left no room for that argument, the New Mexico Supreme Court concluded, see 147 N.M., at 494, 226 P.3d, at 7-8; <em>supra, </em>at 656-657, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 618-619, a conclusion we find inescapable.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">In <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>a state forensic laboratory, on police request, analyzed seized evidence (plastic bags) and reported the laboratory\u2019s analysis to the police (the substance found in the bags contained cocaine). 557 U.S., at 308, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314. The \u201ccertificates of analysis\u201d prepared by the analysts who tested the evidence in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>this Court held, were</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">[564 U.S. 664]</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">\u201cincontrovertibly . . . affirmation [s] made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact\u201d in a criminal proceeding. <em>Id., </em>at 310, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314 (internal quotation marks omitted). The same purpose was served by the certificate in question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">The State maintains that the affirmations made by analyst Caylor were not \u201cadversarial\u201d or \u201cinquisitorial,\u201d Brief for Respondent 27-33; instead, they were simply observations of an \u201cindependent scientist\u201d made \u201caccording to a non-adversarial public duty,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 32-33. That argument fares no better here than it did in <em>Melendez-Diaz. </em> A document created solely for an \u201cevidentiary purpose,\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>clarified, made in aid of a police investigation, ranks as testimonial. 557 U.S., at 311, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314 (forensic reports available for use at trial are \u201ctestimonial statements\u201d and certifying analyst is a \u201c \u2018witnes[s]\u2019 for purposes of the Sixth Amendment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">Distinguishing Bullcoming\u2019s case from <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>where the analysts\u2019 findings were contained in certificates \u201csworn to before a notary public,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 308, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314, the State emphasizes that the SLD report of Bullcoming\u2019s BAC was \u201cunsworn.\u201d Brief for Respondent 13; <em>post, </em>at 676, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 631 (\u201conly sworn statement\u201d here was that of Razatos, \u201cwho was present and [did] testifiy]\u201d). As the New Mexico Supreme Court recognized, \u201c \u2018the absence of [an] oath [i]s not dispositive\u2019 in determining if a statement is testimonial.\u201d 147 N.M., at 494, 226 P.3d, at 8 (quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S., at 52, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177). Indeed, in <em>Crawford, </em>this Court rejected as untenable any construction of the Confrontation Clause that would render inadmissible only sworn <em>ex parte </em>affidavits, while leaving admission of formal, but unsworn statements \u201cperfectly OK.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 52-53, n. 3, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. Reading the Clause in this \u201cimplausible\u201d manner, <em>ibid,, </em>the Court noted, would make the right to confrontation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>easily erasable. See <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 830-831, n. 5, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224; <em>id., </em>at 838, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">In all material respects, the laboratory report in this case resembles those in <em>Melendez-Diaz. </em>Here, as in <em>Melendez-Diaz,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">[564 U.S. 665]</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">a law-enforcement officer provided seized evidence to a state laboratory required by law to assist in police investigations, N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 29-3-4 (2004). Like the analysts in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>analyst Caylor tested the evidence and prepared a certificate concerning the result of his analysis. App. 62. Like the <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>certificates, Caylor\u2019s certificate is \u201cformalized\u201d in a signed document, <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 837, n. 2, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224 (opinion of Thomas, J.), headed a \u201creport,\u201d App. 62. Noteworthy as well, the SLD report form contains a legend referring to municipal and magistrate courts\u2019 rules that provide for the admission of certified blood-alcohol analyses.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">In sum, the formalities attending the \u201creport of blood alcohol analysis\u201d are more than adequate to qualify Caylor\u2019s assertions as testimonial. The absence of notarization does not remove his certification from Confrontation Clause governance. The New Mexico Supreme Court, guided by <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>correctly recognized that Caylor\u2019s report \u201cfell within the core class of testimonial statements,\u201d 147 N.M., at 493, 226 P.3d, at 7, described in this Court\u2019s leading Confrontation Clause decisions: <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S., at 310, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314; <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 830, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224; <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S., at 51-52, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">The State and its <em>amici </em>urge that unbending application of the Confrontation Clause to forensic evidence would impose an undue burden on the prosecution. This argument, also advanced in the dissent, <em>post, </em>at 683, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 635-636, largely repeats a refrain rehearsed and rejected in <em>Melendez-Diaz. See 557 U.S., </em>at 325-328, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314. The constitutional requirement, we reiterate, \u201cmay not [be] disregarded] ... at our convenience,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 325, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314, and the predictions of dire consequences, we again observe, are dubious, see <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">New Mexico law, it bears emphasis, requires the laboratory to preserve samples, which can be retested by other analysts, see N.M. Admin. Code \u00a7 7.33.2.15(A)(4)-(6) (2010),</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">[564 U.S. 666]</p>\n<p id=\"b666-13\">available at http://www.nmcpr.state.nm.us/ nmac/_title07/T07C033.htm, and neither party questions SLD\u2019s compliance with that requirement. Retesting \u201cis almost always an option ... in [DWI] cases,\u201d Brief for Public Defender Service for District of Columbia et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>25 (hereinafter PDS Brief), and the State had that option here: New Mexico could have avoided any Confrontation Clause problem by asking Razatos to retest the sample, and then testify to the results of his retest rather than to the results of a test he did not conduct or observe.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-14\">Notably, New Mexico advocates retesting as an effective means to preserve a defendant\u2019s confrontation right \u201cwhen the [out-of-court] statement is raw data or a mere transcription of raw data onto a public record.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Brief for Respondent 53-54. But the State would require the defendant to initiate retesting. <em>Id., </em>at 55; <em>post, </em>at 677, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 632 (defense \u201cremains free to . . . call and examine the technician who performed a test\u201d); <em>post, </em>at 681, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 634 (\u201cfree retesting\u201d is available to defendants). The prosecution, however, bears the burden of proof. <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S., at 324, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314 (\u201c[T]he Confrontation Clause imposes a burden on the prosecution to present its witnesses, not on the defendant to bring those adverse witnesses into court.\u201d). Hence the obligation to propel retesting when the original analyst is unavailable is the State\u2019s, not the defendant\u2019s. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>484 U.S. 400, 410, n. 14, 108 S. Ct. 646, 98 L. Ed. 2d 798 (1988) (Confrontation Clause\u2019s requirements apply \u201cin every case, whether or not the defendant seeks to rebut the case against him or to present a case of his own\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Furthermore, notice-and-demand procedures, long in effect in many jurisdictions, can reduce burdens on forensic laboratories. Statutes governing these procedures typically \u201crender ... otherwise hearsay forensic reports admissible[,] while specifically preserving a defendant\u2019s right to demand that the prosecution call the author/analyst of [the] report.\u201d PDS Brief 9; see <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S., at 326, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314 (observing that notice-and-demand statutes \u201cpermit the defendant to assert (or forfeit by silence) his Confrontation Clause right</p>\n<p id=\"AJr2\">[564 U.S. 667]</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">after receiving notice of the prosecution\u2019s intent to use a forensic analyst\u2019s report\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Even before this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Crawford, </em>moreover, it was common prosecutorial practice to call the forensic analyst to testify. Prosecutors did so \u201cto bolster the persuasive power of [the State\u2019s] case[,] . . . [even] when the defense would have preferred that the analyst did <em>not </em>testify.\u201d PDS Brief 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">We note also the \u201csmall fraction of . . . cases\u201d that \u201cactually proceed to trial.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S., at 325, 129 S.

And, \u201cwhen cases in which forensic analysis has been conducted [do] go to trial,\u201d defendants \u201cregularly . . . [stipulate] to the admission of [the] analysis.\u201d PDS Brief 20. \u201c[A]s a result, analysts testify in only a very small percentage of cases,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 21, for \u201c [i] t is unlikely that defense counsel will insist on live testimony whose effect will be merely to highlight rather than cast doubt upon the forensic <em>analysis.\u201d Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S., at 328, 129 S.

Gas chromatography is a widely used scientific method of quantitatively analyzing the constituents of a mixture. See generally H. McNair &amp; J.

Ed. 2d 93.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As applied to a scientific report, <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>explained</p>\n<p id=\"Auvf\">[564 U.S. 670]</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">that pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 803, \u201c[d]ocuments kept in the regular course of business may ordinarily be admitted at trial despite their hearsay status,\u201d except \u201cif the regularly conducted business activity is the production of evidence for use at trial.\u201d 557 U.S., at 321, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314 (citing Fed. Rule Evid. 803(6)). In that circumstance, the hearsay rules bar admission of even business records. Relatedly, in the Confrontation Clause context, business and public records \u201care generally admissible absent confrontation . . . because\u2014having been created for the administration of an entity\u2019s affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial\u2014they are not testimonial.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S., at 324, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314. We concluded, therefore, that because the purpose of the certificates of analysis was use at trial, they were not properly admissible as business or public records under the hearsay rules, <em>id., </em>at 321-322, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314, nor were they admissible under the Confrontation Clause, <em>id., </em>at 324, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314. The hearsay rule\u2019s recognition of the certificates\u2019 evidentiary purpose thus confirmed our decision that the certificates were testimonial under the primary purpose analysis required by the Confrontation Clause. See <em>id., </em>at 311, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314 (explaining that under Massachusetts law not just the purpose but the <em>\u201csole purpose </em>of the affidavits was to provide\u201d evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Similarly, in this case, for the reasons the Court sets forth the BAC report and Caylor\u2019s certification on it clearly have a \u201cprimary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S., at 358, 131 S. Ct. 1143, 179 L. Ed. 2d 93. The Court also explains why the BAC report is not materially distinguishable from the certificates we held testimonial in <em>Melendez-Diaz. See 557 </em>U.S., at 308, 310-311, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L.

Although \u201c[formality is not the sole touchstone of our primary purpose inquiry,\u201d a statement\u2019s formality or informality can shed light on whether a particular statement has a primary purpose of use at trial. <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S., at 366, 131 S. Ct. 1143, 179 L. Ed. 2d 93.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I agree with the Court\u2019s assessment that the certificate at issue here is a formal statement, despite the absence of notarization. <em>Ante, </em>at 664, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 623; <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S., at 52, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (\u201c[T]he absence of [an] oath [is] not disposi-tive\u201d). The formality derives from the fact that the analyst is asked to sign his name and \u201ccertify\u201d to both the result and the statements on the form. A \u201ccertification\u201d requires one \u201c [t] o attest\u201d that the accompanying statements are true. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 258 (9th ed. 2009) (definition of \u201ccertify\u201d); see also <em>id., </em>at 147 (defining \u201cattest\u201d as \u201c[t]o bear witness; testify,\u201d or \u201c [t] o affirm to be true or genuine; to authenticate by signing as a witness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">In sum, I am compelled to conclude that the report has a \u201cprimary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">[564 U.S. 672]</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">trial testimony,\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S., at 358, 131 S. Ct. 1143, 179 L. Ed. 2d 93, which renders it testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">After holding that the report was testimonial, the New Mexico Supreme Court nevertheless held that its admission was permissible under the Confrontation Clause for two reasons: because Caylor was a \u201cmere scrivener,\u201d and because Razatos could be cross-examined on the workings of the gas chromatograph and laboratory procedures. 147 N.M., at 494-496, 226 P.3d, at 8-10. The Court convincingly explains why those rationales are incorrect. <em>Ante, </em>at 659-663, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 620-622. Therefore, the New Mexico court contravened our precedents in holding that the report was admissible via Razatos\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">Although this case is materially indistinguishable from the facts we considered in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>I highlight some of the factual circumstances that this case does <em>not </em>present.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">First, this is not a case in which the State suggested an alternative purpose, much less an alternative <em>primary </em>purpose, for the BAC report. For example, the State has not claimed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>the report was necessary to provide Bullcoming with medical treatment. See <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S., at 362, n. 9, 131 S. Ct. 1143, 179 L. Ed. 2d 93 (listing \u201cStatements for Purposes of Medical Diagnosis or Treatment\u201d under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(4) as an example of statements that are \u201cby their nature, made for a purpose other than use in a prosecution\u201d); <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S., at 312, n. 2, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314 (\u201c[M]edical reports created for treatment purposes . . . would not be testimonial under our decision today\u201d); <em>Giles </em>v. <em>California, </em>554 U.S. 353, 376, 128 S. Ct. 2678, 171 L. Ed. 2d 488 (2008) (\u201c[Statements to physicians in the course of receiving treatment would be excluded, if at all, only by hearsay rules\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">Second, this is not a case in which the person testifying is a supervisor, reviewer, or someone else with a personal, albeit limited, connection to the scientific test at issue. Razatos</p>\n<p id=\"A9qn\">[564 U.S. 673]</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">conceded on cross-examination that he played no role in producing the BAC report and did not observe any portion of Curtis Caylor\u2019s conduct of the testing. App. 58. The court below also recognized Razatos\u2019 total lack of connection to the test at issue. 147 N.M., at 492, 226 P.3d, at 6. It would be a different case if, for example, a supervisor who observed an analyst conducting a test testified about the results or a report about such results. We need not address what degree of involvement is sufficient because here Razatos had no involvement whatsoever in the relevant test and report.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Third, this is not a case in which an expert witness was asked for his independent opinion about underlying testimonial reports that were not themselves admitted into evidence. See Fed. Rule Evid. 703 (explaining that facts or data of a type upon which experts in the field would reasonably rely in forming an opinion need not be admissible in order for the expert\u2019s opinion based on the facts and data to be admitted). As the Court notes, <em>ante, </em>at 662, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 622, the State does not assert that Razatos offered an independent, expert opinion about Bullcoming\u2019s blood alcohol concentration. Rather, the State explains, \u201c[a]side from reading a report that was introduced as an exhibit, Mr. Razatos offered no opinion about Petitioner\u2019s blood alcohol content . . . .\u201d Brief for Respondent 58, n. 15 (citation omitted). Here the State offered the BAC report, including Caylor\u2019s testimonial statements, into evidence. We would face a different question if asked to determine the constitutionality of allowing an expert witness to discuss others\u2019 testimonial statements if the testimonial statements were not themselves admitted as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Finally, this is not a case in which the State introduced only machine-generated results, such as a printout from a gas chromatograph. The State here introduced Caylor\u2019s statements, which included his transcription of a blood alcohol concentration, apparently copied from a gas chromato-graph printout, along with other statements about the</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">[564 U.S. 674]</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">procedures used in handling the blood sample. See <em>ante, </em>at 659-660, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 620; App. 62 (\u201cI certify that I followed the procedures set out on the reverse of this report, and the statements in this block are correct\u201d). Thus, we do not decide whether, as the New Mexico Supreme Court suggests, 147 N.M., at 496, 226 P.3d, at 10, a State could introduce (assuming an adequate chain of custody foundation) raw data generated by a machine in conjunction with the testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>mony of an expert witness. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 16, n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">This case does not present, and thus the Court\u2019s opinion does not address, any of these factual scenarios.</p>\n<p id=\"pAiP\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"44\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAR0AAAArAQAAAABtRWHSAAAAxElEQVR4nO3UMQrCQBAF0J8lSAoxNoKd0dbGI0TwIB7BzjbgBbyRWHkBC3s7kRBBcBI030p2cBdsLBSy3RvmszswbEB8PKX53AM0Tf/dJLpQeGAAnHX94MFX31SFa+trlLgwwK2rQnnigQGiLLP1WO/8CyHQ2kxsvb2Ye0ByS3VWLsQAGOlJZj6Q7KlsPXYhBngM1UTVNPWAlGVsw0U+cCAhIFnfhi8duAiI+iT2vvu+SN9RguRRT71zId/bgqD5n36x6Qn7pLFRgAsnPwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"285\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">As in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>the primary purpose of the BAC report is clearly to serve as evidence. It is therefore testimonial, and the trial court erred in allowing the State to introduce it into evidence via Razatos\u2019 testimony. I respectfully concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-10\">. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s characterization, <em>Bryant </em>deemed reliability, as reflected in the hearsay rules, to be \u201crelevant,\u201d 562 U.S., at 359, 131 S. Ct. 1143, 179 L. Ed. 2d 93, not \u201cessential,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 678, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 632 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). The rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause, are designed primarily to police reliability; the purpose of the Confrontation Clause is to determine whether statements are testimonial and therefore require confrontation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b669-11\">. This is not to say, however, that every person noted on the BAC report must testify. As we explained in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>it is not the case \u201cthat anyone whose testimony may be relevant in establishing the chain of custody, authenticity of the sample, or accuracy of the testing device, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>must appear in person as part of the prosecution\u2019s case .... It is up to the prosecution to decide what steps in the chain of custody are so crucial as to require evidence . . . 557 U.S., at 311, n. 1, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b670-15\">. By looking to the formality of a statement, we do not \u201ctrea[t] the reliability of evidence as a reason to exclude it.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 678, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 632 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). Although in some instances formality could signal reliability, the dissent\u2019s argument fails to appreciate that, under our Confrontation Clause precedents, formality is primarily an indicator of testimonial purpose. Formality is not the sole indicator of the testimonial nature of a statement because it is too easily evaded. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 838, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224 (2006) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Nonetheless formality has long been a hallmark of testimonial statements because formality suggests that the statement is intended for use at trial. As we explained in <em>Bryant, </em>informality, on the other hand, \u201cdoes not necessarily indicate . . . lack of testimonial intent.\u201d 562 U.S., at 366, 131 S. Ct. 1143, 179 L. Ed. 2d 93. The dissent itself recognizes the relevance of formality to the testimonial inquiry when it notes the formality of the problematic unconfronted statements in Sir Walter Raleigh\u2019s trial. <em>Post, </em>at 680, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 634.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b672-6\">Justice Kennedy,</author>\n<p id=\"aqk-dedup-2\">with whom the Chief Justice, Justice Breyer, and Justice Alito join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause binds the States and the National Government. <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1965). Two Terms ago, in a case arising from a state criminal prosecution, the Court interpreted the Clause to mandate exclusion of a laboratory report sought to be introduced based on the authority of that report\u2019s own sworn statement that a test had been performed yielding the results as shown. <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. 305, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314 (2009). The Court\u2019s opinion in that case held the report inadmissible because no one was present at trial to testify to its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Whether or not one agrees with the reasoning and the result in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>the Court today takes the new and serious misstep of extending that holding to instances like this one. Here a knowledgeable representative of the laboratory</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">[564 U.S. 675]</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">was present to testify and to explain the lab\u2019s processes and the details of the report; but because he was not the analyst who filled out part of the form and transcribed onto it the test result from a machine printout, the Court finds a confrontation violation. Some of the principal objections to the Court\u2019s underlying theory have been set out earlier and need not be repeated here. See <em>id., </em>at 330-332, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). Additional reasons, applicable to the extension of that doctrine and to the new ruling in this case, are now explained in support of this respectful dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">Before today, the Court had not held that the Confrontation Clause bars admission of scientific findings when an employee of the testing laboratory authenticates the findings, testifies to the laboratory\u2019s methods and practices, and is cross-examined at trial. Far from replacing live testimony with \u201csystematic\u201d and \u201cextrajudicial\u201d examinations, <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 835, 836, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224 (2006) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted), these procedures are fully consistent with the Confrontation Clause and with well-established principles for ensuring that criminal trials are conducted in full accord with requirements of fairness and reliability and with the confrontation guarantee. They do not \u201cresemble Marian proceedings.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 837, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-14\">The procedures followed here, but now invalidated by the Court, make live testimony rather than the \u201csolemnity\u201d of a document the primary reason to credit the laboratory\u2019s scientific results. <em>Id., </em>at 838, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224. Unlike <em>Melendez-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number><em>Diaz, </em>where the jury was asked to credit a laboratory\u2019s findings based solely on documents that were \u201cquite plainly affidavits,\u201d 557 U.S., at 330, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L.

The only sworn statement at issue was that of the witness who was present and who testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The record reveals that the certifying analyst\u2019s role here was no greater than that of anyone else in the chain of custody. App. 56 (laboratory employee\u2019s testimony agreeing that \u201conce the material is prepared and placed in the machine, you don\u2019t need any particular expertise to record the results\u201d). The information contained in the report was the result of a scientific process comprising multiple participants\u2019 acts, each with its own evidentiary significance. These acts included receipt of the sample at the laboratory; recording its receipt; storing it; placing the sample into the testing device; transposing the printout of the results of the test onto the report; and review of the results. See <em>id., </em>at 48-56; see also Brief for New Mexico Department of Health, Scientific Laboratory Division, as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>4 (hereinafter New Mexico Scientific Laboratory Brief) (\u201cEach blood sample has original testing work by ... as many as seve[n] analysts . . .\u201d); App. 62 (indicating that this case involved three laboratory analysts who, respectively, received, analyzed, and reviewed analysis of the sample); cf.

T. 2009, No. 07-11191, p. 10 (explaining that DNA analysis can involve the combined efforts of up to 40 analysts).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">In the New Mexico scientific laboratory where the blood sample was processed, analyses are run in batches involving 40-60 samples. Each sample is identified by a computer-generated number that is not linked back to the file containing the name of the person from whom the sample came until after all testing is completed. See New Mexico Scientific Laboratory Brief 26. The analysis is mechanically performed by the gas chromatograph, which may operate\u2014as in this case\u2014after all the laboratory employees leave for the day. See <em>id., </em>at 17. And whatever the result, it is reported to both law enforcement and the defense. See <em>id., </em>at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">[564 U.S. 677]</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">The representative of the testing laboratory whom the prosecution called was a scientific analyst named Mr. Razatos. He testified that he \u201chelp[ed] in overseeing the administration of these programs throughout the State,\u201d and he was qualified to answer questions concerning each of these steps. App. 49. The Court has held that the government need not produce at trial \u201ceveryone who laid hands on the evidence,\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra, </em>at 311, n. 1, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314. Here, the defense used the opportunity in cross-examination to highlight the absence at trial of certain laboratory employees. Under questioning by Bullcom-ing\u2019s attorney, Razatos acknowledged that his name did not appear on the report; that he did not receive the sample, perform the analysis, or complete the review; and that he did not know the reason for some personnel decisions. App. 58. After weighing arguments from defense counsel con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>cerning these admissions, and after considering the testimony of Razatos, who knew the laboratory\u2019s protocols and processes, the jury found no reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">In these circumstances, requiring the State to call the technician who filled out a form and recorded the results of a test is a hollow formality. The defense remains free to challenge any and all forensic evidence. It may call and examine the technician who performed a test. And it may call other expert witnesses to explain that tests are not always reliable or that the technician might have made a mistake. The jury can then decide whether to credit the test, as it did here. The States, furthermore, can assess the progress of scientific testing and enact or adopt statutes and rules to ensure that only reliable evidence is admitted. Rejecting these commonsense arguments and the concept that reliability is a legitimate concern, the Court today takes a different course. It once more assumes for itself a central role in mandating detailed evidentiary rules, thereby extending and confirming <em>Melendez-Diaz\u2019s </em>\u201cvast potential to disrupt criminal procedures.\u201d 557 U.S., at 331, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">[564 U.S. 678]</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The protections in the Confrontation Clause, and indeed the Sixth Amendment in general, are designed to ensure a fair trial with reliable evidence. But the <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004), line of cases has treated the reliability of evidence as a reason to exclude it. Id., at 61-62, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. Today, for example, the Court bars admission of a lab report because it \u201cis formalized in a signed document.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 665, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 624 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court\u2019s unconventional and unstated premise is that the State\u2014by acting to ensure a statement\u2019s reliability\u2014makes the statement more formal and therefore less likely to be admitted. Park, Is Confrontation the Bottom Line? 19 Regent U. L. Rev. 459, 461 (2007). That is so, the Court insists, because reliability does not animate the Confrontation Clause. <em>Ante, </em>at 661, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 621; <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra, </em>at 317-318, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314; <em>Crawford, supra, </em>at 61-62, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. Yet just this Term the Court ruled that, in another confrontation context, reliability was an essential part of the constitutional inquiry. See <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S. 344, 358-359, 361-362, 131 S. Ct. 1143, 179 L. Ed. 2d 93 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Like reliability, other principles have weaved in and out of the <em>Crawford </em>jurisprudence. Solemnity has sometimes been dispositive, see <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S., at 310-311, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314; <em>id., </em>at 329-330, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314 (Thomas, J., concurring), and sometimes not, see <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S., at 834-837, 841, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). So, too, with the elusive distinction between utterances aimed at proving past events, and those calculated to help police keep the peace. Compare <em>Davis, supra, </em>and <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S., at 371-376, 131 S. Ct. 1143, 179 L. Ed. 2d 93, with <em>id., </em>at 384-387, 131 S. Ct. 1143, 179 L. Ed. 2d 93 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">It is not even clear which witnesses\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>testimony could render a scientific report admissible under the Court\u2019s approach. <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>stated an inflexible rule: Where \u201canalysts\u2019 affidavits\u201d included \u201ctestimonial statements,\u201d defendants were \u201centitled to be confronted with the analysts\u201d themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">[564 U.S. 679]</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">557 U.S., at 311, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314 (internal quotation marks omitted). Now, the Court reveals, this rule is either less clear than it first appeared or too strict to be followed. A report is admissible, today\u2019s opinion states, if a \u201clive witness competent to testify to the truth of the statements made in the report\u201d appears. <em>Ante, </em>at 651, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 615. Such witnesses include not just the certifying analyst, but also any \u201cscientist who . . . perform [ed] or observe [d] the test reported in the certification.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 652, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Today\u2019s majority is not committed in equal shares to a common set of principles in applying the holding of <em>Crawford. </em>Compare <em>Davis, supra </em>(opinion for the Court by Scalia, J.), with <em>id., </em>at 834, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L. Ed. 2d 224 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); and <em>Bryant, supra </em>(opinion for the Court by Sotomayor, J.), with <em>id., </em>at 378, 131 S. Ct. 1143, 179 L. Ed. 2d 93 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment), id<em>., </em>at 379, 131 S. Ct. 1143, 179 L. Ed. 2d 93 (Scalia, J., dissenting), and <em>id., </em>at 395, 131 S. Ct. 1143, 179 L. Ed. 2d 93 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); and <em>ante, </em>at 647, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 610 (opinion of the Court), with <em>ante, </em>at 668, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 626 (Sotomayor, J., concurring). That the Court in the wake of <em>Crawford </em>has had such trouble fashioning a clear vision of that case\u2019s meaning is unsettling; for <em>Crawford </em>binds every judge in every criminal trial in every local, state, and federal court in the Nation. This Court\u2019s prior decisions leave trial judges to \u201cguess what future rules this Court will distill from the sparse constitutional text,\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra, </em>at 331, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314 (Kennedy, J., dissenting), or to struggle to apply an \u201camorphous, if not entirely subjective,\u201d \u201chighly context-dependent inquiry\u201d involving \u201copen-ended balancing,\u201d <em>Bryant, supra, </em>at 393, 131 S. Ct. 1143, 179 L. Ed. 2d 93 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted) (listing 11 factors relevant under the majority\u2019s approach).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The persistent ambiguities in the Court\u2019s approach are symptomatic of a rule not amenable to sensible applications. Procedures involving multiple participants illustrate the problem. In <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>the Court insisted that its opinion</p>\n<p id=\"ADIG\">[564 U.S. 680]</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">did not require everyone in the chain of custody to testify but then qualified that \u201cwhat testimony <em>is </em>introduced must ... be introduced live.\u201d 557 U.S., at 311, n. 1, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314; <em>ante, </em>at 656, n. 2, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 618. This could mean that a statement that evidence remained in law-enforcement custody is admissible if the statement\u2019s maker appears in court. If so, an intern at police headquarters could review the evidence log, declare that chain of custody was retained, and so testify. The rule could also be that the intern\u2019s statement\u2014which draws on statements in the evidence log\u2014is inadmissible unless every officer who signed the log appears at trial. That rule, if applied to this case, would have conditioned admissibility of the report on the testimony of three or more identified witnesses. See App. 62. In other instances, 7 or even 40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>witnesses could be required. See <em>supra, </em>at 676, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 631. The court has thus\u2014in its fidelity to <em>Me</em>lendez-Diaz\u2014boxed itself into a choice of evils: render the Confrontation Clause <em>pro forma </em>or construe it so that its dictates are unworkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\"><em>Crawford, </em>itself does not compel today\u2019s conclusion. It is true, as <em>Crawford. </em>confirmed, that the Confrontation Clause seeks in part to bar the government from replicating trial procedures outside of public view. See 541 U.S., at 50, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177; <em>Bryant, supra, </em>at 358-359, 131 S. Ct. 1143, 179 L. Ed. 2d 93. <em>Crawford </em>explained that the basic purpose of the Clause was to address the sort of abuses exemplified at the notorious treason trial of Sir Walter Raleigh. 541 U.S., at 51, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177. On this view the Clause operates to bar admission of out-of-court statements obtained through formal interrogation in preparation for trial. The danger is that innocent defendants may be convicted on the basis of unreliable, untested statements by those who observed\u2014or claimed to have observed\u2014preparation for or commission of the crime. And, of course, those statements might not have been uttered at all or\u2014even if spoken\u2014might not have been true.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">[564 U.S. 681]</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">A rule that bars testimony of that sort, however, provides neither cause nor necessity to impose a constitutional bar on the admission of impartial lab reports like the instant one, reports prepared by experienced technicians in laboratories that follow professional norms and scientific protocols. In addition to the constitutional right to call witnesses in his own defense, the defendant in this case was already protected by checks on potential prosecutorial abuse such as free retesting for defendants; result-blind issuance of reports; testing by an independent agency; routine processes performed en masse, which reduce opportunities for targeted bias; and labs operating pursuant to scientific and professional norms and oversight. See Brief for Respondent 5, 14-15, 41, 54; New Mexico Scientific Laboratory Brief 2, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">In addition to preventing the State from conducting <em>ex parte </em>trials, <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>rejection of the regime of <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980), seemed to have two underlying jurisprudential objectives. One was to delink the intricacies of hearsay law from a constitutional mandate; and the other was to allow the States, in their own courts and legislatures and without this Court\u2019s supervision, to explore and develop sensible, specific eviden-tiary rules pertaining to the admissibility of certain statements. These results were to be welcomed, for this Court lacks the experience and day-to-day familiarity with the trial process to suit it well to assume the role of national tribunal for rules of evidence. Yet far from pursuing these objectives, the Court rejects them in favor of their opposites.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">Instead of freeing the Clause from reliance on hearsay doctrines, the Court has now linked the Clause with hearsay rules in their earliest, most rigid, and least refined formulations. See, <em>e.g., </em>Mosteller, Remaking Confrontation Clause and Hearsay Doctrine Under the Challenge of Child Sexual Abuse Prosecutions, 1993 U. Ill. L. Rev. 691, 739-740, 742, 744-746; Gallanis, The Rise of Modern Evidence Law, 84 Iowa L. Rev. 499, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>502-503, 514-515, 533-537(1999). In</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">[564 U.S. 682]</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">cases like <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>and this one, the Court has tied the Confrontation Clause to 18th-century hearsay rules unleavened by principles tending to make those rules more sensible. Sklansky, Hearsay\u2019s Last Hurrah, 2009 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 5-6, 36. As a result, the Court has taken the Clause far beyond its most important application, which is to forbid sworn, <em>ex parte, </em>out-of-court statements by un-confronted and available witnesses who observed the crime and do not appear at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Second, the States are not just at risk of having some of their hearsay rules reviewed by this Court. They often are foreclosed now from contributing to the formulation and enactment of rules that make trials fairer and more reliable. For instance, recent state laws allowing admission of well-documented and supported reports of abuse by women whose abusers later murdered them must give way, unless that abuser murdered with the specific purpose of foreclosing the testimony. <em>Giles </em>v. <em>California, </em>554 U.S. 353, 128 S. Ct. 2678, 171 L. Ed. 2d 488 (2008); Sklansky, <em>supra, </em>at 14-15. Whether those statutes could provide sufficient indicia of reliability and other safeguards to comply with the Confrontation Clause as it should be understood is, to be sure, an open question. The point is that the States cannot now participate in the development of this difficult part of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">In short, there is an ongoing, continued, and systemic displacement of the States and dislocation of the federal structure. Cf. <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S., at 307-309, 327-329, 129 S. Ct. 2527, 174 L. Ed. 2d 314. If this Court persists in applying wooden formalism in order to bar reliable testimony offered by the prosecution\u2014testimony thought proper for many decades in state and federal courts committed to devising fair trial processes\u2014then the States might find it necessary and appropriate to enact statutes to accommodate this new, intrusive federal regime. If they do, those rules could remain on state statute books for decades, even if subsequent decisions of this Court were to better implement the objectives of <em>Crawford. </em>This underscores</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">[564 U.S. 683]</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">the disruptive, long-term structural consequences of decisions like the one the Court announces today.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">States also may decide it is proper and appropriate to enact statutes that require defense counsel to give advance notice if they are going to object to introduction of a report without the presence in court of the technician who prepared it. Indeed, today\u2019s opinion relies upon laws of that sort as a palliative to the disruption it is causing. <em>Ante, </em>at 666-667, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 625 (plurality opinion). It is quite unrealistic, however, to think that this will take away from the defense the incentives to insist on having the certifying analyst present. There is in the ordinary case that proceeds to trial no good reason for defense counsel to waive the right of confrontation as the Court now interprets it.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">Today\u2019s opinion repeats an assertion from <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>that its decision will not \u201cimpose an undue burden on the prosecution.\u201d Ante, at 665, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 624 (plurality opinion). But evidence to the contrary already has begun to mount. See, <em>e.g., </em>Brief for State of California et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>7 (explaining that the 10 toxicologists for the Los Angeles Police Department spent 782 hours at 261 court appearances during a 1-year period); Brief for National District Attorneys Association et al. as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number><em>Amici Curiae </em>23 (observing that each blood-alcohol analyst in California processes 3,220 cases per year on average). New and more rigorous empirical studies further detailing the unfortunate effects of <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>are sure to be forthcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">In the meantime, New Mexico\u2019s experience exemplifies the problems ahead. From 2008 to 2010, subpoenas requiring New Mexico analysts to testify in impaired-driving cases rose 71%, to 1,600\u2014or 8 or 9 every workday. New Mexico Scientific Laboratory Brief 2. In a State that is the Nation\u2019s fifth largest by area and that employs just 10 total analysts, <em>id., </em>at 3, each analyst in blood-alcohol cases recently received 200 subpoenas per year, <em>id., </em>at 33. The analysts now must travel great distances on most working days. The result</p>\n<p id=\"axj-dedup-1\">[564 U.S. 684]</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">has been, in the laboratory\u2019s words, \u201cchaotic.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 5. And if the defense raises an objection and the analyst is tied up in another court proceeding; or on leave; or absent; or delayed in transit; or no longer employed; or ill; or no longer living, the defense gets a windfall. As a result, good defense attorneys will object in ever-greater numbers to a prosecution failure or inability to produce laboratory analysts at trial. The concomitant increases in subpoenas will further impede the state laboratory\u2019s ability to keep pace with its obligations. Scarce state resources could be committed to other urgent needs in the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"pAmMP\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"61\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAUwAAAA+AQAAAABoiB+MAAAAoklEQVR4nGP8z0Ak+MhErEoGhlGlo0pHlQ5JpR+QRbFy4EpvIMti5dDWrV84FBCC2Dkwpe+QJHFwYEr5kUtE7BwWKM1TkICQxcH5DwXN/5EANs4HeAi4INmJgwPV+k8byRysHLipvxwdEObg4ED1fngnjzAIKwdu6kdGJNdh5zBCQ+3PlQ8IS7FyPsID6zhy+GDjfKBNymIcrQ1HlY4qpYlSAGOuyGy0XxUCAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"332\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Seven years after its initiation, it bears remembering that the <em>Crawford' </em>approach was not preordained. This Court\u2019s missteps have produced an interpretation of the word \u201cwitness\u201d at odds with its meaning elsewhere in the Constitution, including elsewhere in the Sixth Amendment, see Amar, Sixth Amendment First Principles, 84 Geo. L. J. 641, 647, 691-696 (1996), and at odds with the sound administration of justice. It is time to return to solid ground. A proper place to begin that return is to decline to extend <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>to bar the reliable, commonsense evi-dentiary framework the State sought to follow in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
