The District Court did so because it had earlier denied a motion to certify a class in a related case, brought by a different plaintiff against the same defendant alleging similar claims. The federal court thought its injunction appropriate to prevent relitigation of the issue it had decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">We hold to the contrary. In issuing this order to a state court, the federal court exceeded its authority under the \u201crelitigation exception\u201d to the Anti-Injunction Act. That statutory provision permits a federal court to enjoin a state proceeding only in rare cases, when necessary to \u201cprotect or effectuate [the federal court\u2019s] judgments.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283. Here, that standard was not met for two reasons. First, the issue presented in the state court was not identical to the one decided in the federal tribunal. And second, the plaintiff in the state court did not have the requisite connection to the federal suit to be bound by the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b388-15\">Because the question before us involves the effect of a former adjudication on this case, we begin our statement of the facts not with this lawsuit, but with another. In August 2001, George McCollins sued respondent Bayer Corporation in the Circuit Court of Cabell County, West Virginia, asserting various state-law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>claims arising from Bayer\u2019s sale of an allegedly hazardous prescription drug called Baycol (which Bayer withdrew from the market that same month). McCollins contended that Bayer had violated West Virginia\u2019s consumer protection statute and the company\u2019s express and implied</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">[564 U.S. 303]</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">warranties by selling him a defective product. And pursuant to West Virginia Rule of Civil Procedure 23 (2011), McCollins asked the state court to certify a class of West Virginia residents who had also purchased Baycol, so that the case could proceed as a class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Approximately one month later, the suit now before us began in a different part of West Virginia. Petitioners Keith Smith and Shirley Sperlazza (Smith for short) filed state-law claims against Bayer, similar to those raised in McCollins\u2019 suit, in the Circuit Court of Brooke County, West Virginia. And like McCollins, Smith asked the court to certify under West Virginia\u2019s Rule 23 a class of Baycol purchasers residing in the State. Neither Smith nor McCollins knew about the other\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">In January 2002, Bayer removed McCollins\u2019 case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332, 1441. The case was then transferred to the District of Minnesota pursuant to a preexisting order of the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation, which had consolidated all federal suits involving Baycol (numbering in the tens of thousands) before a single District Court Judge. See \u00a7 1407. Bayer, however, could not remove Smith\u2019s case to federal court because Smith had sued several West Virginia defendants in addition to Bayer, and so the suit lacked complete diversity. See \u00a7 1441(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Smith\u2019s suit thus remained in the state courthouse in Brooke County.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Over the next six years, the two cases proceeded along their separate pretrial paths at roughly the same pace. By 2008, both courts were preparing to turn to their respective plaintiffs\u2019 motions for class certification. The Federal District Court was the first to reach a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">[564 U.S. 304]</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">Applying Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the District Court declined to certify McCollins\u2019 proposed class of West Virginia Baycol purchasers. The District Court\u2019s reasoning proceeded in two steps. The court first ruled that, under West Virginia law, each plaintiff would have to prove \u201cactual injury\u201d from his use of Baycol to recover. App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a. The court then held that because the necessary showing of harm would vary from plaintiff to plaintiff, \u201cindividual issues of fact predominate [d]\u201d over issues common to all members of the proposed class, and so the case was not suitable for class treatment. <em>Id., </em>at 45a. In the same order, the District Court also dismissed McCollins\u2019 claims on the merits in light of his failure to demonstrate physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>injury from his use of Baycol. McCol-lins chose not to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Although McCollins\u2019 suit was now concluded, Bayer asked the District Court for another order based upon it, this one affecting Smith\u2019s case in West Virginia. In a motion\u2014receipt of which first apprised Smith of McCol-lins\u2019 suit\u2014Bayer explained that the proposed class in Smith\u2019s case was identical to the one the federal court had just rejected. Bayer therefore requested that the federal court enjoin the West Virginia state court from hearing Smith\u2019s motion to certify a class. According to Bayer, that order was appropriate to protect the District Court\u2019s judgment in McCollins\u2019 suit denying class certification. The District Court agreed and granted the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. <em>In re Baycol Prods. Litigation, </em>593 F.3d 716 (2010). The court noted that the Anti-Injunction Act generally prohibits federal courts from enjoining state court proceedings. But the court held that the Act\u2019s relitigation exception authorized</p>\n<p id=\"AfaN\">[564 U.S. 305]</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">the injunction here because ordinary rules of issue preclusion barred Smith from seeking certification of his proposed class. According to the court, Smith was invoking a similar class action rule as McCollins had used to seek certification \u201cof the same class\u201d in a suit alleging \u201cthe same legal theories,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 724; the issue in the state court therefore was \u201csufficiently identical\u201d to the one the federal court had decided to warrant preclusion, <em>ibid. </em>In addition, the court held, the parties in the two proceedings were sufficiently alike: Because Smith was an unnamed member of the class Mc-Collins had proposed, and because their \u201cinterests were aligned,\u201d Smith was appropriately bound by the federal court\u2019s judgment. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">We granted certiorari, 561 U.S. 1057, 131 S. Ct. 61, 177 L. Ed. 2d 1150 (2010), because the order issued here implicates two circuit splits arising from application of the Anti-Injunction Act\u2019s relitigation exception. The first involves the requirement of preclusion law that a subsequent suit raise the \u201csame issue\u201d as a previous case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The second concerns the scope of the rule that a court\u2019s judgment cannot bind nonparties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We think the</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">[564 U.S. 306]</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">District Court erred on both grounds when it granted the injunction, and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">The Anti-Injunction Act, first enacted in 1793, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-14\">\u201cA court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The statute, we have recognized, \u201cis a necessary concomitant of the Framers\u2019 decision to authorize, and Congress\u2019 decision to implement, a dual system of federal and state courts.\u201d <em>Chick Kam Choo </em>v. <em>Exxon Corp., </em>486 U.S. 140, 146, 108 S. Ct. 1684, 100 L. Ed. 2d 127 (1988). And the Act\u2019s core message is one of respect for state courts.  The Act broadly commands that those tribunals \u201cshall remain free from interference by federal courts.\u201d <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. </em>v. <em>Locomotive Engineers, </em>398 U.S. 281, 282, 90 S. Ct. 1739, 26 L. Ed. 2d 234 (1970). That edict is subject to only \u201cthree specifically defined exceptions.\u201d Id<em>., </em>at 286, 90 S. Ct. 1739, 26 L. Ed. 2d 234. And those exceptions, though designed for important purposes, \u201care narrow and are \u2018not [to] be enlarged by loose statutory construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chick Kam Choo, </em>486 U.S., at 146, 108 S. Ct. 1684, 100 L. Ed. 2d 127 (quoting <em>Atlantic Coast Line, </em>398 U.S., at 287, 90 S. Ct. 1739, 26 L. Ed. 2d 234; alteration in original). Indeed, \u201c[a]ny doubts as to the propriety of a federal injunction against state court proceedings should be resolved in favor of permitting the state courts to proceed.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 297, 90 S. Ct. 1739, 26 L. Ed. 2d 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">This case involves the last of the Act\u2019s three exceptions, known as the relitigation exception.  That exception is designed to implement \u201cwell-recognized concepts\u201d of claim and issue preclusion. <em>Chick Kam Choo, </em>486 U.S., at 147, 108 S. Ct. 1684, 100 L. Ed. 2d 127. The provision authorizes an injunction to prevent state litigation of a claim or issue \u201cthat previously was presented to and decided by the federal court.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>But in applying this exception, we have taken special care to keep it \u201cstrict and</p>\n<p id=\"app-dedup-0\">[564 U.S. 307]</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">narrow.\u201d Id<em>., </em>at 148, 108 S. Ct. 1684, 100 L. Ed. 2d 127. After all, a court does not usually \u201cget to dictate to other courts the preclusion consequences of its own judgment.\u201d 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4405, p. 82 (2d ed. 2002) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller). Deciding whether and how prior litigation has preclusive effect is usually the bailiwick of the <em>second </em>court (here, the one in West Virginia). So issuing an injunction under the reliti-gation exception is resorting to heavy artillery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For that reason, every benefit of the doubt goes toward the state court, see <em>Atlantic Coast Line, </em>398 U.S., at 287, 297, 90 S. Ct. 1739, 26 L. Ed. 2d 234; an injunction can issue only if preclusion is clear beyond peradventure.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The question here is whether the federal court\u2019s rejection of McCollins\u2019 proposed class precluded a later adjudication in state court of Smith\u2019s certification motion. For the federal court\u2019s determination of the class issue to have this preclusive effect, at least two conditions must be met.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>First, the issue the federal court decided must be the same as the one presented in the state tribunal. See 18 Wright &amp; Miller</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">[564 U.S. 308]</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u00a7 4417, at 412. And second, Smith must have been a party to the federal suit, or else must fall within one of a few discrete exceptions to the general rule against binding nonparties. See 18A id., \u00a7 4449, at 330. In fact, as we will explain, the issues before the two courts were not the same, and Smith was neither a party nor the exceptional kind of non-party who can be bound. So the courts below erred in finding the certification issue precluded, and erred all the more in thinking an injunction appropriate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">In our most recent case on the re-litigation exception, <em>Chick Kam Choo </em>v. <em>Exxon, </em>we applied the \u201csame issue\u201d requirement of preclusion law to invalidate a federal court\u2019s injunction. 486 U.S., at 151, 108 S. Ct. 1684, 100 L. Ed. 2d 127. The federal court had dismissed a suit involving Singapore law on grounds of <em>forum non conveni-ens. </em>After the plaintiff brought the same claim in Texas state court, the federal court issued an injunction barring the plaintiff from pursuing relief in that alternate forum. We held that the District Court had gone too far.  \u201c[A]n essential prerequisite for applying the relitigation exception,\u201d we explained, \u201cis that the . . . issues which the federal injunction insulates from litigation in state proceedings actually have been decided by the federal court.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 148, 108 S. Ct. 1684, 100 L. Ed. 2d 127. That prerequisite, we thought, was not satisfied because the issue to be adjudicated in state court was not the one the federal court had resolved. The federal court had considered the permissibility of the claim under federal <em>forum non conveniens </em>principles. But the Texas courts, we thought, \u201cwould apply a significantly different <em>forum non con-veniens </em>analysis,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 149, 108 S. Ct. 1684, 100 L. Ed. 2d 127; they had in prior cases rejected the strictness of the federal doctrine. Our conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"ALBx\">[564 U.S. 309]</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">followed: \u201c[W]hether the Texas <em>state </em>courts are an appropriate forum for [the plaintiffs] Singapore law claims has not yet been litigated.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Because the legal standards in the two courts differed, the issues before the courts differed, and an injunction was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">The question here closely resembles the one in <em>Chick Kam Choo. </em>The class Smith proposed in state court mirrored the class McCollins sought to certify in federal court: Both included all Baycol purchasers resident in West Virginia. Moreover, the substantive claims in the two suits broadly overlapped: Both complaints alleged that Bayer had sold a defective prod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>uct in violation of the State\u2019s consumer protection law and the company\u2019s warranties. So far, so good for preclusion. But not so fast: a critical question\u2014the question of the applicable legal standard\u2014remains. The District Court ruled that the proposed class did not meet the requirements of Federal Rule 23 (because individualized issues would predominate over common ones). But the state court was poised to consider whether the proposed class satisfied <em>West Virginia </em>Rule 23. If those two legal standards differ (as federal and state <em>forum non conveniens </em>law differed in <em>Chick Kam </em>Choo)\u2014then the federal court resolved an issue not before the state court. In that event, much like in <em>Chick Kam Choo, </em>\u201cwhether the [West Virginia] <em>state </em>cour[t]\u201d should certify the proposed class action \u201chas not yet been litigated.\u201d 486 U.S., at 149, 108 S. Ct. 1684, 100 L. Ed. 2d 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">The Court of Appeals and Smith offer us two competing ways of deciding whether the West Virginia and Federal Rules differ, but we think the right path lies somewhere in the middle. The Eighth Circuit relied almost exclusively on the near-identity of the two Rules\u2019 texts. See 593 F.3d, at 723. That was the right place to start, but not to end.  Federal and state courts, after all, can and do apply identically worded procedural provisions in widely varying ways. If a State\u2019s procedural provision tracks the language of a Federal Rule, but a state court interprets that provision in a manner</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">[564 U.S. 310]</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">federal courts have not, then the state court is using a different standard and thus deciding a different issue. See 18 Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 4417, at 454 (stating that preclusion is \u201cinappropriate\u201d when \u201cdifferent legal standards . . . masquerad[e] behind similar legal labels\u201d). At the other extreme, Smith contends that the source of law is all that matters: a different sovereign must in each and every case \u201c \u2018have the opportunity, if it chooses, to construe its procedural rule differently.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioners 22 (quoting ALI, Principles of the Law, Aggregate Litigation \u00a7 2.11, Reporters\u2019 Notes, Comment <em>b, </em>p. 179 (2010)). But if state courts have made crystal clear that they follow the same approach as the federal court applied, we see no need to ignore that determination; in that event, the issues in the two cases would indeed be the same. So a federal court considering whether the relitigation exception applies should examine whether state law parallels its federal counterpart. But as suggested earlier, see <em>supra, </em>at 307, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 349, the federal court must resolve any uncertainty on that score by leaving the question of preclusion to the state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Under this approach, the West Virginia Supreme Court has gone some way toward resolving the matter before us by declaring its independence from federal courts\u2019 interpretation of the Federal Rules\u2014and particularly of Rule 23. In <em>In re W. Va. Rezulin Litigation, </em>214 W. Va. 52, 585 S.E.2d 52 (2003) <em>(In re Rezulin), </em>the West Virginia high court considered a plaintiffs motion to certify a class\u2014 coincidentally enough, in a suit about an allegedly defective pharmaceutical product. The court made a point of complaining about the parties\u2019 and lower court\u2019s near-exclusive reliance on federal cases about Federal Rule 23 to decide the certification question. Such cases, the court cautioned, \u201c \u2018may be persuasive, but [they are] not binding or controlling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 61, 585 S.E.2d, at 61. And lest anyone mistake the import of this message, the court went on: The aim of \u201cthis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>rule is to avoid having our legal analysis of our Rules \u2018amount to</p>\n<p id=\"Axi0\">[564 U.S. 311]</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">nothing more than Pavlovian responses to federal decisional law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis deleted). Of course, the state courts might still have adopted an approach to their Rule 23 that tracked the analysis the federal court used in Mc-Collins\u2019 case. But absent clear evidence that the state courts had done so, we could not conclude that they would interpret their Rule in the same way. And if that is so, we could not tell whether the certification issues in the state and federal courts were the same. That uncertainty would preclude an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">But here the case against an injunction is even stronger, because the West Virginia Supreme Court has <em>disapproved, </em>the approach to Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s predominance requirement that the Federal District Court embraced. Recall that the federal court held that the presence of a single individualized issue\u2014injury from the use of Baycol\u2014prevented class certification. See <em>supra, </em>at 304, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 348. The court did not identify the common issues in the case; nor did it balance these common issues against the need to prove individual injury to determine which predominated. The court instead applied a strict test barring class treatment when proof of each plaintiffs injury is necessary.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> By contrast, the West Virginia Supreme Court in <em>In re Rezulin </em>adopted an all-things-considered, balancing inquiry in interpreting its Rule 23. Rejecting any \u201crigid test,\u201d the state court opined that the predominance requirement \u201ccontemplates a review of many factors.\u201d 214 W. Va., at 72, 585 S.E.2d, at 72. Indeed, the court noted, a \u201c \u2018single common issue\u2019 \u201d in a case could outweigh \u201c \u2018numerous . . . individual questions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>That meant, the court further explained (quoting what it termed</p>\n<p id=\"a6m-dedup-0\">[564 U.S. 312]</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">the \u201cleading treatise\u201d on the subject), that even objections to certification \u201c \u2018based on . . . causation, or reliance\u2019 \u201d\u2014which typically involve showings of individual injury\u2014\u201c \u2018will not bar predominance satisfaction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting 2 A. Conte &amp; H. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions \u00a7 4.26, p. 241 (4th ed. 2002)). So point for point, the analysis set out in <em>In re Rezulin </em>diverged from the District Court\u2019s interpretation of Federal Rule 23. A state court using the <em>In re Rezulin </em>standard would decide a different question than the one the federal court had earlier resolved.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">This case, indeed, is little more than a rerun of <em>Chick Kam Choo. </em>A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>federal court and a state court apply different law. That means they decide distinct questions. The federal court\u2019s resolution of one issue does not preclude the state court\u2019s determination of another. It then goes without saying that the federal court may not issue an injunction. The Anti-Injunction Act\u2019s /'e-litigation exception does not extend nearly so far.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The injunction issued here runs into another basic premise of preclusion law:  A court\u2019s judgment binds only the parties to a suit, subject to a handful of discrete and limited exceptions. See, <em>e.g., </em>18A Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 4449, at 330. The</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">[564 U.S. 313]</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">importance of this rule and the narrowness of its exceptions go hand in hand. We have repeatedly \u201cemphasize [d] the fundamental nature of the general rule\u201d that only parties can be bound by prior judgments; accordingly, we have taken a \u201cconstrained approach to non-party preclusion.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Sturgell, </em>553 U.S. 880, 898, 128 S. Ct. 2161, 171 L. Ed. 2d 155 (2008). Against this backdrop, Bayer defends the decision below by arguing that Smith\u2014an unnamed member of a proposed but un-certified class\u2014qualifies as a party to the McCollins litigation. See Brief for Respondent 32-34. Alternatively, Bayer claims that the District Court\u2019s judgment binds Smith under the recognized exception to the rule against nonparty preclusion for members of class actions. See <em>id., </em>at 34-39. We think neither contention has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">Bayer\u2019s first claim ill-comports with any proper understanding of what a \u201cparty\u201d is.  In general, \u201c[a] \u2018party\u2019 to litigation is \u2018[o]ne by or against whom a lawsuit is brought,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States ex rel. Eisenstein </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>556 U.S. 928, 933, 129 S. Ct. 2230, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1255 (2009), or one who \u201cbecome [s] a party by intervention, substitution, or third-party practice,\u201d <em>Karcher </em>v. <em>May, </em>484 U.S. 72, 77, 108 S. Ct. 388, 98 L. Ed. 2d 327 (1987). And we have further held that an unnamed member of a <em>certified </em>class may be \u201cconsidered a \u2018party\u2019 for the [particular] purpos[e] of appealing\u201d an adverse judgment. <em>Devlin </em>v. <em>Scardelletti, </em>536 U.S. 1, 7, 122 S. Ct. 2005, 153 L. Ed. 2d 27 (2002). But as the dissent in <em>Devlin </em>noted, no one in that case was \u201cwilling to advance the novel and surely erroneous argument that a nonnamed class member is a party to the class-action litigation <em>before the class is certified.\u201d Id., </em>at 16, n. 1, 122 S. Ct. 2005, 153 L. Ed. 2d 27 (opinion of Scalia, J.). Still less does that argument make sense <em>once certification is denied. </em>The definition of the term \u201cparty\u201d can on no account be stretched so far as to cover a person like Smith, whom the plaintiff in a lawsuit was denied leave to represent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If the judgment in the McCol-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>lins litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">[564 U.S. 314]</p>\n<p id=\"AE0v\">can indeed bind Smith, it must do so under principles of non-party preclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">As Bayer notes, see Brief for Respondent 37, one such principle allows  unnamed members of a class action to be bound, even though they are not parties to the suit. See <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, </em>467 U.S. 867, 874, 104 S. Ct. 2794, 81 L. Ed. 2d 718 (1984) (\u201c[U]nder elementary principles of prior adjudication a judgment in a properly entertained class action is binding on class members in any subsequent litigation\u201d); see also <em>Taylor, </em>553 U.S., at 894, 128 S. Ct. 2161, 171 L. Ed. 2d 155 (stating that nonparties can be bound in \u201cproperly conducted class actions\u201d). But here Bayer faces a conundrum. If we know one thing about the McCol-lins suit, we know that it was <em>not </em>a class action. Indeed, the very ruling that Bayer argues ought to be given preclusive effect is the District Court\u2019s decision that a class could not properly be certified. So Bayer wants to bind Smith as a member of a class action (because it is only as such that a nonparty in Smith\u2019s situation can be bound) to a determination that there could not be a class action. And if the logic of that position is not immediately transparent, here is Bayer\u2019s attempt to clarify: \u201c[U]ntil the moment when class certification was denied, the <em>McCollins </em>case <em>was </em>a properly conducted class action.\u201d Brief for Respondent 37. That is true, according to Bayer, because McCollins\u2019 interests were aligned with the members of the class he proposed and he</p>\n<p id=\"AFd8\">[564 U.S. 315]</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u201cact[ed] in a representative capacity when he sought class certification.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">But wishing does not make it so. McCollins sought class certification, but he failed to obtain that result. Because the District Court found that individual issues predominated, it held that the action did not satisfy Federal Rule 23\u2019s requirements for class proceedings. In these circumstances, we cannot say that a properly conducted class action existed at any time in the litigation. Federal Rule 23 determines what is and is not a class action in federal court, where McCol-lins brought his suit. So in the absence of a certification under that Rule, the precondition for binding Smith was not met.  Neither a proposed class action nor a rejected class action may bind nonparties. What does have this effect is a class action approved under Rule 23. But McCollins\u2019 lawsuit was never that.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">We made essentially these same points in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Sturgell </em>just a few Terms ago. The question there concerned the propriety of binding non-parties under a theory of \u201cvirtual representation\u201d based on \u201cidentity of interests and some kind of relationship between parties and nonparties.\u201d 553 U.S., at 901, 128 S. Ct. 2161, 171 L. Ed. 2d 155. We rejected the theory unanimously, explaining that it \u201cwould Vecogniz[e], in effect, a common-law kind of class action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Such a device, we objected, would authorize preclusion \u201cshorn of [Rule 23\u2019s] procedural protections.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Or as otherwise stated in the opinion: We could not allow \u201ccircumvent[ion]\u201d of Rule 23\u2019s protections through a \u201cvirtual representation doctrine that allowed courts to \u2018create <em>de facto </em>class actions at will.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We could hardly have been more clear that a \u201cproperly conducted class action,\u201d with binding effect on nonparties, can come about in federal courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>in just one way\u2014through the procedure set out in Rule 23. Bayer attempts to distinguish <em>Taylor </em>by noting that the party in the prior litigation there did not propose a class action. But we do not see why that difference matters. Yes, McCollins wished to represent a</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">[564 U.S. 316]</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">class, and made a motion to that effect. But it did not come to pass. To allow McCollins\u2019 suit to bind nonparties would be to adopt the very theory <em>Taylor </em>rejected.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Bayer\u2019s strongest argument comes not from established principles of preclusion, but instead from policy concerns relating to use of the class action device. Bayer warns that under our approach class counsel can repeatedly try to certify the same class \u201cby the simple expedient of changing the named plaintiff in the caption of the complaint.\u201d Brief for Respondent 47-48. And in this world of \u201cserial relitigation of class certification,\u201d Bayer contends, defendants \u201cwould be forced in effect to buy litigation peace by settling.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 2, 12; see also <em>In re Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., Tires Prods. Liability Litigation, </em>333 F.3d 763, 767 (CA7 2003) (objecting to \u201can asymmetric system in which class counsel can win but never lose\u201d because of their ability to relitigate the issue of certification).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">But this form of argument flies in the face of the rule against nonparty preclusion. That rule perforce leads to relitigation of many issues, as plaintiff after plaintiff after plaintiff (none precluded by the last judgment because none a party to the last suit) tries his hand at establishing some legal principle or obtaining some grant of relief. We confronted a similar policy concern in <em>Taylor, </em>which involved</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">[564 U.S. 317]</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">litigation brought under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The Government there cautioned that unless we bound nonparties a \u201c \u2018potentially limitless\u2019 \u201d number of plaintiffs, perhaps coordinating with each other, could \u201cmount a series of repetitive lawsuits\u201d demanding the selfsame documents. 553 U.S., at 903, 128 S. Ct. 2161, 171 L. Ed. 2d 155. But we rejected this argument, even though the payoff in a single successful FOIA suit\u2014disclosure of documents to the public\u2014could \u201ctrum[p]\u201d or \u201csubsum[e]\u201d all prior losses, just as a single successful class certification motion could do. <em>In re </em>Bridgestone/<em>Firestone, </em>333 F.3d, at 766, 767. As that response suggests, our legal system generally relies on principles of <em>stare decisis </em>and comity among courts to mitigate the sometimes substantial costs of similar litigation brought by different plaintiffs. We have not thought that the right approach (except in the discrete categories of cases we have recognized) lies in binding nonparties to a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">And to the extent class actions raise special problems of relitigation, Congress has provided a remedy that does not involve departing from the usual rules of preclusion. In the Class Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>tion Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332(d), 1453 (2006 ed. and Supp. III), Congress enabled defendants to remove to federal court any sizable class action involving minimal diversity of citizenship. Once removal takes place, Federal Rule 23 governs certification. And federal courts may consolidate multiple overlapping suits against a single defendant in one court (as the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation did for the many actions involving Baycol). See \u00a7 1407. Finally, we would expect federal courts to apply principles of comity to each other\u2019s class certification decisions when addressing a common dispute. See, <em>e.g., Cortez Byrd Chips, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bill Harbert Constr. Co., </em>529 U.S. 193, 198, 120 S. Ct. 1331, 146 L. Ed. 2d 171 (2000) (citing <em>Landis </em>v. <em>North American Co., </em>299 U.S. 248, 254, 57 S. Ct. 163, 81 L. Ed. 153 (1936)). CAFA may be cold comfort to Bayer with respect to suits like this one beginning before its enactment. But Congress\u2019s decision to address the relitigation</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">[564 U.S. 318]</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">concerns associated with class actions through the mechanism of removal provides yet another reason for federal courts to adhere in this context to longstanding principles of preclusion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And once again, that is especially so when the federal court is deciding whether to go so far as to enjoin a state proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"pAlRE\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"64\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAUIAAABAAQAAAABHaUOOAAAArElEQVR4nO2VMQoCQQxF/+gWFoKl5W7vJRQ8iEfwAB5O72Cxp1hmwUJE/BYzkIAJbrNd0r3kkcnAkEnEtLgtJopAmGGG+cfMOmdDNXtdtGG+OR+rTlIOFHNQNQ+KudE7x4EGALA+n6ToQDGX24sUHah3P6oDPSBJfnaUsOFaer4Oe+niAUkyD620saH2HJOazIFEAHjfs5xoQ93ezVON5sAcbynFLxNmmGH+xBfYz3mMjA9Q6QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"322\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The Anti-Injunction Act prohibits the order the District Court entered here. The Act\u2019s relitigation exception authorizes injunctions only when a former federal adjudication clearly precludes a state court decision. As we said more than 40 years ago, and have consistently maintained since that time, \u201c[a]ny doubts . . . should be resolved in favor of permitting the state courts to proceed.\u201d <em>Atlantic Coast Line, </em>398 U.S., at 297, 90 S. Ct. 1739, 26 L. Ed. 2d 234. Under this approach, close cases have easy answers: The federal court should not issue an injunction, and the state court should decide the preclusion question. But this case does not even strike us as close. The issues in the federal and state lawsuits differed because the relevant legal standards differed. And the mere proposal of a class in the federal action could not bind persons who were not parties there. For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-16\"> Justice Thomas joins Parts I and II-A of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-12\">. The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, 119 Stat. 4, which postdates and therefore does not govern this lawsuit, now enables a defendant to remove to federal court certain class actions involving nondiverse parties.

That is especially so because an injunction is not the only way to correct a state trial court\u2019s erroneous refusal to give preclusive effect to a federal judgment. As we have noted before, \u201cthe state appellate courts and ultimately this Court\u2019\u2019 can review and reverse such a ruling. <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. </em>v. <em>Locomotive Engineers, </em>398 U.S. 281, 287, 90 S. Ct. 1739, 26 L. Ed. 2d 234 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b391-10\">. We have held that federal common law governs the preclusive effect of a decision of a federal court sitting in diversity.

Smith assumes that federal common law should here incorporate West Virginia\u2019s preclusion law, see Brief for Petitioners 15-16, whereas Bayer favors looking only to federal rules of preclusion because of the federal interests at stake in this case, see Brief for Respondent 18. We do not think the question matters here. Neither party identifies any way in which federal and state principles of preclusion law differ in any relevant respect. Nor have we found any such divergence. Compare, <em>e.g., Montana </em>v. <em>United States, </em>440 U.S. 147, 153-154, 99 S. Ct. 970, 59 L.

We therefore need not decide whether, in general, federal common law ought to i ncorporate state law in situations such as this.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b392-12\">. Because we rest our decision on the Anti-Injunction Act and the principles of issue preclusion that inform it, we do not consider Smith\u2019s argument, based on <em>Phillips Petroleum Co. </em>v. <em>Shutts, </em>472 U.S. 797, 105 S. Ct. 2965, 86 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1985), that the District Court\u2019s action violated the Due Process Clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b394-10\">. The District Court\u2019s approach to the predominance inquiry is consistent with the approach employed by the Eighth Circuit. See <em>In re St. Jude Medical, Inc., </em>522 F.3d 836, 837-840 (2008) (holding that most commercial misrepresentation cases are \u201cunsuitable for class treatment\u2019\u2019 because individual issues of reliance necessarily predominate). We express no opinion as to the correctness of this approach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b394-11\">. Bayer argues that <em>In re Rezulin </em>does not preclude an injunction in this case because the West Virginia court there decided that common issues predominated over individual issues of damages, not over individual issues of liability (as exist here). See Brief for Respondent 25-26. We think Bayer is right about this distinction, but wrong about its consequence. Our point is not that <em>In re Rezulin </em>dictates the answer to the class certification question here; the two cases are indeed too dissimilar for that to be true. The point instead is that <em>In re Rezulin </em>articulated a general approach to the predominance requirement that differs markedly from the one the federal court used. Minor variations in the application of what is in essence the same legal standard do not defeat preclusion; but where, as here, the State\u2019s courts \u201cwould apply a significantly different . . . analysis,\" <em>Chick Kam Choo </em>v. <em>Exxon Corp., </em>486 U.S. 140, 149, 108 S.

In support of its claim that Smith counts as a party, Bayer cites two cases in which we held that a putative member of an uncertified class may wait until after the court rules on the certification motion to file an individual claim or move to intervene in the suit. See Brief for Respondent 32-33 (citing <em>United Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>432 U.S. 385, 97 S. Ct. 2464, 53 L. Ed. 2d 423 (1977); <em>American Pipe &amp; Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>414 U.S. 538, 94 S. Ct. 756, 38 L. Ed. 2d 713 (1974)). But these cases, which were specifically grounded in policies of judicial administration, demonstrate only that a person not a party to a class suit may receive certain benefits (such as the tolling of a limitations period) related to that proceeding. See <em>id., </em>at 553, 94 S. Ct. 756, 38 L. Ed. 2d 713; <em>McDonald, </em>432 U.S., at 394, n. 15, 97 S. Ct. 2464, 53 L. Ed. 2d 423. That result is consistent with a commonplace of preclusion law\u2014that nonparties sometimes may benefit from, even though they cannot be bound by, former litigation.
