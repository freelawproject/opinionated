In accord with the text and purpose of the Act, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Missouri Pacific R. Co., </em>352 U.S. 500, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1957), and the uniform view of federal appellate courts, we conclude that the Act does not incorporate \u201cproximate cause\u201d standards developed in nonstatutory common-law tort actions. The charge proper in FELA cases, we hold, simply tracks the language Congress employed, informing juries that a defendant railroad caused or contributed to a plaintiff employee\u2019s injury if the railroad\u2019s negligence played any part in bringing about the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">[564 U.S. 689]</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Respondent Robert McBride worked as a locomotive engineer for petitioner CSX Transportation, Inc., which operates an interstate system of railroads. On April 12, 2004, CSX assigned McBride to assist on a local run between Evansville, Indiana, and Mount Vernon, Illinois. The run involved frequent starts and stops to add and remove individual rail cars, a process known as \u201cswitching.\u201d The train McBride was to operate had an unusual engine configuration: two \u201cwide-body\u201d engines followed by three smaller conventional cabs. McBride protested that the configuration was unsafe, because switching with heavy, wide-body engines required constant use of a hand-operated independent brake. But he was told to take the train as is. About ten hours into the run, McBride injured his hand while using the independent brake. Despite two surgeries and extensive physical therapy, he never regained full use of the hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">Seeking compensation for his injury, McBride commenced a FELA action against CSX in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. He alleged that CSX was twice negligent: First, the railroad required him to use equipment unsafe for switching; second, CSX failed to train him to operate that equipment. App. 24a-26a. A verdict for McBride would be in order, the District Court instructed, if the jury found that CSX \u201cwas negligent\u201d and that the \u201cnegligence caused or contributed to\u201d McBride\u2019s injury. <em>Id., </em>at 23a.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">CSX sought additional charges that the court declined to give. One of the rejected instructions would have required \u201cthe plaintiff [to] show that. . . the defendant\u2019s negligence was a proximate cause of the injury.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 34a. Another would have defined \u201cproximate cause\u201d to mean \u201cany cause which, in natural or probable sequence, produced the injury com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>plained of,\u201d with the qualification that a proximate cause \u201cneed not be the only cause, nor the last or nearest cause.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 32a.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">[564 U.S. 690]</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Instead, the District Court employed, as McBride requested, the Seventh Circuit\u2019s pattern instruction for FELA cases, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">\u201cDefendant \u2018caused or contributed to\u2019 Plaintiffs injury if Defendant\u2019s negligence played a part\u2014no matter how small\u2014in bringing about the injury. The mere fact that an injury occurred does not necessarily mean that the injury was caused by negligence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 31a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">For this instruction, the Seventh Circuit relied upon this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Missouri Pacific R. Co., </em>352 U.S. 500, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1957). The jury returned a verdict for McBride, setting total damages at $275,000, but reducing that amount by one-third, the percentage the jury attributed to plaintiffs negligence. App. 29a.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">CSX appealed to the Seventh Circuit, renewing its objection to the failure to instruct on \u201cproximate cause.\u201d Before the appellate court, CSX \u201cmaintain [ed] that the correct definition of proximate causation is a \u2018direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u2019 \u201d 598 F.3d 388, 393, n. 3 (2010) (quoting <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Securities Investor Protection Corporation, </em>503 U.S. 258, 268, 112 S. Ct. 1311, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1992)). A properly instructed jury, CSX contended, might have found that the chain of causation was too indirect, or that the engine configuration was unsafe because of its propensity to cause crashes during switching, not because of any risk to an engineer\u2019s hands. Brief for Defendant-Appellant in No. 08-3557 (CA7), pp. 49-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">The Court of Appeals approved the District Court\u2019s instruction and affirmed the judgment entered on the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Rogers </em>had \u201crelaxed the proximate cause requirement\u201d in FELA cases, the Seventh Circuit concluded, a view of <em>Rogers </em>\u201cechoed by every other court of appeals.\u201d 598 F.3d, at 399. While acknowledging that a handful of state courts \u201cstill applied] traditional formulations of proximate cause in FELA cases,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 404, n. 7, the Seventh Circuit</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">[564 U.S. 691]</p>\n<p id=\"b686-12\">said it could hardly declare erroneous an instruction that \u201csimply paraphrase[d] the Supreme Court\u2019s own words in <em>Rogers,\u201d id., </em>at 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-13\">We granted certiorari to decide whether the causation instruction endorsed by the Seventh Circuit is proper in FELA cases. 562 U.S. 1060, 131 S. Ct. 644, 178 L. Ed. 2d 475 (2010). That instruction does not include the term \u201cproximate cause,\u201d but does tell the jury defendant\u2019s negligence must \u201cpla[y] a part\u2014no matter how small\u2014in bringing about the [plaintiffs] injury.\u201d App. 31a.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b686-15\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b686-16\">The railroad business was exceptionally hazardous at the dawn of the 20th century. As we have recounted, \u201cthe physical dangers of railroading . . . resulted in the death or maiming of thousands of workers every year,\u201d <em>Consolidated Rail Corporation </em>v. <em>Gottshall, </em>512 U.S. 532, 542, 114 S. Ct. 2396, 129 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1994), including 281,645 casualties in the year 1908 alone, S. Rep. No. 432, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1910). Enacted that same year in an effort to \u201cshif[t] part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>of the human overhead of doing business from employees to their employers,\u201d <em>Gottshall, </em>512 U.S., at 542, 114 S. Ct. 2396, 129 L. Ed. 2d 427 (internal quotation marks omitted), FELA prescribes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-4\">\u201cEvery common carrier by railroad . . . shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier . . . for such injury or death <em>resulting in whole or in part </em>from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier . . . .\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Liability under FELA is limited in these key respects: Railroads are liable only to their employees, and only for injuries sustained in the course of employment. FELA\u2019s language on causation, however, \u201cis as broad as could be framed.\u201d <em>Urie </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>337 U.S. 163, 181, 69 S. Ct. 1018, 93 L. Ed. 1282 (1949). Given the breadth of the phrase \u201cresulting in whole or in</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">[564 U.S. 692]</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">part from the [railroad\u2019s] negligence,\u201d and Congress\u2019 \u201chumanitarian\u201d and \u201cremedial goal[s],\u201d we have recognized that, in comparison to tort litigation at common law, \u201ca relaxed standard of causation applies under FELA.\u201d <em>Gottshall, </em>512 U.S., at 542-543, 114 S. Ct. 2396, 129 L. Ed. 2d 427. In our 1957 decision in <em>Rogers, </em>we described that relaxed standard as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\">\u201cUnder [FELA] the test of a jury case is simply whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought.\u201d 352 U.S., at 506, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">As the Seventh Circuit emphasized, the instruction the District Court gave in this case, permitting a verdict for McBride if \u201c[railroad] negligence played a part\u2014no matter how small\u2014in bringing about the injury,\u201d App. 31a, tracked the language of <em>Rogers. </em>If <em>Rogers </em>prescribes the definition of causation applicable under FELA, that instruction was plainly proper. See <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>McLean Credit Union, </em>491 U.S. 164, 172, 109 S. Ct. 2363, 105 L. Ed. 2d 132 (1989) (\u201c  Considerations of <em>stare decisis </em>have special force in the area of statutory interpretation . . . .\u201d). While CSX does not ask us to disturb <em>Rogers, </em>the railroad contends that lower courts have overread that opinion. In CSX\u2019s view, shared by the dissent, <em>post, </em>at 713-714, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 659, <em>Rogers </em>was a narrowly focused decision that did not touch, concern, much less displace common-law formulations of \u201cproximate cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">Understanding this argument requires some background. The <em>term </em>\u201cproximate cause\u201d is shorthand for a concept: Injuries have countless causes, and not all should give rise to legal liability. See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \u00a7 42, p. 273 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser and Keeton). \u201cWhat we . . . mean by the word \u2018proximate,\u2019 \u201d one noted jurist has explained, is simply this: \u201c[B]ecause of convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice, the law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events beyond a certain point.\u201d <em>Palsgraf</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">[564 U.S. 693]</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">v. <em>Long Island R. Co., </em>248 N.Y. 339, 352, 162 N.E. 99, 103 (1928) (Andrews, J., dissenting). Common-law \u201cproximate cause\u201d formulations varied, and were often both constricted and difficult to comprehend. See T. Cooley, Law of Torts 73-77, 812-813 (2d ed. 1888) (describing, for example, prescriptions precluding recovery in the event of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>\u201cintervening\u201d cause or any contributory negligence). Some courts cut off liability if a \u201cproximate cause\u201d was not the <em>sole </em>proximate cause. Prosser and Keeton \u00a7 65, p. 452 (noting \u201ctendency ... to look for some single, principal, dominant, \u2018proximate\u2019 cause of every injury\u201d). Many used definitions resembling those CSX proposed to the District Court or urged in the Court of Appeals. See <em>supra, </em>at 689-690, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 643-644 (CSX proposed key words \u201cnatural or probable\u201d or \u201cdirect\u201d to describe required relationship between injury and alleged negligent conduct); Prosser and Keeton \u00a7 43, pp. 282-283.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Drawing largely on Justice Souter\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Norfolk Southern R. Co. </em>v. <em>Sorrell, </em>549 U.S. 158, 173, 127 S. Ct. 799, 166 L. Ed. 2d 638 (2007), CSX contends that the <em>Rogers </em>\u201cany part\u201d test displaced only common-law restrictions on recovery for injuries involving contributory negligence or other \u201cmultiple causes.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 35 (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Rogers </em>\u201cdid not address the requisite directness of a cause,\u201d CSX argues, hence that question continues to be governed by restrictive common-law formulations. Brief for Petitioner 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">To evaluate CSX\u2019s argument, we turn first to the facts of <em>Rogers. </em>The employee in that case was injured while burning off weeds and vegetation that lined the defendant\u2019s railroad tracks. A passing train had fanned the flames, which spread from the vegetation to the top of a culvert where the employee was standing. Attempting to escape, the employee</p>\n<p id=\"A22R\">[564 U.S. 694]</p>\n<p id=\"A7qr\">slipped and fell on the sloping gravel covering the culvert, sustaining serious injuries. 352 U.S., at 501-503, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493. A Missouri state-court jury returned a verdict for the employee, but the Missouri Supreme Court reversed. Even if the railroad had been negligent in failing to maintain a flat surface, the court reasoned, the employee was at fault because of his lack of attention to the spreading fire. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>284 S.W.2d 467, 472 (1955). As the fire \u201cwas something extraordinary, unrelated to, and disconnected from the incline of the gravel,\u201d the court felt \u201cobliged to say [that] plaintiffs injury was not the natural and probable consequence of any negligence of defendant.\u201d <em>Ibid-</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">We held that the jury\u2019s verdict should not have been upset. Describing two potential readings of the Missouri Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, we condemned both. First, the court erred in concluding that the employee\u2019s negligence was the \u201csole\u201d cause of the injury, for the jury reasonably found that railroad negligence played a part. <em>Rogers, </em>352 U.S., at 504-505, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493. Second, the court erred insofar as it held that the railroad\u2019s negligence was not a sufficient cause unless it was the more \u201cprobable\u201d cause of the injury. <em>Id., </em>at 505, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493. FELA, we affirmed, did not incorporate any traditional common-law formulation of \u201cproximate causation[,] which [requires] the jury [to] find that the defendant\u2019s negligence was the sole, efficient, producing cause of injury.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 506, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493. Whether the railroad\u2019s negligent act was the \u201cim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>mediate reason\u201d for the fall, we added, was \u201can irrelevant consideration.\u201d Id<em>., </em>at 503, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493. We then announced the \u201cany part\u201d test, <em>id., </em>at 506, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493, and reiterated it several times. See, <em>e.g., id., </em>at 507, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493 (\u201cnarro[w]\u201d and \u201csingle inquiry\u201d is whether \u201cnegligence of the employer played any part at all\u201d in bringing about the injury); <em>id., </em>at 508, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493 (FELA case \u201crarely presents more than the single question whether negligence of the employer played any part, however small, in the injury\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">[564 U.S. 695]</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\"><em>Rogers </em>is most sensibly read as a comprehensive statement of the FELA causation standard. Notably, the Missouri Supreme Court in <em>Rogers </em>did not doubt that a FELA injury might have multiple causes, including railroad negligence and employee negligence. See 284 S.W.2d, at 472 (reciting FELA\u2019s \u201cin whole or in part\u201d language). But the railroad\u2019s part, according to the state court, was too indirect, not sufficiently \u201cnatural and probable,\u201d to establish the requisite causation. <em>Ibid. </em>That is the very reasoning the Court rejected in <em>Rogers. </em>It is also the reasoning CSX asks us to resurrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Our understanding is informed by the statutory history and precedent on which <em>Rogers </em>drew. Before FELA was enacted, the \u201charsh and technical\u201d rules of state common law had \u201cmade recovery difficult or even impossible\u201d for injured railroad workers. <em>Trainmen </em>v. <em>Virginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar, </em>377 U.S. 1, 3, 84 S. Ct. 1113, 12 L. Ed. 2d 89 (1964). \u201c[Dissatisfied with the [railroad\u2019s] common-law duty,\u201d Congress sought to \u201csupplan[t] that duty with [FELA\u2019s] far more drastic duty of paying damages for injury or death at work due in whole or in part to the employer\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>Rogers, </em>352 U.S., at 507, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493. Yet, <em>Rogers </em>observed, the Missouri court and other lower courts continued to ignore FELA\u2019s \u201csignifican[t]\u201d departures from the \u201cordinary common-law negligence\u201d scheme, to reinsert common-law formulations of causation involving \u201cprobabilities,\u201d and consequently to \u201cdeprive litigants of their right to a jury determination.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 507, 509-510, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493. Aiming to end lower court disregard of congressional purpose, the <em>Rogers </em>Court repeatedly called the \u201cany part\u201d test the \u201csingle\u201d inquiry determining causation in FELA cases. <em>Id., </em>at 507, 508, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493 (emphasis added). In short, CSX\u2019s argument that the</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">[564 U.S. 696]</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\"><em>Rogers </em>standard concerns only division of responsibility among multiple actors, and not causation more generally, misses the thrust of our decision in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">Tellingly, in announcing the \u201cany part... in producing the injury\u201d test, <em>Rogers </em>cited <em>Coray </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co., </em>335 U.S. 520, 69 S. Ct. 275, 93 L. Ed. 208 (1949), a decision emphasizing that FELA had parted from traditional common-law formulations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>causation. What qualified as a \u201cproximate\u201d or legally sufficient cause in FELA cases, <em>Coray </em>had explained, was determined by the statutory phrase \u201cresulting in whole or in part,\u201d which Congress \u201cselected ... to fix liability\u201d in language that was \u201csimple and direct.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 524, 69 S. Ct. 275, 93 L. Ed. 208. That straightforward phrase, <em>Coray </em>observed, was incompatible with \u201cdialectical subtleties\u201d that common-law courts employed to determine whether a particular cause was sufficiently \u201csubstantial\u201d to constitute a proximate cause. <em>Id., </em>at 523-524, 69 S. Ct. 275, 93 L. Ed. 208.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Our subsequent decisions have confirmed that  <em>Rogers </em>announced a general standard for causation in FELA cases, not one addressed exclusively to injuries involving multiple potentially cognizable causes. The very day <em>Rogers </em>was announced, we applied its \u201cany part\u201d instruction in a case in which the sole causation issue was the directness or foreseeability of the connection between the carrier\u2019s negligence and the plaintiffs injury. See <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., </em>352 U.S. 521, 523-524, 77 S. Ct. 457, 1 L. Ed. 2d 511 (1957) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">[564 U.S. 697]</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">A few years later, in <em>Gallick </em>v. <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co., </em>372 U.S. 108, 83 S. Ct. 659, 9 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1963), we held jury findings for the plaintiff proper in a case presenting the following facts: For years, the railroad had allowed a fetid pool, containing \u201cdead and decayed rats and pigeons,\u201d to accumulate near its right-of-way; while standing near the pool, the plaintiff-employee suffered an insect bite that became infected and required amputation of his legs. <em>Id., </em>at 109, 83 S. Ct. 659, 9 L. Ed. 2d 618. The appellate court had concluded there was insufficient evidence of causation to warrant submission of the case to the jury. <em>Id., </em>at 112, 83 S. Ct. 659, 9 L.

The <em>Rogers </em>\u201cany part\u201d instruction opens the door to unlimited liability, CSX worries, inviting juries to impose liability on the basis of \u201cbut for\u201d causation. The dissent shares these fears. <em>Post, </em>at 710-711, 719-720, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 656-657, 663. But a half century\u2019s experience</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">[564 U.S. 700]</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">with <em>Rogers </em>gives us little cause for concern: CSX\u2019s briefs did not identify even <em>one </em>trial in which the instruction generated an absurd or untoward award.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nor has the dissent managed to uncover such a case. <em>Post, </em>at 717-718, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 661-662 (citing no actual case but conjuring up images of falling pianos and spilled coffee).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">While some courts have said that <em>Rogers </em>eliminated the <em>concept </em>of proximate cause in FELA cases,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we think it \u201cmore accurate ... to recognize that <em>Rogers </em>describes the test for proximate causation applicable in FELA suits.\u201d <em>Sorrell, </em>549 U.S., at 178, 127 S. Ct. 799, 166 L. Ed. 2d 638 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment). That understanding was expressed by the drafters of the 1965 federal model instructions, see <em>supra, </em>at 698-699, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 649-650:  Under FELA, injury \u201cis proximately caused\u201d by the railroad\u2019s negligence if that negligence \u201cplayed any part . . . in . . . causing the injury.\u201d Avoiding \u201cdialectical subtleties\u201d that confound attempts to convey intelligibly to juries just what \u201cproximate cause\u201d means, see <em>Coray, </em>335 U.S., at 524, 69 S. Ct. 275, 93 L. Ed. 208, the <em>Rogers </em>instruction uses the everyday words contained in the statute itself. Jurors can comprehend those words and apply them in light of their experience and common sense. Unless and until Congress orders otherwise, we see no good reason to tamper with an instruction tied to FELA\u2019s text,</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">[564 U.S. 701]</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">long employed by lower courts, and hardly shown to be unfair or unworkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">As we have noted, see <em>supra, </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>692-693, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 645-646, the phrase \u201cproximate cause\u201d is shorthand for the policy-based judgment that not all factual causes contributing to an injury should be legally cognizable causes. Prosser and Kee-ton explain: \u201cIn a philosophical sense, the consequences of an act go forward to eternity, and the causes of an event go back to the dawn of human events, and beyond.\u201d \u00a7 41, p. 264. To prevent \u201cinfinite liability,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>courts and legislatures appropriately place limits on the chain of causation that may support recovery on any particular claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">The term \u201cproximate cause\u201d itself is hardly essential to the imposition of such limits. It is a term notoriously confusing. See, <em>e.g., id., </em>\u00a742, p. 273 (\u201cThe word \u2018proximate\u2019 is a legacy of Lord Chancellor Bacon, who in his time committed other sins.... It is an unfortunate word, which places an entirely wrong emphasis upon the factor of physical or mechanical closeness. For this reason \u2018legal cause\u2019 or perhaps even \u2018responsible cause\u2019 would be a more appropriate term.\u201d (footnotes omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">And the lack of consensus on any one definition of \u201cproximate cause\u201d is manifest. <em>Id., </em>\u00a741, p. 263. Common-law formulations include, <em>inter alia, </em>the \u201cimmediate\u201d or \u201cnearest\u201d antecedent test; the \u201cefficient, producing cause\u201d test; the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test; and the \u201cprobable,\u201d or \u201cnatural and probable,\u201d or \u201cforeseeable\u201d consequence test. Smith, Legal Cause in Actions of Tort, 25 Harv. L. Rev. 103, 106-121 (1911); Smith, Legal Cause in Actions of Tort (Concluded), 25 Harv. L. Rev. 303, 311 (1912).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Notably, CSX itself did not settle on a uniform definition of the term \u201cproximate cause\u201d in this litigation, nor does the dissent. In the District Court, CSX requested a jury instruction defining \u201cproximate cause\u201d to mean \u201cany cause which, in natural or probable sequence, produced the injury</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">[564 U.S. 702]</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">complained of.\u201d App. 32a. On appeal, \u201cCSX maintain[ed] that the correct definition ... is a \u2018direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u2019 \u201d 598 F.3d, at 393, n. 3. Before this Court, CSX called for \u201ca demonstration that the plaintiffs injury resulted from the wrongful conduct in a way that was natural, probable, and foreseeable.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">Lay triers, studies show, are scarcely aided by charges so phrased. See Steele &amp; Thornburg, Jury Instructions: A Persistent Failure To Communicate, 67 N. C. L. Rev. 77, 88-92, 110 (1988) (85% of actual and potential jurors were unable to understand a pattern proximate-cause instruction similar to the one requested by CSX); Charrow &amp; Charrow, Making Legal Language Understandable: A Psycholinguistic Study of Jury Instructions, 79 Colum. L. Rev. 1306, 1353 (1979) (nearly one-quarter of subjects misunderstood proximate cause to mean \u201capproximate cause\u201d or \u201cestimated cause\u201d). In light of the potential of \u201cproximate cause\u201d instructions to leave jurors at sea, it is not surprising that the drafters of the Restatement (Third) of Torts avoided the term altogether. See 1 Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm \u00a7 29 (2005) (confining liability to \u201charms that result from the risks that made the actor\u2019s conduct tortious\u201d); <em>id., </em>Comment <em>b.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Congress, it is true, has written the words \u201cproximate cause\u201d into a number of statutes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But  when the legislative text uses less legalistic language, <em>e.g., </em>\u201ccaused by,\u201d \u201coccasioned by,\u201d \u201cin consequence of,\u201d or, as in FELA, \u201cresulting in whole or in part from,\u201d and the legislative purpose is to loosen constraints on recovery, there is little reason for</p>\n<p id=\"AjKS\">[564 U.S. 703]</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">courts to hark back to stock, judge-made proximate-cause formulations.

The argument for importing into FELA\u2019s text \u201cprevious judicial definitions or <em>dicta\u201d </em>originating in non-statutory common-law actions, see Smith, Legal Cause in Actions of Tort (Continued), <em>supra, </em>at 235, misapprehends how foreseeability figures in FELA cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">\u201c [Reasonable foreseeability of harm,\u201d we clarified in <em>Gallick, </em>is indeed \u201can essential ingredient of [FELA] <em>negligence.\u201d </em>372 U.S., at 117, 83 S.

In that regard, the jury may be told that \u201c[the railroad\u2019s] duties are measured by what is reasonably foreseeable under like circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).

Indeed, judges would have no warrant to submit such cases to the jury. See <em>Nicholson </em>v. <em>Erie R. Co., </em>253 F.2d 939, 940-941 (CA2 1958) (alleged negligence was failure to provide lavatory for female employee; employee was injured by a suitcase while looking for a lavatory in a passenger car; applying <em>Rogers, </em>appellate court affirmed lower court\u2019s dismissal for lack of causation); <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Corp., </em>921 F.2d 1, 2-5 (CA1 1990) (employee suffered stress-related heart attack after railroad forced him to work more than 12 hours with inadequate breaks; applying <em>Rogers, </em>appellate court affirmed grant of summary judgment for lack of causation). See also <em>supra, </em>at 699-700, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 650 <em>(Rogers </em>has generated no extravagant jury awards or appellate court decisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">In addition to the constraints of common sense, FELA\u2019s limitations on who may sue, and for what, reduce the risk of exorbitant liability. As earlier noted, see <em>supra, </em>at 691, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 645, the statute confines the universe of compensable injuries to those sustained by employees, during employment. \u00a7 51. Hence there are no unforeseeable plaintiffs in FELA cases. And the statute weeds out the injuries most likely to bear only a tenuous relationship to railroad negligence, namely, those occurring <em>outside </em>the workplace.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">[564 U.S. 705]</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">There is a real risk, on the other hand, that the \u201cin natural or probable sequence\u201d charge sought by CSX would mislead. If taken to mean the plaintiffs injury must <em>probably </em>(\u201cmore likely than not\u201d) follow from the railroad\u2019s negligent conduct, then the force of FELA\u2019s \u201cresulting in whole or in part\u201d language would be blunted. Railroad negligence would \u201cprobably\u201d cause a worker\u2019s injury only if that negligence was a dominant contributor to the injury, not merely a contributor in any part.</p>\n<p id=\"pAxS\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"47\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAU8AAAAuAQAAAACAaaYUAAAAoklEQVR4nO2UPQrCQBCFXxax1cZePYFX8FQew9xIvI5YpEuQmM9iwZ3mQZogyL7um3nzs7C7DZop0lyn9NfWIYYcZOszZh0suOtr1ZaIhSRJ/TYUewAYLhu+cjAlSVrfTqXWAwB3ggzkrjrGk1oAYBcbGchd34d9qbWQJGk8dyXrAaDrr2Wkg6lB0vQYyhwH+RmmMaxnYZmb1dQvo1qr9dfWD1PNy2FdBDgUAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"335\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">For the reasons stated,  it is not error in a FELA case to refuse a charge embracing stock proximate-cause terminology.

See <em>supra, </em>at 696, 700, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 647, 650. As the courts below so held, the judgment of the U. S.

In face of <em>Rogers' </em>repeated admonition that the \u201cany part... in producing the injury\u2019\u2019 test was the <em>single </em>test for causation under FELA, the dissent speculates that <em>Rogers </em>was simply making a veiled reference to a particular form of modified comparative negligence, <em>i.e., </em>allowing plaintiff to prevail on showing that her negligence was \u201cslight\u201d while the railroad\u2019s was \u201cgross.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 713-714, 180 L.

Ed. 2d, at 654, does not say which of the many formulations it would declare applicable in FELA cases. We regard the phrase \u201cnegligence played a part\u2014no matter how small,\u2019\u2019 see <em>Rogers, </em>352 U.S., at 508, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L.

Ed. 2d 493, and the phrase \u201cin producing the injury\u2019 as synonymous with the phrase \u201cin bringing about the injury.\u2019\u2019 We therefore approve both the Seventh Circuit\u2019s instruction and the \u201cany part, even the slightest, in producing the injury\u2019\u2019 formulation. The host of definitions of proximate cause, in contrast, are hardly synonymous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b690-10\">. CSX and the dissent observe, correctly, that some of our <em>pre-Rogers </em>decisions invoked common-law formulations of proximate cause. See, <em>e.g., Brady </em>v. <em>Southern R. Co., </em>320 U.S. 476, 483, 64 S. Ct. 232, 88 L. Ed. 239 (1943) (injury must be \u201cthe natural and probable consequence of the negligence\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, the \u201cnatural or probable\u201d charge that CSX requested was drawn from <em>Brady, </em>which in turn relied on a pre-FELA case, <em>Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul R. Co. </em>v. <em>Kellogg, </em>94 U.S. 469, 475, 24 L. Ed. 256 (1877). But other <em>pre-Rogers </em>FELA decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>invoked no common-law formulations. See, <em>e.g., Union Pacific R. Co. </em>v. <em>Huxoll, </em>245 U.S. 535, 537, 38 S. Ct. 187, 62 L. Ed. 455 (1918) (approving instruction asking whether negligence \u201ccontribute [d] \u2018in whole or in part\u2019to cause the death\u201d); <em>Coray </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co., </em>335 U.S. 520, 524, 69 S. Ct. 275, 93 L. Ed. 208 (1949) (rejecting use of common-law \u201cdialectical subtleties\u201d concerning the term \u201cproximate cause,\u201d and approving use of \u201csimple and direct\u201d statutory language). We rely on <em>Rogers </em>not because \u201ctime begins in 1957,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 711, 180 L.

This even though we have held that FELA generally follows the common law, unless the Act expressly provides otherwise; even though FELA expressly abrogated common law rules in four other respects, but said nothing about proximate cause; and even though our own cases, for 50 years after the passage of FELA, repeatedly recognized that proximate cause was required for recovery under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The Court is wrong to dispense with that familiar element of an action seeking recovery for negligence, an element \u201cgenerally thought to be a necessary limitation on liability,\u201d <em>Exxon Co., U.

The test the Court would substitute\u2014whether negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury\u2014is no limit at all. It is simply \u201cbut for\u201d causation. Nothing in FELA itself, or our decision in <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Missouri Pacific R. Co., </em>352 U.S. 500, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L.

Law, however, is not philosophy, and the concept of proximate cause developed at common law in response to the perceived need to distinguish \u201cbut for\u201d cause from those more direct causes of injury that can form the basis for liability at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-14\">The plurality breaks no new ground in criticizing the variety of formula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>tions of the concept of proximate cause, <em>ante, </em>at 701-702, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 651; courts, commentators, and first-year law students have been doing that for generations. See <em>Exxon, supra, </em>at 838, 116 S. Ct. 1813, 135 L. Ed. 2d 113. But it is often easier to disparage the product of centuries of common law than to devise a plausible substitute\u2014which may explain why Congress did not attempt to do so in FELA. Proximate cause is hardly the only enduring common law concept that is useful despite its imprecision, see <em>ante, </em>at 701, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 651. It is in good company with proof beyond a reasonable doubt, necessity, willfulness, and unconscionability\u2014to name just a few.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Proximate cause refers to the basic requirement that before recovery is allowed in tort, there must be \u201csome direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged,\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>503 U.S., at 268, 112 S. Ct. 1311, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532. It excludes from the scope of liability injuries that are \u201ctoo remote,\u201d \u201cpurely contingent,\u201d or \u201cindirect[ ].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 268, 271, 274, 112 S. Ct. 1311, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532. Recognizing that liability must not attach to \u201cevery conceivable harm that can be traced to alleged wrongdoing,\u201d proximate cause requires a \u201ccausal connection between the wrong and the injury,\u201d <em>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. </em>v. <em>Carpenters, </em>459 U.S. 519, 536, 533, n. 26, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983), that is not so \u201ctenuous . . . that what is claimed to be consequence is only fortuity,\u201d <em>Exxon, supra, </em>at 838, 116 S. Ct. 1813, 135 L. Ed. 2d 113 (internal quotation marks omitted). It limits liability at some point before the want of a nail leads to loss of the kingdom. When FELA</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">[564 U.S. 708]</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">was passed, as now, \u201c [t]he question whether damage in a given case is proximate or remote [was] one of great importance. . . . [T]he determination of it determines legal right,\u201d 1 T. Street, Foundations of Legal Liability 110 (1906) (reprint 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">FELA expressly abrogated common law tort principles in four specific ways. See <em>Sorrell, supra, </em>at 166, 168, 127 S. Ct. 799, 166 L. Ed. 2d 638; <em>Consolidated Rail Corporation </em>v. <em>Gottshall, </em>512 U.S. 532, 542-543, 114 S. Ct. 2396, 129 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1994). As enacted in 1908, the Act abolished the common law contributory negligence rule, which barred plaintiffs whose negligence had contributed to their injuries from recovering for the negligence of another. See Act of Apr. 22, \u00a7 3, 35 Stat. 66. FELA also abandoned the so-called fellow-servant rule, \u00a7 1, prohibited an assumption of risk defense in certain cases, \u00a7 4, and barred employees from contractually releasing their employers from liability, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">But \u201c[o]nly to the extent of these explicit statutory alterations is FELA an avowed departure from the rules of the common law.\u201d <em>Gottshall, supra, </em>at 544, 114 S. Ct. 2396, 129 L. Ed. 2d 427 (internal quotation marks omitted). FELA did not abolish the familiar requirement of proximate cause. Because \u201cCongress expressly dispensed with [certain] common-law doctrines\u201d in FELA but \u201cdid not deal at all with [other] equally well-established doctrine [s],\u201d I do not believe that \u201cCongress intended to abrogate [the other] doctrine[s] <em>suh silentio.\u201d Monessen Southwestern R. Co. </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>486 U.S. 330, 337-338, 108 S. Ct. 1837, 100 L. Ed. 2d 349 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">We have applied the standard requirement of proximate cause to actions under federal statutes where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>the text did not expressly provide for it. See <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Broudo, </em>544 U.S. 336, 342-346, 125 S. Ct. 1627, 161 L. Ed. 2d 577 (2005) (securities fraud); <em>Holmes, supra, </em>at 268-270, 112 S. Ct. 1311, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532 (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act); <em>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc., supra, </em>at 529-535, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (Clayton Act); cf. <em>Metropolitan Edison Co. </em>v. <em>People Against Nuclear Energy, </em>460 U.S. 766, 774, 103 S. Ct. 1556, 75 L. Ed. 2d 534 (1983) (\u201cthe terms \u2018environmental</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">[564 U.S. 709]</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">effect\u2019 and \u2018environmental impact\u2019 in [the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 should] be read to include a requirement of a reasonably close causal relationship between a change in the physical environment and the effect at issue . . . like the familiar doctrine of proximate cause from tort law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The Court does not explicitly rest its argument on its own reading of FELA\u2019s text. The jury instruction on causation it approves, however, derives from Section 1 of FELA, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51. See <em>ante, </em>at 688, 703-704, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 643, 652. But nothing in Section 1 is similar to the \u201cexpress language\u201d Congress employed elsewhere in FELA when it wanted to abrogate a common law rule, <em>Sorrell, </em>549 U.S., at 165-166, 127 S. Ct. 799, 166 L. Ed. 2d 638. See, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7 53 (\u201cthe fact that the employee may have been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery\u201d); \u00a7 54 (\u201cemployee shall not be held to have assumed the risks of his employment\u201d). As the very first section of the statute, Section 1 simply outlines who could be sued by whom and for what types of injuries. It provides that \u201c[e]very common carrier by railroad . . . shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier ... for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier.\u201d \u00a7 51. The Court\u2019s theory seems to be that the words \u201cin whole or in part\u201d signal a departure from the historic requirement of proximate cause. But those words served a very different purpose. They did indeed mark an important departure from a common law principle, but it was the principle of contributory negligence\u2014 not proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">As noted, FELA abolished the defense of contributory negligence; the \u201cin whole or in part\u201d language simply reflected the fact that the railroad would remain liable even if its negligence was not the sole cause of injury. See <em>Sorrell, supra, </em>at 170, 127 S. Ct. 799, 166 L. Ed. 2d 638. The Congress that was so clear when it was abolishing common law limits on recovery elsewhere in</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">[564 U.S. 710]</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">FELA did not abrogate the fundamental principle of proximate cause in the oblique manner the Court suggests. \u201c[I]f Congress had intended such a sea change\u201d in negligence principles \u201cit would have said so clearly.\u201d <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ. </em>v. <em>Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., </em>563 U.S. 776, 792, 131 S. Ct. 2188, 180 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">The language the Court adopts as an instruction on causation requires only that negligence have \u201c \u2018played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 703, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 652 <em>(quoting Rogers, </em>352 U.S., at 506, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493; emphasis deleted); see also <em>ante, </em>at 705, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 653 (\u201cJuries in such cases are properly instructed that a defendant railroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>\u2018caused or contributed to\u2019 a railroad worker\u2019s injury \u2018if [the railroad\u2019s] negligence played a part\u2014no matter how small\u2014in bringing about the injury\u2019 \u201d). If that is proved, \u201cthen the carrier is answerable in damages even if the extent of the [injury] or the manner in which it occurred was not \u2018[p]robable\u2019 or \u2018foreseeable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 703-704, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 652 (some internal quotation marks omitted). There is nothing in that language that requires anything other than \u201cbut for\u201d cause. The terms \u201ceven the slightest\u201d and \u201cno matter how small\u201d make clear to juries that even the faintest whisper of \u201cbut for\u201d causation will do.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">At oral argument, counsel for McBride explained that the correct standard for recovery under FELA is \u201cbut-for plus a relaxed form of legal cause.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 44. There is no \u201cplus\u201d in the rule the Court announces today. In this very case defense counsel was free to argue \u201cbut for\u201d cause pure and simple to the jury. In closing, counsel informed the jury: \u201cWhat we also have to show is defendant\u2019s negligence caused or contributed to [McBride\u2019s] injury. It never would have happened <em>but for </em>[CSX] giving him that train.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">At certain points in its opinion, the Court acknowledges that \u201c[injuries have countless causes,\u201d not all of which \u201cshould give rise to legal liability.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 692, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 645. But the</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">[564 U.S. 711]</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">causation test the Court embraces contains no limit on causation at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">This Court, from the time of FELA\u2019s enactment, understood FELA to require plaintiffs to prove that an employer\u2019s negligence \u201cis a proximate cause of the accident,\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Wolfe, </em>263 U.S. 239, 243, 44 S.

See, <em>e.g., ibid. </em>(\u201cThe rule clearly deducible from [prior] cases is that ... an employee cannot recover ... if the [employer\u2019s] failure . . . is not a proximate cause of the accident . . . but merely creates an incidental condition or situation in which the accident, otherwise caused, results in such injury\u201d); <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Atlanta &amp; St. Andrews Bay R.

As Justice Souter has explained, for the half century after the enactment of FELA, the Court \u201cconsistently recognized and applied proximate cause as the proper standard in FELA suits.\u201d <em>Sorrell, supra, </em>at 174, 127 S.

Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">That opinion, however, \u201cleft this law where it was.\u201d <em>Sorrell, supra, </em>at 174, 127 S. Ct. 799, 166 L. Ed. 2d 638 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>(Souter, J., concurring). A jury in that case awarded Rogers damages against his railroad employer, but the Supreme Court of Missouri reversed the jury verdict. As the Court explains today, we suggested in <em>Rogers </em>that</p>\n<p id=\"AgPg\">[564 U.S. 712]</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">there were \u201ctwo potential readings\u201d of the lower court\u2019s opinion and that both were wrong. <em>Ante, </em>at 694, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 646. In doing so, we clarified the consequences of FELA\u2019s elimination of the common law contributory negligence rule. We did not do what Congress chose not to do, and abrogate the rule of proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">First, we rejected the idea \u201cthat [Rogers\u2019s] conduct was the <em>sole cause </em>of his mishap.\u201d 352 U.S., at 504, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493 (emphasis added); contra, <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>284 S.W.2d 467, 472 (Mo. 1955) (while \u201c[Rogers] was confronted by an emergency, ... it was an emergency brought about by himself\u2019). There were, we explained, \u201cprobative facts from which the jury could find that [the railroad] was or should have been aware of conditions which created a likelihood that [Rogers] . . . would suffer just such an injury as he did.\u201d 352 U.S., at 503, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493. We noted that \u201c[c]ommon experience teaches both that a passing train will fan the flames of a fire, and that a person suddenly enveloped in flames and smoke will instinctively react by retreating from the danger.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In referring to this predictable sequence of events, we described\u2014in familiar terms\u2014sufficient evidence of proximate cause. We therefore held that the railroad\u2019s negligence could have been a cause of Rogers\u2019s injury regardless of whether \u201cthe <em>immediate </em>reason\u201d why Rogers slipped was the railroad\u2019s negligence in permitting gravel to remain on the surface or some other cause. <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\"><em>Rogers </em>thereby clarified that, under a statute in which employer and employee could both be proximate causes of an injury, a railroad\u2019s negligence need not be the sole or last cause in order to be proximate. That is an application of proximate cause, not a repudiation of it. See Street 111 (\u201ca cause may be sufficiently near in law to the damage to be considered its effective legal cause without by any means being the nearest or most proximate to the causes which contribute of the injury\u201d); 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Torts \u00a7 180, p. 445 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">[564 U.S. 713]</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">We then considered a second interpretation. The Missouri Supreme Court\u2019s opinion could alternatively be read as having held that Rogers\u2019s \u201cconduct was <em>at least as probable a cause </em>for his mishap as any negligence of the [railroad],\u201d and that\u2014in those circumstances\u2014\u201cthere was no case for the jury.\u201d 352 U.S., at 505, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493 (emphasis added). If this was the principle the court applied below, it was also wrong and for many of the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">Under a comparative negligence scheme in which multiple causes may act concurrently, we clarified that a railroad\u2019s negligence need not be the \u201csole, efficient, producing cause of injury,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 506, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493. The question was simply whether \u201cemployer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cIt does not matter,\u201d we continued, \u201cthat, from the evidence, the jury may also with reason, on grounds of probability, attribute the result to other causes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number><em>including the employee\u2019s contributory negligence.\u201d Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">The Court today takes the \u201cany part, even the slightest\u201d language out of context and views it as a rejection of proximate cause. But <em>Rogers </em>was talking about contributory negligence\u2014it said so\u2014and the language it chose confirms just that. \u201cSlight\u201d negligence was familiar usage in this context. The statute immediately preceding FELA, passed just two years earlier in 1906, moved part way from contributory to comparative negligence. It provided that \u201cthe fact that the employee may have been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery where his contributory negligence was slight and that of the employer was gross in comparison.\u201d Act of June 11, 1906, \u00a7 2, 34 Stat. 232. Other statutes similarly made this halfway stop on the road from contributory to pure comparative negligence, again using the term \u201cslight.\u201d See Dobbs \u00a7 201, at 503 (\u201cOne earlier [version of comparative fault] allowed the negligent plaintiff to recover if the plaintiffs negligence was slight and the defendant\u2019s gross. . . . Modern comparative negligence law</p>\n<p id=\"APZN\">[564 U.S. 714]</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">works differently, reducing the plaintiffs recovery in proportion to the plaintiffs fault\u201d); V. Schwartz, Comparative Negligence \u00a7 2.01[b][2], p. 33 (5th ed. 2010) (a \u201cmajor form of modified comparative negligence is the \u2018slight-gross\u2019 system\u201d); <em>id., </em>\u00a7 3.04[b], at 75. In 1908, FELA completed the transition to pure comparative negligence with respect to railworkers. See Dobbs \u00a7 201, at 503. Under FELA, it does not matter whose negligence was \u201cslight\u201d or \u201cgross.\u201d The use of the term \u201ceven the slightest\u201d in <em>Rogers </em>makes perfect sense when the decision is understood to be about multiple causes\u2014not about how direct any particular cause must be. See <em>Sorrell, </em>549 U.S., at 175, 127 S. Ct. 799, 166 L. Ed. 2d 638 (Souter, J., concurring) (pertinent language concerned \u201cmultiplicity of causations,\u201d not \u201cthe necessary directness of . . . causation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">The Court views <em>Rogers </em>as \u201cdescribing] the test for proximate causation\u201d under FELA, <em>ante, </em>at 700, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 650 (internal quotation marks omitted), but <em>Rogers </em>itself says nothing of the sort. See 352 U.S., at 506, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493 (describing its test as \u201cthe test <em>of a jury case\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). <em>Rogers </em>did not set forth a novel standard for proximate cause\u2014much less an instruction designed to guide jurors in determining causation. Indeed, the trial court in <em>Rogers </em>used the term \u201cproximate cause\u201d in its jury instruction and directed the jury to find that Rogers could not recover if his injuries \u201cwere not directly . . . caused by\u201d the railroad\u2019s negligence. <em>Id., </em>at 505, n. 9, 77 S. Ct. 443, 1 L. Ed. 2d 493 (internal quotation marks omitted). Our opinion quoted that instruction, <em>ibid., </em>but \u201ctook no issue with [it] in this respect,\u201d <em>Sorrell, supra, </em>at 176, 127 S. Ct. 799, 166 L. Ed. 2d 638 (Souter, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">A few of our cases have characterized <em>Rogers </em>as holding that \u201ca relaxed standard of causation applies under FELA.\u201d <em>Gottshall, </em>512 U.S., at 543, 114 S. Ct. 2396, 129 L. Ed. 2d 427; see <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Cedar Rapids &amp; Iowa City R. Co., </em>395 U.S. 164, 166, 89 S. Ct. 1706, 23 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1969). Fair enough; but these passing summations of <em>Rogers </em>do not alter its holding. FELA did, of course, change common law rules relating to causation in one respect: Under FELA, a railroad\u2019s negligence did not have to be the exclusive cause of an injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">[564 U.S. 715]</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">See <em>Gottshall, supra, </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>542-543, 114 S. Ct. 2396, 129 L. Ed. 2d 427 (\u201cCongress did away with several common-law tort defenses . . . . Specifically, the statute . . . rejected the doctrine of contributory negligence in favor of that of comparative negligence\u201d). And, unlike under FE-LA\u2019s predecessor, the proportionate degree of the employee\u2019s negligence would not necessarily bar his recovery. But we have never held\u2014until today\u2014that FELA entirely eliminates proximate cause as a limit on liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The Court is correct that the federal courts of appeals have read <em>Rogers </em>to support the adoption of instructions like the one given here. But we do not resolve questions such as the one before us by a show of hands. See <em>Buckhannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources, </em>532 U.S. 598, 605, 121 S. Ct. 1835, 149 L. Ed. 2d 855 (2001); <em>id., </em>at 621, 121 S. Ct. 1835, 149 L. Ed. 2d 855 (Scalia, J., concurring) (\u201cThe dissent\u2019s insistence that we defer to the \u2018clear majority\u2019 of Circuit opinion is particularly peculiar in the present case, since that majority has been nurtured and preserved <em>by our own misleading dicta\u201d); </em>cf. <em>McNally </em>v. <em>United States, </em>483 U.S. 350, 365, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292 (1987) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (pointing out that \u201c[e]very court to consider the matter\u201d had disagreed with the majority\u2019s holding).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">In addition, the Court discounts the views of those state courts of last resort that agree FELA did not relegate proximate cause to the dustbin. Those courts either reject the position the Court adopts today or suggest that FELA does not entirely eliminate proximate cause. See <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>Union Pacific R. Co., </em>279 Neb. 638, 644, 781 N.W.2d 47, 53 (2010) (\u201can employee must prove the employer\u2019s negligence and that the alleged negligence is a proximate cause of the employee\u2019s injury\u201d); <em>CSX Transp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>46 So. 3d 434, 450 (Ala. 2010) (\u201cthe jury in this case was properly instructed by the trial court that [respondent] could not be compensated for any injury not proximately caused by [petitioner\u2019s] negligence\u201d), cf. <em>id., </em>at 461 (quoting <em>Rogers);</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">[564 U.S. 716]</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\"><em>Raab </em>v. <em>Utah R.

Ed. 2d, at 649 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under these circumstances, it seems important to correct an interpretation of our own case law that has run, so to speak, off its own rails.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">[564 U.S. 717]</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Even the Court seems to appreciate that it is creating a troubling gap in the FELA negligence action and ought to do <em>something </em>to patch it over. The something it proposes is \u201c[r]easonable foreseeability of harm,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 703, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 652 (internal quotation marks omitted). Foreseeability as a test for proximate causation would be one thing; foreseeability has, after all, long been an aspect of proximate cause. But that is not the test the Court prescribes. It instead limits the foreseeability inquiry to whether the defendant was negligent in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">The Court observes that juries may be instructed that a defendant\u2019s negligence depends on \u201cwhat a reasonably prudent person would anticipate or foresee as creating a potential for harm.\u201d 5 L. Sand et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions-Civil \u00b6 89.10, p. 89-21 (2010); see <em>ante, </em>at 703, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 652. That\u2019s all fine and good when a defendant\u2019s negligence results directly in the plaintiffs injury (nevermind that no \u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d instruction was given in this case). For instance, if I drop a piano from a window and it falls on a person, there is no question that I was negligent and could have foreseen that the piano would hit someone\u2014 as, in fact, it did. The problem for the Court\u2019s test arises when the negligence does not directly produce the injury to the plaintiff: I drop a piano; it cracks the sidewalk; during sidewalk repairs weeks later a man barreling down the sidewalk on a bicycle hits a cone that repairmen have placed around their worksite, and is injured. Was I negligent in dropping the piano because I could have foreseen \u201ca mishap and injury,\u201d <em>ibid, </em>(emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted)? Yes. Did my negligence cause <em>\u201c[the] </em>mishap and injury\u201d that resulted? It depends on what is meant by cause. My negligence was a \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the injury:</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">[564 U.S. 718]</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">If I had not dropped the piano, the bicyclist would not have crashed. But is it a legal cause? No.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">In one respect the Court\u2019s test is needlessly rigid. If courts must instruct juries on foreseeability as an aspect of negligence, why not instruct them on foreseeability as an aspect of causation? And if the jury is simply supposed to intuit that there should also be limits on the legal chain of causation\u2014and that \u201cbut for\u201d cause is not enough\u2014why hide the ball? Why not simply tell the jury? Finally, if the Court intends \u201cforeseeability of harm\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>to be a kind of poor man\u2019s proximate cause, then where does the Court find that requirement in the test <em>Rog</em>ers\u2014or FELA\u2014prescribes? Could it be derived from the common law?</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Where does \u201cforeseeability of harm\u201d as the sole protection against limitless liability run out of steam? An answer would seem only fair to the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">A railroad negligently fails to maintain its boiler, which overheats. An employee becomes hot while repairing it and removes his jacket. When finished with the repairs, he grabs a thermos of coffee, which spills on his now-bare arm, burning it. Was the risk that someone would be harmed by the failure to maintain the boiler foreseeable? Was the risk that an employee would be burned while repairing the overheated boiler foreseeable? Can the railroad be liable under the Court\u2019s test for the coffee burn? According to the Court\u2019s opinion, it does not matter that the \u201cmanner in which [the injury] occurred was not . . . foreseeable,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 704, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 652 (internal quotation marks omitted), so long as some negligence\u2014any negligence at all\u2014can be established.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The Court\u2019s opinion fails to settle on a single test for answering these questions: Is it that the railroad\u2019s negligence \u201cpla[y] a part\u2014no matter how small\u2014in bringing about the [plaintiffs] injury,\u201d as the Court indicates, <em>ante, </em>at 692, 703, n. 13, and 705, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 645, 652, 653, or that \u201cnegligence play any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury,\u201d as suggested at <em>ante, </em>at 694, n. 2, 697, n. 4, and 704, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 647, 649, 652? The Court says there is no</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">[564 U.S. 719]</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">difference, see <em>ante, </em>at 696, n. 3, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 648, but I suspect lawyers litigating FELA cases will prefer one instruction over the other, depending on whether they represent the employer or the employee. In any event, if the Court\u2019s test\u2014whichever version\u2014provides answers to these hypotheticals, the Court keeps them to itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">Proximate cause supplies the vocabulary for answering such questions. It is useful to ask whether the injury that resulted was within the scope of the risk created by the defendant\u2019s negligent act; whether the injury was a natural or probable consequence of the negligence; whether there was a superseding or intervening cause; whether the negligence was anything more than an antecedent event without which the harm would not have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">The cases do not provide a mechanical or uniform test and have been criticized for that. But they do \u201cfurnish illustrations of situations which judicious men upon careful consideration have adjudged to be on one side of the line or the other.\u201d <em>Exxon, </em>517 U.S., at 839, 116 S. Ct. 1813, 135 L. Ed. 2d 113 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">The Court forswears ah these inquiries and\u2014with them\u2014an accumulated common law history that might provide guidance for courts and juries faced with causation questions. See <em>ante, </em>at 688, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 643 (FELA \u201cdoes not incorporate \u2018proximate cause\u2019 standards developed in nonstatutory common-law tort actions\u201d); <em>ante, </em>at 705, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 653 (\u201cit is not error in a FELA case to refuse a charge embracing stock proximate-cause terminology\u201d). It is not necessary to accept every verbal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>formulation of proximate cause ever articulated to recognize that these standards provide useful guidance\u2014 and that juries should receive some instruction\u2014on the type of link required between a railroad\u2019s negligence and an employee\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"pAnW\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"52\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASMAAAA0AQAAAADp/2MXAAAAnElEQVR4nO3UsQ3CMBCF4d8n90ANBaNkAAZjBbZJmTHsIaAyOTrOxZOgCFR29917lh0pcnI+r2pflGC0ftZq/UTBAB59oLD1vZ62xEDCgHbttkkYkOc5AonkwCmXSAQq7u7FuyVQDODQf4+CAdz6QMLd1+MuzlAoGVjPl9gtYUCbpggkkoPf2/4dKFQD0hpzjS3/iTRek9EarT+0XrVTeZ/Ob+hzAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"291\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Law has its limits.
