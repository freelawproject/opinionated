We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Petitioner Alejandra Tapia was convicted of, <em>inter alia, </em>smuggling unauthorized aliens into the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1324(a)(2)(B)(ii) and (iii). At sentencing, the District Court determined that the United States Sentencing Guidelines recommended a prison term of between 41 and 51 months for Tapia\u2019s offenses. The court decided to impose a 51-month term, followed by three years of supervised release. In explaining its reasons, the court referred several times to Tapia\u2019s need for drug treatment, citing in particular the Bureau of Prison\u2019s Residential Drug</p>\n<p id=\"b405-16\">[564 U.S. 322]</p>\n<p id=\"b405-17\">Abuse Program (known as RDAP or the 500 Hour Drug Program). The court indicated that Tapia should serve a prison term long enough to qualify for and complete that program:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-18\">\u201cThe sentence has to be sufficient to provide needed correctional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>treatment, and here I think the needed correctional treatment is the 500 Hour Drug Program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAXHO\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"49\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAn4AAAAwAQAAAACnZkr4AAAAYklEQVR4nO3WIQ7AIBBE0dkGUdkj9P6nqq6qaYKAgMCt3EDSpB/5J3liFdY09dVtricBAgICAv4czD6XcBjg7dc3HAZ4+fUJh0U3PH0+wsGaJOXdrSUFQzW+IoCAgICAXwU7ENcZ+E4vIXwAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"638\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\">\u201cHere I have to say that one of the factors that\u2014I am going to impose a 51-month sentence, . . . and one of the factors that affects this is the need to provide treatment. In other words, so she is in long enough to get the 500 Hour Drug Program, number one.\u201d App. 27.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">(\u201cNumber two\u201d was \u201cto deter her from committing other criminal offenses.\u201d Ibid.) The court \u201cstrongly recommend [ed]\u201d to the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) that Tapia \u201cparticipate in [RDAP] and that she serve her sentence at\u201d the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin, California (FCI Dublin), where \u201cthey have the appropriate tools ... to help her, to start to make a recovery.\u201d Id., at 29. Tapia did not object to the sentence at that time. <em>Id., </em>at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">On appeal, however, Tapia argued that the District Court had erred in lengthening her prison term to make her eligible for RDAP. 376 Fed. Appx. 707, 708 (CA9 2010). In Tapia\u2019s view, this action violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a), which instructs sentencing courts to \u201crecogniz[e] that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation.\u201d The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit disagreed, 376 Fed. Appx. 707 (2010), relying on its prior decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Duran, </em>37 F.3d 557 (1994). The Ninth Circuit had held there that \u00a7 3582(a) distinguishes between deciding to impose a term of imprisonment and determining its length. See <em>id., </em>at 561. According to <em>Duran, </em>a sentencing court cannot impose a prison term to assist a defendant\u2019s rehabilitation. But \u201c[o]nce imprisonment is chosen as a punishment,\u201d the court may consider</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">[564 U.S. 323]</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">the defendant\u2019s need for rehabilitation in setting the length of the sentence. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">We granted certiorari to consider whether \u00a7 3582(a) permits a sentencing court to impose or lengthen a prison term in order to foster a defendant\u2019s rehabilitation. 562 U.S. 1104, 131 S. Ct. 817, 178 L. Ed. 2d 551 (2010). That question has divided the Courts of Appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the United States agrees with Tapia\u2019s interpretation of the statute, we appointed an <em>amicus curiae </em>to defend the judgment below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">We begin with statutory background\u2014how the relevant sentencing provisions came about and what they say. Aficionados of our sentencing decisions will recognize much of the story line.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">\u201cFor almost a century, the Federal Government employed in criminal cases a system of indeterminate sentencing.\u201d <em>Mistretta </em>v. <em>United States, </em>488 U.S. 361, 363, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1989). Within \u201ccustomarily wide\u201d outer boundaries set by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Congress, trial judges exercised \u201calmost unfettered discretion\u201d to select prison sentences for federal offenders. <em>Id., </em>at 364, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714. In the usual case, a judge also could reject prison time altogether, by imposing a \u201csuspended\u201d sentence. If the judge decided to impose a prison term, discretionary authority shifted to parole officials: Once the defendant had spent a third of his term behind bars, they could order his release. See K.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">[564 U.S. 324]</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Stith &amp; J. Cabranes, Fear of Judging: Sentencing Guidelines in the Federal Courts 18-20 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">This system was premised on a faith in rehabilitation. Discretion allowed \u201cthe judge and the parole officer to [base] their respective sentencing and release decisions upon their own assessments of the offender\u2019s amenability to rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Mistretta, </em>488 U.S., at 363, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714. A convict, the theory went, should generally remain in prison only until he was able to reenter society safely. His release therefore often coincided with \u201cthe successful completion of certain vocational, educational, and counseling programs within the prisons.\u201d S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 40 (1983) (hereinafter S. Rep.). At that point, parole officials could \u201cdetermin[e] that [the] prisoner had become rehabilitated and should be released from confinement.\u201d Stith &amp; Cabranes, <em>supra, </em>at 18.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">But this model of indeterminate sentencing eventually fell into disfavor. One concern was that it produced \u201c[s]erious disparities in [the] sentences\u201d imposed on similarly situated defendants. <em>Mistretta, </em>488 U.S., at 365, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714. Another was that the system\u2019s attempt to \u201cachieve rehabilitation of offenders had failed.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 366, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714. Lawmakers and others increasingly doubted that prison programs could \u201crehabilitate individuals on a routine basis\u201d\u2014or that parole officers could</p>\n<p id=\"AJLC\">[564 U.S. 325]</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">\u201cdetermine accurately whether or when a particular prisoner ha[d] been rehabilitated.\u201d S. Rep., at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Congress accordingly enacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987 (SRA or Act), to overhaul federal sentencing practices. The Act abandoned indeterminate sentencing and parole in favor of a system in which Sentencing Guidelines, promulgated by a new Sentencing Commission, would provide courts with \u201ca range of determinate sentences for categories of offenses and defendants.\u201d <em>Mistretta, </em>488 U.S., at 368, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714. And the Act further channeled judges\u2019 discretion by establishing a framework to govern their consideration and imposition of sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Under the SRA, a judge sentencing a federal offender must impose at least one of the following sanctions: imprisonment (often followed by supervised release), probation, or a fine. See \u00a7 3551(b). In determining the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>propriate sentence from among these options, \u00a7 3553(a)(2) requires the judge to consider specified factors, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">\u201cthe need for the sentence imposed\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">\u201c(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">\u201c(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">\u201c(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">\u201c(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">These four considerations\u2014retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation\u2014are the four purposes of sentencing generally, and a court must fashion a sentence \u201cto achieve the[se] purposes ... to the extent that they are applicable\u201d in a given case. \u00a7 3551(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">The SRA then provides additional guidance about how the considerations listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2) pertain to each of the</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">[564 U.S. 326]</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">Act\u2019s main sentencing options\u2014imprisonment, supervised release, probation, and fines. See \u00a7 3582(a); \u00a7 3583; \u00a7 3562(a); \u00a7 3572(a). These provisions make clear that a particular purpose may apply differently, or even not at all, depending on the kind of sentence under consideration. For example, a court may <em>not </em>take account of retribution (the first purpose listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)) when imposing a term of supervised release. See \u00a7 3583(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">Section 3582(a), the provision at issue here, specifies the \u201cfactors to be considered\u201d when a court orders imprisonment. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-16\">\u201cThe court, in determining whether to impose a term of imprisonment, and, if a term of imprisonment is to be imposed, in determining the length of the term, shall consider the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, recognizing that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-17\">A similar provision addresses the Sentencing Commission in its capacity as author of the Sentencing Guidelines. The SRA instructs the Commission to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-18\">\u201cinsure that the guidelines reflect the inappropriateness of imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant or providing the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(k).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-19\">With this statutory background established, we turn to the matter of interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-20\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b408-21\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b408-22\">Our consideration of Tapia\u2019s claim starts with the text of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a)\u2014and given the clarity of that provision\u2019s language, could end there as well. As just noted,  that section</p>\n<p id=\"b408-23\">[564 U.S. 327]</p>\n<p id=\"b408-24\">instructs courts to \u201crecogniz[e] that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation.\u201d A common\u2014and in context the most natural\u2014definition of the word \u201crecognize\u201d is \u201cto acknowledge or treat as valid.\u201d Random House Dictionary of the English <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Language 1611 (2d ed. 1987). And a thing that is not \u201cappropriate\u201d is not \u201csuitable or fitting for a particular purpose.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 103. Putting these two definitions together, \u00a7 3582(a) tells courts that they should acknowledge that imprisonment is not suitable for the purpose of promoting rehabilitation. And when should courts acknowledge this? Section 3582(a) answers: when \u201cdetermining whether to impose a term of imprisonment, and, if a term of imprisonment is to be imposed, [when] determining the length of the term.\u201d So a court making these decisions should consider the specified rationales of punishment <em>except for </em>rehabilitation, which it should acknowledge as an unsuitable justification for a prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">As against this understanding, <em>am-icus </em>argues that \u00a7 3582(a)\u2019s \u201crecognizing\u201d clause is not a flat prohibition but only a \u201creminder\u201d or a \u201cguide [for] sentencing judges\u2019 cognitive processes.\u201d Brief for Court-Appointed <em>Amicus Curiae </em>in Support of Judgment Below 23-24 (hereinafter <em>Amicus </em>Brief) (emphasis deleted). <em>Amicus </em>supports this view by offering a string of other definitions of the word \u201crecognize\u201d: \u201c \u2018recall to mind,\u2019 \u2018realize,\u2019 or \u2018perceive clearly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 24 (quoting dictionary definitions). Once these are plugged in, <em>amicus </em>suggests, \u00a7 3582(a) reveals itself as a kind of loosey-goosey caution not to put <em>too </em>much faith in the capacity of prisons to rehabilitate.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">But we do not see how these alternative meanings of \u201crecognize\u201d help amicus\u2019s cause. A judge who \u201cperceives clearly\u201d that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting rehabilitation would hardly incarcerate someone for that purpose. Ditto for a judge who \u201crealizes\u201d or \u201crecalls\u201d that imprisonment is not a way to rehabilitate an offender. To be sure, the drafters of the \u201crecognizing\u201d clause</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">[564 U.S. 328]</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">could have used still more commanding language: Congress could have inserted a \u201cthou shalt not\u201d or equivalent phrase to convey that a sentencing judge may never, ever, under any circumstances consider rehabilitation in imposing a prison term. But  when we interpret a statute, we cannot allow the perfect to be the enemy of the merely excellent. Congress expressed itself clearly in \u00a7 3582(a), even if armchair legislators might come up with something even better. And what Congress said was that when sentencing an offender to prison, the court shall consider all the purposes of punishment except rehabilitation\u2014because imprisonment is not an appropriate means of pursuing that goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\"><em>Amicus </em>also claims, echoing the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Duran, </em>that \u00a7 3582(a)\u2019s \u201crecognizing\u201d clause bars courts from considering rehabilitation only when imposing a prison term, and not when deciding on its length. The argument goes as follows. Section 3582(a) refers to two decisions: \u201cThe court, [1] in determining whether to impose a term of imprisonment, and, if a term of imprisonment is to be imposed, [2] in determining the length of the term\u201d must consider the purposes of punishment listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), subject to the caveat of the \u201crecognizing\u201d clause. But that clause says only that \u201cimprisonment\u201d is not an appropriate means of rehabilitation. Because the \u201cprimary meaning of \u2018imprisonment\u2019 is \u2018the act of confining a person,\u2019 \u201d <em>amicus </em>argues, the clause relates only to [1] the decision to incarcerate, and not to [2] the separate determination of the sentence\u2019s length. <em>Amicus </em>Brief 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>We again disagree.  Under standard rules of grammar, \u00a7 3582(a) says: A sentencing judge shall recognize that imprisonment is not appropriate to promote rehabilitation when the court considers the applicable factors of \u00a7 3553(a)(2); and a court considers these factors when determining <em>both </em>whether to imprison an offender <em>and </em>what length of term to give him. The use of the word \u201cimprisonment\u201d in the \u201crecognizing\u201d clause does not destroy\u2014but instead</p>\n<p id=\"a-e-dedup-0\">[564 U.S. 329]</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">fits neatly into\u2014this construction. \u201cImprisonment\u201d as used in the clause most naturally means \u201c [t]he state of being confined\u201d or \u201ca period of confinement.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 825 (9th ed. 2009); see also Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1137 (1993) (the \u201cstate of being imprisoned\u201d). So the word does not distinguish between the defendant\u2019s initial placement behind bars and his continued stay there. As the D. C. Circuit noted in rejecting an identical argument, \u201c[a] sentencing court deciding to keep a defendant locked up for an additional month is, as to that month, in fact choosing imprisonment over release.\u201d <em>In re Sealed Case, </em>573 F.3d 844, 850 (2009).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the word \u201cimprisonment\u201d does not change the function of the \u201crecognizing\u201d clause\u2014to constrain a sentencing court\u2019s decision both to impose and to lengthen a prison term.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The context of \u00a7 3582(a) puts an exclamation point on this textual conclusion. As noted earlier, <em>supra, </em>at 326, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 366, another provision of the SRA restates \u00a7 3582(a)\u2019s message, but to a different audience. That provision,  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(k), directs the Sentencing Commission to ensure that the Guidelines \u201creflect the inappropriateness of imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant or providing the defendant with needed educational</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">[564 U.S. 330]</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment.\u201d In this way, Congress ensured that all sentencing officials would work in tandem to implement the statutory determination to \u201creject imprisonment as a means of promoting rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Mistretta, </em>488 U.S., at 367, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(k)). Section 994(k) bars the Commission from recommending a \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d\u2014a phrase that again refers both to the fact and to the length of incarceration\u2014based on a defendant\u2019s rehabilitative needs. And \u00a7 3582(a) prohibits a court from considering those needs to impose or lengthen a period of confinement when selecting a sentence from within, or choosing to depart from, the Guidelines range. Each actor at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>each stage in the sentencing process receives the same message: Do not think about prison as a way to rehabilitate an offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Equally illuminating here is a statutory silence\u2014the absence of any provision granting courts the power to ensure that offenders participate in prison rehabilitation programs. For when Congress wanted sentencing courts to take account of rehabilitative needs, it gave courts the authority to direct appropriate treatment for offenders. Thus,  the SRA instructs courts, in deciding whether to impose probation or supervised release, to consider whether an offender could benefit from training and treatment programs. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3562(a); \u00a7 3583(c). And so the SRA <em>also </em>authorizes courts, when imposing those sentences, to order an offender\u2019s participation in certain programs and facilities. \u00a7 3563(b)(9); \u00a7 3563(b)(11); \u00a7 3563(a)(4); \u00a7 3583(d). As a condition of probation, for example, the court may require the offender to \u201cundergo available medical, psychiatric, or psychological treatment, including treatment for drug or alcohol dependency, as specified by the court, and [to] remain in a specified institution if required for that purpose.\u201d \u00a7 3563(b)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">If Congress had similarly meant to allow courts to base prison terms on offenders\u2019 rehabilitative needs, it would have given courts the capacity to ensure that offenders participate</p>\n<p id=\"AuV_\">[564 U.S. 331]</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">in prison correctional programs. But in fact, courts do not have this authority.  When a court sentences a federal offender, the BOP has plenary control, subject to statutory constraints, over \u201cthe place of the prisoner\u2019s imprisonment,\u201d \u00a7 3621(b), and the treatment programs (if any) in which he may participate, \u00a7\u00a7 3621(e), (f); \u00a7 3624(f). See also 28 CFR pt. 544 (2010) (BOP regulations for administering inmate educational, recreational, and vocational programs); 28 CFR pt. 550, subpart F (drug abuse treatment programs). A sentencing court can <em>recommend </em>that the BOP place an offender in a particular facility or program. See \u00a7 3582(a). But decisionmaking authority rests with the BOP.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">This case well illustrates the point. As noted earlier, the District Court \u201cstrongly recommend [ed]\u201d that Tapia participate in RDAP, App. 29, and serve her sentence at FCI Dublin, \u201cwhere they have the facilities to really help her,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 28. But the court\u2019s recommendations were only recommendations\u2014and in the end they had no effect. See <em>Amicus </em>Brief 42 (\u201c[Tapia] was not admitted to RDAP, nor even placed in the prison recommended by the district court\u201d); Reply Brief for United States 8, n. 1 (\u201cAccording to BOP records, [Tapia] was encouraged to enroll [in RDAP] during her psychology intake screening at [the federal prison], but she stated that she was not interested, and she has not volunteered for the program\u201d). The sentencing court may have had plans for Tapia\u2019s rehabilitation, but it lacked the power to implement them. That incapacity speaks volumes. It indicates that Congress did not intend that courts consider offenders\u2019 rehabilitative needs when imposing prison sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Finally, for those who consider legislative history useful, the key Senate Report concerning the SRA provides one last piece of corroborating evidence. According to that Report, decades of experience with indeterminate sentencing, resulting in the release of many inmates after they completed correctional programs, had left Congress skeptical that \u201crehabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>tation</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">[564 U.S. 332]</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">can be induced reliably in a prison setting.\u201d S. Rep., at 38. Although some critics argued that \u201crehabilitation should be eliminated completely as a purpose of sentencing,\u201d Congress declined to adopt that categorical position. <em>Id., </em>at 76. Instead, the Report explains, Congress barred courts from considering rehabilitation in imposing prison terms, <em>ibid., </em>and n. 165, but not in ordering other kinds of sentences, <em>ibid., </em>and n. 164. \u201c[T]he purpose of rehabilitation,\u201d the Report stated, \u201cis still important in determining whether a sanction <em>other than a term of imprisonment </em>is appropriate in a particular case.\u201d See <em>id., </em>at 76-77 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">And so this is a case in which text, context, and history point to the same bottom line:  Section 3582(a) precludes sentencing courts from imposing or lengthening a prison term to promote an offender\u2019s rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">With all these sources of statutory meaning stacked against him, <em>amicus </em>understandably tries to put the SRA\u2019s view of rehabilitation in a wholly different frame. <em>Amicus </em>begins by conceding that Congress, in enacting the SRA, rejected the old \u201c[r]ehabilitation [m]odel.\u201d <em>Amicus </em>Brief 1. But according to <em>amicus, </em>that model had a very limited focus: It was the belief that \u201cisolation and prison routine\u201d could alone produce \u201cpenitence and spiritual renewal.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1, 11. What the rehabilitation model did <em>not </em>include\u2014 and the SRA therefore did not reject\u2014 was prison treatment programs (including for drug addiction) targeted to offenders\u2019particular needs. See <em>id., </em>at 21, 25, 27-28. So even after the passage of \u00a7 3582(a), <em>amicus </em>argues, a court may impose or lengthen a prison sentence to promote an offender\u2019s participation in a targeted treatment program. The only thing the court may not do is to impose a prison term on the ground that confinement itself\u2014its inherent solitude and routine\u2014will lead to rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">[564 U.S. 333]</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">We think this reading of the SRA is too narrow. For one thing, the relevant history shows that at the time of the SRA\u2019s enactment, prison rehabilitation efforts focused on treatment, counseling, and training programs, not on seclusion and regimentation. See Rotman, The Failure of Reform: United States, 1865-1965, in Oxford History of the Prison: The Practice of Punishment in Western Society 169, 189-190 (N. Morris &amp; D. Rothman eds. 1995) (describing the pre-SRA \u201ctherapeutic model of rehabilitation\u201d as characterized by \u201cindividualized treatment\u201d and \u201cvocational training and group counseling programs\u201d); see also n. 3, <em>supra </em>(noting pre-SRA statutes linking the confinement of drug addicts to the completion of treatment programs). Indeed, Congress had in mind precisely these programs when it prohibited consideration of rehabilitation in imposing a prison term. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(k) (instructing the Sentencing Commission to prevent the use of imprisonment to \u201cprovid [e] the defendant with needed educational or vocational training ... or other correctional treatment\u201d); S. Rep., at 40 (rejecting the \u201cmodel of \u2018coercive\u2019 rehabilitation\u2014the theory of correction that ties prison release dates to the successful completion of certain vocational, educational, and counseling programs within the prisons\u201d). Far from falling outside the \u201crehabilitation model,\u201d these programs practically defined it.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">It is hardly surprising, then, that amicus\u2019s argument finds little support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>in the statutory text.  Read most naturally, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a)\u2019s prohibition on \u201cpromoting correction and rehabilitation\u201d covers efforts to place offenders in rehabilitation programs. Indeed, \u00a7 3582(a)\u2019s language recalls the SRA\u2019s description of the rehabilitative purpose of sentencing\u2014\u201cproviding] the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment.\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D). That description makes clear that, under the SRA, treatment, training, and like programs are rehabilitation\u2019s sum and substance. So amicus\u2019s efforts to exclude rehabilitation programs from the \u201crecognizing\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">[564 U.S. 334]</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">clause\u2019s reach do not succeed. That section prevents a sentencing court from imposing or lengthening a prison term because the court thinks an offender will benefit from a prison treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">In this case, the sentencing transcript suggests the possibility that Tapia\u2019s sentence was based on her rehabilitative needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">We note first what we do <em>not </em>disapprove about Tapia\u2019s sentencing.  A court commits no error by discussing the opportunities for rehabilitation within prison or the benefits of specific treatment or training programs. To the contrary, a court properly may address a person who is about to begin a prison term about these important matters. And as noted earlier, a court may urge the BOP to place an offender in a prison treatment program. See <em>supra, </em>at 331, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 369. Section 3582(a) itself provides, just after the clause at issue here, that a court may \u201cmake a recommendation concerning the type of prison facility appropriate for the defendant\u201d; and in this calculus, the presence of a rehabilitation program may make one facility more appropriate than another. So the sentencing court here did nothing wrong\u2014and probably something very right\u2014in trying to get Tapia into an effective drug treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">But the record indicates that the court may have done more\u2014that it may have selected the length of the sentence to ensure that Tapia could complete the 500 Hour Drug Program. \u201cThe sentence has to be sufficient,\u201d the court explained, \u201cto provide needed correctional treatment, and here I think the needed correctional treatment is the 500 Hour Drug Program.\u201d App. 27; see <em>supra, </em>at 321-322, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 363-364. Or again: The \u201cnumber one\u201d thing \u201cis the need to provide treatment. In other words, so she is in long enough to get the 500 Hour Drug Program.\u201d App. 27; see <em>supra, </em>at 322, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 364. These statements suggest that the court may have calculated the length</p>\n<p id=\"AvfG\">[564 U.S. 335]</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">of Tapia\u2019s sentence to ensure that she receive certain rehabilitative services. And that a sentencing court may not do. As we have held, a court may not impose or lengthen a prison sentence to enable an offender to complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">For the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Consistent with our practice, see, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Marcus, </em>560 U.S. 258, 266-267, 130 S. Ct. 2159, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1012 (2010), we leave it to the Court of Appeals to consider the effect of Tapia\u2019s failure to object to the sentence when imposed. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 123 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-14\">. Three Circuits have held that \u00a7 3582(a) allows a court to lengthen, although not to impose, a prison term based on the need for rehabilitation. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Duran, </em>37 F.3d 557 (CA9 1994); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hawk Wing, </em>433 F.3d 622 (CA8 2006); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>605 F.3d 415 (CA6 2010). Two Courts of Appeals have ruled that \u00a7 3582(a) bars a court from either imposing or increasing a period of confinement for rehabilitative reasons. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Manzella, </em>475 F.3d 152 (CA3 2007); <em>In re Sealed Case, </em>573 F.3d 844 (CADC 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-15\">. We appointed Stephanos Bibas to brief and argue the case, 562 U.S. 1132, 131 S. Ct. 975, 178 L. Ed. 2d 744 (2011), and he has ably discharged his responsibilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b407-12\">. The statutes governing punishment of drug-addicted offenders (like Tapia) provide an example of this system at work. If a court concluded that such an offender was \u201clikely to be rehabilitated through treatment,\u2019\u2019 it could order confinement \u201cfor treatment . . . for an indeterminate period of time\u2019\u2019 not to exceed the lesser of 10 years or the statutory maximum for the offender\u2019s crime. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4253(a) (1982 ed.); see also \u00a7 4251(c) (\u201c \u2018Treatment\u2019 includes confinement and treatment in an institution . . . and includes, but is not limited to, medical, educational, social, psychological, and vocational services, corrective and preventive guidance and training, and other rehabilitative services\u2019\u2019). Once the offender had undergone treatment for six months, the Attorney General could recommend that the Board of Parole release him from custody, and the Board could then order release \u201cin its discretion.\" \u00a7 4254.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b410-9\">. Indeed, we can scarcely imagine a reason why Congress would have wanted to draw the distinction that <em>amicus </em>urges on us. That distinction would prevent a court from considering rehabilitative needs in imposing a 1-month sentence rather than probation, but not in choosing a 60-month sentence over a 1-month term. The only policy argument <em>amicus </em>can offer in favor of this result is that \u201c[t]he effects of imprisonment plateau a short while after the incarceration\u201d and \u201c \u2018[t]he difference in harm between longer and shorter prison terms is smaller than typically assumed.\u2019 <em>\"Amicus </em>Brief 56. But nothing in the SRA indicates that Congress is so indifferent to the length of prison terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b410-10\">. The Government argues that \u201cCongress did not intend to prohibit courts from imposing <em>less </em>imprisonment in order to promote a defendant\u2019s rehabilitation.\u201d Brief for United States 40 (emphasis added). This case does not require us to address that question, and nothing in our decision expresses any views on it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b414-4\">SEPARATE OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"pAUKH\">Justice Sotomayor,</author>\n<p id=\"A1l\">with whom Justice Alito joins, concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a) \u201cprecludes federal courts from imposing or lengthening a prison term in order to promote a criminal defendant\u2019s rehabilitation.\u201d Ante, at 321, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 363. I write separately to note my skepticism that the District Judge violated this proscription in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">At the sentencing hearing, the District Judge carefully reviewed the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). First, he considered \u201c[t]he nature and circumstances of the offense\u201d committed by petitioner Alejandra Tapia\u2014in this case, alien smuggling. App. 25-26; see \u00a7 3553(a)(1). He emphasized that Tapia\u2019s criminal conduct \u201ccreated a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury\u201d to the smuggled aliens. <em>Id., </em>at 26; see also <em>id., </em>at 20 (noting that the aliens were secreted in the vehicle\u2019s gas tank compartment). Second, he reviewed Tapia\u2019s \u201chistory and characteristics,\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(1), including her history of being abused and her associations \u201cwith the wrong people,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 26. He noted his particular concern about Tapia\u2019s criminal conduct while released on bail, when</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">[564 U.S. 336]</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">she failed to appear and was found in an apartment with methamphetamine, a sawed-off shotgun, and stolen mail. <em>Id., </em>at 25-26. Third, he noted that the offense was \u201cserious,\u201d warranting a \u201csufficient\u201d sentence. <em>Id., </em>at 26; see \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). Fourth, he considered the need \u201cto deter criminal conduct\u201d and \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,\u201d which he characterized as a \u201cbig factor here, given [Tapia\u2019s] failure to appear and what she did out on bail.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 26; see \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), (C). Fifth, he took account of the need \u201cto provide needed correctional treatment,\u201d in this case, the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 (BOP) \u201c500 Hour Drug Program,\u201d more officially called the Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program (RDAP). <em>Id., </em>at 27; see \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D). And, finally, he noted the need \u201cto avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities\u201d and the need for the sentence \u201cto be sufficient to effect the purposes of 3553(a) but not greater.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 27; see \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), (a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">Tapia faced a mandatory minimum sentence of 36 months\u2019 incarceration, <em>Id., </em>at 18, but her Guidelines range was 41 to 51 months, <em>id., </em>at 13. After reviewing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the judge imposed a sentence of 51 months, the top of the Guidelines range. He offered two reasons for choosing this sentence: \u201cnumber one,\u201d the need for drug treatment; and \u201c[n]umber two,\u201d deterrence. <em>Id., </em>at 27. With respect to the latter reason, the judge highlighted Tapia\u2019s criminal history and her criminal conduct while released on bail\u2014which, he said, was \u201csomething that motivates imposing a sentence that in total is at the high end of the guideline range.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 27-28. He concluded, \u201cI think that a sentence less than what I am imposing would not deter her and provide for sufficient time so she could begin to address these problems.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">The District Judge\u2019s comments at sentencing suggest that he believed the need to deter Tapia from engaging in further criminal conduct warranted a sentence of 51 months\u2019 incarceration. Granted, the judge also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>mentioned the need to</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">[564 U.S. 337]</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">provide drug treatment through the RDAP. The 51-month sentence he selected, however, appears to have had no connection to eligibility for the RDAP See BOP Program Statement No. P5330.11, \u00a7 2.5.1(b) (Mar. 16, 2009) (providing that, to participate in the RDAP, an inmate must ordinarily have at least 24 months remaining on her sentence). Even the 36-month mandatory minimum would have qualified Tapia for participation in the RDAP. I thus find it questionable that the judge lengthened her term of imprisonment beyond that necessary for deterrence in the belief that a 51-month sentence was necessary for rehabilitation. Cf. S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 176 (1983) (\u201cA term imposed for another purpose of sentencing may . . . have a rehabilitative focus if rehabilitation in such a case is an appropriate secondary purpose of the sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Although I am skeptical that the thoughtful District Judge imposed or lengthened Tapia\u2019s sentence to promote rehabilitation, I acknowledge that his comments at sentencing were not perfectly clear. Given that Ninth Circuit precedent incorrectly permitted sentencing courts to consider rehabilitation in setting the length of a sentence, see <em>ante, </em>at 322-323, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 364, and that the judge stated that the sentence needed to be \u201clong enough to get the 500 Hour Drug Program,\u201d App. 27, I cannot be certain that he did not lengthen Tapia\u2019s sentence to promote rehabilitation in violation of \u00a7 3582(a). I therefore agree with the Court\u2019s disposition of this case and join the Court\u2019s opinion in full.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
