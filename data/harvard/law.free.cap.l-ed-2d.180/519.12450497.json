The Act allows retroactive amendments to the Guidelines for cases where the Guidelines become a cause of inequality, not a bulwark against it. When a retroactive Guidelines amendment is adopted, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) permits defendants sentenced based on a sentencing range that has been modified to move for a reduced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The question here is whether defendants who enter into plea agreements that recommend a particular sentence as a condition of the guilty plea may be eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c)(1)(C) (authorizing such plea agreements). The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that, barring a miscarriage of justice or mutual mistake, defendants who enter into 11(c)(1)(C) agreements cannot benefit from retroactive Guidelines amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Five Members of the Court agree that this judgment must be reversed. The Justices who join this plurality opinion conclude that the categorical bar enacted by the Court of Appeals finds no support in \u00a7 3582(c)(2), Rule 11(c)(1)(C), or the relevant Guidelines policy statements.  In every case the judge must exercise discretion to impose an appropriate sentence. This discretion, in turn, is framed by the Guidelines. And the Guidelines must be consulted, in the regular course, whether the case is one in which the conviction was</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">[564 U.S. 526]</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">after a trial or after a plea, including a plea pursuant to an agreement that recommends a particular sentence. The district judge\u2019s decision to impose a sentence may therefore be based on the Guidelines even if the defendant agrees to plead guilty under Rule 11(c)(1)(C). Where the decision to impose a sentence is based on a range later subject to retroactive amendment, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) permits a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Section 3582(c)(2) empowers district judges to correct sentences that depend on frameworks that later prove unjustified. There is no reason to deny \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief to defendants who linger in prison pursuant to sentences that would not have been imposed but for a since-rejected, excessive range.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">Justice Sotomayor would reverse the judgment on a different ground set out in the opinion concurring in the judgment. That opinion, like the dissent, would hold that sentences following 11(c)(1)(C) agreement are based on the agreement rather than the Guidelines, and therefore that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief is not available in the typical case. But unlike the dissent she would permit the petitioner here to seek a sentence reduction because his plea agreement in express terms ties the recommended sentence to the Guidelines sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">The reasons that lead those Members of the Court who join this plurality opinion may be set forth as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">Federal courts are forbidden, as a general matter, to \u201cmodify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c); but the rule of finality is subject to a few narrow exceptions. Here, the exception is contained in a statutory provision enacted to permit defendants whose Guidelines sentencing range has been lowered by retroactive amendment to move for a sentence reduction if the terms of the statute are met. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-15\">[564 U.S. 527]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-16\">\u201c[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>prisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o) ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">This case concerns the application of the statute to cases in which defendants enter into plea agreements under Rule 11(c)(1)(C).  That Rule permits the parties to \u201cagree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appropriate disposition of the case, ... [a request which] binds the court once the court accepts the plea agreement.\u201d The question is whether defendants who enter into 11(c)(1)(C) agreements that specify a particular sentence may be said to have been sentenced \u201cbased on\u201d a Guidelines sentencing range, making them eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Petitioner William Freeman was indicted in 2005 for various crimes, including possessing with intent to distribute cocaine base. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C). He entered into an agreement under Rule 11(c)(1)(C) in which he agreed to plead guilty to all charges. In return the Government \u201cagree [d] that a sentence of 106 months\u2019 incarceration is the appropriate disposition of this case.\u201d App. 26a. The agreement states that \u201c[b]oth parties have independently reviewed the Sentencing Guidelines applicable in this case,\u201d and that \u201c[Freeman] agrees to have his sentence determined pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 27a-28a The agreement reflects the parties\u2019 expectation that Freeman would face a Guidelines range of 46 to 57 months, <em>ibid. </em>(Offense Level 19, Criminal History Category IV), along with a consecutive mandatory minimum of 60 months for possessing</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">[564 U.S. 528]</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). The recommended sentence of 106 months thus corresponded with the minimum sentence suggested by the Guidelines, in addition to the 60-month \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">The District Court accepted the plea agreement. At the sentencing hearing, the court \u201cadopt[ed] the findings of the probation officer disclosed in the probation report and application of the guidelines as set out therein.\u201d App. 47a. \u201c[H]aving considered the advisory guidelines and 18 USC 3553(a),\u201d the court imposed the recommended 106-month sentence, which was \u201cwithin the guideline ranges\u201d\u2014the 46- to 57-month range the parties had anticipated plus the mandatory 60 months under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u2014and \u201csufficient to meet the objectives of the law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 48a-49a.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-13\">Three years later, the Commission issued a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines to remedy the significant disparity between the penalties for cocaine base and powder cocaine offenses. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706 (Nov. 2010) (USSG) (effective Nov. 1, 2007) (adjusting Guidelines); <em>id., </em>Amdt. 713 (effective Mar. 3, 2008) (making Amendment 706 retroactive). Its effect was to reduce Freeman\u2019s applicable sentencing range to 37 to 46 months, again with the consecutive 60-month mandatory minimum. App. 142a-144a (Sealed).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Freeman moved for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The District Court, however, denied the motion, and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goins, </em>355 Fed. Appx. 1 (2009). Adhering to its decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Peveler, </em>359 F.3d 369 (2004), the Court of Appeals held that defendants sentenced following 11(c)(1)(C) agreements that specify a particular sentence are ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief, barring a miscarriage of justice or mutual mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">This Court granted certiorari. 561 U.S. 1058, 131 S. Ct. 61, 177 L. Ed. 2d 1152 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">[564 U.S. 529]</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Federal sentencing law requires the district judge in every case to impose \u201ca sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with\u201d the purposes of federal sentencing, in light of the Guidelines and other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The Guidelines provide a framework or starting point\u2014a basis, in the commonsense meaning of the term\u2014for the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion. <em>E.g., </em>1 Oxford English Dictionary 977 (2d ed. 1989). Rule 11(c)(1)(C) permits the defendant and the prosecutor to agree that a specific sentence is appropriate, but that agreement does not discharge the district court\u2019s independent obligation to exercise its discretion. In the usual sentencing, whether following trial or plea, the judge\u2019s reliance on the Guidelines will be apparent, for the judge will use the Guidelines range as the starting point in the analysis and impose a sentence within the range. <em>Gall </em>v. <em>United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445 (2007). Even where the judge varies from the recommended range, <em>id., </em>at 50, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445, if the judge uses the sentencing range as the beginning point to explain the decision to deviate from it, then the Guidelines are in a real sense a basis for the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Rule 11(c)(1)(C) makes the parties\u2019 recommended sentence binding on the court \u201conce the court accepts the plea agreement,\u201d but the governing policy statement confirms that the court\u2019s acceptance is itself based on the Guidelines. See USSG \u00a7 6B1.2. That policy statement forbids the district judge to accept an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement without first evaluating the recommended sentence in light of the defendant\u2019s applicable sentencing range. The commentary to \u00a7 6B1.2 advises that a court may accept an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement \u201conly if the court is satisfied either that such sentence is an appropriate sentence within the applicable guideline range or, if not, that the sentence departs from the applicable guideline range for justifiable reasons.\u201d Cf. <em>Stinson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 113 S. Ct. 1913, 123 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1993) (Guidelines commentary is authoritative). Any bargain between the parties is contingent until the</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">[564 U.S. 530]</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">court accepts the agreement. The Guidelines require the district judge to give due consideration to the relevant sentencing range, even if the defendant and prosecutor recommend a specific sentence as a condition of the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">This approach finds further support in the policy statement that applies to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions. See USSG \u00a7 IB 1.10.  It instructs the district court in modifying a sentence to substitute only the retroactive amendment and then leave all original Guidelines determinations in place. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1). In other words, the policy statement seeks to isolate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>whatever marginal effect the since-rejected Guideline had on the defendant\u2019s sentence. Working backwards from this purpose, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) modification proceedings should be available to permit the district court to revisit a prior sentence to whatever extent the sentencing range in question was a relevant part of the analytic framework the judge used to determine the sentence or to approve the agreement. This is the only rule consistent with the governing policy statement, a statement that rests on the premise that a Guideline range may be one of many factors that determine the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Thus,  the text and purpose of the three relevant sources\u2014the statute, the Rule, and the governing policy statements\u2014require the conclusion that the district court has authority to entertain \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions when sentences are imposed in light of the Guidelines, even if the defendant enters into an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The transcript of petitioner\u2019s sentencing hearing reveals that his original sentence was based on the Guidelines. The District Court first calculated the sentencing range, as both \u00a7 3553(a)(4) and \u00a76B1.2(c) require. App. 47a, 49a. It explained that it \u201cconsidered the advisory guidelines and 18 USC 3553(a),\u201d and that \u201cthe sentence imposed ... fall[s] within the guideline rang[e] and [is] sufficient to meet the objectives of the law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 48a-49a. Apart from the defense</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">[564 U.S. 531]</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">attorney\u2019s initial statement that the case involved a \u201c(C) plea,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 47a, the hearing proceeded as if the agreement did not exist. The court expressed its independent judgment that the sentence was appropriate in light of the applicable Guidelines range, and its decision was therefore \u201cbased on\u201d that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">The Government asks this Court to hold that sentences like petitioner\u2019s, which follow an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement, are based only on the agreement and not the Guidelines, and therefore that defendants so sentenced are ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. The Government\u2019s position rests in part on the concern that the conclusion reached here will upset the bargain struck between prosecutor and defendant. See Brief for United States 42-43. That, however, has nothing to do with whether a sentence is \u201cbased on\u201d the Guidelines under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). And in any event, the concern is overstated. Retroactive reductions to sentencing ranges are infrequent, so the problem will not arise often. Klein &amp; Thompson, DOJ\u2019s Attack on Federal Judicial \u201cLeniency,\u201d the Supreme Court\u2019s Response, and the Future of Criminal Sentencing, 44 Tulsa L. Rev. 519, 535 (2009). More important,  the district court\u2019s authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is subject to significant constraints, constraints that can be enforced by appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">The binding policy statement governing \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions places considerable limits on district court discretion. All Guidelines decisions from the original sentencing remain in place, save the sentencing range that was altered by retroactive amendment. USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1). In an initial sentencing hearing, a district court can vary below the Guidelines; but, by contrast, below-Guidelines modifications in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings are forbidden, USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A), except where the original sentence was itself a downward departure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>\u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B). And the court must always \u201cconsider the nature and seriousness of the danger to</p>\n<p id=\"A4D\">[564 U.S. 532]</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">any person or the community that may be posed by a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment.\u201d \u00a7 IB 1.10, comment., n. l(B)(ii). The district court\u2019s authority is limited; and the courts of appeals, and ultimately this Court, can ensure that district courts do not overhaul plea agreements, thereby abusing their authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). See <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 130 S. Ct. 2683, 177 L. Ed. 2d 271 (2010) (reviewing and affirming a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction); <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S., at 49, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445 (all sentences are reviewable for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The Government would enact a categorical bar on \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. But such a bar would prevent district courts from making an inquiry that is within their own special knowledge and expertise. What is at stake in this case is a defendant\u2019s eligibility for relief, not the extent of that relief. Indeed, even where a defendant is permitted to seek a reduction, the district judge may conclude that a reduction would be inappropriate.  District judges have a continuing professional commitment, based on scholarship and accumulated experience, to a consistent sentencing policy. They can rely on the frameworks they have devised to determine whether and to what extent a sentence reduction is warranted in any particular case. They may, when considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, take into account a defendant\u2019s decision to enter into an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement. If the district court, based on its experience and informed judgment, concludes the agreement led to a more lenient sentence than would otherwise have been imposed, it can deny the motion, for the statute permits but does not require the court to reduce a sentence. This discretion ensures that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not produce a windfall.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">As noted, the opinion concurring in the judgment suggests an intermediate position. That opinion argues that in general defendants sentenced following 11(c)(1)(C) agreements are ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief, but relief may be sought where the plea agreement itself contemplates sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">[564 U.S. 533]</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">The statute, however, calls for an inquiry into the reasons for a judge\u2019s sentence, not the reasons that motivated or informed the parties. If, as the Government suggests, the judge\u2019s decision to impose a sentence is based on the agreement, then \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not apply. The parties cannot by contract upset an otherwise-final sentence. And the consequences of this erroneous rule would be significant. By allowing modification only when the terms of the agreement contemplate it, the proposed rule would permit the very disparities the Sentencing Reform Act seeks to eliminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">The Act aims to create a comprehensive sentencing scheme in which those who commit crimes of similar severity under similar conditions receive similar sentences. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6); K. Stith &amp; J. Cabranes, Fear of Judging 104-105 (1998). Section 3582(c)(2) contributes to that goal by ensuring that district courts may adjust sentences imposed pursuant to a range that the Commission concludes are too severe, out of step with the seriousness of the crime and the sentencing ranges of analogous offenses, and inconsistent with the Act\u2019s purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">The crack-cocaine range here is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>prime example of an unwarranted disparity that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is designed to cure. The Commission amended the crack-cocaine Guidelines to effect a \u201cpartial remedy\u201d for the \u201curgent and compelling\u201d problem of crack-cocaine sentences, which, the Commission concluded, \u201csignificantly undermines the various congressional objectives set forth in the Sentencing Reform Act.\u201d United States Sentencing Commission, Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 8-10 (May 2007); see also USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706; <em>Kimbrough </em>v. <em>United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 99-100, 128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481 (2007). The Commission determined that those Guidelines were flawed, and therefore that sentences that relied on them ought to be reexamined. There is no good reason to extend the benefit of the Commission\u2019s judgment only to an arbitrary subset of defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">[564 U.S. 534]</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">whose agreed sentences were accepted in light of a since-rejected Guidelines range based on whether their plea agreements refer to the Guidelines. Congress enacted \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to remedy systemic injustice, and the approach outlined in the opinion concurring in the judgment would undercut a systemic solution.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Even when a defendant enters into an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement, the judge\u2019s decision to accept the plea and impose the recommended sentence is likely to be based on the Guidelines; and when it is, the defendant should be eligible to seek \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. This straightforward analysis would avoid making arbitrary distinctions between similar defendants based on the terms of their plea agreements. And it would also reduce unwarranted disparities in federal sentencing, consistent with the purposes of the Sentencing Reform Act.</p>\n<p id=\"pA9Pp\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"86\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAT4AAABWAQAAAAB+k8ceAAAAn0lEQVR4nGP8z0AU+MtEnDoGhlGFowpHFY4qHF4KDyALYuX8hwD5/0gAC+cPzdx4QbYBIYaVA1W4A0kKOweq0OYPkhx2DsRrHzci+RMb5w9U4T9+JDlsHFjwMAog2YadA9H3Yz2SIdg4MBNfMiIZgpUDVfiIAylIsHKgCo+wIBmCnQNxyXs7JGdh4/wZwNTDONoCGFU4qnBU4ajCIasQAIvA/lQeu0gdAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"318\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b574-9\">Justice Sotomayor,</author>\n<p id=\"AYgL\">concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">I agree with the plurality that petitioner William Freeman is eligible for sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), but I differ as to the reason why. In my view, the term of imprisonment imposed by a district court pursuant to an agreement authorized by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) ((C) agreement) is \u201cbased on\u201d the agreement itself, not on the judge\u2019s calculation of the Sentencing Guidelines. However, I believe that if a (C) agreement expressly uses a Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the charged offense to establish the term of imprisonment, and that range is subsequently lowered by the United States Sentencing Commission, the term of imprisonment is \u201cbased on\u201d the range employed and the defendant is eligible for sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">[564 U.S. 535]</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">To ask whether a particular term of imprisonment is \u201cbased on\u201d a Guidelines sentencing range is to ask whether that range serves as the basis or foundation for the term of imprisonment. No term of imprisonment\u2014 whether derived from a (C) agreement or otherwise\u2014has legal effect until the court enters judgment imposing it. As a result, in applying \u00a7 3582(c)(2) a court must discern the foundation for the term of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge. As the plurality explains, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>normal course the district judge\u2019s calculation of the Guidelines range applicable to the charged offenses will serve as the basis for the term of imprisonment imposed. See <em>ante, </em>at 529, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 529; see also <em>Gall </em>v. <em>United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Sentencing under (C) agreements, however, is different. At the time of sentencing, the term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement does not involve the court\u2019s independent calculation of the Guidelines or consideration of the other 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court may only accept or reject the agreement, and if it chooses to accept it, at sentencing the court may only impose the term of imprisonment the agreement calls for; the court may not change its terms. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c)(3)(A) (\u201cTo the extent the plea agreement is of the type specified in [Rule 11(c)(1)(C)], the court may accept the agreement, reject it, or defer a decision until the court has reviewed the presentence report\u201d); Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes on 1979 Amendments to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11, 18 U.S.C. App., pp. 583-584 (1982 ed.) (\u201c[C]ritical to a ... (C) agreement is that the defendant receive the . . . agreed-to sentence\u201d); accord, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rivera-Martnez, </em>607 F.3d 283, 286 (CA1 2010); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Green, </em>595 F.3d 432, 438 (CA2 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In the (C) agreement context, therefore, it is the binding plea agreement that is the foundation for the term of imprisonment to which the defendant is sentenced. At the moment of sentencing, the court simply implements the terms</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">[564 U.S. 536]</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">of the agreement it has already accepted. Contrary to the plurality\u2019s view, see <em>ante, </em>at 529-530, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 529-530, the fact that United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a76B 1.2(c) (Nov. 2010) (USSG), instructs a district court to use the Guidelines as a yardstick in deciding whether to accept a (C) agreement does not mean that the term of imprisonment imposed by the court is \u201cbased on\u201d a particular Guidelines sentencing range. The term of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge is dictated by the terms of the agreement entered into by the parties, not the judge\u2019s Guidelines calculation. In short, the term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement is, for purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), \u201cbased on\u201d the agreement itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">To hold otherwise would be to contravene the very purpose of (C) agreements\u2014to bind the district court and allow the Government and the defendant to determine what sentence he will receive. Although district courts ordinarily have significant discretion in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on a particular defendant, see <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S., at 46, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445, under Rule 11(c)(1)(C) it is the parties\u2019 agreement that determines the sentence to be imposed, see Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes on 1999 Amendments to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11, 18 U.S.C. App., p. 1570 (2000 ed.) (noting that, under a (C) agreement, \u201cthe government and defense have actually agreed on what amounts to an appropriate sentence.... [T]his agreement is binding on the court once the court accepts it\u201d). To be sure, the court \u201cretains absolute discretion whether to accept a plea agreement,\u201d <em>ibid.., </em>but once it does it is bound at sentencing to give effect to the parties\u2019 agreement as to the appropriate term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">Allowing district courts later to reduce a term of imprisonment simply because the court itself considered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Guidelines in deciding whether to accept the agreement would transform \u00a7 3582(c)(2) into a mechanism by which courts could rewrite the terms of (C) agreements in ways not contemplated</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">[564 U.S. 537]</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">by the parties. At the time that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) was enacted in 1984, it was already well understood that, under Rule 11, the term of imprisonment stipulated in a (C) agreement bound the district court once it accepted the agreement. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(e)(1)(C) (1982) (specifying that the parties to a (C) agreement may \u201cagree that a specific sentence is the appropriate disposition of the case\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>French, </em>719 F.2d 387, 389, n. 2 (CA11 1983) <em>(per curiam) </em>(noting that a Rule 11(e)(1)(C) plea agreement was a \u201c \u2018binding\u2019 plea bargain\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">In the absence of any indication from the statutory text or legislative history that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) was meant to fundamentally alter the way in which Rule 11(c)(1)(C) operates, I cannot endorse the plurality\u2019s suggestion that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) should be understood \u201cto permit the district court to revisit a prior sentence to whatever extent the sentencing range in question was a relevant part of the analytic framework the judge used to determine the sentence or to approve the agreement.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 530, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 530; cf. <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826, 130 S. Ct. 2683, 177 L. Ed. 2d 271 (2010) (\u201cCongress intended [\u00a7 3582(c)(2)] to authorize only a limited adjustment to an otherwise final sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">By the same token, the mere fact that the parties to a (C) agreement may have considered the Guidelines in the course of their negotiations does not empower the court under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce the term of imprisonment they ultimately agreed upon, as Freeman argues. Undoubtedly, he is correct that in most cases the Government and the defendant will negotiate the term of imprisonment in a (C) agreement by reference to the applicable Guidelines provisions. See Brief for Petitioner 30-31 (\u201c[T]he Guidelines are . . . the starting point and initial benchmark for plea</p>\n<p id=\"AXUj\">[564 U.S. 538]</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">negotiations\u201d); Brief for United States 33 (noting the \u201cconcededly strong likelihood that the parties will . . . calculate] and conside[r] potential Guidelines ranges in the course of negotiating a plea agreement and selecting a specific sentence\u201d). This only makes sense; plea bargaining necessarily occurs in the shadow of the sentencing scheme to which the defendant would otherwise be subject. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 255, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2005) (\u201c[P]lea bargaining takes place in the shadow of... a potential trial\u201d (emphasis deleted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">The term of imprisonment imposed by the district court, however, is not \u201cbased on\u201d those background negotiations; instead, as explained above, it is based on the binding agreement produced by those negotiations. I therefore cannot agree with Freeman that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) calls upon district courts to engage in a free-ranging search through the parties\u2019 negotiating history in search of a Guidelines sentencing range that might have been relevant to the agreement or the court\u2019s acceptance of it. Nor can I agree with the plurality that the district judge\u2019s calculation of the Guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>lines provides the basis for the term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">These conclusions, however, do not mean that a term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement can <em>never </em>be reduced under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), as the Government contends. For example, Rule 11(c)(1)(C) allows the parties to \u201cagree that a specific . . . sentencing range is the appropriate disposition of the case.\u201d In delineating the agreed-upon term of imprisonment, some (C) agreements may call for the defendant to be sentenced within a particular Guidelines sentencing range. In such cases, the district court\u2019s acceptance of the agreement obligates the court to sentence the defendant accordingly, and there can be no doubt that the term of imprisonment the court imposes is \u201cbased on\u201d the agreed-upon sentencing range within the meaning of \u00a7 3582(c)(2). If</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">[564 U.S. 539]</p>\n<p id=\"aks-dedup-1\">that Guidelines range is subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission, the defendant is eligible for sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Similarly, a plea agreement might provide for a specific term of imprisonment\u2014such as a number of months\u2014but also make clear that the basis for the specified term is a Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the offense to which the defendant pleaded guilty. As long as that sentencing range is evident from the agreement itself, for purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) the term of imprisonment imposed by the court in accordance with that agreement is \u201cbased on\u201d that range. Therefore, when a (C) agreement expressly uses a Guidelines sentencing range to establish the term of imprisonment, and that range is subsequently lowered by the Commission, the defendant is eligible for sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">In so holding, I necessarily reject the categorical rule advanced by the Government and endorsed by the dissent, which artificially divorces a (C) agreement from its express terms.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the very purpose of a (C) agreement is to</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">[564 U.S. 540]</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">allow the parties to determine the defendant\u2019s sentence, when the agreement itself employs the particular Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the charged offenses in establishing the term of imprisonment, the defendant is eligible to have his sentence reduced under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In such cases, the district court\u2019s reduction of the sentence does not rewrite the plea agreement; instead, it enforces the agreement\u2019s terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Like the plurality, I am not persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that allowing a term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement to be reduced under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) deprives the Government of the benefit of the bargain it struck with the defendant. When a (C) agreement explicitly employs a particular Guidelines sentencing range to establish the term of imprisonment, the agreement itself demonstrates the parties\u2019 intent that the imposed term of imprisonment will be based on that range, as required for sentence reduction under the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Government\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">[564 U.S. 541]</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">concern that application of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to (C) agreements will result in certain defendants receiving an \u201cunjustified windfall\u201d is therefore misplaced. See Brief for United States 40, 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Furthermore, in cases where the Government believes that even the limited sentence reduction authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 improperly benefits the defendant, it can argue to the district court that the court should not exercise its discretion under the statute to reduce the sentence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Dillon, </em>560 U.S., at 826, 130 S. Ct. 2683, 177 L. Ed. 2d 271 (noting that, in applying \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the court must \u201cconsider whether the authorized reduction is warranted, either in whole or in part, according to the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">Finally, if the Government wants to ensure <em>ex ante </em>that a particular defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment will not be reduced later, the solution is simple enough: Nothing prevents the Government from negotiating with a defendant to secure a waiver of his statutory right to seek sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), just as it often does with respect to a defendant\u2019s rights to appeal and collaterally attack the conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2006 ed., Supp. III); see also App. 28a-29a (provision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Freeman\u2019s agreement expressly waiving both rights). In</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">[564 U.S. 542]</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">short, application of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to an eligible defendant does not\u2014and will not\u2014deprive the Government of the benefit of its bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">In order to conclude that Freeman is eligible for sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the plea agreement between Freeman and the Government must use a Guidelines sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission to establish the term of imprisonment imposed by the District Court. Freeman\u2019s agreement does.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The agreement states that Freeman \u201cagrees to have his sentence determined pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 28a, and that 106 months is the total term of imprisonment to be imposed, <em>id., </em>at 26a. The agreement also makes clear that the \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) count to which Freeman agrees to plead guilty carries a minimum sentence of 60 months, \u201cwhich must be served consecutively to\u201d any other sentence imposed. <em>Id., </em>at 27a. This leaves 46 months unaccounted for. The agreement sets Freeman\u2019s offense level at 19, as determined by the quantity of drugs and his acceptance of responsibility, and states that the parties anticipate a criminal history category of IV. <em>Id., </em>at 27a-28a. Looking to the Sentencing Guidelines, an offense level of 19 and a criminal history category of IV produce a sentencing range of 46 to 57 months.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See USSG ch. 5, pt. A (sentencing table). Therefore, contrary to the dissent\u2019s curious suggestion that \u201cthere is no way of knowing what th[e] sentence was \u2018based on,\u2019 \u201d <em>post, </em>at 549, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 541, it is evident that Freeman\u2019s agreement employed the 46-month figure at the bottom end</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">[564 U.S. 543]</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">of this sentencing range, in combination with the 60-month mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), to establish his 106-month sentence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus the first of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u2019s conditions is satisfied\u2014 Freeman\u2019s term of imprisonment is \u201cbased on\u201d a Guidelines sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">In 2007 the Commission amended the Guidelines provisions applicable to cocaine base offenses, such that the offense level applicable to the quantity of drugs for which Freeman was charged was lowered from 22 to 20. See App. 142a-143a (Sealed); USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706. Taking into account the three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Freeman\u2019s recalculated offense level is 17, resulting in an amended sentencing range of 37 to 46 months. Thus there can be no doubt that the Guidelines sentencing range originally used to establish Freeman\u2019s term of imprisonment \u201chas subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2), such that the amendment \u201cha[s]</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">[564 U.S. 544]</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">the effect of lowering [Freeman\u2019s] applicable guideline range,\u201d \u00a7 IB 1.10(a)(2)(B). As a result, Freeman\u2019s term of imprisonment satisfies the second of \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u2019s conditions. I therefore concur in the plurality\u2019s judgment that he is eligible for sentence reduction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-11\">. Prior to 2002, Rule ll\u2019s provisions governing binding plea agreements were located in Rule 11(e)(1)(C). In substance they were largely identical to the current rules in 11(c)(1)(C). See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(e)(1)(C) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b577-12\">. The dissent suggests that this rule results from a \u201cmistaken shift in analysis\u2019\u2019 in this opinion from the actions of the judge to the intent of the parties. See <em>post, </em>at 547, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 540 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.). The purpose of a (C) agreement, however, is to bind the sentencing court to the terms agreed upon by the parties. See <em>supra, </em>at 536-537, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 533-534. Therefore, to determine whether a sentence imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement was \u201cbased on\u2019\u2019 a Guidelines sentencing range, the reviewing court must necessarily look to the agreement itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b577-13\">. The majority of the Courts of Appeals to have addressed this question have taken approaches consistent with the one I take today. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rivera-Martnez, </em>607 F.3d 283, 286-287 (CA1 2010); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>598 F.3d 407, 409-410 (CA7 2010); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Main, </em>579 F.3d 200, 203 (CA2 2009); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scurlark, </em>560 F.3d 839, 842-843 (CA8 2009). It appears that only the Third Circuit has applied the absolute rule advanced by the Government. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>562 F.3d 275, 282, and n. 8 (2009). As noted by the plurality, see <em>ante, </em>at 525, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 527, even the Sixth Circuit allows for sentence reduction \u201cto avoid a miscarriage of justice or to correct a mutual mistake,\u2019\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Peveler, </em>359 F.3d 369, 378, n. 4 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). And only two Courts of Appeals have adopted a wide-ranging approach similar to the one suggested by Freeman. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 209, 214 (CA5 2010) <em>(per curiam); United States </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>584 F.3d 979, 985 (CA10 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b578-10\">.

See <em>post, </em>at 548, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 540 (citing USSG \u00a7 IB 1.10(b)(1). But in so arguing, the dissent\u2014like the Government\u2014would have courts ignore the agreement\u2019s express terms, which the court \u201capplie[s]\u201d when imposing the term of imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b578-11\">. The plurality asserts that \u201c[t]here is no good reason to extend the benefit [of sentence reduction] only to an arbitrary subset of defendants . . . based on whether their plea agreements refer to the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 533-534, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 532. But the \u201cgood reason\u201d is evident: Rule ll(c)(l)(C)\u2019s entire purpose is to allow the parties\u2019 intent to determine sentencing outcomes. See <em>supra, </em>at 536-537, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 533-534. If a (C) agreement does not indicate the parties\u2019 intent to base the term of imprisonment on a particular Guidelines range subsequently lowered by the Commission, then \u00a7 3582(c)(2) simply does not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b578-12\">. For example, the district court might decline to reduce the term of imprisonment of an eligible defendant in light of the Government\u2019s argument that it made significant concessions in the agreement\u2014such as dropping a charge or forgoing a future charge\u2014and therefore it would not have agreed to a lower sentence at the time the agreement was made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b578-13\">. The opposite would not necessarily be true, however, under the reading of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proposed by the Government and the dissent. If a district court has no statutory authority to reduce a term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement\u2014because such a term is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>never \u201cbased on\u2019\u2019 a Guidelines sentencing range within the meaning of \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u2014it is not clear how the parties could effectively confer that authority upon the court by the terms of their agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b579-13\">. Because it is the parties\u2019 agreement that controls in the (C) agreement context, see <em>supra, </em>at 536-537, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 533-534, even if the District Court had calculated the range differently than the parties, see <em>post, </em>at 550-551, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 542-543 (Roberts, C. J., dissenting), Freeman would still be eligible for resentencing, as long as the parties\u2019 chosen range was one that was \u201csubsequently . . . lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u2019\u2019 \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b579-14\">. The dissent asks whether Freeman would be eligible for sentence reduction if the agreement had called for a 53-month term of imprisonment. See <em>post, </em>at 550, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 542. Though that question is not presented by the facts of this case, the answer is evident from the foregoing discussion: If the agreement itself made clear that the parties arrived at the 53-month term of imprisonment by determining the sentencing range applicable to Freeman\u2019s offenses and then halving the 106-month figure at its low end, he would have been eligible under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>600 F.3d 893, 897 (CA7 2010) (noting that a (C) agreement would not foreclose relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if it provided that the term of imprisonment was to be 40 percent below the low end of the applicable sentencing range).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-15\">Of course, if a (C) agreement \u201cdoes not contain any references to the Guidelines,\u2019\u2019 <em>post, </em>at 550, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 542 (Roberts, C.

Ed. 2d, at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">Section 3582(c)(2) provides that \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d a district court \u201cmay reduce the term of imprisonment ... if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d The lone issue here is whether petitioner William Freeman meets the initial prerequisite of having been sentenced to a term of imprisonment \u201cbased on\u201d a subsequently reduced sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">I agree with Justice Sotomayor that \u201cthe term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement is, for purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), \u2018based on\u2019 the agreement itself.\u201d Ante, at 536, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 533. In this case, Freeman executed a written plea agreement in which the parties \u201cagree [d] that a sentence of 106</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">[564 U.S. 545]</p>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">months\u2019 incarceration [was] the appropriate disposition.\u201d App. 26a. Because the plea agreement was entered pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C), that proposed sentence became binding on the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Court once it accepted the agreement. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c)(1)(C) (the parties\u2019 \u201crequest\u201d for \u201ca specific sentence\u201d \u201cbinds the court once the court accepts the plea agreement\u201d). As a result, when determining the sentence to impose on Freeman, the District Court needed to consult one thing and one thing only\u2014the plea agreement. See <em>ante, </em>at 535-536, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 532-533 (opinion of So-tomayor, J.) (\u201cAt the moment of sentencing, the court simply implements the terms of the agreement it has already accepted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">I also agree with Justice Sotomayor that the \u201cterm of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge is dictated by the terms of the agreement entered into by the parties, not the judge\u2019s Guidelines calculation,\u201d and that \u201c[a]llowing district courts later to reduce a term of imprisonment simply because the court itself considered the Guidelines in deciding whether to accept the agreement would transform \u00a7 3582(c)(2) into a mechanism by which courts could rewrite the terms of (C) agreements in ways not contemplated by the parties.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 536-537, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 533-534.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">But then comes the 0. Henry twist: After cogently explaining why a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) sentence is based on the plea agreement, Justice Sotomayor diverges from that straightforward conclusion and holds that Freeman nevertheless satisfies the threshold requirement in \u00a7 3582(c)(2). According to her opinion, if a Rule 11( c)(1)(C) \u201cagreement expressly uses a Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the charged offense to establish the term of imprisonment\u201d\u2014or if such use is \u201cevident from the agreement\u201d\u2014 then the defendant\u2019s \u201cterm of imprisonment is \u2018based on\u2019 the range employed and the defendant is eligible for sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d Ante, at 534, 539, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 532, 535. This exception is in my view as mistaken as the position of the plurality\u2014and basically for the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">[564 U.S. 546]</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Justice Sotomayor begins the departure from her own rule innocently enough. As she explains, \u201csome (C) agreements may call for the defendant to be sentenced within a particular Guidelines sentencing range.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 538, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 535. In such a case, according to Justice So-tomayor, there can be \u201cno doubt\u201d that the prison term the court imposes is \u201cbased on\u201d the agreed-upon sentencing range, and therefore the defendant is eligible for sentence reduction. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Whether or not that is true, it provides no support for the next step:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-10\">\u201cSimilarly, a plea agreement might provide for a specific term of imprisonment\u2014such as a number of months\u2014but also make clear that the basis for the specified term is a Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the offense to which the defendant pleaded guilty. As long as that sentencing range is evident from the agreement itself . . . the term of imprisonment imposed by the court in accordance with that agreement is \u2018based on\u2019 that <em>range.\u201d Ante, </em>at 539, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 535.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">This category of cases is not \u201csimilar\u201d to the first at all. It is one thing to say that a sentence imposed pursuant to an agreement expressly providing that the court will sentence the defendant within an applicable Guidelines range is \u201cbased on\u201d that range. It is quite another to conclude that an agreement providing for a specific term is \u201csimilarly\u201d based on a Guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>lines range, simply because the specified term can be said to reflect that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">According to the concurrence, if the parties simply \u201cconsider [] the Guidelines\u201d or \u201cnegotiate ... by reference\u201d to them, the defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction. <em>Ante, </em>at 537, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 534. If, however, the agreement sets forth a specific term but it is somehow \u201cclear that the basis for the specified term is a Guidelines sentencing range,\u201d then the defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction. <em>Ante, </em>at 539, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 535. This head-scratching distinction between negotiating by reference</p>\n<p id=\"A-qq\">[564 U.S. 547]</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">to the Guidelines and using them as a basis for the specified term makes for an unworkable test that can yield only arbitrary results.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The confusion is compounded by the varying standards in the concurrence. Sometimes the test is whether an agreement \u201cexpressly uses\u201d a Guidelines sentencing range, <em>ante, </em>at 534, 539, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 532, 535; see <em>ante, </em>at 540, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 536 (\u201cexplicitly employs\u201d). Other times the test is whether such use is \u201cevident,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 539, 542, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 535, 537; see <em>ante, </em>at 543, n. 9, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 537 (\u201cclear\u201d). A third option is whether the agreement <em>\u201cindicatefs] </em>the parties\u2019 intent to base the term of imprisonment on a particular Guidelines <em>range\u201d Ante, </em>at 540, n. 5, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 536 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">The error in the concurring opinion is largely attributable to a mistaken shift in analysis. In the first half of the opinion, the inquiry properly looks to what the <em>judge </em>does: He is, after all, the one who imposes the sentence. After approving the agreement, the judge considers only the fixed term in the agreement, so the sentence he actually imposes is not \u201cbased on\u201d the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">In the second half of the opinion, however, the analysis suddenly shifts, and focuses on the parties: Did <em>they </em>\u201cuse\u201d or \u201cemploy\u201d the Guidelines in arriving at the term in their agreement? But \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is concerned only with whether a defendant \u201chas been <em>sentenced </em>to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Only a court can sentence a defendant, so there is no basis for examining why the parties settled on a particular prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">This conclusion dovetails with United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1) (Nov. 2010) (USSG)\u2014the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement governing whether a defendant is eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). As we explained last Term, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) requires a district court \u201cto follow the Commission\u2019s instructions in \u00a7 IB 1.10 to determine the prisoner\u2019s eligibility for a sentence modification.\u201d <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 827, 130 S. Ct. 2683, 177 L. Ed. 2d 271 (2010). According to \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1), the court must</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">[564 U.S. 548]</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">first determine \u201cthe amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant\u201d if the retroactively amended provision had been in effect at the time of his sentencing. \u201cIn making such determination, the court shall substitute only the amendments . . . for the corresponding guideline provisions that were <em>applied when the defendant was </em>sentenced.\u201d USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1), p.s. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">As noted, the District Court sentenced Freeman pursuant to the term specified by his plea agreement; it never \u201capplied\u201d a Guidelines provision in imposing his term of imprisonment. The fact that the court may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>have \u201cuse[d] the Guidelines as a yardstick in deciding whether to accept a (C) agreement does not mean that the term of imprisonment imposed by the court is \u2018based on\u2019 a particular Guidelines sentencing range.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 536, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 533 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.). Even if the Guidelines were \u201cused\u201d or \u201cemployed\u201d <em>by the parties </em>in arriving at the Rule 11(c)(1)(C) sentencing term, they were not \u201capplied when the defendant was sentenced.\u201d Once the District Court accepted the agreement, all that was later \u201capplied\u201d was the sentence set forth in that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Justice Sotomayor is wrong to assert that her standard \u201cdoes not rewrite the plea agreement\u201d but rather \u201cenforces the agreement\u2019s terms.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 540, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 536. According to the concurrence, \u201c[w]hen a (C) agreement explicitly employs a particular Guidelines sentencing range to establish the term of imprisonment, the agreement itself demonstrates the parties\u2019 intent that the imposed term of imprisonment will be based on that range,\u201d and therefore subject to reduction if the Commission subsequently lowers that range. <em>Ibid. </em>In this case, Justice Sotomayor concludes that Freeman\u2019s agreement contemplated such a reduction, even though the parties had \u201cagree [d] that a sentence of 106 months\u2019 incarceration is the appropriate disposition of this case.\u201d App. 26a.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">There is, however, no indication whatever that the parties to the agreement contemplated the prospect of lowered sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">[564 U.S. 549]</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">ranges. And it is fanciful to suppose that the parties would have said \u201c106 months\u201d if what they really meant was \u201ca sentence at the lowest end of the applicable Guidelines range.\u201d Cf. <em>id., </em>at 25a (parties in this case recommending \u201ca fine at the lowest end of the applicable Guideline Range\u201d). In concluding otherwise, the concurrence \u201cignore [s] the agreement\u2019s express terms.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 540, n. 4, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">The reality is that whenever the parties choose a fixed term, there is no way of knowing what that sentence was \u201cbased on.\u201d The prosecutor and the defendant could well have had quite different reasons for concluding that 106 months was a good deal. Perhaps the prosecutor wanted to devote the limited resources of his office to a different area of criminal activity, rather than try this case. Perhaps the defendant had reason to question the credibility of one of his key witnesses, and feared a longer sentence if the case went to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">Indeed, the fact that there may be uncertainty about how to calculate the appropriate Guidelines range could be the basis for agreement on a fixed term in a plea under Rule 11(c)(1)(C). Here the agreement made clear that there was some doubt about the Guidelines calculations. See App. 28a (\u201cBoth parties reserve the right to object to the USSG \u00a7 4A1.1 calculation of defendant\u2019s criminal history\u201d); <em>ibid, </em>(the parties acknowledge that their Guidelines calculations \u201care not binding upon the Court\u201d and that the \u201cdefendant understands the Court will independently calculate the Guidelines at sentencing and defendant may not withdraw the plea of guilty solely because the Court does not agree with . . . [the] Sentencing Guideline application\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">In addition, parties frequently enter plea agreements that reflect pros-ecutorial decisions not to pursue particular counts. If a defendant faces three counts, and agrees to plead to one if the prosecutor does not pursue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>the other two, is the sentence reflected in the Rule 11(c)(1)(C) agreement in any sense \u201cbased on\u201d the Guidelines sentencing range for the</p>\n<p id=\"ASnZ\">[564 U.S. 550]</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">one count to which the defendant pleaded? Surely not. The concurrence tacitly concedes as much when it suggests that an agreement to \u201cdrop[ ] a charge or forgot ] a future charge\u201d could ultimately be grounds for not reducing the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Ante, </em>at 541, n. 6, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 536. But what this really shows is a basic flaw in the \u201cbased on\u201d test adopted by that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Finally, Justice Sotomayor\u2019s approach will foster confusion in an area in need of clarity. As noted, courts will be hard pressed to apply the distinction between referring to and relying on a Guidelines range. Other questions abound:</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">What if the agreement contains a particular Guidelines calculation but the agreement\u2019s stipulated sentence is outside the parties\u2019 predicted Guidelines range? The test in the concurring opinion is whether the agreement \u201cuses\u201d or \u201cemploys\u201d a Guidelines sentencing range to establish the term of imprisonment, <em>ante, </em>at 534, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 532, not whether that term falls within the range. In this case, what if the term was 53 months\u2014exactly half the low end of the sentencing range anticipated by the parties? Is it \u201cevident\u201d in that case that the Guidelines were used or employed to establish the agreed-upon sentence?<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">What if the plea agreement does not contain any references to the Guidelines\u2014not even the partial and tentative Guidelines calculations in Freeman\u2019s agreement\u2014but the binding sentence selected by the parties corresponds exactly to the low end of the applicable Guidelines range? Is it \u201cevident\u201d in that case that the agreement is based on a sentencing range?</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">What if the District Court calculates the applicable Guidelines range differently than the parties? This is no academic</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">[564 U.S. 551]</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">hypothetical. See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>600 F.3d 893, 896-897 (CA7 2010) (noting that \u201cthe district court settled on a higher guidelines range than that contemplated in the [Rule 11(c)(1)(C)] plea agreement\u201d). Is a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) sentence still subject to reduction if the parties relied on the wrong sentencing range? Justice Sotomayor\u2019s surprising answer is \u201cyes,\u201d see <em>ante, </em>at 542, n. 8, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 537, even though the governing Guidelines provision specifies that a defendant is only eligible for sentence reduction if the amended Guideline has \u201cthe effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range\u201d\u2014presumably the <em>correct </em>applicable guideline range. See USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B), p.s. Relying on error is just one unforeseen consequence of looking not to the specified term in a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) agreement, but instead trying to reconstruct what led the parties to agree to that term in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">This confusion will invite the very thing Justice Sotomayor claims to disavow: a \u201cfree-ranging search\u201d by district courts \u201cthrough the parties\u2019 negotiating history in search of a Guidelines sentencing range that might have been relevant to the agreement.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 538, 180 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>2d, at 534. This is particularly unfortunate given that the whole point of Rule 11(c)(1)(C) agreements is to provide the parties with certainty about sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"pasm-dedup-0\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"39\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAVcAAAAmAQAAAABYQ+VlAAAAj0lEQVR4nGP8z0As+M9EtFIGhlG1FKk9gCyOlfMfDuT//8fL+Ud7916QbWDAz0Go3YEki52DUGvzB0kaOwfu2Y8bkXyOjfMPofYfP5I0Ng5SmDEKIFmLnQPX/WM9klHYOEjmvmREMgorB6H2EQdSOGHlINQeYUEyCjsH7qr3dkhOxMb5NxjSGeNoGTXs1QIAqlIQAa+rJdwAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"343\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">As with any negotiation, parties entering a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement must take the bitter with the sweet. Because of today\u2019s decision, however, Freeman gets more sweet and the Government more bitter than either side bargained for. But those who will really be left with a sour taste after today\u2019s decision are the lower courts charged with making sense of it going forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b584-13\"> Justice Sotomayor responds that \u201c[i]f the agreement itself made clear\u201d that the parties arrived at the 53-month figure by determining the sentencing range and then halving the range\u2019s low end\u2014106 months\u2014then the sentence could be reduced. <em>Ante, </em>at 543, n. 9, 180 L.
