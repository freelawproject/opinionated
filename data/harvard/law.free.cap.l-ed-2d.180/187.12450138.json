The common law, however, has recognized an exception to the privilege when a trustee obtains legal advice related to the exercise of fiduciary duties. In such cases, courts have held, the trustee cannot withhold attorney-client communications from the beneficiary of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">In this case, we consider whether the fiduciary exception applies to the general trust relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes. We hold that it does not. Although the Government\u2019s responsibilities with respect to the management of funds belonging to Indian tribes bear some resemblance to those of a private trustee, this analogy cannot be taken too far. The trust obligations of the United States to the Indian tribes are established and governed by statute rather than the common law, and in fulfilling its statutory duties, the Government acts not as a private trustee but pursuant to its sovereign interest in the execution of federal law. The reasons for the fiduciary exception\u2014that</p>\n<p id=\"ABT\">[564 U.S. 166]</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">the trustee has no independent interest in trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>administration, and that the trustee is subject to a general common-law duty of disclosure\u2014do not apply in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"A0B\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The Jicarilla Apache Nation (Tribe) occupies a 900,000-acre reservation in northern New Mexico that was established by Executive Order in 1887. The land contains timber, gravel, and oil and gas reserves, which are developed pursuant to statutes administered by the Department of the Interior. Proceeds derived from these natural resources are held by the United States in trust for the Tribe pursuant to the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 4239, and other statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">In 2002, the Tribe commenced a breach-of-trust action against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims (CFC). The Tribe sued under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 (2006 ed. and Supp. III), and the Indian Tucker Act, \u00a7 1505, which vest the CFC with jurisdiction over claims against the Government that are founded on the Constitution, laws, treaties, or contracts of the United States. The complaint seeks monetary damages for the Government\u2019s alleged mismanagement of funds held in trust for the Tribe. The Tribe argues that the Government violated various laws, including 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 161a and 162a, that govern the management of funds held in trust for Indian tribes. See 88 Fed. Cl. 1, 3 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">From December 2002 to June 2008, the Government and the Tribe participated in alternative dispute resolution in order to resolve the claim. During that time, the Government turned over thousands of documents but withheld 226 potentially relevant documents as protected by the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work-product doctrine, or the deliberative-process privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">In 2008, at the request of the Tribe, the case was restored to the active litigation docket. The CFC divided the case</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">[564 U.S. 167]</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">into phases for trial and set a discovery schedule. The first phase, relevant here, concerns the Government\u2019s management of the Tribe\u2019s trust accounts from 1972 to 1992. The Tribe alleges that during this period the Government failed to invest its trust funds properly. Among other things, the Tribe claims the Government failed to maximize returns on its trust funds, invested too heavily in short-term maturities, and failed to pool its trust funds with other tribal trusts. During discovery, the Tribe moved to compel the Government to produce the 226 withheld documents. In response, the Government agreed to withdraw its claims of deliberative-process privilege and, accordingly, to produce 71 of the documents. But the Government continued to assert the attorney-client privilege and attorney work-product doctrine with respect to the remaining 155 documents. The CFC reviewed those documents <em>in camera </em>and classified them into five categories: (1) requests for legal advice relating to trust administration sent by personnel at the Department of the Interior to the Office of the Solicitor, which directs legal affairs for the Department, (2) legal advice sent from the Solicitor\u2019s Office to personnel at the Interior and Treasury Departments, (3) documents generated under contracts between Interior and an accounting firm, (4) Interior documents concerning litigation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>other tribes, and (5) miscellaneous documents not falling into the other categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The CFC granted the Tribe\u2019s motion to compel in part. The CFC held that communications relating to the management of trust funds fall within a \u201cfiduciary exception\u201d to the attorney-client privilege. Under that exception, which courts have applied in the context of common-law trusts, a trustee who obtains legal advice related to the execution of fiduciary obligations is precluded from asserting the attorney-client privilege against beneficiaries of the trust. The CFC concluded that the trust relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes is sufficiently analogous</p>\n<p id=\"Ars\">[564 U.S. 168]</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">to a common-law trust relationship that the exception should apply. Accordingly, the CFC held, the United States may not shield from the Tribe communications with attorneys relating to trust matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The CFC ordered disclosure of almost all documents in the first two categories because those documents \u201cinvolve matters regarding the administration of tribal trusts, either directly or indirectly implicating the investments that benefit Jicarilla\u201d and contain \u201clegal advice relating to trust administration.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 14-15. The CFC allowed the Government to withhold most of the documents in the remaining categories as attorney work product,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but the court identified some individual documents that it determined were also subject to the fiduciary exception. <em>Id., </em>at 18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The Government sought to prevent disclosure of the documents by petitioning the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for a writ of mandamus directing the CFC to vacate its production order. The Court of Appeals denied the petition because, in its view, the CFC correctly applied the fiduciary exception. The court held that \u201cthe United States cannot deny an Indian tribe\u2019s request to discover communications between the United States and its attorneys based on the attorney-client privilege when those communications concern management of an Indian trust and the United States has not claimed that the government or its attorneys considered a specific competing interest in those communications.\u201d <em>In re United States, </em>590 F.3d 1305, 1313 (CA Fed. 2009). In qualifying its holding, the court recognized that sometimes the Government may have other statutory obligations that clash with its fiduciary duties to the Indian tribes. But because the Government had not alleged that the legal advice in this case related to such conflicting interests, the</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">[564 U.S. 169]</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">court reserved judgment on how the fiduciary exception might apply in that situation. The court rejected the Government\u2019s argument that, because its duties to the Indian tribes were governed by statute rather than the common law, it had no general duty of disclosure that would override the attorney-client privilege. The court also disagreed with the Government\u2019s contention that a case-by-case approach made the attorney-client privilege too unpredictable and would impair the Government\u2019s ability to obtain confidential legal advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">We granted certiorari, 562 U.S. 1128, 131 S. Ct. 856, 178 L. Ed. 2d 622 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>(2011),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and now reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The Federal Rules of Evidence provide that evidentiary privileges \u201cshall be governed by the principles of the common law ... in the light of reason and experience.\u201d Fed. Rule Evid. 501. The attorney-client privilege \u201cis the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law.\u201d <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>449 U.S. 383, 389, 101 S. Ct. 677, 66 L. Ed. 2d 584 (1981) (citing 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2290 (J. McNaughton rev. 1961)). Its aim is \u201cto encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice.\u201d 449 U.S., at 389, 101 S. Ct. 677, 66 L. Ed. 2d 584; <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Blackburn, </em>128 U.S. 464, 470, 9 S. Ct. 125, 32 L. Ed. 488 (1888).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The objectives of the attorney-client privilege apply to governmental clients. \u201cThe privilege aids government entities</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">[564 U.S. 170]</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">and employees in obtaining legal advice founded on a complete and accurate factual picture.\u201d 1 Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 74, Comment <em>b, </em>pp. 573-574 (1998). Unless applicable law provides otherwise, the Government may invoke the attorney-client privilege in civil litigation to protect confidential communications between Government officials and Government attorneys. <em>Id., </em>at 574 (\u201c[G]overnmental agencies and employees enjoy the same privilege as nongovernmental counterparts\u201d). The Tribe argues, however, that the common law also recognizes a fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege and that, by virtue of the trust relationship between the Government and the Tribe, documents that would otherwise be privileged must be disclosed. As preliminary matters, we consider the bounds of the fiduciary exception and the nature of the trust relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">English courts first developed the fiduciary exception as a principle of trust law in the 19th century. The rule was that when a trustee obtained legal advice to guide the administration of the trust, and not for the trustee\u2019s own defense in litigation, the beneficiaries were entitled to the production of documents related to that advice. <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Humberston, </em>27 Beav. 421, 423-424, 54 Eng. Rep. 165, 166 (1858); <em>Talbot </em>v. <em>Marshfield, </em>2 Dr. &amp; Sm. 549, 550-551, 62 Eng. Rep. 728, 729 (1865). The courts reasoned that the normal attorney-client privilege did not apply in this situation because the legal advice was sought for the beneficiaries\u2019 benefit and was obtained at the beneficiaries\u2019 expense by using trust funds to pay the attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Ibid.; Wynne, supra, </em>at 423-424, 54 Eng. Rep., at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">The fiduciary exception quickly became an established feature of English common law, see, <em>e.g., In re Mason, </em>22 Ch. D. 609 (1883), but it did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>not appear in this country until the following century. American courts seem first to have expressed</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">[564 U.S. 171]</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">skepticism. See <em>In re Prudence-Bonds Corp., </em>76 F. Supp. 643, 647 (EDNY 1948) (declining to apply the fiduciary exception to the trustee of a bondhold-ing corporation because of the \u201cimportant right of such a corporate trustee ... to seek legal advice and nevertheless act in accordance with its own judgment\u201d). By the 1970\u2019s, however, American courts began to adopt the English common-law rule. See <em>Garner </em>v. <em>Wolfinbarger, </em>430 F.2d 1093, 1103-1104 (CA5 1970) (allowing shareholders, upon a showing of \u201cgood cause,\u201d to discover legal advice given to corporate management).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The leading American case on the fiduciary exception is <em>Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington, D. C. </em>v. <em>Zimmer, </em>355 A.2d 709 (Del. Ch. 1976). In that case, the beneficiaries of a trust estate sought to compel the trustees to reimburse the estate for alleged breaches of trust. The beneficiaries moved to compel the trustees to produce a legal memorandum related to the administration of the trust that the trustees withheld on the basis of attorney-client privilege. The Delaware Chancery Court, observing that \u201cAmerican case law is practically nonexistent on the duty of a trustee in this context,\u201d looked to the English cases. <em>Id., </em>at 712. Applying the common-law fiduciary exception, the court held that the</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">[564 U.S. 172]</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">memorandum was discoverable. It identified two reasons for applying the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">First, the court explained, the trustees had obtained the legal advice as \u201cmere representative [s]\u201d of the beneficiaries because the trustees had a fiduciary obligation to act in the beneficiaries\u2019 interest when administering the trust. <em>Ibid. </em>For that reason, the beneficiaries were the \u201creal clients\u201d of the attorney who had advised the trustee on trust-related matters, and therefore the attorney-client privilege properly belonged to the beneficiaries rather than the trustees. <em>Id., </em>at 711-712. The court based its \u201creal client\u201d determination on several factors: (1) When the advice was sought, no adversarial proceedings between the trustees and beneficiaries had been pending, and therefore there was no reason for the trustees to seek legal advice in a personal rather than a fiduciary capacity; (2) the court saw no indication that the memorandum was intended for any purpose other than to benefit the trust; and (3) the law firm had been paid out of trust assets. That the advice was obtained at the beneficiaries\u2019 expense was not only a \u201csignificant factor\u201d entitling the beneficiaries to see the document but also \u201ca strong indication of precisely who the real clients were.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 712. The court distinguished between \u201clegal advice procured at the trustee\u2019s <em>own </em>expense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>and for his <em>own </em>protection,\u201d which would remain privileged, \u201cand the situation where the trust itself is assessed for obtaining opinions of counsel where interests of the beneficiaries are presently at stake.\u201d <em>Ibid- </em>In the latter case, the fiduciary exception applied, and the trustees could not withhold those attorney-client communications from the beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Second, the court concluded that the trustees\u2019 fiduciary duty to furnish trust-related information to the beneficiaries outweighed their interest in the attorney-client privilege. \u201cThe policy of preserving the full disclosure necessary in the trustee-beneficiary relationship,\u201d the court explained, \u201cis here ultimately more important than the protection of the</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">[564 U.S. 173]</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">trustees\u2019 confidence in the attorney for the trust.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 714. Because more information helped the beneficiaries to police the trustees\u2019 management of the trust, disclosure was, in the court\u2019s judgment, \u201ca weightier public policy than the preservation of confidential attorney-client communications.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The Federal Courts of Appeals apply the fiduciary exception based on the same two criteria. See, <em>e.g., In re Long Island Lighting Co., </em>129 F.3d 268, 272 (CA2 1997); <em>Wachtel </em>v. <em>Health Net, Inc., </em>482 F.3d 225, 233-234 (CA3 2007); <em>Solis </em>v. <em>Food Employers Labor Relations Assn., </em>644 F.3d 221, 227-228 (CA4 2011); <em>Wildbur </em>v. <em>ARCO Chemical Co., </em>974 F.2d 631, 645 (CA5 1992); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>796 F.2d 264, 265-266 (CA9 1986) <em>(per curiam). </em>Not until the decision below had a federal appellate court held the exception to apply to the United States as trustee for the Indian tribes.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">In order to apply the fiduciary exception in this case, the Court of Appeals analogized the Government to a private trustee. 590 F.3d, at 1313. We have applied that analogy in limited contexts, see, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. 206, 226, 103 S. Ct. 2961, 77 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1983) <em>(Mitchell II), </em>but that does not mean the Government resembles a private trustee in every respect. On the contrary, this Court has previously noted that  the relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes is distinctive, \u201cdifferent from that existing between individuals whether dealing at arm\u2019s length, <em>as trustees and. beneficiaries, </em>or otherwise.\u201d <em>Klamath and Moadoc Tribes </em>v. <em>United States, </em>296 U.S. 244, 254, 56 S. Ct. 212, 80 L. Ed. 202 (1935) (emphasis added). \u201cThe <em>general </em>relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes is not comparable to a private trust relationship.\u201d <em>Cherokee Nation of Okla. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>21 Cl. Ct. 565, 573 (1990) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">The Government, of course, is not a private trustee. Though the relevant statutes denominate the relationship</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">[564 U.S. 174]</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">between the Government and the Indians a \u201ctrust,\u201d see, <em>e.g., </em>25 U.S.C. \u00a7 162a, that trust is defined and governed by statutes rather than the common law. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Navajo Nation, </em>537 U.S. 488, 506, 123 S. Ct. 1079, 155 L. Ed. 2d 60 (2003) <em>(Navajo I) </em>(\u201c[T]he analysis must train on specific rights-creating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory prescriptions\u201d). As we have recognized in prior cases, Congress may style its relations with the Indians a \u201ctrust\u201d without assuming all the fiduciary duties of a private trustee, creating a trust relationship that is \u201climited\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>\u201cbare\u201d compared to a trust relationship between private parties at common law. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>445 U.S. 535, 542, 100 S. Ct. 1349, 63 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980) <em>(Mitchell I); Mitchell II, supra, </em>at 224, 103 S. Ct. 2961, 77 L. Ed. 2d 580.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The difference between a private common-law trust and the statutory Indian trust follows from the unique position of the Government as sovereign.  The distinction between \u201cpublic rights\u201d against the Government and \u201cprivate rights\u201d between private parties is well established. The Government consents to be liable to private parties \u201cand may yield this consent upon such terms and under such restrictions as it may think just.\u201d <em>Murray\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co., </em>18 How. 272, 283, 15 L. Ed. 372 (1856). This creates an important distinction \u201cbetween cases of private right and those which arise between the Government and persons subject to its authority in connection with the performance of the constitutional functions of the executive or legislative departments.\u201d <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>285 U.S. 22, 50, 52 S. Ct. 285, 76 L. Ed. 598 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">[564 U.S. 175]</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Throughout the history of the Indian trust relationship, we have recognized that the organization and management of the trust is a sovereign function subject to the plenary authority of Congress. See <em>Merrion </em>v. <em>Jicarilla Apache Tribe, </em>455 U.S. 130, 169, n. 18, 102 S. Ct. 894, 71 L. Ed. 2d 21 (1982) (\u201cThe United States retains plenary authority to divest the tribes of any attributes of sovereignty\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>435 U.S. 313, 319, 98 S. Ct. 1079, 55 L. Ed. 2d 303 (1978) (\u201cCongress has plenary authority to legislate for the Indian tribes in all matters, including their form of government\u201d); <em>Winton </em>v. <em>Amos, </em>255 U.S. 373, 391, 41 S. Ct. 342, 65 L. Ed. 684 (1921) (\u201cCongress has plenary authority over the Indians and all their tribal relations, and full power to legislate concerning their tribal property\u201d); <em>Lone Wolf </em>v. <em>Hitchcock, </em>187 U.S. 553, 565, 23 S. Ct. 216, 47 L. Ed. 299 (1903) (\u201cPlenary authority over the tribal relations of the Indians has been exercised by Congress from the beginning, and the power has always been deemed a political one, not subject to be controlled by the judicial department of the government\u201d); <em>Cherokee Nation </em>v. <em>Hitchcock, </em>187 U.S. 294, 308, 23 S. Ct. 115, 47 L. Ed. 183 (1902) (\u201cThe power existing in Congress to administer upon and guard the tribal property, and the power being political and administrative in its nature, the manner of its exercise is a question within the province of the legislative branch to determine, and is not one for the courts\u201d); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Candelaria, </em>271 U.S. 432, 439, 46 S. Ct. 561, 70 L. Ed. 1023 (1926); <em>Tiger </em>v. <em>Western Investment Co., </em>221 U.S. 286, 315, 31 S. Ct. 578, 55 L. Ed. 738 (1911).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Because the Indian trust relationship represents an exercise of that authority, we have explained that the Government \u201chas a real and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>direct interest\u201d in the guardianship it exercises over the Indian tribes; \u201cthe interest is one which is vested in it as a sovereign.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>270 U.S. 181, 194, 46 S. Ct. 298, 70 L. Ed. 539 (1926). This is especially so because the Government has often structured the trust relationship to pursue its own policy goals. Thus, while trust administration \u201crelat[es] to the welfare of the Indians, the maintenance of the limitations which Congress has prescribed as a part of its plan of distribution is distinctly an interest of the United</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">[564 U.S. 176]</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">States.\u201d <em>Heckman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>224 U.S. 413, 437, 32 S. Ct. 424, 56 L. Ed. 820 (1912); see also <em>Candelaria, supra, </em>at 443-444, 46 S. Ct. 561, 70 L. Ed. 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">In <em>Heckman, </em>the Government brought suit to cancel certain conveyances of allotted lands by members of an Indian tribe because the conveyances violated restrictions on alienation imposed by Congress. This Court explained that the Government brought suit as the representative of the very Indian grantors whose conveyances it sought to cancel, and those Indians were thereby bound by the judgment. 224 U.S., at 445-446, 32 S. Ct. 424, 56 L. Ed. 820. But while it was formally acting as a trustee, the Government was in fact asserting its own sovereign interest in the disposition of Indian lands, and the Indians were precluded from intervening in the litigation to advance a position contrary to that of the Government. <em>Id., </em>at 445, 32 S. Ct. 424, 56 L. Ed. 820. Such a result was possible because the Government assumed a fiduciary role over the Indians not as a common-law trustee but as the governing authority enforcing statutory law.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">We do not question \u201cthe undisputed existence of a general trust relationship between the United States and the Indian people.\u201d <em>Mitchell II, </em>463 U.S., at 225, 103 S.

Congress has expressed this policy in a series of statutes that have defined and redefined the trust relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes. In some cases, Congress established only a limited trust relationship to serve a narrow purpose. See <em>Mitchell I, supra, </em>at 544, 100 S. Ct. 1349, 63 L.

The Indian tribes have been called \u201cdomestic dependent nations,\u201d <em>Cherokee Nation </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>5 Pet. 1, 17, 8 L. Ed. 25 (1831), under the \u201ctutelage\u201d of the United States, <em>Heckman, supra, </em>at 444, 32 S. Ct. 424, 56 L. Ed. 820, and subject to \u201cthe exercise of the Government\u2019s guardianship over . . . their affairs,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sandoval, </em>231 U.S. 28, 48, 34 S. Ct. 1, 58 L. Ed. 107 (1913). These concepts do not necessarily correspond</p>\n<p id=\"ARW\">[564 U.S. 178]</p>\n<p id=\"AgVW\">to a common-law trust relationship. See, <em>e.g., </em>Restatement 2d, \u00a7 7, at 22 (\u201cA guardianship is not a trust\u201d). That is because Congress has chosen to structure the Indian trust relationship in different ways. We will apply common-law trust principles where Congress has indicated it is appropriate to do so. For that reason, the Tribe must point to a right conferred by statute or regulation in order to obtain otherwise privileged information from the Government against its wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">In this case, the Tribe\u2019s claim arises from 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 161a-162a and the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994, \u00a7 4001 <em>et seq. </em>These provisions define \u201cthe trust responsibilities of the United States\u201d with respect to tribal funds. \u00a7 162a(d). The Court of Appeals concluded that the trust relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes, outlined in these and other statutes, is \u201csufficiently similar to a private trust to justify applying the fiduciary exception.\u201d 590 F.3d, at 1313. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">As we have discussed,  the Government exercises its carefully delimited trust responsibilities in a sovereign capacity to implement national policy respecting the Indian tribes. The two features justifying the fiduciary exception\u2014the beneficiary\u2019s status as the \u201creal client\u201d and the trustee\u2019s common-law duty to disclose information about the trust\u2014are notably absent in the trust relationship Congress has established between the United States and the Tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The Court of Appeals applied the fiduciary exception based on its determination that the Tribe rather than the Government was the \u201creal client\u201d with respect to the Government attorneys\u2019 advice. <em>Ibid. </em> In cases applying the fiduciary exception, courts identify the \u201creal client\u201d based on whether the advice was bought by the trust corpus, whether</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">[564 U.S. 179]</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">the trustee had reason to seek advice in a personal rather than a fiduciary capacity, and whether the advice could have been intended for any purpose other than to benefit the trust. <em>Riggs, </em>355 A.2d, at 711-712. Applying these factors, we conclude that the United States does not obtain legal advice as a \u201cmere representative\u201d of the Tribe; nor is the Tribe the \u201creal client\u201d for whom that advice is intended. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Here, the Government attorneys are paid out of congressional appropriations at no cost to the Tribe. Courts look to the source of funds as a \u201cstrong indication of precisely who the real clients were\u201d and a \u201csignificant factor\u201d in determining who ought to have access to the legal advice. <em>Id., </em>at 712. We similarly find it significant that the attorneys were paid by the Government for advice regarding the Government\u2019s statutory obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">The payment structure confirms our view that the Government seeks legal advice in its sovereign capacity rather than as a conventional fiduciary of the Tribe. Undoubtedly, Congress intends the Indian tribes to benefit from the Government\u2019s management of tribal trusts. That intention represents \u201ca humane and self imposed policy\u201d based on felt \u201cmoral obligations.\u201d <em>Seminole Nation, </em>316 U.S., at 296-297, 62 S. Ct. 1049, 86 L. Ed. 1480. This statutory purpose does not imply a full common-law trust, however. Cf. Restatement 2d, \u00a7 25, Comment <em>b, </em>at 69 (\u201cNo trust is created if the settlor manifests an intention to impose merely a moral obligation\u201d). Congress makes such policy judgments pursuant to its sovereign governing authority, and the implementation of federal policy remains \u201cdistinctly an interest of the United States.\u201d <em>Heckman, </em>224 U.S., at 437, 32 S. Ct. 424, 56 L. Ed. 820.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We have said that \u201cthe United States continue [s]</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">[564 U.S. 180]</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">as trustee to have an active interest\u201d in the disposition of Indian assets because the terms of the trust relationship embody policy goals of the United States. <em>McKay </em>v. <em>Kalyton, </em>204 U.S. 458, 469, 27 S. Ct. 346, 51 L. Ed. 566 (1907).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">In some prior cases, we have found that the Government had established the trust relationship in order to impose its own policy on Indian lands. See <em>Mitchell I, </em>445 U.S., at 544 (Congress \u201cintended that the United States \u2018hold the land ... in trust\u2019. . . because it wished to prevent alienation of the land\u201d). In other cases, the Government has invoked its trust relationship to prevent state interference with its policy toward the Indian tribes. See <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>United States, </em>305 U.S. 382, 386, 59 S. Ct. 292, 83 L. Ed. 235 (1939); <em>Candelaria, </em>271 U.S., at 442-444, 46 S. Ct. 561, 70 L. Ed. 1023; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kagama, </em>118 U.S. 375, 382-384, 6 S. Ct. 1109, 30 L. Ed. 228 (1886). And the exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>of federal authority thereby established has often been \u201cleft under the acts of Congress to the discretion of the Executive Department.\u201d <em>Heckman, supra, </em>at 446, 32 S. Ct. 424, 56 L. Ed. 820. In this way, Congress has designed the trust relationship to serve the interests of the United States as well as to benefit the Indian tribes. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rickert, </em>188 U.S. 432, 443, 23 S. Ct. 478, 47 L. Ed. 532 (1903) (trust relationship \u201c \u2018authorizes the adoption on the part of the United States of such policy as their own public interests may dictate\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Choctaw Nation </em>v. <em>United States, </em>119 U.S. 1, 28, 7 S. Ct. 75, 30 L. Ed. 306 (1886))).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">[564 U.S. 181]</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We cannot agree with the Tribe and its <em>amici </em>that \u201c[t]he government and its officials who obtained the advice have no stake in [the] substance of the advice, beyond their trustee role,\u201d Brief for Respondent 9, or that \u201cthe United States\u2019 interests in trust administration were identical to the interests of the tribal trust fund beneficiaries,\u201d Brief for National Congress of American Indians et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>5. The United States has a sovereign interest in the administration of Indian trusts distinct from the private interests of those who may benefit from its administration. Courts apply the fiduciary exception on the ground that \u201cmanagement does not manage for itself.\u201d <em>Garner, </em>430 F.2d, at 1101; <em>Wachtel, </em>482 F.3d, at 232 (\u201c[O]f central importance in both <em>Garner </em>and <em>Riggs </em>was the fiduciary\u2019s lack of a legitimate personal interest in the legal advice obtained\u201d). But the Government is never in that position. While one purpose of the Indian trust relationship is to benefit the tribes, the Government has its own independent interest in the implementation of federal Indian policy. For that reason,  when the Government seeks legal advice related to the administration of tribal trusts, it establishes an attorney-client relationship related to its sovereign interest in the execution</p>\n<p id=\"Add\">[564 U.S. 182]</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">of federal law. In other words, the Government seeks legal advice in a \u201cpersonal\u201d rather than a fiduciary capacity. See <em>Riggs, </em>355 A.2d, at 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Moreover, the Government has too many competing legal concerns to allow a case-by-case inquiry into the purpose of each communication. When \u201cmultiple interests\u201d are in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>volved in a trust relationship, the equivalence between the interests of the beneficiary and the trustee breaks down. <em>Id., </em>at 714. That principle applies with particular force to the Government. Because of the multiple interests it must represent, \u201cthe Government cannot follow the fastidious standards of a private fiduciary, who would breach his duties to his single beneficiary solely by representing potentially conflicting interests without the beneficiary\u2019s consent.\u201d <em>Nevada </em>v. <em>United States, </em>463 U.S. 110, 128, 103 S. Ct. 2906, 77 L. Ed. 2d 509 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">As the Court of Appeals acknowledged, the Government may be obliged \u201cto balance competing interests\u201d when it administers a tribal trust. 590 F.3d, at 1315. The Government may need to comply with other statutory duties, such as the environmental and conservation obligations that the Court of Appeals discussed. See <em>id., </em>at 1314-1315. The Government may also face conflicting obligations to different tribes or individual Indians. See, <em>e.g., Nance </em>v. <em>EPA, </em>645 F.2d 701, 711 (CA9 1981) (Federal Government has \u201cconflicting fiduciary responsibilities\u201d to the Northern Cheyenne and Crow Tribes); <em>Hoopa Valley Tribe </em>v. <em>Christie, </em>812 F.2d 1097, 1102 (CA9 1986) (\u201cNo trust relation exists which can be discharged to the plaintiff here at the expense of other Indians\u201d). Within the bounds of its \u201cgeneral trust relationship\u201d with the Indian people, we have recognized that the Government has \u201cdiscretion to reorder its priorities from serving a subgroup of beneficiaries to serving the broader class of all Indians nationwide.\u201d <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Vigil, </em>508 U.S. 182, 195, 113 S. Ct. 2024, 124 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1993); see also <em>ibid. </em>(\u201cFederal Government \u2018does have a fiduciary obligation to the Indians; but it is a fiduciary obligation that is owed to <em>all </em>Indian tribes\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Hoopa</em></p>\n<p id=\"A6k\">[564 U.S. 183]</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\"><em>Valley Tribe, supra, </em>at 1102)). And sometimes, we have seen, the Government has enforced the trust statutes to dispose of Indian property contrary to the wishes of those for whom it was nominally kept in trust. The Government may seek the advice of counsel for guidance in balancing these competing interests. Indeed, the point of consulting counsel may be to determine whether conflicting interests are at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The Court of Appeals sought to accommodate the Government\u2019s multiple obligations by suggesting that the Government may invoke the attorney-client privilege if it identifies \u201ca specific competing interest\u201d that was considered in the particular communications it seeks to withhold. 590 F.3d, at 1313. But the conflicting interests the Government must consider are too pervasive for such a case-by-case approach to be workable.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">We have said that for the attorney-client privilege to be effective, it must be predictable. See <em>Jaffee </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>518 U.S. 1, 18, 116 S. Ct. 1923, 135 L. Ed. 2d 337 (1996); <em>Upjohn, </em>449 U.S., at 393, 101 S. Ct. 677, 66 L. Ed. 2d 584. If the Government were required to identify the specific interests it considered in each communication, its ability to receive confidential legal advice would be substantially compromised. The Government will not always be able to predict what considerations qualify as a \u201cspecific competing interest,\u201d especially in advance of receiving counsel\u2019s advice. Forcing the Government to monitor all the considerations contained in each communication with counsel would render its attorney-client privilege \u201clittle better than no privilege at all.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The Court of Appeals also decided the fiduciary exception properly applied to the Government because \u201cthe fiduciary has a duty to disclose all information related to trust management to the beneficiary.\u201d 590 F.3d, at 1312.  In general, the common-law trustee of an irrevocable trust must produce trust-related information to the beneficiary on a reasonable</p>\n<p id=\"A00\">[564 U.S. 184]</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">basis, though this duty is sometimes limited and may be modified by the settlor. Restatement (Third) of Trusts \u00a7 82 (2005) (hereinafter Restatement 3d); Bogert \u00a7\u00a7 962, 965.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The fiduciary exception applies where this duty of disclosure overrides the attorney-client privilege. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mett, </em>178 F.3d 1058, 1063 (CA9 1999) (\u201c[T]he fiduciary exception can be understood as an instance of the attorney-client privilege giving way in the face of a competing legal principle\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The United States, however, does not have the same common-law disclosure obligations as a private trustee. As we have previously said, common-law principles are relevant only when applied to a \u201cspecific, applicable, trust-creating statute or regulation.\u201d <em>Navajo II, </em>556 U.S., at 302, 129 S. Ct. 1547, 173 L. Ed. 2d 429. The relevant statute in this case is  25 U.S.C. \u00a7 162a(d), which delineates \u201ctrust responsibilities of the United States\u201d that the Secretary of the Interior must discharge. The enumerated responsibilities include a provision identifying the Secretary\u2019s obligation to provide specific information to tribal</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">[564 U.S. 185]</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">account holders: The Secretary must \u201csuppl[y] account holders with periodic statements of their account performance\u201d and must make \u201cavailable on a daily basis\u201d the \u201cbalances of their account.\u201d \u00a7 162a(d)(5). The Secretary has complied with these requirements by adopting regulations that instruct the Office of Trust Fund Management to provide each tribe with a quarterly statement of performance, 25 CFR \u00a7 115.801 (2010), that identifies \u201cthe source, type, and status of the trust funds deposited and held in a trust account; the beginning balance; the gains and losses; receipts and disbursements; and the ending account balance of the quarterly statement period,\u201d \u00a7 115.803. Tribes may request more frequent statements or further \u201cinformation about account transactions and balances.\u201d \u00a7 115.802.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">The common law of trusts does not override the specific trust-creating statute and regulations that apply here. Those provisions define the Government\u2019s disclosure obligation to the Tribe. The Tribe emphasizes, Brief for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Respondent 34, that the statute identifies the list of trust responsibilities as nonexhaustive. See \u00a7 162a(d) (trust responsibilities \u201care not limited to\u201d those enumerated). The Government replies that this clause \u201cis best read to refer to other statutory and regulatory requirements\u201d rather than to common-law duties. Brief for United States 38. Whatever Congress intended, we cannot read the clause to include a general common-law duty to disclose all information related to the administration of Indian trusts.  When Congress provides specific statutory obligations, we will not read a \u201ccatchall\u201d provision to impose general obligations that would include those specifically enumerated. <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>473 U.S. 134, 141-142, 105 S. Ct. 3085, 87 L.

Ct. 2182, 100 L. Ed. 2d 836 (1988). Reading the statute to incorporate the</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">[564 U.S. 186]</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">full duties of a private, common-law fiduciary would vitiate Congress\u2019 specification of narrowly defined disclosure obligations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">By law and regulation, moreover, the documents at issue in this case are classed \u201cthe property of the United States\u201d while other records are \u201cthe property of the tribe.\u201d 25 CFR \u00a7 115.1000 (2010); see also \u00a7\u00a7 15.502, 162.111, 166.1000. Just as the source of the funds used to pay for legal advice is highly relevant in identifying the \u201creal client\u201d for purposes of the fiduciary exception, we consider ownership of the resulting records to be a significant factor in deciding who \u201cought to have access to the document.\u201d See <em>Riggs, </em>355 A.2d, at 712.

Some state courts have altogether rejected the notion that the attorney-client privilege is subject to a fiduciary exception. See, <em>e.g., Huie </em>v. <em>DeShazo, </em>922 S.W.2d 920, 924 (Tex. 1996) (\u201cThe attorney-client privilege serves the same important purpose in the trustee-attorney relationship as it does in other attorney-client relationships\u201d); <em>Wells Fargo Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., 22 </em>Cal. 4th 201, 208-209, 990 P.2d 591, 595 (2000) (\u201c[T]he attorney for the trustee of a trust is not, by virtue of this relationship, also the attorney for the beneficiaries of the trust\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).

Congress has structured the trust relationship to reflect its considered judgment about how the Indians ought to be governed. For example, the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 388, was \u201ca comprehensive congressional attempt to change the role of Indians in American society.\u201d F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law \u00a7 1.04, p. 77 (2005 ed.) (hereinafter Cohen). Congress aimed to promote the assimilation of Indians by dividing Indian lands into individually owned allotments. The federal policy aimed \u2018To substitute a new individual way of life for the older Indian communal way.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 79. The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 984, marked a shift away \u201cfrom assimilation policies and toward more tolerance and respect for traditional aspects of Indian culture.\u201d Cohen \u00a7 1.05, at 84. The Act prohibited further allotment and restored tribal ownership. Id., at 86. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, 88 Stat. 2203, and the Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 4270, enabled tribes to run health, education, economic development, and social programs for themselves. Cohen \u00a7 1.07, at 103. This strengthened self-government supported Congress\u2019 decision to authorize tribes to withdraw trust funds from Federal Government control and place the funds under tribal control. American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 4242-4244; see 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4021-4029 (2006 ed. and Supp. III). The control over the Indian tribes that has been exercised by the United States pursuant to the trust relationship\u2014forcing the division of tribal lands, restraining alienation\u2014does not correspond to the fiduciary duties of a common-law trustee. Rather, the trust relationship has been altered and administered as an instrument of federal policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b248-11\">. We assume for the sake of argument that an Indian trust is properly analogized to an irrevocable trust rather than to a revocable trust. A revocable trust imposes no duty of the trustee to disclose information to the beneficiary. \u201c[W]hile a trust is revocable, only the person who may revoke it is entitled to receive information about it from the trustee.\u201d Bogert \u00a7 962, at 25, \u00a7 964; Restatement 3d, \u00a7 74, Comment <em>e, </em>at 31 (\u201c[T]he trustee of a revocable trust is not to provide reports or accountings or other information concerning the terms or administration of the trust to other beneficiaries without authorization either by the settlor or in the terms of the trust or a statute\u201d). In many respects, Indian trusts resemble revocable trusts at common law because Congress has acted as the settlor in establishing the trust and retains the right to alter the terms of the trust by statute, even in derogation of tribal property interests. See <em>Winton </em>v. <em>Amos, </em>255 U.S. 373, 391, 41 S. Ct. 342, 65 L.

The Government has not advanced the argument that the relationship here is similar to a revocable trust, and the point need not be addressed to resolve this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b249-11\">. Our reading of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 162a(d) receives additional support from another statute in which Congress expressed its understanding that the Government retains evidentiary privileges allowing it to withhold information related to trust property from Indian tribes. The Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982, 96 Stat. 1976, addressed Indian claims that the claimants desired to have litigated by the United States. If the Secretary of the Interior decided to reject a claim for litigation, he was required to furnish a report to the affected Indian claimants and, upon their request, to provide \u201cany nonprivileged research materials or evidence gathered by the United States in the documentation of such claim.\u2019\u2019 <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 5(b), at 1978.

See <em>ante, </em>at 181-183, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 204-205. Unlike a private trustee, the Government has its own \u201cdistinc[t] interest\u201d in the faithful carrying out of the laws governing the conduct of tribal affairs. <em>Heckman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>224 U.S. 413, 437, 32 S. Ct. 424, 56 L. Ed. 820 (1912). This unique \u201cnational interest,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>obligates Government attorneys, in rendering advice, to make their own \u201cindependent evaluation of the law and facts\u201d in an effort \u201cto arrive at a single position of the United States,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 124a (Letter from Attorney General Griffin B. Bell to Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus (May 31, 1979)). \u201cFor that reason,\u201d as the Court explains, \u201cthe Government seeks legal advice in a \u2018personal\u2019 rather than a fiduciary capacity.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 181, 182, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 204. The attorney-client privilege thus protects the Government\u2019s communications with its attorneys from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">[564 U.S. 188]</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Going beyond attorney-client communications, the Court holds that the Government \u201cassumes Indian trust responsibilities only to the extent it expressly accepts those responsibilities by statute.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 177, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 202. The Court therefore concludes that the trust relationship described by 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 162a does not include the usual \u201ccommon-law disclosure obligations.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 184, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 206. Because it is unnecessary to decide what information <em>other than </em>attorney-client communications the Government may withhold from the beneficiaries of tribal trusts, I concur only in the Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b250-14\">Justice Sotomayor,</author>\n<p id=\"Abv\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">Federal Indian policy, as established by a network of federal statutes, requires the United States to act strictly in a fiduciary capacity when managing Indian trust fund accounts. The interests of the Federal Government as trustee and the Jicarilla Apache Nation (Nation) as beneficiary are thus entirely aligned in the context of Indian trust fund management. Where, as here, the governing statutory scheme establishes a conventional fiduciary relationship, the Government\u2019s duties include fiduciary obligations derived from common-law trust principles. Because the common-law rationales for the fiduciary exception fully support its application in this context, I would hold that the Government may not rely on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>the attorney-client privilege to withhold from the Nation communications between the Government and its attorneys relating to trust fund management.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">The Court\u2019s decision to the contrary rests on false factual and legal premises and deprives the Nation and other Indian tribes of highly relevant evidence in scores of pending cases seeking relief for the Government\u2019s alleged mismanagement of their trust funds. But perhaps more troubling is the majority\u2019s disregard of our settled precedent that looks to common-law trust principles to define the scope of the Government\u2019s fiduciary obligations to Indian tribes. Indeed, aspects</p>\n<p id=\"AdhZ\">[564 U.S. 189]</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">of the majority\u2019s opinion suggest that common-law principles have little or no relevance in the Indian trust context, a position this Court rejected long ago. Although today\u2019s holding pertains only to a narrow evidentiary issue, I fear the upshot of the majority\u2019s opinion may well be a further dilution of the Government\u2019s fiduciary obligations that will have broader negative repercussions for the relationship between the United States and Indian tribes.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Federal Rule of Evidence 501 provides in relevant part that \u201cthe privilege of a . . . government . . . shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience.\u201d Rule 501 \u201cwas adopted precisely because Congress wished to leave privilege questions to the courts rather than attempt to codify them.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Weber Aircraft Corp., </em>465 U.S. 792, 804, n. 25, 104 S. Ct. 1488, 79 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">As the majority notes, the purpose of the attorney-client privilege \u201cis to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice.\u201d <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>449 U.S. 383, 389, 101 S. Ct. 677, 66 L. Ed. 2d 584 (1981). But the majority neglects to explain that the privilege is a limited exception to the usual rules of evidence requiring full disclosure of relevant information. See 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2192, p. 64 (3d ed. 1940) (common law recognizes \u201cfundamental maxim that the public . . . has a right to every man\u2019s evidence\u201d and that \u201cany exemptions which may exist are distinctly exceptional, being so many derogations from a positive general rule\u201d). Because it \u201chas the effect of withholding relevant information from the factfinder,\u201d courts construe the privilege narrowly. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>United States, </em>425 U.S. 391, 403, 96 S.

The fiduciary exception is now well recognized in the jurispru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>dence of both federal and state courts,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and has been applied in a wide variety of contexts, including in litigation involving common-law trusts, see, <em>e.g., Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington, D. C. </em>v. <em>Zimmer, </em>355 A.2d 709 (Del. Ch. 1976), disputes between corporations and shareholders, see, <em>e.g., Garner </em>v. <em>Wolfinbarger, </em>430 F.2d 1093 (CA5 1970), and Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 enforcement actions, see, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>162 F.3d 554 (CA9 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The majority correctly identifies the two rationales courts have articulated for applying the fiduciary exception, <em>ante, </em>at 172-173, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 199-200, but its description of those rationales omits a number of important points. With regard to the first rationale, courts have characterized the trust beneficiary as the \u201creal client\u201d of legal advice relating to trust administration because such advice, provided to a trustee to assist in his management of the trust, is ultimately for the benefit of the trust</p>\n<p id=\"A78\">[564 U.S. 191]</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">beneficiary, rather than for the trustee in his personal capacity. See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Mett, </em>178 F.3d 1058, 1063 (CA9 1999) (\u201c \u2018[A]s a representative for the beneficiaries of the trust which he is administering, the trustee is not the real client in the sense that he is personally being served\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>796 F.2d 264, 266 (CA9 1986) <em>(per curiam))); Riggs, </em>355 A.2d, at 713 (same). The majority places heavy emphasis on the source of payment for the legal advice, see <em>ante, </em>at 172, 179, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 198, 203, but it is well settled that who pays for the legal advice, although \u201cpotentially relevant,\u201d \u201cis not determinative in resolving issues of privilege.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Trusts \u00a7 82, Comment <em>f, </em>p. 188 (2005) (hereinafter Third Restatement). Instead, the linchpin of the \u201creal client\u201d inquiry is the identity of the ultimate beneficiary of the legal advice. See <em>Wachtel, </em>482 F.3d, at 232 (\u201c[O]f central importance . . . [i]s the fiduciary\u2019s lack of a legitimate personal interest in the legal advice obtained\u201d). If the advice was rendered for the benefit of the beneficiary and not for the trustee in any personal capacity, the \u201creal client\u201d of the advice is the beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">As to the second rationale for the fiduciary exception\u2014rooted in the trustee\u2019s fiduciary duty to disclose all information related to trust management\u2014the majority glosses over the fact that this duty of disclosure is designed \u201cto enable the beneficiary to prevent or redress a breach of trust and otherwise to enforce his or her rights under the trust.\u201d Third Restatement \u00a7 82, Comment <em>a(2), </em>at 184. As the leading American case on the fiduciary exception explains, \u201c[i]n order for the beneficiaries to hold the trustee to the proper standards of care and honesty and procure for themselves the benefits to which they are entitled, their knowledge of the affairs and mechanics of the trust management is crucial.\u201d <em>Riggs, </em>355 A.2d, at 712. Courts justifying the fiduciary exception under this ration<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>ale have thus concluded that \u201c[t]he policy of preserving the full disclosure necessary in the trustee-beneficiary relationship is . . . ultimately more</p>\n<p id=\"Alg\">[564 U.S. 192]</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">important than the protection of the trustees\u2019 confidence in the attorney for the trust.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 714; see <em>Mett, </em>178 F.3d, at 1063 (under this rationale, \u201cthe fiduciary exception can be understood as an instance of the attorney-client privilege giving way in the face of a competing legal principle\u201d). The majority fails to appreciate the important oversight and accountability interests that underlie this rationale for the fiduciary exception, or explain why they operate with any less force in the Indian trust context.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The question in this case is whether the fiduciary exception applies in the Indian trust context such that the Government may not rely on the attorney-client privilege to withhold from the Nation communications between the Government and its attorneys relating to the administration of the Nation\u2019s trust fund accounts. Answering that question requires a proper understanding of the nature of the Government\u2019s trust relationship with Indian tribes, particularly with regard to its management of Indian trust funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Since 1831, this Court has recognized the existence of a general trust relationship between the United States and Indian tribes. See <em>Cherokee Nation </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>5 Pet. 1, 17, 8 L. Ed. 25 (1831) (Marshall, C. J.). Our decisions over the past century have repeatedly reaffirmed this \u201cdistinctive obligation of trust incumbent upon the Government\u201d in its dealings with Indians. <em>Seminole Nation </em>v. <em>United States, </em>316 U.S. 286, 296, 62 S. Ct. 1049, 86 L. Ed. 1480 (1942); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. 206, 225-226, 103 S. Ct. 2961, 77 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1983) <em>(Mitchell II) </em>(collecting cases and noting \u201cthe undisputed existence of a general trust relationship between the United States and the Indian people\u201d). Congress, too, has recognized the general trust relationship between the United States and Indian tribes. Indeed, \u201c[n]early every piece of modern legislation dealing with Indian tribes contains a statement reaffirming the trust relationship between tribes and the federal government.\u201d F. Cohen, Handbook of</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">[564 U.S. 193]</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">Federal Indian Law \u00a7 5.04[4][a], pp. 420-421 (2005 ed.) (hereinafter Cohen).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">Against this backdrop, Congress has enacted federal statutes that \u201cdefine the contours of the United States\u2019 fiduciary responsibilities\u201d with regard to its management of Indian tribal property and other trust assets. <em>Mitchell II, </em>463 U.S., at 224, 103 S. Ct. 2961, 77 L. Ed. 2d 580. The Nation\u2019s claims as relevant in this case concern the Government\u2019s alleged mismanagement of its tribal trust fund accounts. See <em>ante, </em>at 167, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 195-196.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">The system of trusteeship and fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>eral management of Indian funds originated with congressional enactments in the 19th century directing the Government to hold and manage Indian tribal funds in trust. See, <em>e.g., </em>Act of Jan. 9, 1837, 5 Stat. 135; see also Misplaced Trust: The Bureau of Indian Affairs\u2019 Mismanagement of the Indian Trust Fund, H. R. Rep. No. 102-499, p. 6 (1992) (hereinafter Misplaced Trust). Through these and later congressional enactments, the United States has come to manage almost $3 billion in tribal funds and collects close to $380 million per year on behalf of tribes. Cohen \u00a7 5.03 [3] [b], at 407 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">[564 U.S. 194]</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Today, numerous statutes outline the Federal Government\u2019s obligations as trustee in managing Indian trust funds. In particular, the Secretary of the Treasury, at the request of the Secretary of the Interior, must invest \u201c[a]ll funds held in trust by the United States ... to the credit of Indian tribes\u201d in certain securities \u201csuitable to the needs of the fund involved.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 161a(a). The Secretary of the Interior may deposit in the Treasury and pay mandatory interest on Indian trust funds when \u201cthe best interests of the Indians will be promoted by such deposits, in lieu of investments.\u201d \u00a7 161. Similarly, the Secretary of the Interior may invest tribal trust funds in certain public debt instruments \u201cif he deems it advisable and for the best interest of the Indians.\u201d \u00a7 162a(a). And Congress has set forth a nonex-haustive list of the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s \u201ctrust responsibilities\u201d with respect to Indian trust funds, which include a series of accounting, auditing, management, and disclosure obligations. \u00a7 162a(d). These and other statutory provision<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> give the United States \u201cfull responsibility to manage Indian [trust fund accounts] for the benefit of the Indians.\u201d <em>Mitchell II, </em>463 U.S., at 224, 103 S.

Ct. 2961, 77 L. Ed. 2d 580. Under the statutory regime described above, the Government has extensive managerial control over Indian trust funds, exercises considerable discretion with respect to their investment, and has assumed significant responsibilities to account to the tribal beneficiaries. As a result, \u201c[a]ll of the necessary elements of a common-law trust are present: a trustee (the United</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">[564 U.S. 195]</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">States), a beneficiary (the Indian [Tribe]), and a trust corpus (Indian . . . funds).\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Unlike in other contexts where the statutory scheme creates only a \u201cbare trust\u201d entailing only limited responsibilities, Uni<em>ted States </em>v. <em>Navajo Nation, </em>537 U.S. 488, 505, 123 S.

As explained below, the twin rationales for the fiduciary exception fully support its application in this context. The majority\u2019s conclusion to the contrary rests on flawed factual and legal premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">When the Government seeks legal advice from a Government attorney on matters relating to the management of the Nation\u2019s trust funds, the \u201creal client\u201d of that advice for purposes of the fiduciary exception is the Nation, not the Government. The majority\u2019s rejection of that conclusion is premised on its erroneous view that the Government, in managing the Nation\u2019s trust funds, \u201chas its own independent interest in the implementation of federal Indian policy\u201d that diverges from the interest of the Nation as beneficiary. <em>Ante, </em>at 181, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 204; see also <em>ante, </em>at 187, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 208 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">The majority correctly notes that, as a general matter, the Government has sovereign interests in managing Indian trusts that distinguish it from a private trustee. See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>270 U.S. 181, 194, 46 S. Ct. 298, 70 L. Ed. 539 (1926). Throughout the history of the Federal Government\u2019s dealings with Indian tribes, Congress has altered and administered the trust relationship \u201cas an instrument of federal <em>policy.\u201d Ante, </em>at 181, n. 8, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 204 (detailing shifts in policy); see generally <em>Cobell </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>240 F.3d 1081, 1086-1088 (CADC 2001) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>(same, and describing that history as \u201ccontentious and tragic\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">In the specific context of Indian trust fund management, however, federal Indian policy entirely aligns the interests of the Government as trustee and the Indian tribe as beneficiary. As explained above, Congress has enacted an extensive network of statutes regulating the Government\u2019s management of Indian trust fund accounts. That statutory framework establishes a \u201cconventional fiduciary relationship\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">[564 U.S. 197]</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">in the context of Indian trust fund administration. <em>Navajo II, </em>556 U.S., at 301, 129 S.

Ed. 2d, at 212-213.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">As a conventional fiduciary, the Government\u2019s management of Indian trust funds must \u201cbe judged by the most exacting fiduciary standards.\u201d <em>Seminole Nation, </em>316 U.S., at 296-297, 62 S. Ct. 1049, 86 L. Ed. 1480. Among the most fundamental fiduciary obligations of a trustee is \u201cto administer the trust solely in the interest of the beneficiaries.\u201d 2AA. Scott &amp; W. Fratcher, Law of Trusts \u00a7 170, p. 311 (4th ed. 1987); see <em>Meinhard </em>v. <em>Salmon, </em>249 N.Y. 458, 464, 164 N.E. 545, 546 (1928) (Cardozo, C. J.) (\u201cNot honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive,\u201d is \u201cthe standard of behavior\u201d for trustees \u201cbound by fiduciary ties\u201d). Although Indian trust funds are deposited in the United States Treasury, \u201cthey are not part of the federal government\u2019s general funds and can be used only for the benefit of the tribe.\u201d Cohen \u00a7 5.03[3][b], at 408, and n. 140 (citing <em>Quick Bear </em>v. <em>Leupp, </em>210 U.S. 50, 80-81, 28 S. Ct. 690, 52 L. Ed. 954 (1908)).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">Because federal Indian policy requires the Government to act strictly as a conventional fiduciary in managing the Nation\u2019s trust funds, the Government acts in a \u201crepresentative\u201d rather than \u201cpersona [1] \u201d capacity when managing the Nation\u2019s trust funds. <em>Riggs, </em>355 A.2d, at 713. By law, the Government cannot pursue any \u201cindependent\u201d interest, <em>ante, </em>at 181, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 204, distinct from its responsibilities as a fiduciary. See Cohen \u00a75.03[3][b], at 408, and n. 141 (\u201cFederal statutes forbid use of Indian tribal funds in any manner not authorized by treaty or express provisions of law\u201d (citing 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 122, 123)). In other words, any uniquely sovereign interest the Government may have in other contexts of its trust relationship with Indian tribes does not exist in the specific context of Indian trust fund administration. It naturally follows, then, that when the Government seeks legal advice from Government attorneys relating to the management of the Nation\u2019s trust funds, the \u201creal client\u201d of the advice for</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">[564 U.S. 198]</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">purposes of the fiduciary exception is the Nation, not the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">This conclusion holds true even though Government attorneys are \u201cpaid out of congressional appropriations at no cost to the [Nation].\u201d Ante, at 179, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 203. As noted above, although the source of funding for legal advice may be relevant, the ultimate inquiry is for whose benefit the legal advice was rendered. See <em>supra, </em>at 191, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 210. And, for all the emphasis the majority places on the funding source here, see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>ante, </em>at 172, 179, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 198, 203, the majority never suggests that the fiduciary exception would apply if Congress amended federal law to permit Indian tribes to pay Government attorneys out of their own trust funds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">The majority also suggests that, even if the interests of the United States and Indian tribes may be equivalent in some contexts, that \u201cequivalence\u201d \u201cbreaks down\u201d when there are \u201cmultiple interests\u201d involved in a trust relationship. <em>Ante, </em>at 182, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 205. According to the majority, \u201cthe Government has too many competing legal concerns to allow a case-by-case inquiry into the purpose of each communication.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As a result, the majority concludes that the fiduciary exception should not be applied at all in the Indian trust context. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Preliminarily, while the Government in certain circumstances may have sovereign obligations that conflict with its duties as a fiduciary for Indian tribes, see, <em>e.g., Nevada </em>v. <em>United States, </em>463 U.S. 110, 103 S. Ct. 2906, 77 L. Ed. 2d 509 (1983),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the existence of competing</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">[564 U.S. 199]</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">interests is not unique to the Government as trustee. Indeed, the issue of competing interests arises frequently in the private trust context. See, <em>e.g., </em>Third Restatement \u00a7 78, Comment c, at 97-103 (describing duties of trustee with respect to \u201ctransactions that involve conflicting fiduciary and personal interests\u201d); <em>id., </em>\u00a7 79, Comment <em>b, </em>at 128-129 (describing trustee\u2019s duty of impartiality in \u201cbalancing . . . competing interests\u201d of multiple beneficiaries). In such circumstances, \u201ca trustee\u2014and ultimately a court\u2014may need to provide some response that offers a compromise between the confidentiality or privacy concerns of some and the interest-protection needs of others.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 82, Comment f, at 188. The majority provides no reason why federal courts applying the fiduciary exception in the Indian trust context could not similarly adopt a workable framework that adequately takes into account any unique governmental interests that bear on the application of the fiduciary exception in any given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>circumstance. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)(2)(C) (authorizing courts to set limits on discovery based on equitable concerns).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The majority\u2019s categorical rejection of the fiduciary exception in the Indian trust context sweeps far broader than necessary. This case involves only the Government\u2019s alleged</p>\n<p id=\"A0h\">[564 U.S. 200]</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">mismanagement of the Nation\u2019s trust fund accounts, and the Government did not claim below that the attorney-client communications at issue relate to any competing governmental obligations. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a-19a. To the extent the United States in other contexts has competing interests, the Government and its attorneys already have to identify those interests in determining how to balance them against their obligations to Indian tribes, and attorney-client communications relating to those interests may properly be withheld or redacted consistent with application of the fiduciary exception. See 88 Fed. Cl. 1, 13 (2009) (observing that redactions \u201callo[w] the privilege and exception to reign supreme within their respective spheres\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The majority\u2019s categorical approach fails to appreciate that privilege determinations are by their very nature made on a case-by-case\u2014indeed, document-by-document\u2014basis. Government attorneys, like private counsel, must review each requested document and make an individualized assessment of privilege, and courts reviewing privilege logs and challenges must do the same. \u201cWhile such a \u2018case-by-case\u2019 basis may to some slight extent undermine desirable certainty in the boundaries of the attorney-client privilege, it obeys the spirit of\u2019 of Rule 501, <em>Upjohn, </em>449 U.S., at 396-397, 101 S. Ct. 677, 66 L. Ed. 2d 584, which \u2018\u201cprovide[s] the courts with the flexibility to develop rules of privilege on a case-by-case basis,\u2019 \u201d <em>Trammel </em>v. <em>United States, </em>445 U.S. 40, 47, 100 S. Ct. 906, 63 L. Ed. 2d 186 (1980) (quoting 120 Cong. Rec. 40891 (1974) (statement of Rep. Hungate)); see S. Rep. No. 93-1277, p. 13 (1974) (\u201c[T]he recognition of a privilege based on a confidential relationship . . . should be determined on a case-by-case basis\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Rather than fashioning a blanket rule against application of the fiduciary exception in the Indian trust context, I would, consistent with Rule 501 and principles of judicial restraint, decide the question solely on the facts before us. See <em>Upjohn, </em>449 U.S., at 386, 101 S. Ct. 677, 66 L. Ed. 2d 584 (noting that \u201cwe sit to decide concrete cases and not abstract propositions of law\u201d and \u201cdeclin[ing]</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">[564 U.S. 201]</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">to lay down a broad rule or series of rules to govern all conceivable future questions in this area\u201d). On those facts, the fiduciary exception applies to the communications in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b258-13\">Like the \u201creal client\u201d rationale, the second rationale for the fiduciary exception, rooted in a trustee\u2019s fiduciary duty to disclose all matters relevant to trust administration to the beneficiary, fully supports disclosure of the communications in this case. As explained above, courts relying on this second rationale have recognized that \u201c [t]he policy of preserving the full disclosure necessary in the trustee-beneficiary relationship is . . . ultimately more important than the protection of the trustees\u2019 confidence in the attorney for the trust.\u201d <em>Riggs, </em>355 A.2d, at 714. Because the statutory scheme requires the Government to act as a conventional fiduciary in managing the Nation\u2019s trust funds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>the Government\u2019s fiduciary duty to keep the Nation informed of matters relating to trust administration includes the concomitant duty to disclose attorney-client communications relating to trust fund management. See Third Restatement \u00a7 82, Comment <em>f, </em>at 187-188; Restatement of the Law (Third) Governing Lawyers \u00a7 84, pp. 627-628 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Notably, the majority does not suggest that the Nation needs less information than a private beneficiary to exercise effective oversight over the Government as trustee. Instead, the majority contends that the Nation is entitled to less disclosure because the Government\u2019s disclosure obligations are more limited than a private trustee. In particular, the majority states that the Government \u201cassumes Indian trust responsibilities only to the extent it expressly accepts those responsibilities by statute,\u201d and thus the Nation \u201cmust point to a right conferred by statute or regulation in order to obtain otherwise privileged information from the Government against its wishes.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 178, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 202. The majority cites a single statutory provision and its implementing regulations</p>\n<p id=\"AOI\">[564 U.S. 202]</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">as \u201cdefin[ing] the Government\u2019s disclosure obligation to the [Nation].\u201d Ante, at 185, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 206; see <em>ante, </em>at 184-185, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 206-207 (citing 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 162a(d)(5) and 25 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 115.801-115.803 (2010)). Because those \u201cnarrowly defined disclosure obligations\u201d do not provide Indian tribes with a specific statutory right to disclosure of attorney-client communications relating to trust administration, <em>ante, </em>at 186, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 207, the majority concludes that the Government has no duty to disclose those communications to the Nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The majority\u2019s conclusion employs a fundamentally flawed legal premise. We have never held that all of the Government\u2019s trust responsibilities to Indians must be set forth expressly in a specific statute or regulation. To the contrary, where, as here, the statutory framework establishes that the relationship between the Government and an Indian tribe \u201cbears the hallmarks of a conventional fiduciary relationship,\u201d <em>Navajo II, </em>556 U.S., at 301, 129 S. Ct. 1547, 173 L. Ed. 2d 429 (internal quotation marks omitted), we have consistently looked to general trust principles to flesh out the Government\u2019s fiduciary obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">For example, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe, </em>537 U.S. 465, 123 S. Ct. 1126, 155 L. Ed. 2d 40 (2003), we construed a statute that vested the Government with discretionary authority to \u201cuse\u201d trust property for certain purposes as imposing a concomitant duty to preserve improvements that had previously been made to the land. <em>Id., </em>at 475, 123 S. Ct. 1126, 155 L. Ed. 2d 40 (quoting 74 Stat. 8). Even though the statute did not \u201cexpressly subject the Government to duties of management and conservation,\u201d we construed the Government\u2019s obligations under the statute by reference to \u201celementary trust law,\u201d which \u201cconfirm [ed] the commonsense assumption that a fiduciary actually administering trust property may not allow it to fall into ruin on his watch.\u201d 537 U.S., at 475, 123 S. Ct. 1126, 155 L. Ed. 2d 40. Similarly, in <em>Seminole Nation, </em>we relied on general trust principles to conclude that the Government had a fiduciary duty to prevent misappropriation of tribal trust funds by corrupt members of a tribe, even</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">[564 U.S. 203]</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">though no specific statutory or treaty provision expressly im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>posed such a duty. See 316 U.S., at 296, 62 S. Ct. 1049, 86 L. Ed. 1480.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Accordingly, although the \u201cgeneral \u2018contours\u2019 of the government\u2019s obligations\u201d are defined by statute, the \u201cinterstices must be filled in through reference to general trust law.\u201d <em>Cobell, </em>240 F.3d, at 1101 <em>(quoting Mitchell II, </em>463 U.S., at 224, 103 S. Ct. 2961, 77 L. Ed. 2d 580). This approach accords with our recognition in other trust contexts that \u201cthe primary function of the fiduciary duty is to constrain the exercise of discretionary powers which are controlled by no other specific duty imposed by the trust instrument or the legal regime.\u201d <em>Varity Corp. </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>516 U.S. 489, 504, 116 S. Ct. 1065, 134 L. Ed. 2d 130 (1996) (emphasis deleted); cf. <em>Central States, Southeast &amp; Southwest Areas Pension Fund </em>v. <em>Central Transport, Inc., </em>472 U.S. 559, 570, 105 S. Ct. 2833, 86 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1985) (\u201c[RJather than explicitly enumerating <em>all </em>of the powers and duties of trustees and other fiduciaries, Congress invoked the common law of trusts to define the general scope of their authority and responsibility\u201d). Indeed, \u201c [i]f the fiduciary duty applied to nothing more than activities already controlled</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">[564 U.S. 204]</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">by other specific legal duties, it would serve no purpose.\u201d <em>Howe, </em>516 U.S., at 504, 116 S. Ct. 1065, 134 L. Ed. 2d 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">The majority pays lipservice to these precedents, acknowledging that \u201c[w]e have looked to common-law principles to inform our interpretation of statutes and to determine the scope of liability that Congress has imposed.\u201d Ante, at 177, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 202. But despite its assurance that it \u201cwill apply common-law trust principles where Congress has indicated it is appropriate to do so,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 178, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 202, the majority inexplicably rejects the application of common-law trust principles in this case. In doing so, the majority states that \u201c [t]he common law of trusts does not override the specific trust-creating statute and regulations that apply here.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 185, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 206 (referring to \u00a7 162a(d)(5) and 25 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 115.801-115.803). That statement evidences the majority\u2019s fundamental misunderstanding of the way in which common-law principles operate in the context of a conventional fiduciary relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s view, the Government\u2019s disclosure obligations are not limited solely to the \u201cnarrowly defined disclosure obligations\u201d set forth in \u00a7 162a(d)(5) and its implementing regulations, <em>ante, </em>at 186, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 207; rather, given that the statutory regime requires the Government to act as a conventional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>fiduciary in managing Indian trust funds, the Government\u2019s disclosure obligations include those of a fiduciary under common-law trust principles. See <em>supra, </em>at 202-204, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 217-219. Instead of \u201cover-rid [ing]\u201d the specific disclosure duty set forth in \u00a7 162a(d)(5) and its implementing regulations, general trust principles flesh out the Government\u2019s disclosure obligations under the broader statutory regime, consistent with its role as a conventional fiduciary in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">This conclusion, moreover, is supported by the plain text of the very statute cited by the majority. Section 162a(d), which was enacted as part of the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 (1994 Act), 108 Stat. 4239, sets forth eight \u201ctrust responsibilities of the United States.\u201d But that provision also specifically states that the</p>\n<p id=\"aoq-dedup-0\">[564 U.S. 205]</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Secretary of the Interior\u2019s \u201cproper discharge of the trust responsibilities of the United States shall include <em>(but are not limited to)\u201d </em>those specified duties. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 162a(d) (emphasis added). By expressly including the italicized language, Congress recognized that the Government has preexisting trust responsibilities that arise out of the broader statutory scheme governing the management of Indian trust funds.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, Title I of the 1994 Act is entitled <em>\u201cRecognition </em>of Trust Responsibility,\u201d 108 Stat. 4240 (emphasis added), and courts have similarly observed that the 1994 Act \u201crecognized and reaffirmed . . . that the government has longstanding and substantial trust obligations to Indians.\u201d <em>Cobell, </em>240 F.3d, at 1098; see also H. R. Rep. No. 103-778, p. 9 (1994) (\u201cThe responsibility for management of Indian Trust Funds by the [Government] has been determined through a series of court decisions, treaties, and statutes\u201d). That conclusion accords with common sense as not even the Government argues that it had no disclosure obligations with respect to Indian trust funds prior to the enactment of the 1994 Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">[564 U.S. 206]</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The majority requires the Nation to \u201cpoint to a right conferred by statute\u201d to the attorney-client communica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>tions at issue, <em>ante, </em>at 178, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 202, and finding none, denies the Nation access to those communications. The upshot of that decision, I fear, may very well be to reinvigorate the position of the dissenting Justices in <em>White Mountain Apache </em>and <em>Mitchell II, </em>who rejected the use of common-law principles to inform the scope of the Government\u2019s fiduciary obligations to Indian tribes. See <em>White Mountain Apache, </em>537 U.S., at 486-487, 123 S. Ct. 1126, 155 L. Ed. 2d 40 (Thomas, J., dissenting); <em>Mitchell II, </em>463 U.S., at 234-235, 103 S. Ct. 2961, 77 L. Ed. 2d 580 (Powell, J., dissenting). That approach was wrong when <em>Mitchell II </em>was decided nearly 30 years ago, and it is wrong today. Under our governing precedents, common-law trust principles play an important role in defining the Government\u2019s fiduciary duties where, as here, the statutory scheme establishes a conventional fiduciary relationship. Applying those principles in this context, I would hold that the fiduciary exception is fully applicable to the communications in this case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">[564 U.S. 207]</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">We have described the Federal Government\u2019s fiduciary duties toward Indian tribes as consisting of \u201cmoral obligations of the highest responsibility and trust,\u201d to be fulfilled through conduct \u201cjudged by the most exacting fiduciary standards.\u201d <em>Seminole Nation, </em>316 U.S., at 297, 62 S. Ct. 1049, 86 L. Ed. 1480; see also <em>Mitchell II, </em>463 U.S., at 225-226, 103 S. Ct. 2961, 77 L. Ed. 2d 580 (collecting cases). The sad and well-documented truth, however, is that the Government has failed to live up to its fiduciary obligations in managing Indian trust fund accounts. See, <em>e.g., Cobell, </em>240 F.3d, at 1089 (\u201cThe General Accounting Office, Interior Department Inspector General, and Office of Management and Budget, among others, have all condemned the mismanagement of [Indian] trust accounts over the past twenty years\u201d); Misplaced Trust 8 (\u201c[T]he [Government\u2019s] indifferent supervision and control of the Indian trust funds has consistently resulted in a failure to exercise its responsibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>ity and [to</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">[564 U.S. 208]</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">meet] any reasonable expectations of the tribal and individual accountholders, Congress, and taxpayers\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 56 (\u201c[H]ad this type of mismanagement taken place in any other trust arrangements such as Social Security, there would be war\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">As Congress has recognized, \u201c[t]he Indian trust fund is more than balance sheets and accounting procedures. These moneys are crucial to the daily operations of native American tribes and a source of income to tens of thousands of native Americans.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 5. Given the history of governmental mismanagement of Indian trust funds, application of the fiduciary exception is, if anything, even more important in this context than in the private trustee context. The majority\u2019s refusal to apply the fiduciary exception in this case deprives the Nation\u2014as well as the Indian tribes in the more than 90 cases currently pending in the federal courts involving claims of tribal trust mismanagement, App. to Pet. for Cert. 126a-138a\u2014of highly relevant information going directly to the merits of whether the Government properly fulfilled its fiduciary duties. Its holding only further exacerbates the concerns expressed by many about the lack of adequate oversight and accountability that has marked the Government\u2019s handling of Indian trust fund accounts for decades.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">But perhaps even more troubling than the majority\u2019s refusal to apply the fiduciary exception in this case is its disregard of our established precedents that affirm the central role that common-law trust principles play in defining the Government\u2019s fiduciary obligations to Indian tribes. By rejecting the Nation\u2019s claim on the ground that it fails to identify a specific statutory right to the communications at issue, the majority effectively embraces an approach espoused by prior dissents that rejects the role of common-law principles altogether in the Indian trust context. Its decision to do so in a case involving only a narrow evidentiary issue is wholly unnecessary and, worse yet, risks further diluting the Government\u2019s fiduciary obligations in a manner that Congress</p>\n<p id=\"Aj9\">[564 U.S. 209]</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">clearly did not intend and that would inflict serious harm on the already-frayed relationship between the United States and Indian tribes. Because there is no warrant in precedent or reason for reaching that result, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\">.

Accordingly, we concluded that Congress did not intend to \u201cimpose upon the Government all fiduciary duties ordinarily placed by equity upon a trustee\u2019\u2019 because the statute \u201ccreated only a limited trust relationship between the United States and the allottee.\u2019\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 542, 100 S.

The majority also states that ownership of the requested documents is \u201ca significant factor\u201d in deciding whether the fiduciary exception applies, <em>ante, </em>at 186, 180 L.

In <em>Nevada, </em>the Government represented certain tribes in litigation involving water rights even though it was also required by statute to represent the water rights of a reclamation project. See 463 U.S., at 128, 103 S. Ct. 2906, 77 L. Ed. 2d 509 (noting that Congress delegated to the Secretary of the Interior \u201cboth the responsibility for the supervision of the Indian tribes and the commencement of reclamation projects in areas adjacent to reservation lands\u201d). Because of this dual litigating responsibility, we noted that \u201cit is simply unrealistic to suggest that the Government may not perform its obligation to represent Indian tribes in litigation when Congress has obliged it to represent other interests as well.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We thus observed in the context of that case that \u201cthe Government cannot follow the fastidious standards of a private fiduciary, who would breach his duties to his single beneficiary solely by representing potentially conflicting interests without the beneficiary\u2019s consent.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We expressly distinguished the context \u201cwhere only a relationship between the Government and the tribe is involved.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 142, 103 S. Ct. 2906, 77 L. Ed. 2d 509. In that context, we acknowledged that \u201cthe law respecting obligations between a trustee and a beneficiary in private litigation will in many, if not all, respects adequately describe the duty of the United States.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b260-10\">. To be sure, in decisions involving the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, we have explained that the jurisdictional analysis \u201cmust train on specific rights-creating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory prescriptions.\u2019\u2019 <em>Navajo I, </em>537 U.S., at 506, 123 S. Ct. 1079, 155 L. Ed. 2d 60. But even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that those jurisdictional decisions have relevance here, they do not stand for the proposition that the Government\u2019s fiduciary duties are defined exclusively by express statutory provisions. Indeed, those decisions relied specifically on general trust principles to determine whether the relevant statutory scheme permitted a damages remedy, a prerequisite for jurisdiction under the Tucker Act. See, <em>e.g., Mitchell II, </em>463 U.S., at 226, 103 S. Ct. 2961, 77 L. Ed. 2d 580 (noting that common-law trust sources establish that \u201ca trustee is accountable in damages for breaches of trust\u2019\u2019 and that, \u201c[g]iven the existence of a trust relationship, it naturally follows that the Government should be liable in damages for the breach of its fiduciary duties\u2019\u2019); see also <em>Navajo II, </em>556 U.S., at 301, 129 S. Ct. 1547, 173 L. Ed. 2d 429 (affirming that general \u201ctrust principles . . . could play a role in inferring that the trust obligation is enforceable by damages\u2019\u2019 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b261-9\">. The majority invokes the canon against superfluity and argues that the \u201ccatchall\u201d phrase (by which it means the \u201cshall include (but are not limited to)\u201d language) cannot be read to \u201cinclude a general common-law duty to disclose all information related to the administration of Indian trusts\u201d because doing so would \u201cimpose general obligations that would include those specifically enumerated.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 185, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 207. But the flaw in the majority\u2019s argument is that it misperceives the function of the relevant language. Rather than serving as a \u201ccatchall\u201d provision that affirmatively \u201cincorporate[s]\u201d common-law trust duties into \u00a7 162a(d), <em>ibid., </em>that language simply makes clear that \u00a7 162a(d) does not set forth an exhaustive list of the Government\u2019s trust responsibilities in managing Indian trust funds; nothing in that language itself imports any substantive obligations into the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b261-10\">. The majority also contends that its reading of \u00a7 162a(d) is supported by a provision in the Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982 (ICLA), 96 Stat. 1976, which provided that if the Secretary of the Interior rejected a claim for litigation by an Indian claimant, he was required to provide upon request \u201cany nonprivileged research materials or evidence gathered by the United States in the documentation of such claim,\u201d \u00a7 5(b), <em>id., </em>at 1978. According to the majority, this provision reflected Congress\u2019 understanding that \u2018The Government retains evidentiary privileges allowing it to withhold information related to trust property from Indian tribes.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 186, n. 10, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 207. But this provision cannot bear the weight the majority places on it. Even putting aside the undisputed fact that the ICLA is inapplicable to the claims in this case, the majority\u2019s reliance on the ICLA provision fails to recognize that documents subject to the fiduciary exception are, under the \u201creal client\u201d rationale, <em>per se </em>nonprivileged. See, <em>e.g., Mett, </em>178 F.3d, at 1063. Accordingly, if anything, the ICLA\u2019s requirement that the Government disclose \u201cnonprivileged\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>materials to Indian claimants supports the conclusion that Congress intended communications related to trust fund management to be disclosed to Indian tribes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b262-8\">. The majority\u2019s errors are further compounded by its failure to accord proper consideration to the mandamus posture of this case. \u201cThis Court repeatedly has observed that the writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, to be reserved for extraordinary situations.\u2019\u2019 <em>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. </em>v. <em>Mayacamas Corp., </em>485 U.S. 271, 289, 108 S. Ct. 1133, 99 L. Ed. 2d 296 (1988). \u201cAs the writ is one of the most potent weapons in the judicial arsenal, three conditions must be satisfied before it may issue,\u2019\u2019 <em>Cheney </em>v. <em>United States Dist. Court for D. C., </em>542 U.S. 367, 380, 124 S. Ct. 2576, 159 L. Ed. 2d 459 (2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">\u201cFirst, the party seeking issuance of the writ must have no other adequate means to attain the relief he desires\u2014a condition designed to ensure that the writ will not be used as a substitute for the regular appeals process. Second, the petitioner must satisfy the burden of showing that his right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable. Third, even if the first two prerequisites have been met, the issuing court, in the exercise of its discretion, must be satisfied that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.\u2019\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 380-381, 124 S. Ct. 2576, 159 L. Ed. 2d 459 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted; alterations deleted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">The majority purports to leave the decision whether to grant mandamus relief to the Federal Circuit, but simultaneously drops a footnote stating that it \u201cassume[s]\u201c that the Court of Federal Claims on remand will \u201cfollow [its] holding\u2019\u2019 that the fiduciary exception is inapplicable here. <em>Ante, </em>at 187, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 208, and n. 12. By doing so, the majority virtually ensures that the Nation will not be able to use the communications at issue in this litigation, thereby effectively granting extraordinary relief to the Government upon no showing whatsoever that the stringent conditions for mandamus have been met.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
