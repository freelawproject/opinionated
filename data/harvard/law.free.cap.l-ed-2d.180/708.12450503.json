Civ. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 1746-1746.5 (West 2009) (Act), prohibits the sale or rental of \u201cviolent video games\u201d to minors, and requires their packaging to be labeled \u201c18.\u201d The Act covers games \u201cin which the range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a human being, if those acts are depicted\u201d in a manner that \u201c[a] reasonable person, considering the game as a whole, would find appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors,\u201d that is \u201cpatently offensive to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors,\u201d and that \u201ccauses the game, as a whole, to lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\u201d \u00a7 1746(d)(1)(A). Violation of the Act is punishable by a civil fine of up to $1,000. \u00a7 1746.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">Respondents, representing the video-game and software industries, brought a preenforcement challenge to the Act in the United States District Court for the Northern District</p>\n<p id=\"acb-dedup-1\">[564 U.S. 790]</p>\n<p id=\"b756-14\">of California. That court concluded that the Act violated the First Amendment and permanently enjoined its enforcement. <em>Video Software Dealers Assn. </em>v. <em>Schwarzenegger, </em>No. C-05-04188 RMW (2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a. The Court of Appeals affirmed, <em>Video Software Dealers Assn. </em>v. <em>Schwarzenegger, </em>556 F.3d 950 (CA9 2009), and we granted certiorari, 559 U.S. 1092, 130 S. Ct. 2398, 176 L. Ed. 2d 784 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-18\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b756-19\">California correctly acknowledges that  video games qualify for First Amendment protection. The Free Speech Clause exists principally to protect discourse on public matters, but we have long recognized that it is difficult to distinguish politics from entertainment, and dangerous to try. \u201cEveryone is familiar with instances of propaganda through fiction. What is one man\u2019s amusement, teaches another\u2019s doctrine.\u201d <em>Winters </em>v. <em>New York, </em>333 U.S. 507, 510, 68 S. Ct. 665, 92 L. Ed. 840 (1948). Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas\u2014and even social messages\u2014through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player\u2019s interaction with the virtual world). That suffices to confer First Amendment protection.  Under our Constitution, \u201cesthetic and moral judgments about art and literature . . . are for the individual to make, not for the Government to decree, even with the mandate or approval of a majority.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number><em>United States </em>v. <em>Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., </em>529 U.S. 803, 818, 120 S. Ct. 1878, 146 L. Ed. 2d 865 (2000). And whatever the challenges of applying the Constitution to ever-advancing technology, \u201cthe basic principles of freedom of speech and the press, like the First Amendment\u2019s command, do not vary\u201d when a new and different medium for communication appears. <em>Joseph Burstyn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>343 U.S. 495, 503, 72 S. Ct. 777, 96 L. Ed. 1098 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">The most basic of those principles is this:  \u201c[A]s a general matter, . . . government has no power to restrict expression</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">[564 U.S. 791]</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.\u201d <em>Ashcroft </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, </em>535 U.S. 564, 573, 122 S. Ct. 1700, 152 L. Ed. 2d 771 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). There are of course exceptions. \u201c\u2018From 1791 to the present,\u2019 . . . the First Amendment has \u2018permitted restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas,\u2019 and has never \u2018include [d] a freedom to disregard these traditional limitations.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>559 U.S. 460, 468, 130 S. Ct. 1577, 176 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2010) (quoting <em>R. A. V. </em>v. <em>St. Paul, </em>505 U.S. 377, 382-383, 112 S. Ct. 2538, 120 L. Ed. 2d 305 (1992)). These limited areas\u2014such as obscenity, <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 483, 77 S. Ct. 1304, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1498 (1957), incitement, <em>Brandenburg </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>395 U.S. 444, 447-449, 89 S. Ct. 1827, 23 L. Ed. 2d 430 (1969) <em>(per curiam), </em>and fighting words, <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 572, 62 S. Ct. 766, 86 L. Ed. 1031 (1942)\u2014represent \u201cwell-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 571-572, 62 S. Ct. 766, 86 L. Ed. 1031.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Last Term, in <em>Stevens, </em>we held that new categories of unprotected speech may not be added to the list by a legislature that concludes certain speech is too harmful to be tolerated. <em>Stevens </em>concerned a federal statute purporting to criminalize the creation, sale, or possession of certain depictions of animal cruelty. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 48 (amended 2010). The statute covered depictions \u201cin which a living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed\u201d if that harm to the animal was illegal where \u201cthe creation, sale, or possession t[ook] place,\u201d \u00a7 48(c)(1). A saving clause largely borrowed from our obscenity jurisprudence, see <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1973), exempted depictions with \u201cserious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value,\u201d \u00a7 48(b). We held that statute to be an impermissible content-based restriction on speech. There was no American tradition of forbidding the <em>depiction of </em>animal cruelty\u2014though States have long had laws against <em>committing </em>it.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">[564 U.S. 792]</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">The Government argued in <em>Stevens </em>that lack of a historical warrant did not matter; that it could create new categories of unprotected speech by applying a \u201csimple balancing test\u201d that weighs the value of a particular category of speech against its social costs and then punishes that category of speech if it fails the test. <em>Stevens, </em>559 U.S., at 470, 130 S. Ct. 1577, 176 L. Ed. 2d 435. We emphatically rejected that \u201cstartling and dangerous\u201d proposition. <em>Ibid.. </em>\u201cMaybe there are some categories of speech that have been historically unpro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>tected, but have not yet been specifically identified or discussed as such in our case law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 472, 130 S. Ct. 1577, 176 L. Ed. 2d 435. But without persuasive evidence that a novel restriction on content is part of a long (if heretofore unrecognized) tradition of proscription, a legislature may not revise the \u201cjudgment [of] the American people,\u201d embodied in the First Amendment, \u201cthat the benefits of its restrictions on the Government outweigh the <em>costs.\u201dId., </em>at 470, 130 S. Ct. 1577, 176 L. Ed. 2d 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">That holding controls this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As in <em>Stevens, </em>California has tried to make violent-speech regulation look like obscenity regulation by appending a saving clause required for the latter. That does not suffice.  Our cases have been clear that the obscenity exception to the First Amendment does</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">[564 U.S. 793]</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">not cover whatever a legislature finds shocking, but only depictions of \u201csexual conduct,\u201d <em>Miller, supra, </em>at 24, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419. See also <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>California, </em>403 U.S. 15, 20, 91 S. Ct. 1780, 29 L. Ed. 2d 284 (1971); <em>Roth, supra, </em>at 487, and n. 20, 77 S. Ct. 1304, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1498.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\"><em>Stevens </em>was not the first time we have encountered and rejected a State\u2019s attempt to shoehorn speech about violence into obscenity. In <em>Winters, </em>we considered a New York criminal statute \u201cforbid [ding] the massing of stories of bloodshed and lust in such a way as to incite to crime against the person,\u201d 333 U.S., at 514, 68 S. Ct. 665, 92 L. Ed. 840. The New York Court of Appeals upheld the provision as a law against obscenity. \u201c[T]here can be no more precise test of written indecency or obscenity,\u201d it said, \u201cthan the continuing and changeable experience of the community as to what types of books are likely to bring about the corruption of public morals or other analogous injury to the public order.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). That is of course the same expansive view of governmental power to abridge the freedom of speech based on interest balancing that we rejected in <em>Stevens. </em> Our opinion in <em>Winters, </em>which concluded that the New York statute failed a heightened vagueness standard applicable to restrictions upon speech entitled to First Amendment protection, 333 U.S., at 517-519, 68 S. Ct. 665, 92 L. Ed. 840, made clear that violence is not part of the obscenity that the Constitution permits to be regulated. The speech reached by the statute contained \u201cno indecency or obscenity in any sense heretofore known to the law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 519, 68 S. Ct. 665, 92 L. Ed. 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">Because speech about violence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>not obscene, it is of no consequence that California\u2019s statute mimics the New York statute regulating obscenity for minors that we upheld in <em>Ginsberg </em>v. <em>New York, </em>390 U.S. 629, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195 (1968). That case approved a prohibition on the sale to minors of <em>sexual </em>material that would be obscene from the perspective of a child.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We</p>\n<p id=\"AlZH\">[564 U.S. 794]</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">held that the legislature could \u201cadjus[t] the definition of obscenity \u2018to social realities by permitting the appeal of this type of material to be assessed in terms of the sexual interests .. .\u2019of... minors.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 638, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195 (quoting <em>Mishkin </em>v. <em>New York, </em>383 U.S. 502, 509, 86 S. Ct. 958, 16 L. Ed. 2d 56 (1966)). And because \u201cobscenity is not protected expression,\u201d the New York statute could be sustained so long as the legislature\u2019s judgment that the proscribed materials were harmful to children \u201cwas not irrational.\u201d 390 U.S., at 641, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The California Act is something else entirely. It does not adjust the boundaries of an existing category of unprotected speech to ensure that a definition designed for adults is not uncritically applied to children. California does not argue that it is empowered to prohibit selling offensively violent works <em>to </em>adults\u2014and it is wise not to, since that is but a hair\u2019s breadth from the argument rejected in <em>Stevens. </em>Instead, it wishes to create a wholly new category of content-based regulation that is permissible only for speech directed at children.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">That is unprecedented and mistaken.  \u201c[M]inors are entitled to a significant measure of First Amendment protection, and only in relatively narrow and well-defined circumstances may government bar public dissemination of protected materials to them.\u201d <em>Erznoznik </em>v. <em>Jacksonville, </em>422 U.S. 205, 212-213, 95 S. Ct. 2268, 45 L. Ed. 2d 125 (1975) (citation omitted). No doubt a State possesses legitimate power to protect children from harm, <em>Ginsberg, supra, </em>at 640-641, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195; <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>321 U.S. 158, 165, 64 S. Ct. 438, 88 L. Ed. 645 (1944), but that does not include a free-floating power to restrict the ideas to which children may be exposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">[564 U.S. 795]</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">\u201cSpeech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some other legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely to protect the young from ideas or images that a legislative body thinks unsuitable for them.\u201d <em>Erznoznik, supra, </em>at 213-214, 95 S. Ct. 2268, 45 L. Ed. 2d 125.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>California\u2019s argument would fare better if there were a longstanding tradition in this country of specially restricting children\u2019s access to depictions of violence, but there is none. Certainly the <em>books </em>we give children to read\u2014or read to</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">[564 U.S. 796]</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">them when they are younger\u2014contain no shortage of gore. Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales, for example, are grim indeed. As her just deserts for trying to poison Snow White, the wicked queen is made to dance in red hot slippers \u201ctill she fell dead on the floor, a sad example of envy and jealousy.\u201d The Complete Brothers Grimm Fairy Tales 198 (2006 ed.). Cinderella\u2019s evil stepsisters have their eyes pecked out by doves. <em>Id., </em>at 95. And Hansel and Gretel (children!) kill their captor by baking her in an oven. Id., at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">High-school reading lists are full of similar fare. Homer\u2019s Odysseus blinds Polyphemus the Cyclops by grinding out his eye with a heated stake. 22 The Odyssey of Homer, Book IX, p. 125 (S. Butcher &amp; A. Lang trans\u00eds. 1909) (\u201cEven so did we seize the fiery-pointed brand and whirled it round in his eye, and the blood flowed about the heated bar. And the breath of the flame singed his eyelids and brows all about, as the ball of the eye burnt away, and the roots thereof crackled in the flame\u201d). In the Inferno, Dante and Virgil watch corrupt politicians struggle to stay submerged beneath a lake of boiling pitch, lest they be skewered by devils above the surface. Canto XXI, pp. 187-189 (A. Mandelbaum trans\u00ed. Bantam Classic ed. 1982). And Golding\u2019s Lord of the Flies recounts how a schoolboy called Piggy is savagely murdered <em>by other children </em>while marooned on an island. W. Golding, Lord of the Flies 208-209 (1997 ed.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">[564 U.S. 797]</p>\n<p id=\"b761-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>This is not to say that minors\u2019 consumption of violent entertainment has never encountered resistance. In the 1800\u2019s, dime novels depicting crime and \u201cpenny dreadfuls\u201d (named for their price and content) were blamed in some quarters for juvenile delinquency. See Brief for Cato Institute as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>6-7. When motion pictures came along, they became the villains instead. \u201cThe days when the police looked upon dime novels as the most dangerous of textbooks in the school for crime are drawing to a close. . . . They say that the moving picture machine . . . tends even more than did the dime novel to turn the thoughts of the easily influenced to paths which sometimes lead to prison.\u201d Moving Pictures as Helps to Crime, N. Y. Times, Feb. 21, 1909, quoted in Brief for Cato Institute 8. For a time, our Court did permit broad censorship of movies because of their capacity to be \u201cused for evil,\u201d see <em>Mutual Film Corp. </em>v. <em>Industrial Comm\u2019n of Ohio, </em>236 U.S. 230, 242, 35 S. Ct. 387, 59 L. Ed. 552 (1915), but we eventually reversed course, <em>Joseph Burstyn, Inc., </em>343 U.S., at 502, 72 S. Ct. 777, 96 L. Ed. 1098; see also <em>Erznoznik, supra, </em>at 212-214, 95 S. Ct. 2268, 45 L. Ed. 2d 125 (invalidating a drive-in movies restriction designed to protect children). Radio dramas were next, and then came comic books. Brief for Cato Institute 10-11. Many in the late 1940\u2019s and early 1950\u2019s blamed comic books for fostering a \u201cpreoccupation with violence and horror\u201d among the young, leading to a rising juvenile crime rate. See Note, Regulation of Comic Books, 68 Harv. L. Rev. 489, 490 (1955). But efforts to convince Congress to restrict comic books failed. Brief for Comic Book Legal Defense Fund as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>11-15.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">[564 U.S. 798]</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">And, of course, after comic books came television and music lyrics.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">California claims that video games present special problems because they are \u201cinteractive,\u201d in that the player participates in the violent action on screen and determines its outcome. The latter feature is nothing new: Since at least the publication of The Adventures of You: Sugarcane Island in 1969, young readers of choose-your-own-adventure stories have been able to make decisions that determine the plot by following instructions about which page to turn to. Cf. <em>Interactive Digital Software Assn. </em>v. <em>St. Louis County, </em>329 F.3d 954, 957-958 (CA8 2003). As for the argument that video games enable participation in the violent action, that seems to us more a matter of degree than of kind. As Judge Posner has observed, all literature is interactive. \u201c[T]he better it is, the more interactive. Literature when it is successful draws the reader into the story, makes him identify with the characters, invites him to judge them and quarrel with them, to experience their joys and sufferings as the reader\u2019s own.\u201d <em>American Amusement Machine Assn. </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>244 F.3d 572, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>577 (CA7 2001) (striking down a similar restriction on violent video games).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Justice Alito has done considerable independent research to identify, see <em>post, </em>at 818-819, nn. 13-18, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 732, video games in which \u201cthe violence is astounding,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 818, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 732. \u201cVictims are dismembered, decapitated, disemboweled, set on fire, and chopped into little pieces. . . . Blood gushes, splatters, and pools.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Justice Alito recounts all these disgusting video games in order to disgust us\u2014but  disgust is not a valid basis for restricting expression. And the same is true of Justice Alito\u2019s description, <em>post, </em>at 819, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 732, of those</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">[564 U.S. 799]</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">video games he has discovered that have a racial or ethnic motive for their violence\u2014\u201c \u2018ethnic cleansing\u2019 [of] . . . African-Americans, Latinos, or Jews.\u201d To what end does he relate this? Does it somehow increase the \u201caggressiveness\u201d that California wishes to suppress? Who knows? But it does arouse the reader\u2019s ire, and the reader\u2019s desire to put an end to this horrible message. Thus, ironically, Justice Alito\u2019s argument highlights the precise danger posed by the California Act: that the <em>ideas </em>expressed by speech\u2014whether it be violence, or gore, or racism\u2014and not its objective effects, may be the real reason for governmental proscription.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">Because the Act imposes a restriction on the content of protected speech, it is invalid unless California can demonstrate that it passes strict scrutiny\u2014that is, unless it is justified by a compelling government interest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest. <em>R. A. V., </em>505 U.S., at 395, 112 S. Ct. 2538, 120 L. Ed. 2d 305. The State must specifically identify an \u201cactual problem\u201d in need of solving, <em>Playboy, </em>529 U.S., at 822-823, 120 S. Ct. 1878, 146 L. Ed. 2d 86, and the curtailment of free speech must be actually necessary to the solution, see <em>R. A. V., supra, </em>at 395, 112 S. Ct. 2538, 120 L. Ed. 2d 305. That is a demanding standard. \u201cIt is rare that a regulation restricting speech because of its content will ever be permissible.\u201d <em>Playboy, supra, </em>at 818, 120 S. Ct. 1878, 146 L. Ed. 2d 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">California cannot meet that standard. At the outset, it acknowledges that it cannot show a direct causal link between violent video games and harm to minors. Rather, relying upon our decision in <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>512 U.S. 622, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 129 L. Ed. 2d 497 (1994), the State claims that it need not produce such proof because the legislature can make a predictive judgment that such a link exists, based on competing psychological studies. But reliance on <em>Turner Broadcasting </em>is misplaced. That decision applied <em>intermediate scrutiny </em>to a content-neutral regulation. <em>Id., </em>at 661-662, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 129 L. Ed. 2d 497. California\u2019s burden is much higher, and because it bears the</p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">[564 U.S. 800]</p>\n<p id=\"b762-16\">risk of uncertainty, see <em>Playboy, supra, </em>at 816-817, 120 S. Ct. 1878, 146 L. Ed. 2d 86, ambiguous proof will not suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-17\">The State\u2019s evidence is not compelling. California relies primarily on the research of Dr. Craig Anderson and a few other research psychologists whose studies purport to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children. These studies have been rejected by every court to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>them,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and with good reason: They do not prove that violent video games <em>cause </em>minors to <em>act </em>aggressively (which would at least be a beginning). Instead, \u201c[n] early all of the research is based on correlation, not evidence of causation, and most of the studies suffer from significant, admitted flaws in methodology.\u201d 556 F.3d, at 964. They show at best some correlation between exposure to violent entertainment and minuscule real-world effects, such as children\u2019s feeling more aggressive or making louder noises in the few minutes after playing a violent game than after playing a nonviolent game.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">Even taking for granted Dr. Anderson\u2019s conclusions that violent video games produce some effect on children\u2019s feelings of aggression, those effects are both small and indistinguishable</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">[564 U.S. 801]</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">from effects produced by other media. In his testimony in a similar lawsuit, Dr. Anderson admitted that the \u201ceffect sizes\u201d of children\u2019s exposure to violent video games are \u201cabout the same\u201d as that produced by their exposure to violence on television. App. 1263. And he admits that the <em>same </em>effects have been found when children watch cartoons starring Bugs Bunny or the Road Runner, <em>id., </em>at 1304, or when they play video games like Sonic the Hedgehog that are rated \u201cE\u201d (appropriate for all ages), <em>id., </em>at 1270, or even when they \u201cvie[w] a picture of a gun,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 1315-1316.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Of course, California has (wisely) declined to restrict Saturday morning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>cartoons, the sale of games rated for young</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">[564 U.S. 802]</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">children, or the distribution of pictures of guns. The consequence is that its regulation is wildly underinclusive when judged against its asserted justification, which in our view is alone enough to defeat it. Underinclusiveness raises serious doubts about whether the government is in fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint. See <em>City of Ladue </em>v. <em>Gilleo, </em>512 U.S. 43, 51, 114 S. Ct. 2038, 129 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1994); <em>Florida Star </em>v. <em>B. J. F., </em>491 U.S. 524, 540, 109 S. Ct. 2603, 105 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1989). Here, California has singled out the purveyors of video games for disfavored treatment\u2014at least when compared to booksellers, cartoonists, and movie producers\u2014and has given no persuasive reason why.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The Act is also seriously underin-clusive in another respect\u2014and a respect that renders irrelevant the contentions of the concurrence and the dissents that video games are qualitatively different from other portrayals of violence. The California Legislature is perfectly willing to leave this dangerous, mind-altering material in the hands of children so long as one parent (or even an aunt or uncle) says it\u2019s OK. And there are not even any requirements as to how this parental or avuncular relationship is to be verified; apparently the child\u2019s or putative parent\u2019s, aunt\u2019s, or uncle\u2019s say-so suffices. That is not how one addresses a serious social problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">California claims that the Act is justified in aid of parental authority: By requiring that the purchase of violent video games can be made only by adults, the Act ensures that parents can decide what games are appropriate. At the outset, we note our doubts that punishing third parties for conveying protected speech to children <em>just in case </em>their parents disapprove of that speech is a proper governmental means of aiding parental authority. Accepting that position would largely vitiate the rule that \u201conly in relatively narrow and well-defined circumstances may government bar public dissemination of protected materials to [minors].\u201d <em>Erznoznik, </em>422 U.S., at 212-213, 95 S. Ct. 2268, 45 L. Ed. 2d 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">[564 U.S. 803]</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">But leaving that aside, California cannot show that the Act\u2019s restrictions meet a substantial need of parents who wish to restrict their children\u2019s access to violent video games but cannot do so. The video-game industry has in place a voluntary rating system designed to inform consumers about the content of games. The system, implemented by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), assigns age-specific ratings to each video game submitted: EC (Early Childhood); E (Everyone); E10+ (Everyone 10 and older); T (Teens); M (17 and older); and AO (Adults Only\u201418 and older). App. 86. The Video Software Dealers Association encourages retailers to prominently display information about the ESRB system in their stores; to refrain from renting or selling adults-only games to minors; and to rent or sell \u201cM\u201d rated games to minors only with parental consent. <em>Id., </em>at 47. In 2009, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that, as a result of this system, \u201cthe video game industry outpaces the movie and music industries\u201d in \u201c(1) restricting target-marketing of mature-rated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>products to children; (2) clearly and prominently disclosing rating information; and (3) restricting children\u2019s access to mature-rated products at retail.\u201d FTC, Report to Congress, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children 30 (Dec. 2009), online at http://www.ftc.gov/os/ 2009/12/ P9945llviolententertainment.pdf (as visited June 24,2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (FTC Report). This system does much to ensure that minors cannot purchase seriously violent games on their own, and that parents who care about the matter can readily evaluate the games their children bring home. Filling the remaining modest gap in concerned parents\u2019 control can hardly be a compelling state interest.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">[564 U.S. 804]</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">And finally,  the Act\u2019s purported aid to parental authority is vastly overinclusive. Not all of the children who are forbidden to purchase violent video games on their own have parents who <em>care </em>whether they purchase violent video games. While some of the legislation\u2019s effect may indeed be in support of what some parents of the restricted children actually want, its entire effect is only in support of what the State thinks parents <em>ought </em>to want. This is not the narrow tailoring to \u201cassisting parents\u201d that restriction of First Amendment rights requires.</p>\n<p id=\"pARs7\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"46\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAREAAAAuAQAAAAAntBDvAAAAj0lEQVR4nO3TvQnCYBhF4ZMLgp0jJGu4i0vYWcYuY2QUEXvBVdJYCK+lt7iQJihCvu453EB+SFPMnbNmJ/DtTe8hQFAXqwkL3s+4NycIjn5NguD0tJwgOEyWI6pebX1OQC9Q588QIJg8Jwge/o4SBLed5QTBsLWcILhvLCcIuqvlhKW+e/On/866WTe/3rwBkrFFTF23arYAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"273\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">California\u2019s effort to regulate violent video games is the latest episode in a long series of failed attempts to censor violent entertainment for minors. While we have pointed out above that some of the evidence brought forward to support the harmfulness of video games is unpersuasive, we do not mean to demean or disparage the concerns that underlie the attempt to regulate them\u2014concerns that may and doubtless do prompt a good deal of parental oversight. We have no business passing judgment on the view of the California Legislature that violent video games (or, for that matter, any other forms of speech) corrupt the young or harm their moral development. Our task is only to say whether or not such works constitute a \u201cwell-defined and narrowly limited clas[s] of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem,\u201d <em>Chaplinsky, </em>315 U.S., at 571-572, 62 S. Ct. 766, 86 L. Ed. 1031, 62 S. Ct. 766, 86 L. Ed. 1031 (the answer plainly is no); and if not, whether the regulation of such works is justified by that high degree of necessity we have described as a compelling state interest (it is not).  Even where the protection</p>\n<p id=\"A0mX\">[564 U.S. 805]</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">of children is the object, the constitutional limits on governmental action apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">California\u2019s legislation straddles the fence between (1) addressing a serious social problem and (2) helping concerned parents control their children. Both ends are legitimate, but when they affect First Amendment rights they must be pursued by means that are neither seri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>ously underinclusive nor seriously overinclusive. See <em>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hialeah, </em>508 U.S. 520, 546, 113 S. Ct. 2217, 124 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1993). As a means of protecting children from portrayals of violence, the legislation is seriously underinclusive, not only because it excludes portrayals other than video games, but also because it permits a parental or avuncular veto. And as a means of assisting concerned parents it is seriously overinclusive because it abridges the First Amendment rights of young people whose parents (and aunts and uncles) think violent video games are a harmless pastime. And the overbreadth in achieving one goal is not cured by the underbreadth in achieving the other. Legislation such as this, which is neither fish nor fowl, cannot survive strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">We affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-10\">. Justice Alito distinguishes <em>Stevens </em>on several grounds that seem to us ill founded. He suggests, <em>post, </em>at 814, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 729 (opinion concurring in judgment), that <em>Stevens </em>did not apply strict scrutiny. If that is so (and we doubt it), it would make this an <em>a fortiori </em>case. He says, <em>post, </em>at 814, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 729, that the California Act punishes the sale or rental rather than the \u201ccreation\u201d or \u201cpossession\u201d of violent depictions. That distinction appears nowhere in <em>Stevens </em>itself, and for good reason: It would make permissible the prohibition of printing or selling books\u2014though not the writing of them. Whether government regulation applies to creating, distributing, or consuming speech makes no difference. And finally, Justice Alito points out, <em>post, </em>at 814, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 729, that <em>Stevens </em>\u201cleft open the possibility that a more narrowly drawn statute\u201d would be constitutional. True, but entirely irrelevant. <em>Stevens </em>said, 559 U.S., at 482, 130 S. Ct. 1577, 176 L. Ed. 2d 435, that the \u201ccrush-video\u201d statute at issue there might pass muster if it were limited to videos of acts of animal cruelty that violated the law where the acts were performed.

Justice Thomas ignores the holding of <em>Erznoznik, </em>and denies that persons under 18 have any constitutional right to speak or be spoken to without their parents\u2019 consent. He cites no case, state or federal, supporting this view, and to our knowledge there is none. Most of his dissent is devoted to the proposition that parents have traditionally had the power to control what their children hear and say. This is true enough. And it perhaps follows from this that the state has the power to <em>enforce </em>parental prohibitions\u2014to require, for example, that the promoters of a rock concert exclude those minors whose parents have advised the promoters that their children are forbidden to attend. But it does not follow that the state has the power to prevent children from hearing or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>saying anything <em>without their parents\u2019 prior consent. </em>The latter would mean, for example, that it could be made criminal to admit persons under 18 to a political rally without their parents\u2019 prior written consent\u2014even a political rally in support of laws against corporal punishment of children, or laws in favor of greater rights for minors. And what is good for First Amendment rights of speech must be good for First Amendment rights of religion as well: It could be made criminal to admit a person under 18 to church, or to give a person under 18 a religious tract, without his parents\u2019 prior consent. Our point is not, as Justice Thomas believes, <em>post, </em>at 836, n. 2, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 742, merely that such laws are \u201cundesirable.\u201d They are obviously an infringement upon the religious freedom of young people and those who wish to proselytize young people. Such laws do not enforce <em>parental </em>authority over children\u2019s speech and religion; they impose <em>governmental </em>authority, subject only to a parental veto. In the absence of any precedent for state control, uninvited by the parents, over a child\u2019s speech and religion (Justice Thomas cites none), and in the absence of any justification for such control that would satisfy strict scrutiny, those laws must be unconstitutional. This argument is not, as Justice Thomas asserts, \u201ccircular,\u201d <em>ibid. </em>It is the absence of any historical warrant or compelling justification for such restrictions, not our <em>ipse dixit, </em>that renders them invalid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b760-10\">.

Ed. 2d, at 724. Well of course it is different in kind, but not in a way that causes the provision and viewing of violent video games, unlike the provision and reading of books, not to be expressive activity and hence not to enjoy First Amendment protection. Reading Dante is unquestionably more cultured and intellectually edifying than playing Mortal Kombat. But these cultural and intellectual differences are not <em>constitutional </em>ones.

Although the California statute is well intentioned, its terms are not framed with the precision that the Constitution demands, and I therefore agree with the Court that this particular law cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">[564 U.S. 806]</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">I disagree, however, with the approach taken in the Court\u2019s opinion. In considering the application of unchanging constitutional principles to new and rapidly evolving technology, this Court should proceed with caution. We should make every effort to understand the new technology. We should take into account the possibility that developing technology may have important societal implications that will become apparent only with time. We should not jump to the conclusion that new technology is fundamentally the same as some older thing with which we are familiar. And we should not hastily dismiss the judgment of legislators, who may be in a better position than we are to assess the implications of new technology. The opinion of the Court exhibits none of this caution.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-14\">In the view of the Court, all those concerned about the effects of violent video games\u2014federal and state legislators, educators, social scientists, and parents\u2014are unduly fearful, for violent video games really present no serious problem.

Because I agree with the latter argument, I see no need to</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">[564 U.S. 807]</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">reach the broader First Amendment issues addressed by the Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">Due process requires that laws give people of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited. <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S. Ct. 2294, 33 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1972). The lack of such notice in a law that regulates expression \u201craises special First Amendment concerns because of its obvious chilling effect on free speech.\u201d <em>Reno </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, </em>521 U.S. 844, 871-872, 117 S. Ct. 2329, 138 L. Ed. 2d 874 (1997). Vague laws force potential speakers to \u201c \u2018steer far wider of the unlawful zone\u2019 . . . than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.\u201d <em>Baggett </em>v. <em>Bullitt, </em>377 U.S. 360, 372, 84 S.

While \u201cperfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required even of regulations that restrict expressive activity,\u201d <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Rock Against Racism, </em>491 U.S. 781, 794, 109 S.

These principles apply to laws that regulate expression for the purpose of protecting children. See <em>Interstate Circuit, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dallas, </em>390 U.S. 676, 689, 88 S. Ct. 1298, 20 L. Ed. 2d 225 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">Here, the California law does not define \u201cviolent video games\u201d with the \u201cnarrow specificity\u201d that the Constitution demands. In an effort to avoid First Amendment problems, the California Legislature modeled its violent video game statute on the New York law that this Court upheld in <em>Ginsberg </em>v. <em>New York, </em>390 U.S. 629, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195 (1968)\u2014a law that prohibited the sale of certain sexually related materials to minors, see <em>id., </em>at 631-633, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195. But the California Legislature departed</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">[564 U.S. 808]</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">from the <em>Ginsberg </em>model in an important respect, and the legislature overlooked important differences between the materials falling within the scope of the two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b767-14\">The law at issue in <em>Ginsberg </em>prohibited the sale to minors of materials that were deemed \u201charmful to minors,\u201d and the law defined \u201charmful to minors\u201d simply by adding the words \u201cfor minors\u201d to each element of the definition of obscenity set out in what were then the Court\u2019s leading obscenity decisions, see <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 77 S. Ct. 1304, 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 1498 (1957), and <em>Book Named \u201cJohn Cleland\u2019s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure\u201d </em>v. <em>Attorney General of Mass., </em>383 U.S. 413, 86 S. Ct. 975, 16 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Seeking to bring its violent video game law within the protection of <em>Ginsberg, </em>the California Legislature began with the obscenity test adopted in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1973), a decision that revised the obscenity tests previously set out in <em>Roth </em>and <em>Memoirs. </em>The legislature then made certain modifications to accommodate the aim of the violent video game law.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Under <em>Miller, </em>an obscenity statute must contain a threshold limitation that restricts the statute\u2019s scope to specifically described \u201chard core\u201d materials. See 413 U.S., at 23-25, 27, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419. Materials that fall within this \u201chard core\u201d category may be deemed to be obscene if three additional requirements are met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">(1) An \u201caverage person, applying contemporary community standards [must] find . . . the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\">(2) \u201cthe work [must] depic[t] or describe], in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-8\">(3) \u201cthe work, taken as a whole, [must] lac[k] serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 24, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419 (internal quotation marks omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">[564 U.S. 809]</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">Adapting these standards, the California law imposes the following threshold limitation: \u201c[T]he range of options available to a player [must] includ[e] killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a human being.\u201d \u00a7 1746(d)(1). Any video game that meets this threshold test is subject to the law\u2019s restrictions if it also satisfies three further requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-12\">\u201c(i) A reasonable person, considering the game as a whole, would find [the game] appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-13\">\u201c(ii) It is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-14\">\u201c(iii) It causes the game, as a whole, to lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\u201d \u00a7 1746(d)(1)(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-15\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b768-16\">The first important difference between the <em>Ginsberg </em>law and the California violent video game statute concerns their respective threshold requirements. As noted, the <em>Ginsberg </em>law built upon the test for adult obscenity, and the current adult obscenity test, which was set out in <em>Miller, </em>requires an obscenity statute to contain a threshold limitation that restricts the statute\u2019s coverage to spec-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>cifically defined \u201chard core\u201d depictions. See 413 U.S., at 23-25, 27, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419. The <em>Miller </em>Court gave as an example a statute that applies to only \u201c[p]atently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts,\u201d \u201cmasturbation, excretory functions, and</p>\n<p id=\"A2Ro\">[564 U.S. 810]</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">lewd exhibition of the genitals.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 25, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419. The <em>Miller </em>Court clearly viewed this threshold limitation as serving a vital notice function. \u201cWe are satisfied,\u201d the Court wrote, \u201cthat these specific prerequisites will provide fair notice to a dealer in such materials that his public and commercial activities may bring <em>prosecution.\u201d Id., </em>at 27, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419; see also <em>Reno, </em>521 U.S., at 873, 117 S. Ct. 2329, 138 L. Ed. 2d 874 (observing that <em>Miller\u2019s </em>threshold limitation \u201creduces the vagueness inherent in the open-ended term \u2018patently offensive\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">By contrast, the threshold requirement of the California law does not perform the narrowing function served by the limitation in <em>Miller. </em>At least when <em>Miller </em>was decided, depictions of \u201chard core\u201d sexual conduct were not a common feature of mainstream entertainment. But nothing similar can be said about much of the conduct covered by the California law. It provides that a video game cannot qualify as \u201cviolent\u201d unless \u201cthe range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a human being.\u201d \u00a7 1746(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">For better or worse, our society has long regarded many depictions of killing and maiming<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as suitable features of popular entertainment, including entertainment that is widely available to minors. The California law\u2019s threshold requirement would more closely resemble the limitation in <em>Miller </em>if it targeted a narrower class of graphic depictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Because of this feature of the California law\u2019s threshold test, the work of providing fair notice is left in large part to</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">[564 U.S. 811]</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">the three requirements that follow, but those elements are also not up to the task. In drafting the violent video game law, the California Legislature could have made its own judgment regarding the kind and degree of violence that is acceptable in games played by minors (or by minors in particular age groups). Instead, the legislature relied on undefined societal or community standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">One of the three elements at issue here refers expressly to \u201cprevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors.\u201d \u00a7 1746(d)(1)(A)(ii). Another element points in the same direction, asking whether \u201c[a] reasonable person, considering [a] game as a whole,\u201d would find that it \u201cappeals to a <em>deviant </em>or <em>morbid, </em>interest of minors.\u201d \u00a7 1746(d)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">The terms \u201cdeviant\u201d and \u201cmorbid\u201d are not defined in the statute, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>California offers no reason to think that its courts would give the terms anything other than their ordinary meaning. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 5 (arguing that \u201c[a] reasonable person can make this judgment through ... a common understanding and definition of the applicable terms\u201d). I therefore assume that \u201cdeviant\u201d and \u201cmorbid\u201d carry the meaning that they convey in ordinary speech. The adjective \u201cdeviant\u201d ordinarily means \u201cdeviating . . . from some accepted norm,\u201d and the term \u201cmorbid\u201d means \u201cof, relating to, or characteristic of disease.\u201d Webster\u2019s 618, 1469. A \u201cdeviant or morbid interest\u201d in violence, therefore, appears to be an interest that deviates from what is regarded\u2014presumably in accordance with some generally accepted standard\u2014as normal and healthy. Thus, the application of the California law is heavily dependent on the identification of generally accepted standards regarding the suitability of violent entertainment for minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">The California Legislature seems to have assumed that these standards are sufficiently well known so that a person of ordinary intelligence would have fair notice as to whether the kind and degree of violence in a particular game is</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">[564 U.S. 812]</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">enough to qualify the game as \u201cviolent.\u201d And because the <em>Miller </em>test looks to community standards, the legislature may have thought that the use of undefined community standards in the violent video game law would not present vagueness problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">There is a critical difference, however, between obscenity laws and laws regulating violence in entertainment. By the time of this Court\u2019s landmark obscenity cases in the 1960\u2019s, obscenity had long been prohibited, see Roth, 354 U.S., at 484-485, 77 S. Ct. 1304, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1498, and this experience had helped to shape certain generally accepted norms concerning expression related to sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">There is no similar history regarding expression related to violence. As the Court notes, classic literature contains descriptions of great violence, and even children\u2019s stories sometimes depict very violent scenes. See <em>ante, </em>at 795-797, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 718-719.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">Although our society does not generally regard all depictions of violence as suitable for children or adolescents, the prevalence of violent depictions in children\u2019s literature and entertainment creates numerous opportunities for reasonable people to disagree about which depictions may excite \u201cdeviant\u201d or \u201cmorbid\u201d impulses. See Edwards &amp; Berman, Regulating Violence on Television, 89 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1487, 1523 (1995) (observing that the <em>Miller </em>test would be difficult to apply to violent expression because \u201cthere is nothing even approaching a consensus on low-value violence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">Finally, the difficulty of ascertaining the community standards incorporated into the California law is compounded by the legislature\u2019s decision to lump all minors together. The California law draws no distinction between young children and adolescents who are nearing the age of majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">In response to a question at oral argument, the attorney defending the constitutionality of the California law said that the State would accept a narrowing construction of the law under which the law\u2019s references to \u201cminors\u201d would be interpreted to refer to the oldest minors\u2014that is, those just short</p>\n<p id=\"b770-13\">[564 U.S. 813]</p>\n<p id=\"b770-14\">of 18. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-12. However, \u201cit is not within our power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>to construe and narrow state laws.\u201d <em>Grayned, </em>408 U.S., at 110, 92 S. Ct. 2294, 33 L. Ed. 2d 222. We can only \u201c \u2018extrapolate [their] allowable meaning\u2019 \u201d from the statutory text and authoritative interpretations of similar laws by courts of the State. <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Garner </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>368 U.S. 157, 174, 82 S. Ct. 248, 7 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1961) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment)).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">In this case, California has not provided any evidence that the California Legislature intended the law to be limited in this way, or cited any decisions from its courts that would support an \u201coldest minors\u201d construction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">For these reasons, I conclude that the California violent video game law fails to provide the fair notice that the Constitution requires. And I would go no further. I would not express any view on whether a properly drawn statute would or would not survive First Amendment scrutiny. We should address that question only if and when it is necessary to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Having outlined how I would decide this case, I will now briefly elaborate on my reasons for questioning the wisdom of the Court\u2019s approach. Some of these reasons are touched upon by the dissents, and while I am not prepared at this time to go as far as either Justice Thomas or Justice Breyer, they raise valid concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">The Court is wrong in saying that the holding in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>559 U.S. 460, 130 S. Ct. 1577, 176 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2010), \u201ccontrols this <em>case.\u201d Ante, </em>at 792, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 716. First, the statute in <em>Stevens </em>differed sharply</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">[564 U.S. 814]</p>\n<p id=\"b771-12\">from the statute at issue here. <em>Stevens </em>struck down a law that broadly prohibited <em>any person </em>from creating, selling, or possessing depictions of animal cruelty for commercial gain. The California law involved here, by contrast, is limited to the sale or rental of violent video games <em>to minors. </em>The California law imposes no restriction on the creation of violent video games, or on the possession of such games by anyone, whether above or below the age of 18. The California law does not regulate the sale or rental of violent games by adults. And the California law does not prevent parents and certain other close relatives from buying or renting violent games for their children or other young relatives if they see fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-13\">Second, <em>Stevens </em>does not support the proposition that a law like the one at issue must satisfy strict scrutiny. The portion of <em>Stevens </em>on which the Court relies rejected the Government\u2019s contention that depictions of animal cruelty were categorically outside the range of <em>any </em>First Amendment protection. 559 U.S., at 471-472, 130 S. Ct. 1577, 176 L. Ed. 2d 435. Going well beyond <em>Stevens, </em>the Court now holds that any law that attempts to prevent minors from purchasing violent video games must satisfy strict scrutiny instead of the more lenient standard applied in <em>Ginsberg, </em>390 U.S. 629, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195, our most closely related precedent. As a result of today\u2019s decision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>a State may prohibit the sale to minors of what <em>Ginsberg </em>described as \u201cgirlie magazines,\u201d but a State must surmount a formidable (and perhaps insurmountable) obstacle if it wishes to prevent children from purchasing the most violent and depraved video games imaginable.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Third, <em>Stevens </em>expressly left open the possibility that a more narrowly drawn statute targeting depictions of animal cruelty might be compatible with the First Amendment. See 559 U.S., at 482, 130 S. Ct. 1577, 176 L. Ed. 2d 435. In this case, the Court\u2019s sweeping opinion will likely be read by many, both inside and outside the video-game industry, as suggesting that no regulation of minors\u2019 access to violent video games is allowed\u2014at least</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">[564 U.S. 815]</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">without supporting evidence that may not be realistically obtainable given the nature of the phenomenon in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">The Court\u2019s opinion distorts the effect of the California law. I certainly agree with the Court that the government has no \u201cfree-floating power to restrict the ideas to which children may be exposed,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 794-795, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 717, but the California law does not exercise such a power. If parents want their child to have a violent video game, the California law does not interfere with that parental prerogative. Instead, the California law reinforces parental de-cisionmaking in exactly the same way as the New York statute upheld in <em>Ginsberg. </em>Under both laws, minors are prevented from purchasing certain materials; and under both laws, parents are free to supply their children with these items if that is their wish.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">Citing the video-game industry\u2019s voluntary rating system, the Court argues that the California law does not \u201cmeet a substantial need of parents who wish to restrict their children\u2019s access to violent video games but cannot do <em>so.\u201d Ante, </em>at 803, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 722. The Court does not mention the fact that the industry adopted this system in response to the threat of federal regulation, Brief for Activision Blizzard, Inc., as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>7-10, a threat that the Court\u2019s opinion may now be seen as largely eliminating. Nor does the Court acknowledge that compliance with this system at the time of the enactment of the California law left much to be desired<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\u2014or that future enforcement may decline if the video-game</p>\n<p id=\"axj-dedup-2\">[564 U.S. 816]</p>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">industry perceives that any threat of government regulation has vanished. Nor does the Court note, as Justice Breyer points out, see <em>post, </em>at 849-850, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 751 (dissenting opinion), that many parents today are simply not able to monitor their children\u2019s use of computers and gaming devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-12\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b772-13\">Finally, the Court is far too quick to dismiss the possibility that the experience of playing video games (and the effects on minors of playing violent video games) may be very different from anything that we have seen before. Any assessment of the experi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>ence of playing video games must take into account certain characteristics of the video games that are now on the market and those that are likely to be available in the near future.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">Today\u2019s most advanced video games create realistic alternative worlds in which millions of players immerse themselves for hours on end. These games feature visual imagery and sounds that are strikingly realistic, and in the near future video-game graphics may be virtually indistinguishable from actual video footage.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Many of the games already on the market can produce high definition images,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and it is predicted that it will not be long before video-game images will be seen in three dimensions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is also forecast that</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">[564 U.S. 817]</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">video games will soon provide sensory feedback.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> By wearing a special vest or other device, a player will be able to experience physical sensations supposedly felt by a character on the screen.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Some <em>amici </em>who support respondents foresee the day when \u201c \u2018virtual-reality shoot-\u2018em-ups\u2019 \u201d will allow children to \u201c \u2018actually feel the splatting blood from the blown-off head\u2019 \u201d of a victim. Brief for Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>29 (quoting H. Schechter, Savage Pastimes 18 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Persons who play video games also have an unprecedented ability to participate in the events that take place in the virtual worlds that these games create. Players can create their own video-game characters and can use photos to produce characters that closely resemble actual people. A person playing a sophisticated game can make a multitude of choices and can thereby alter the course of the action in the game. In addition, the means by which players control the action in video games now bear a closer relationship to the means by which people control action in the real world. While the action in older games was often directed with buttons or a joystick, players dictate the action in newer games by engaging in the same motions that they desire a character</p>\n<p id=\"Ayqk\">[564 U.S. 818]</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>the game to perform.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For example, a player who wants a video-game character to swing a baseball bat\u2014either to hit a ball or smash a skull\u2014could bring that about by simulating the motion of actually swinging a bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">These present-day and emerging characteristics of video games must be considered together with characteristics of the violent games that have already been marketed.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">In some of these games, the violence is astounding.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Victims by the dozens are killed with every imaginable implement, including ma-chineguns, shotguns, clubs, hammers, axes, swords, and chainsaws. Victims are dismembered, decapitated, disemboweled, set on fire, and chopped into little pieces. They cry out in agony and beg for mercy. Blood gushes, splatters, and pools. Severed body parts and gobs of human remains are graphically shown. In some games, points are awarded based, not only on the number of victims killed, but on the killing technique employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">It also appears that there is no antisocial theme too base for some in the video-game industry to exploit. There are games in which a player can take on the identity and reenact the killings carried out by the perpetrators of the murders at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The objective</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">[564 U.S. 819]</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">of one game is to rape a mother and her daughters;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> in another, the goal is to rape Native American women.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> There is a game in which players engage in \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and can choose to gun down African-Americans, Latinos, or Jews.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In still another game, players attempt to fire a rifle shot into the head of President Kennedy as his motorcade passes by the Texas School Book Depository.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">If the technological characteristics of the sophisticated games that are likely to be available in the near future are combined with the character<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>istics of the most violent games already marketed, the result will be games that allow troubled teens to experience in an extraordinarily personal and vivid way what it would be like to carry out unspeakable acts of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">The Court is untroubled by this possibility. According to the Court, the \u201cinteractive\u201d nature of video games is \u201cnothing new\u201d because \u201call literature is interactive.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 798, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 719. Disagreeing with this assessment, the International Game Developers Association (IGDA)\u2014a group that presumably understands the nature of video games and that supports respondents\u2014tells us that video games are \u201cfar more concretely interactive.\u201d Brief for IGDA et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>3. And on this point, the game developers are surely correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">[564 U.S. 820]</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">It is certainly true, as the Court notes, that \u201c \u2018[l]iterature when it is successful draws the reader into the story, makes him identify with the characters, invites him to judge them and quarrel with them, to experience their joys and sufferings as the reader\u2019s own.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 798, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 719 (quoting <em>American Amusement Machine Assn. </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>244 F.3d 572, 577 (CA7 2001)). But only an extraordinarily imaginative reader who reads a description of a killing in a literary work will experience that event as vividly as he might if he played the role of the killer in a video game. To take an example, think of a person who reads the passage in Crime and Punishment in which Ras-kolnikov kills the old pawnbroker with an ax. See F. Dostoyevsky, Crime and Punishment 78 (Modern Library ed. 1950). Compare that reader with a video-game player who creates an avatar that bears his own image; who sees a realistic image of the victim and the scene of the killing in high definition and in three dimensions; who is forced to decide whether or not to kill the victim and decides to do so; who then pretends to grasp an ax, to raise it above the head of the victim, and then to bring it down; who hears the thud of the ax hitting her head and her cry of pain; who sees her split skull and feels the sensation of blood on his face and hands. For most people, the two experiences will not be the same.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">When all of the characteristics of video games are taken into account, there is certainly a reasonable basis for thinking that the experience of playing a video game may be quite different from the experience of reading a book, listening to a radio broadcast, or viewing a movie. And if this is so,</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">[564 U.S. 821]</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">then for at least some minors, the effects of playing violent video games may also be quite different. The Court acts prematurely in dismissing this possibility out of hand.</p>\n<p id=\"pA3E8\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"31\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASMAAAAfAQAAAACElJbiAAAAmklEQVR4nNWToRFCMRBEX24QODqgCgr4nWFxtEIJ4CjhC0RAIcF9A4tA5MTOgIiAc293b+aSS4r4XOf4IgTdUzUrDgJglw0Hvee6LoYmWAjglHQPASyfyfAgaRrVykEtAuZT6jfw3uMmn8dBAI9j0j1Iuo3rNoqDGsB9tm/tFgK45AVYCGB1GJrhQZK26Yoc1J5vovzyH/rb1AstMZRcyZ261AAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"292\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">For all these reasons, I would hold only that the particular law at issue here fails to provide the clear notice that the Constitution requires.

The majority strikes down, as facially unconstitutional, a state law that prohibits the direct sale or rental of certain video games to minors because the law \u201cabridges] the freedom of speech.\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 1. But I do not think the First Amendment stretches that far. The practices and beliefs of the founding generation establish that \u201cthe freedom of speech,\u201d as originally understood, does not include a right to speak to minors (or a right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors\u2019 parents or guardians. I would hold that the law at issue is not facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment, and reverse and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">[564 U.S. 822]</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">When interpreting a constitutional provision, \u201cthe goal is to discern the most likely public understanding of [that] provision at the time it was adopted.\u201d <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>561 U.S. 742, 828, 130 S. Ct. 3020, 177 L. Ed. 2d 894 (2010) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Because the Constitution is a written instrument, \u201cits meaning does not alter.\u201d <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Ohio Elections Comm\u2019n, </em>514 U.S. 334, 359, 115 S. Ct. 1511, 131 L.

Laws regulating such speech do not \u201cabridg[e] the freedom of speech\u201d because such speech is understood to fall outside \u201cthe freedom of speech.\u201d See <em>Ashcroft </em>v. <em>Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. 234, 245-246, 122 S.

Ct. 1511, 131 L. Ed. 2d 426. The historical evidence shows that the founding generation believed parents had absolute authority over their minor children and expected parents to use that authority to direct the proper development of their children. It would be absurd to suggest that such a society understood \u201cthe</p>\n<p id=\"ALT1\">[564 U.S. 823]</p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">freedom of speech\u201d to include a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>to speak to minors (or a corresponding right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors\u2019 parents. Cf. Brief for Common Sense Media as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>12-15. The founding generation would not have considered it an abridgment of \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d to support parental authority by restricting speech that bypasses minors\u2019 parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Attitudes toward children were in a state of transition around the time that the States ratified the Bill of Rights. A complete understanding of the founding generation\u2019s views on children and the parent-child relationship must therefore begin roughly a century earlier, in colonial New England.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">In the Puritan tradition common in the New England Colonies, fathers ruled families with absolute authority. \u201cThe patriarchal family was the basic building block of Puritan society.\u201d S. Mintz, Huck\u2019s Raft 13 (2004) (hereinafter Mintz); see also R. MacDonald, Literature for Children in England and America From 1646 to 1774, p. 7 (1982) (hereinafter MacDonald). The Puritans rejected many customs, such as godparenthood, that they considered inconsistent with the patriarchal structure. Mintz 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Part of the father\u2019s absolute power was the right and duty \u201cto fill his children\u2019s minds with knowledge and . . . make them apply their knowledge in right action.\u201d E. Morgan, The Puritan Family 97 (rev. ed. 1966) (hereinafter Morgan). Puritans thought children were \u201cinnately sinful and that parents\u2019 primary task was to suppress their children\u2019s natural depravity.\u201d S. Mintz &amp; S. Kellogg, Domestic Revolutions 2 (1988) (hereinafter Mintz <em>&amp; </em>Kellogg); see also B. Wadsworth, The Well-Ordered Family 55 (1712) (\u201cChildren should not be left to themselves ... to do as they please; . . . not being fit to govern themselves\u201d); C. Mather, A Family Well-Ordered 38 (1699). Accordingly, parents were not to let their children read \u201cvain Books, profane Ballads, and filthy Songs\u201d or \u201cfond and amorous Romances, . . . fabulous Histories of Giants, the bombast Achievements of Knight Errantry, and the like.\u201d The History of Genesis, pp. vi-vii (3d ed. corrected 1708).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">[564 U.S. 824]</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">This conception of parental authority was reflected in laws at that time. In the Massachusetts Colony, for example, it was unlawful for tavern keepers (or anyone else) to entertain children without their parents\u2019 consent. 2 Records and Files of the Quarterly Courts of Essex County, Massachusetts, p. 180 (1912); 4 <em>id., </em>at 237, 275 (1914); 5 <em>id., </em>at 143 (1916); see also Morgan 146. And a \u201cstubborn or REBELLIOUS SON\u201d of 16 years or more committed a capital offense if he disobeyed \u201cthe voice of his Father, or the voice of his Mother.\u201d The Laws and Liberties of Massachusetts 6 (1648) (reprint M. Farrand ed. 1929); see also J. Kamensky, Governing the Tongue 102, n. 14 (1997) (citing similar laws in the Connecticut, New Haven, Plymouth, and New Hampshire Colonies in the late 1600\u2019s).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">In the decades leading up to and following the Revolution, attitudes toward children changed. See, <em>e.g., </em>J. Reinier, From Virtue to Character: American Childhood, 1775-1850, p. 1 (1996) (hereinafter Reinier). Children came to be seen less as innately sinful and more as blank slates requiring careful and deliberate development. But the same overarching principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>remained. Parents continued to have both the right and duty to ensure the proper development of their children. They exercised significant authority over their children, including control over the books that children read. And laws at the time continued to reflect strong support for parental authority and the sense that children were not fit to govern themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The works of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau were a driving force behind the changed understanding of children and childhood. See id., at 2-5; H. Brewer, By Birth or Consent 97 (2005) (hereinafter Brewer); K. Calvert, Children in</p>\n<p id=\"ac0-dedup-0\">[564 U.S. 825]</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">the House 59-60 (1992) (hereinafter Calvert). Locke taught that children\u2019s minds were blank slates and that parents therefore had to be careful and deliberate about what their children were told and observed. Parents had only themselves to blame if, \u201cby humour-ing and cockering\u201d their children, they \u201cpoison\u2019d the fountain\u201d and later \u201ctaste[d] the bitter waters.\u201d Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1692), in 37 English Philosophers of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries 27-28 (C. Eliot ed. 1910). All vices, he explained, were sowed by parents and \u201cthose about children.\u201d Id., at 29. Significantly, Locke did not suggest circumscribing parental authority but rather articulated a new basis for it. Rousseau disagreed with Locke in important respects, but his philosophy was similarly premised on parental control over a child\u2019s development. Although Rousseau advocated that children should be allowed to develop naturally, he instructed that the environment be directed by \u201ca tutor who is given total control over the child and who removes him from society, from all competing sources of authority and influence.\u201d J. Fliegel-man, Prodigals and Pilgrims 30 (1982) (hereinafter Fliegelman); see also Reinier 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">These writings received considerable attention in America. Locke\u2019s An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and his Some Thoughts Concerning Education were significantly more popular than his Two Treatises of Government, according to a study of 92 colonial libraries between 1700 and 1776. Lundberg &amp; May, The Enlightened Reader in America, 28 American Quarterly 262, 273 (1976) (hereinafter Lundberg). And Rousseau\u2019s Emile, a treatise on education, was more widely advertised and distributed than his political work, The Social Contract. Fliegelman 29; see also Lundberg 285. In general, the most popular books in the Colonies on the eve of the American Revolution were not political discourses but ones concerned with child rearing. See Mintz <em>&amp; </em>Kellogg 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">[564 U.S. 826]</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">Locke\u2019s and Rousseau\u2019s writings fostered a new conception of childhood. Children were increasingly viewed as malleable creatures, and childhood came to be seen as an important period of growth, development, and preparation for adulthood. See <em>id., </em>at 17, 21, 47; M. Grossberg, Governing the Hearth 8 (1985) (hereinafter Grossberg). Noah Webster, called the father of American education, wrote that \u201c [t]he impressions received in early life usually form the characters of individuals.\u201d On the Education of Youth in America (1790) (hereinafter Webster), in Essays on Education in the Early Republic 43 (F. Rudolph ed. 1965) (hereinafter Rudolph); cf. Slater, Noah Webster: Founding Father of Ameri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>can Scholarship and Education, in Noah Webster\u2019s First Edition of an American Dictionary of the English Language (1967). Elizabeth Smith, sister-in-law to John Adams, similarly wrote: \u201cThe Infant Mind, I beleive[,] is a blank, that eassily receives any impression.\u201d M. Norton, Liberty\u2019s Daughters 101 (1996) (hereinafter Norton) (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original); see also S. Doggett, A Discourse on Education (1796) (hereinafter Doggett), in Rudolph 151 (\u201c[I]n early youth,. . . every power and capacity is pliable and susceptible of any direction or impression\u201d); J.

Burgh, Thoughts on Education 7 (1749) (hereinafter Burgh) (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">This conception of childhood led to great concern about influences on children. \u201cYouth are ever learning to do what they see others around them doing, and these imitations grow into habits.\u201d Doggett, in Rudolph 151; see also B. Rush, A Plan for the Establishment of Public Schools (1786) (hereinafter Rush), in Rudolph 16 (\u201cThe vices of young people are generally learned from each other\u201d); Webster, in Rudolph 58 (\u201c[CJhildren, artless and unsuspecting, resign their hearts to any person whose manners are agreeable and whose conduct is respectable\u201d). Books therefore advised parents \u201cnot to put children in the way of those whom you dare not trust.\u201d L. Child, The Mother\u2019s Book 149 (1831) (hereinafter Child); see also S. Coontz, The Social Origins of Private Life 149-150 (1988) (noting that it was \u201cconsidered dangerous to leave children to the supervision of servants or apprentices\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">As a result, it was widely accepted that children needed close monitoring and carefully planned development. See B. Wishy, The Child and the Republic 24-25, 32 (1968) (hereinafter Wishy); Grossberg 8. Managing the young mind was considered \u201cinfinitely important.\u201d Doggett, in Rudolph 151; see also A. MacLeod, A Moral Tale 72-73 (1975) (hereinafter MacLeod). In an essay on the education of youth in America, Noah Webster described the human mind as \u201ca rich field, which, without constant care, will ever be covered with a luxuriant growth of weeds.\u201d Rudolph 54. He advocated sheltering children from \u201cevery low-bred, drunken, immoral character\u201d and keeping their minds \u201cuntainted till their reasoning faculties have acquired strength and the good principles which may be planted in their minds have taken deep root.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 63; see also Rush, in <em>id., </em>at 16 (\u201c[T]he most useful citizens have been formed from those youth who have</p>\n<p id=\"AJOA\">[564 U.S. 828]</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">never known or felt their own wills till they were one and twenty years of age\u201d); Burgh 7 (\u201c[T]he souls of Youth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>are more immediately committed to the care of their Parents and Instructors than even those of a People are to their Pastor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The Revolution only amplified these concerns. The Republic would require virtuous citizens, which necessitated proper training from childhood. See Mintz 54, 71; MacLeod 40; Saxton, French and American Childhoods, in Children and Youth in a New Nation 69 (J. Marten ed. 2009) (hereinafter Marten); see also W. Cardell, Story of Jack Halyard, pp. xv-xvi (30th ed. 1834) (hereinafter Cardell) (\u201c[T]he glory and efficacy of our institutions will soon rest with those who are growing up to succede us\u201d). Children were \u201cthe pivot of the moral world,\u201d and their proper development was \u201ca subject of as high interest, as any to which the human mind ha[d] ever been called.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at xvi.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Based on these views of childhood, the founding generation understood parents to have a right and duty to govern their children\u2019s growth. Parents were expected to direct the development and education of their children and ensure that bad habits did not take root. See Calvert 58-59; MacLeod 72; Mintz &amp; Kellogg 23. They were responsible for instilling \u201cmoral prohibitions, behavioral standards, and a capacity for self-government that would prepare a child for the outside world.\u201d Mintz &amp; Kellogg 58; see also Youth\u2019s Companion, Apr. 16, 1827, p. 1 (hereinafter Youth\u2019s Companion) (\u201cLet [children\u2019s] minds be formed, their hearts prepared, and their characters moulded for the scenes and the duties of a brighter day\u201d). In short, \u201c[h]ome and family bore the major responsibility for the moral training of children and thus, by implication, for the moral health of the nation.\u201d MacLeod 29; see also Introduction, in Marten 6; Reinier, p. xi; Smith, Autonomy and Affection: Parents and Children</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">[564 U.S. 829]</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">in Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake Families, in Growing up in America 54 (N. Hiner &amp; J. Hawes eds. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">This conception of parental rights and duties was exemplified by Thomas Jefferson\u2019s approach to raising children. He wrote letters to his daughters constantly and often gave specific instructions about what the children should do. See, <em>e.g., </em>Letter to Martha Jefferson (Nov. 28, 1783), in S. Randolph, The Domestic Life of Thomas Jefferson 44 (1939) (dictating her daily schedule of music, dancing, drawing, and studying); Letter to Martha Jefferson (Dec. 22, 1783), in <em>id., </em>at 45-46 (\u201cI do not wish you to be gaily clothed at this time of life .... [A]bove all things and at all times let your clothes be neat, whole, and properly put on\u201d). Jefferson expected his daughter, Martha, to write \u201cby every post\u201d and instructed her, \u201cInform me what books you read [and] what tunes you learn.\u201d Letter (Nov. 28, 1783), in <em>id., </em>at 44. He took the same approach with his nephew, Peter Carr, after Carr\u2019s father died. See Letter (Aug. 19, 1785), in 8 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson 405-408 (J. Boyd ed. 1953) (detailing a course of reading and exercise, and asking for monthly progress reports describing \u201cin what manner you employ every hour in the day\u201d); see also 3 Dictionary ofVirginia Biography 29 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">Jefferson\u2019s rigorous management of his charges was not uncommon. \u201c[M]uch evidence indicates that mothers and fathers both believed in giving their children a strict upbringing, enforcing obedience to their commands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>and stressing continued subjection to the parental will.\u201d Norton 96. Two parenting books published in the 1830\u2019s gave prototypical advice. In The Mother\u2019s Book, Lydia Child advised that \u201c[t]he first and most important step in management is, that whatever a mother says, always <em>must </em>be done.\u201d Child 26. John Abbott, the author of The Mother at Home, likewise advised that \u201c[o]bedience is absolutely essential to proper family government.\u201d Abbott 18. Echoing Locke, Abbott warned that parents who indulged a child\u2019s \u201cfoolish and unreasonable</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">[564 U.S. 830]</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">wishes\u201d would doom that child to be indulgent in adulthood. <em>Id., </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The concept of total parental control over children\u2019s lives extended into the schools. \u201cThe government both of families and schools should be absolute,\u201d declared Noah Webster. Rudolph 57-58. Dr. Benjamin Rush concurred: \u201cIn the education of youth, let the authority of our masters be as <em>absolute </em>as possible.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 16. Through the doctrine of <em>in loco parentis, </em>teachers assumed the \u201c \u2018sacred dut[y] of parents ... to train up and qualify their children\u2019 \u201d and exercised the same authority \u201c \u2018to command obedience, to control stubbornness, to quicken diligence, and to reform bad habits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Frederick, </em>551 U.S. 393, 413-414, 127 S. Ct. 2618, 168 L. Ed. 2d 290 (2007) (Thomas, J., concurring) (quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Pendergrass, </em>19 N.C. 365, 365-366 (1837)); see also Wishy 73. Thus, the quality of teachers and schools had to \u201cbe watched with the most scrupulous attention.\u201d Webster, in Rudolph 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">For their part, children were expected to be dutiful and obedient. Mintz &amp; Kellogg 53; Wishy 31; cf. J. Kett, Rites of Passage 45 (1977). Schoolbooks instructed children to do so and frequently featured vignettes illustrating the consequences of disobedience. See Adams, \u201cPictures of the Vicious ultimately overcome by misery and shame\u201d: The Cultural Work of Early National Schoolbooks (hereinafter Adams), in Marten 156. One oft-related example was the hangings of 19 alleged witches in 1692, which, the schoolbooks noted, likely began with false complaints by two young girls. See J. Morse, The American Geography 191 (1789); see also Adams, in Marten 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">An entire genre of books, \u201cloosely termed \u2018advice to youth,\u2019 \u201d taught similar lessons well into the 1800\u2019s. J. Demos, Circles and Lines: The Shape of Life in Early America 73 (2004); cf. Wishy 54. \u201cNext to your duty to God,\u201d advised one book, \u201cis your duty to your parents,\u201d even if the child did not \u201cunderstand the reason of their commands.\u201d L. Sigourney, The Girl\u2019s Reading Book 44 (14th ed.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">[564 U.S. 831]</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">1843); see also Filial Duty Recommended and Enforced, Introduction, p. iii (c. 1798); The Parent\u2019s Present 44 (3d ed. 1841). \u201cDisobedience is generally punished in some way or other,\u201d warned another, \u201cand often very severely.\u201d S. Goodrich, Peter Parley\u2019s Book of Fables 43 (1836); see also The Country School-House 27 (1848) (\u201c[T]he number of children who die from the effects of disobedience to their parents is very large\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b781-14\">Society\u2019s concern with children\u2019s development extended to the books they read. \u201cVice always spreads by being published,\u201d Noah Webster observed. Rudolph 62. \u201c[Y]oung people are taught many vices by fiction, books, or public exhibitions, vices which they never would have known had they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>never read such books or attended such public places.\u201d <em>Ibid.; </em>see also Cardell, p. xii (cautioning parents that \u201c[t]he first reading lessons for children have an extensive influence on the acquisitions and habits of future years\u201d); Youth\u2019s Companion 1 (\u201c[T]he capacities of children, and the peculiar situation and duties of youth, require select and appropriate reading\u201d). Prominent children\u2019s authors harshly criticized fairy tales and the use of anthropomorphic animals. See, <em>e.g., </em>S. Goodrich, 2 Recollections of a Lifetime 320, n.* (1856) (describing fairy tales as \u201ccalculated to familiarize the mind with things shocking and monstrous; to cultivate a taste for tales of bloodshed and violence; to teach the young to use coarse language, and cherish vulgar ideas; . . . and to fill [the youthful mind] with the horrors of a debased and debauched fancy\u201d); 1 <em>id., </em>at 167 (recalling that children\u2019s books were \u201cfull of nonsense\u201d and \u201clies\u201d); Cardell, p. xiv (\u201cThe fancy of converting inferior animals into \u2018teachers of children,\u2019 has been carried to ridiculous extravagance\u201d); see also MacDonald 83, 103 (noting that fables and works of fantasy were not popular in America in the 1700\u2019s).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Adults carefully controlled what they published for children. Stories written for children were dedicated to moral</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">[564 U.S. 832]</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">instruction and were relatively austere, lacking details that might titillate children\u2019s minds. See MacLeod 24-25, 42-48; see also <em>id., </em>at 42 (\u201cThe authors of juvenile fiction imposed the constraints upon themselves in the name of duty, and for the sake of giving to children what they thought children should have, although they were often well aware that children might prefer more exciting fare\u201d); Francis, American Children\u2019s Literature, 1646-1880, in American Childhood 208-209 (J. Hawes &amp; N. Hiner eds. 1985). John Newbery, the publisher often credited with creating the genre of children\u2019s literature, removed traditional folk characters, like Tom Thumb, from their original stories and placed them in new morality tales in which good children were rewarded and disobedient children punished. Reinier 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">Parents had total authority over what their children read. See A. MacLeod, American Childhood 177 (1994) (\u201cIdeally, if not always actually, nineteenth-century parents regulated their children\u2019s lives fully, certainly including their reading\u201d). Lydia Child put it bluntly in The Mother\u2019s Book: \u201cChildren . . . should not read anything without a mother\u2019s knowledge and sanction; this is particularly necessary between the ages of twelve and sixteen.\u201d Child 92; see also <em>id., </em>at 143 (\u201c[P]arents, or some guardian friends, should carefully examine every volume they put into the hands of young people\u201d); E. Monaghan, Learning To Read and Write in Colonial America 337 (2005) (reviewing a 12-year-old girl\u2019s journal from the early 1770\u2019s and noting that the child\u2019s aunts monitored and guided her reading).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">5</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">The law at the time reflected the founding generation\u2019s understanding of parent-child relations. According to Sir William Blackstone, parents were responsible for maintaining, protecting, and educating their children, and therefore had \u201cpower\u201d over their children. 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England 434, 440-441 (1765); cf. <em>Washington </em>v.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">[564 U.S. 833]</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\"><em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. 702, 712, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 117 S. Ct. 2302, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1997) (Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries was \u201ca primary legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>authority for 18th- and 19th-century American lawyers\u201d). Chancellor James Kent agreed. 2 Commentaries on American Law *189-*207. The law entitled parents to \u201cthe custody of their [children],\u201d \u201cthe value of th[e] [children\u2019s] labor and services,\u201d and the \u201cright to the exercise of such discipline as may be requisite for the discharge of their sacred trust.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at *193, *203. Children, in turn, were charged with \u201cobedience and assistance during their own minority, and gratitude and reverance during the rest of their lives.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at *207.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">Thus, in case after case, courts made clear that parents had a right to the child\u2019s labor and services until the child reached majority. In 1810, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts explained, \u201cThere is no question but that a father, who is entitled to the services of his minor son, and for whom he is obliged to provide, may, at the common law, assign those services to others, for a consideration to enure to himself.\u201d <em>Day </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>7 Mass. 145, 147; see also <em>Benson </em>v. <em>Remington, </em>2 Mass. 113, 115 (1806) (opinion of Parsons, C. J.) (\u201cThe law is very well settled, that parents are under obligations to support their children, and that they are entitled to their earnings\u201d). Similarly, the Supreme Court of Judicature of New Hampshire noted that the right of parents to recover for the services of their child, while a minor, \u201ccannot be contested.\u201d <em>Gale </em>v. <em>Parrot, </em>1 N.H. 28, 29 (1817). And parents could bring tort suits against those who knowingly enticed a minor away from them. See, <em>e.g., Kirkpatrick </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>2 Brev. 276 (S. C. Constitutional Ct. 1809); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Tevis, </em>4 Litt. 25 (Ky. App. 1823).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Relatedly, boys could not enlist in the military without parental consent. Many of those who did so during the Revolutionary War found, after-wards, that their fathers were entitled to their military wages. See Cox, Boy Soldiers of the American Revolution, in Marten 21-24. And after the</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">[564 U.S. 834]</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">war, minors who enlisted without parental consent in violation of federal law could find themselves returned home on writs of habeas corpus issued at their parents\u2019 request. See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>24 F. Cas. 813 (No. 14,449) (CC Tenn. 1812); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callan, </em>6 Binn. 255 (Pa. 1814) <em>(per curiam).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">Laws also set age limits restricting marriage without parental consent. For example, from 1730 until at least 1849, Pennsylvania law required parental consent for the marriage of anyone under the age of 21. See 4 Statutes at Large of Pennsylvania 153 (J. Mitchell &amp; H. Flanders eds. 1897) (hereinafter Pa. Stats. at Large); General Laws of Pennsylvania 82-83 (J. Dunlop 2d ed. 1849) (including the 1730 marriage law with no amendments); see also Perpetual Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 253 (1788), in The First Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (J. Cushing ed. 1981). In general, \u201c[p]ost-Revolutionary marriage law assumed that below a certain age, children could . . . no[t] intellectually understand its significance.\u201d Grossberg 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">Indeed, the law imposed age limits on all manner of activities that required judgment and reason. Children could not vote, could not serve on juries, and generally could not be witnesses in criminal cases unless they were older than 14. See Brewer 43, 145, 148, 159. Nor could they swear loyalty to a State. See, <em>e.g., </em>9 Pa. Stats, at Large 111 (1903 ed.). Early federal laws granting aliens the abil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>ity to become citizens provided that those under 21 were deemed citizens if their fathers chose to naturalize. See, <em>e.g., </em>Act of Mar. 26, 1790, 1 Stat. 104; Act of Jan. 29, 1795, ch. 20, 1 Stat. 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The history clearly shows a founding generation that believed parents to have complete authority over their minor children and expected parents to direct the development of those children. The Puritan tradition in New England laid the foundation of American parental authority and duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">[564 U.S. 835]</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">See MacDonald 6 (\u201cThe Puritans are virtually the inventors of the family as we know it today\u201d). In the decades leading up to and following the Revolution, the conception of the child\u2019s mind evolved but the duty and authority of parents remained. Indeed, society paid closer attention to potential influences on children than before. See Mintz 72 (\u201cBy weakening earlier forms of patriarchal authority, the Revolution enhanced the importance of childrearing and education in ensuring social stability\u201d). Teachers and schools came under scrutiny, and children\u2019s reading material was carefully supervised. Laws reflected these concerns and often supported parental authority with the coercive power of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">In light of this history, the Framers could not possibly have understood \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d to include an unqualified right to speak to minors. Specifically, I am sure that the founding generation would not have understood \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d to include a right to speak to children without going through their parents. As a consequence, I do not believe that laws limiting such speech\u2014for example, by requiring parental consent to speak to a minor\u2014\u201cabridg[e] the freedom of speech\u201d within the original meaning of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">We have recently noted that this Court does not have \u201cfreewheeling authority to declare new categories of speech outside the scope of the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Stevens, </em>559 U.S., at 472, 130 S. Ct. 1577, 176 L. Ed. 2d 435. But we also recognized that there may be \u201csome categories of speech that have been historically unprotected [and] have not yet been specifically identified or discussed as such in our case law.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In my opinion, the historical evidence here plainly reveals one such category.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-12\">[564 U.S. 836]</p>\n<p id=\"b784-13\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b784-14\">Admittedly, the original public understanding of a constitutional provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>sion does not always comport with modern sensibilities. See <em>Morse, </em>551 U.S., at 419, 127 S. Ct. 2618, 168 L. Ed. 2d 290 (Thomas, J., concurring) (treating students \u201cas though it were still the 19th century would find little support today\u201d). It may also be inconsistent with precedent. See <em>McDonald, </em>561 U.S., at 851-855, 130 S. Ct. 3020, 177 L. Ed. 2d 894 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (rejecting the <em>Slaughter-House Cases, </em>16 Wall. 36, 21 L. Ed. 394 (1873), as inconsistent with the original public meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">This, however, is not such a case. Although much has changed in this country since the Revolution, the notion that parents have authority over their children and that the law can support that authority persists today. For example, at least some States make it a crime to lure or entice a minor away from the minor\u2019s parent. See, <em>e.g., </em>Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 272(b)(1) (West 2008); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 787.03 (2010). Every State in the Union still establishes a minimum age for marriage without parental or judicial consent. Cf. <em>Roper </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>543 U.S. 551, 558, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2005) (Appendix D to opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">[564 U.S. 837]</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">of the Court). Individuals less than 18 years old cannot enlist in the military without parental consent. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 505(a). And minors remain subject to curfew laws across the country, see Brief for State of Louisiana et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>16, and cannot unilaterally consent to most medical procedures, <em>id., </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Moreover, there are many things minors today cannot do at all, whether they have parental consent or not. State laws set minimum ages for voting and jury duty. See <em>Roper, supra, </em>at 581-585, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1 (Appendixes B and C to opinion of the Court). In California (the State at issue here), minors cannot drive for hire or drive a school bus, Cal. Veh. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 12515, 12516 (West 2010), purchase tobacco, Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 308(b) (West 2008), play bingo for money, \u00a7 326.5(e), or execute a will, Cal. Prob. Code Ann. \u00a7 6220 (West 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">My understanding of \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d is also consistent with this Court\u2019s precedents. To be sure, the Court has held that children are entitled to the protection of the First Amendment, see, <em>e.g., Erznoznik </em>v. <em>Jacksonville, </em>422 U.S. 205, 212-213, 95 S. Ct. 2268, 45 L. Ed. 2d 125 (1975), and the government may not unilaterally dictate what children can say or hear, see <em>id., </em>at 213-214, 95 S. Ct. 2268, 45 L.

But this Court has never held, until today, that \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d includes a right to speak to minors (or a right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors\u2019 parents.

I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">Under any of this Court\u2019s standards for a facial First Amendment challenge, this one must fail. The video game associations cannot show \u201cthat no set of circumstances exists under which [the law] would be valid,\u201d \u201cthat the statute lacks any plainly legitimate sweep,\u201d or that \u201ca substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d <em>Stevens, </em>559 U.S., at 472, 473, 130 S. Ct. 1577, 176 L. Ed. 2d 435 (internal quotation marks omitted). Even assuming that video games are speech, in most applications the California law does not implicate the First Amendment. All that the law does is prohibit the direct sale or rental of a violent video game to a minor by someone other than the minor\u2019s parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or legal guardian. Where a minor has a parent or guardian, as is usually true, the law does not prevent that minor from obtaining a violent video game with his parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s help. In the typical case, the only speech affected is speech that bypasses a minor\u2019s parent or guardian. Because such speech does not fall within \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d as originally understood, California\u2019s law does not ordinarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>implicate the First Amendment and is not facially unconstitutional.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAL4k\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"58\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAV4AAAA6AQAAAADQQgxPAAAAm0lEQVR4nGP8z0A0+MtEvFoGhlHFo4oJKv6HLIqDA1f8G1keB4f2bv7f+AQhiIsDU/zvCJIJuDgwxUwPHiBZh4MDU8xYcAYhj4sD92DyBySrcXAYYUXBT3YkeewcRFFwtgFJHgcHrtiDA0keBwcezgI2CGlcHHg4Kygg5HFxYIqZbUQQ8rg45IUGMYAkxYyj5fOo4lHFo4oHjWIAD807HxtqFHkAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"350\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">\u201cThe freedom of speech,\u201d as originally understood, does not include a right to speak to minors without going through the minors\u2019 parents or guardians.

I believe it is clear that the founding public would not have understood \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d to include speech to minor children bypassing their parents.

Representatives of the video game and software industries, claiming that the statute violates the First Amendment on its face, seek an injunction against its enforcement.

Ct. 1577, 176 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, it is more difficult to mount a facial First Amendment attack on a statute that seeks to regulate activity that involves action as well as speech. See <em>Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 614-615, 93 S. Ct. 2908, 37 L. Ed. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>830 (1973). Hence, I shall focus here upon an area within which I believe the State can legitimately apply its statute, namely, sales to minors under the age of 17 (the age cutoff used by the industry\u2019s own ratings system), of highly realistic violent video games, which a reasonable game maker would know meet the Act\u2019s criteria. That area lies at the heart of the statute. I shall assume that the number of instances in which the State will enforce the statute within that area is comparatively large, and that the number outside that area (for example, sales to 17-year-olds) is comparatively small. And the activity the statute regulates combines speech with action (a virtual form of target practice).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">In determining whether the statute is unconstitutional, I would apply both this Court\u2019s \u201cvagueness\u201d precedents and a strict form of First Amendment scrutiny. In doing so, the special First Amendment category I find relevant is not (as the Court claims) the category of \u201cdepictions of violence,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 795, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 718, but rather the category of \u201cprotection of children.\u201d This Court has held that the \u201cpower of the state to control the conduct of children reaches beyond the scope of its authority over adults.\u201d <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>321 U.S. 158, 170, 64 S. Ct. 438, 88 L. Ed. 645 (1944). And the \u201c \u2018regulado [n] of communication</p>\n<p id=\"aar-dedup-1\">[564 U.S. 842]</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">addressed to [children] need not conform to the requirements of the [F]irst [A]mendment in the same way as those applicable to adults.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ginsberg </em>v. <em>New York, </em>390 U.S. 629, 638, n. 6, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195 (1968) (quoting Emerson, Toward a General Theory of the First Amendment, 72 Yale L. J. 877, 939 (1963)).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">The majority\u2019s claim that the California statute, if upheld, would create a \u201cnew categor[y] of unprotected speech,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 791, 794, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 715, 717, is overstated. No one here argues that depictions of violence, even extreme violence, <em>automatically </em>fall outside the First Amendment\u2019s protective scope as, for example, do obscenity and depictions of child pornography. We properly speak of <em>categories </em>of expression that lack protection when, like \u201cchild pornography,\u201d the category is broad, when it applies automatically, and when the State can prohibit everyone, including adults, from obtaining access to the material within it. But where, as here, careful analysis must precede a narrower judicial conclusion (say, denying protection to a shout of \u201cfire\u201d falsely made in a crowded theater, or to an effort to teach a terrorist group how to peacefully petition the United Nations), we do not normally describe the result as creating a \u201cnew category of unprotected speech.\u201d See <em>Schenck </em>v. <em>United States, </em>249 U.S. 47, 52, 39 S. Ct. 247, 63 L. Ed. 470 (1919); <em>Holder </em>v. <em>Humanitarian Law Project, </em>561 U.S. 1, 130 S. Ct. 2705, 177 L. Ed. 2d 355 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">Thus, in <em>Stevens, </em>after rejecting the claim that <em>all </em>depictions of animal cruelty (a category) fall outside the First Amendment\u2019s protective scope, we went on to decide whether the particular statute at issue violates the First Amendment under traditional standards; and we held that, because the statute was overly broad, it was invalid. Similarly, here the issue is whether, applying traditional First Amendment standards, this statute does, or does not, pass muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">In my view, California\u2019s statute provides \u201cfair notice of what is prohib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>ited,\u201d and consequently it is not impermissibly vague. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>553 U.S. 285, 304, 128 S. Ct. 1830, 170 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">[564 U.S. 843]</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\"><em>Ginsberg </em>explains why that is so. The Court there considered a New York law that forbade the sale to minors of a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-6\">\u201cpicture, photograph, drawing, sculpture, motion picture film, or similar visual representation or image of a person or portion of the human body which depicts nudity</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">\n<em>that</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-8\">\u201cpredominately appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid interest of minors,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">\n<em>and</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-10\">\u201cis patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">\n<em>and</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-12\">\u201cis utterly without redeeming social importance for minors.\u201d 390 U.S., at 646-647, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">This Court upheld the New York statute in <em>Ginsberg </em>(which is sometimes unfortunately confused with a very different, earlier case, <em>Ginzburg </em>v. <em>United States, </em>383 U.S. 463, 86 S. Ct. 942, 16 L. Ed. 2d 31 (1966)). The five-Justice majority, in an opinion written by Justice Brennan, wrote that the statute was sufficiently clear. 390 U.S., at 643-645, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195. No Member of the Court voiced any vagueness objection. See <em>id., </em>at 648-650, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195 (Stewart, J., concurring in result); <em>id., </em>at 650-671, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195 (Douglas, J., joined by Black, J., dissenting); <em>id., </em>at 671-675, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195 (Fortas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-15\">Comparing the language of California\u2019s statute (set forth <em>supra, </em>at 840, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 745) with the language of New York\u2019s statute (set forth immediately above), it is difficult to find any vagueness-related difference. Why are the words \u201ckill,\u201d \u201cmaim,\u201d and \u201cdismember\u201d any more difficult to understand than the word \u201cnudity?\u201d Justice Alito objects that these words do \u201cnot perform the narrowing function\u201d that this Court has required in adult obscenity cases, where statutes</p>\n<p id=\"a1y-dedup-0\">[564 U.S. 844]</p>\n<p id=\"b789-16\">can only cover \u201c \u2018hard core\u2019 \u201d depictions. <em>Ante, </em>at 810, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 727 (opinion concurring in judgment). But the relevant comparison is not to adult obscenity cases but to <em>Ginsberg, </em>which dealt with \u201cnudity,\u201d a category no more \u201cnarrow\u201d than killing and maiming. And in any event, <em>narrowness </em>and <em>vagueness </em>do not necessarily have anything to do with one another. All that is required for vagueness purposes is that the terms \u201ckill,\u201d \u201cmaim,\u201d and \u201cdismember\u201d give fair notice as to what they cover, which they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-18\">The remainder of California\u2019s definition copies, almost word for word, the language this Court used in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1973), in permitting a <em>total ban </em>on material that satisfied its definition (one enforced with <em>criminal </em>penalties). The California law\u2019s reliance on \u201ccommunity standards\u201d adheres to <em>Miller, </em>and in <em>Fort Wayne Books, Inc. </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em>489 U.S. 46, 57-58, 109 S. Ct. 916, 103 L. Ed. 2d 34 (1989), this Court specifically upheld the use of <em>Miller\u2019s </em>language against charges of vagueness. California only departed from the <em>Miller </em>formulation in two signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>cant respects: It substituted the word \u201cdeviant\u201d for the words \u201cprurient\u201d and \u201cshameful,\u201d and it three times added the words \u201cfor minors.\u201d The word \u201cdeviant\u201d differs from \u201cprurient\u201d and \u201cshameful,\u201d but it would seem no less suited to defining and narrowing the reach of the statute. And the addition of \u201cfor minors\u201d to a version of the <em>Miller </em>standard was approved in <em>Ginsberg, supra, </em>at 643, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195, even though the New York law \u201cdr[ew] no distinction between young children and adolescents who are nearing the age of majority,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 812, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 728 (opinion of Alito, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Both the <em>Miller </em>standard and the law upheld in <em>Ginsberg </em>lack perfect clarity. But that fact reflects the difficulty of the Court\u2019s long search for words capable of protecting expression without depriving the State of a legitimate constitutional power to regulate. As is well known, at one point Justice Stewart thought he could do no better in defining obscenity than, \u201cI know it when I see it.\u201d <em>Jacobellis </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>378 U.S. 184, 197, 84 S. Ct. 1676, 12 L. Ed. 2d 793 (1964) (concurring opinion). And Justice</p>\n<p id=\"AboH\">[564 U.S. 845]</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Douglas dissented from <em>Miller\u2019s </em>standard, which he thought was still too vague. 413 U.S., at 39-40, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419. Ultimately, however, this Court accepted the \u201ccommunity standards\u201d tests used in <em>Miller </em>and <em>Ginsberg. </em>They reflect the fact that sometimes, even when a precise standard proves elusive, it is easy enough to identify instances that fall within a legitimate regulation. And they seek to draw a line, which, while favoring free expression, will nonetheless permit a legislature to find the words necessary to accomplish a legitimate constitutional objective. Cf. <em>Williams, </em>553 U.S., at 304, 128 S. Ct. 1830, 170 L. Ed. 2d 650 (the Constitution does not always require \u201c \u2018perfect clarity and precise guidance,\u2019 \u201d even when \u201c \u2018expressive activity\u2019 \u201d is involved).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">What, then, is the difference between <em>Ginsberg </em>and <em>Miller </em>on the one hand and the California law on the other? It will often be easy to pick out cases at which California\u2019s statute directly aims, involving, say, a character who shoots out a police officer\u2019s knee, douses him with gasoline, lights him on fire, urinates on his burning body, and finally kills him with a gunshot to the head. (Footage of one such game sequence has been submitted in the record.) See also <em>ante, </em>at 818-819, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 732-733 (opinion of Alito, J.). As in <em>Miller </em>and <em>Ginsberg, </em>the California law clearly <em>protects </em>even the most violent games that possess serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. \u00a7 1746(d)(1)(A)(iii). And it is easier here than in <em>Miller </em>or <em>Ginsberg </em>to separate the sheep from the goats at the statute\u2019s border. That is because here the industry itself has promulgated standards and created a review process, in which adults who \u201ctypically have experience with children\u201d assess what games are inappropriate for minors. See Entertainment Software Rating Board, Rating Process, online at http://www.esrb.org/ ratings/, process.jsp (all Internet materials as visited June 24, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">There is, of course, one obvious difference: The <em>Ginsberg </em>statute concerned depictions of \u201cnudity,\u201d while California\u2019s statute concerns extremely violent video games. But for</p>\n<p id=\"AMAl\">[564 U.S. 846]</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">purposes of vagueness, why should that matter? Justice Alito argues that the <em>Miller </em>standard sufficed because there are \u201ccertain generally accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>norms concerning expression related to sex,\u201d whereas there are no similarly \u201caccepted standards regarding the suitability of violent entertainment.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 811-812, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 728. But there is no evidence that is so. The Court relied on \u201ccommunity standards\u201d in <em>Miller </em>precisely because of the difficulty of articulating \u201caccepted norms\u201d about depictions of sex. I can find no difference\u2014historical or otherwise\u2014that is <em>relevant </em>to the vagueness question. Indeed, the majority\u2019s examples of literary descriptions of violence, on which Justice Ah to relies, do not show anything relevant at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">After all, one can find in literature as many (if not more) descriptions of physical love as descriptions of violence. Indeed, sex \u201chas been a theme in art and literature throughout the ages.\u201d <em>Ashcroft </em>v. <em>Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. 234, 246, 122 S. Ct. 1389, 152 L. Ed. 2d 403 (2002). For every Homer, there is a Titian. For every Dante, there is an Ovid. And for all the teenagers who have read the original versions of Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales, I suspect there are those who know the story of Lady Godiva.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Thus, I can find no meaningful vagueness-related differences between California\u2019s law and the New York law upheld in <em>Ginsberg. </em>And if there remain any vagueness problems, the state courts can cure them through interpretation. See <em>Erznoznik </em>v. <em>Jacksonville, </em>422 U.S. 205, 216, 95 S. Ct. 2268, 45 L. Ed. 2d 125 (1975) (\u201cstate statute should not be deemed facially invalid unless it is not readily subject to a narrowing construction by the state courts\u201d). Cf. <em>Ginsberg, </em>390 U.S., at 644, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195 (relying on the fact that New York Court of Appeals would read a knowledge requirement into the statute); <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Santa Barbara, </em>40 Cal. App. 4th 1075, 1088-1089, 47 Cal. Rptr. 2d 661, 669 (1995) (reading a knowledge requirement into a statute). Consequently, for purposes of this facial challenge, I would not find the statute unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">[564 U.S. 847]</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">Video games combine physical action with expression. Were physical activity to predominate in a game, government could appropriately intervene, say by requiring parents to accompany children when playing a game involving actual target practice, or restricting the sale of toys presenting physical dangers to children. See generally Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, 122 Stat. 3016 (\u201cTitle I\u2014Children\u2019s Product Safety\u201d). But because video games also embody important expressive and artistic elements, I agree with the Court that the First Amendment significantly limits the State\u2019s power to regulate. And I would determine whether the State has exceeded those limits by applying a strict standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">Like the majority, I believe that the California law must be \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to further a \u201ccompelling interest,\u201d without there being a \u201cless restrictive\u201d alternative that would be \u201cat least as effective.\u201d <em>Reno </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, </em>521 U.S. 844, 874, 875, 879, 117 S. Ct. 2329, 138 L. Ed. 2d 874 (1997). I would not apply this strict standard \u201cmechanically.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., </em>529 U.S. 803, 841, 120 S. Ct. 1878, 146 L. Ed. 2d 865 (2000) (Breyer, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and O\u2019Connor and Scalia, JJ., dissenting). Rather, in applying it, I would evaluate the degree to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>which the statute injures speech-related interests, the nature of the potentially justifying \u201ccompelling interests,\u201d the degree to which the statute furthers that interest, the nature and effectiveness of possible alternatives, and, in light of this evaluation, whether, overall, \u201cthe statute works speech-related harm .. . out of proportion to the benefits that the statute seeks to provide.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See also <em>Burson </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>504 U.S. 191, 210, 112 S. Ct. 1846, 119 L. Ed. 2d 5 (1992) (plurality opinion) (applying strict scrutiny and finding relevant the lack of a \u201csignificant impingement\u201d on speech).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">First Amendment standards applied in this way are difficult but not impossible to satisfy. Applying \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">[564 U.S. 848]</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">the Court has upheld restrictions on speech that, for example, ban the teaching of peaceful dispute resolution to a group on the State Department\u2019s list of terrorist organizations, <em>Holder, </em>561 U.S., at 27-39, 130 S. Ct. 2705, 177 L. Ed. 2d 355; but cf. <em>id., </em>at 41, 130 S. Ct. 2705, 177 L. Ed. 2d 355 (Breyer, J., dissenting), and limit speech near polling places, <em>Burson, supra, </em>at 210-211, 112 S. Ct. 1846, 119 L. Ed. 2d 5 (plurality opinion). And applying less clearly defined but still rigorous standards, the Court has allowed States to require disclosure of petition signers, <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>561 U.S. 186, 130 S. Ct. 2811, 177 L. Ed. 2d 493 (2010), and to impose campaign contribution limits that were \u201c \u2018closely drawn\u2019 to match a \u2018sufficiently important interest,\u2019 \u201d <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Shrink Missouri Government PAC, </em>528 U.S. 377, 387-388, 120 S. Ct. 897, 145 L. Ed. 2d 886 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Moreover, although the Court did not specify the \u201clevel of scrutiny\u201d it applied in <em>Ginsberg, </em>we have subsequently described that case as finding a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d in protecting children from harm sufficient to justify limitations on speech. See <em>Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>492 U.S. 115, 126, 109 S. Ct. 2829, 106 L. Ed. 2d 93 (1989). Since the Court in <em>Ginsberg </em>specified that the statute\u2019s prohibition applied to material that was <em>not </em>obscene, 390 U.S., at 634, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195, I cannot dismiss <em>Ginsberg </em>on the ground that it concerned obscenity. But cf. <em>ante, </em>at 793-794, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 716-717 (majority opinion). Nor need I depend upon the fact that the Court in <em>Ginsberg </em>insisted only that the legislature have a \u201crational\u201d basis for finding the depictions there at issue harmful to children. 390 U.S., at 639, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195. For in this case, California has substantiated its claim of harm with considerably stronger evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">California\u2019s law imposes no more than a modest restriction on expression. The statute prevents no one from playing a video game, it prevents no adult from buying a video game, and it prevents no child or adolescent from obtaining a game provided a parent is willing to help. \u00a7 1746.1(c). All it prevents is a child or adolescent from buying, without a parent\u2019s assistance, a gruesomely violent video game of a kind that</p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">[564 U.S. 849]</p>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">the industry <em>itself </em>tells us it wants to keep out of the hands of those under the age of 17. See Brief for Respondents 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-13\">Nor is the statute, if upheld, likely to create a precedent that would adversely affect other media, say, films, or videos, or books. A typical video game involves a significant amount of physical activity. See <em>ante, </em>at 817-818, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 731-732 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>(citing examples of the increasing interactivity of video game controllers). And pushing buttons that achieve an interactive, virtual form of target practice (using images of human beings as targets), while containing an expressive component, is not just like watching a typical movie. See <em>infra, </em>at 853, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The interest that California advances in support of the statute is compelling. As this Court has previously described that interest, it consists of both (1) the \u201cbasic\u201d parental claim \u201cto authority in their own household to direct the rearing of their children,\u201d which makes it proper to enact \u201claws designed to aid discharge of [parental] responsibility,\u201d and (2) the State\u2019s \u201cindependent interest in the well-being of its youth.\u201d <em>Ginsberg, </em>390 U.S., at 639-640, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195. Cf. <em>id., </em>at 639, n. 7, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195 (\u201c \u2018[O]ne can well distinguish laws which do not impose a morality on children, but which support the right of parents to deal with the morals of their children as they see fit\u2019 \u201d (quoting Henkin, Morals and the Constitution: The Sin of Obscenity, 63 Colum. L. Rev. 391, 413, n. 68 (1963))). And where these interests work in tandem, it is not fatally \u201cunderinclusive\u201d for a State to advance its interests in protecting children against the special harms present in an interactive video game medium through a default rule that still allows parents to provide their children with what their parents wish.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Both interests are present here. As to the need to help parents guide their children, the Court noted in 1968 that</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">[564 U.S. 850]</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">\u201c \u2018parental control or guidance cannot always be provided.\u2019 \u201d 390 U.S., at 640, 88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195. Today, 5.3 million grade-school-age children of working parents are routinely home alone. See Dept, of Commerce, Census Bureau, Who\u2019s Minding the Kids? Child Care Arrangements: Spring 2005/Summer 2006, p. 12 (2010), online at http:// www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p70-121.pdf. Thus, it has, if anything, become more important to supplement parents\u2019 authority to guide their children\u2019s development.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">As to the State\u2019s independent interest, we have pointed out that juveniles are more likely to show a \u201c \u2018lack of maturity\u2019 \u201d and are \u201cmore vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures,\u201d and that their \u201ccharacter ... is not as well formed as that of an adult.\u201d <em>Roper </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>543 U.S. 551, 569-570, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2005). And we have therefore recognized \u201ca compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors.\u201d <em>Sable Communications, supra, </em>at 126, 109 S. Ct. 2829, 106 L. Ed. 2d 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">At the same time, there is considerable evidence that California\u2019s statute significantly furthers this compelling interest. That is, in part, because video games are excellent teaching tools. Learning a practical task often means developing habits, becoming accustomed to performing the task, and receiving positive reinforcement when performing that task well. Video games can help develop habits, accustom the player to performance of the task, and reward the player for performing that task well. Why else would the Armed Forces incorporate video games into its training? See CNN, War Games: Military Training Goes High-Tech (Nov. 22, 2001), on<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>line at http://articles.cnn.com/2001-ll-2/tech/2war.games_l_ict-bill-swartout-r eal-world-training?_s=PM:TE C H.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">When the military uses video games to help soldiers train for missions, it is using this medium for a beneficial purpose. But California argues that when the teaching features of video games are put to less desirable ends, harm can ensue.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">[564 U.S. 851]</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">In particular, extremely violent games can harm children by rewarding them for being violently aggressive in play, and thereby often teaching them to be violently aggressive in life. And video games can cause more harm in this respect than can typically passive media, such as books or films or television programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">There are many scientific studies that support California\u2019s views. Social scientists, for example, have found <em>causal </em>evidence that playing these games results in harm. Longitudinal studies, which measure changes over time, have found that increased exposure to violent video games causes an increase in aggression over the same period. See Moller &amp; Krah\u00e9, Exposure to Violent Video Games and Aggression in German Adolescents: A Longitudinal Analysis, 35 Aggressive Behavior 75 (2009); Gentile &amp; Gentile, Violent Video Games as Exemplary Teachers: A Conceptual Analysis, 37 J.

Applied Developmental Psychology 286 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Experimental studies in laboratories have found that subjects randomly assigned to play a violent video game subsequently displayed more characteristics of aggression than those who played nonviolent games. See, <em>e.g., </em>Anderson et al., Violent Video Games: Specific Effects of Violent Content on Aggressive Thoughts and Behavior, 36 Advances in Experimental Soc. Psychology 199 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">Surveys of eighth and ninth grade students have found a correlation between playing violent video games and aggression. See, <em>e.g., </em>Gentile, Lynch, Linder, &amp; Walsh, The Effects of Violent Video Game Habits on Adolescent Hostility, Aggressive Behaviors, and School Performance, 27 J. Adolescence 5 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">[564 U.S. 852]</p>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">Cutting-edge neuroscience has shown that \u201cvirtual violence in video game playing results in those neural patterns that are considered characteristic for aggressive cognition and behavior.\u201d Weber, Ritterfeld, &amp; Mathiak, Does Playing Violent Video Games Induce Aggression? Empirical Evidence of a Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study, 8 Media Psychology 39, 51 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-13\">And \u201cmeta-analyses,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>studies of all the studies, have concluded that exposure to violent video games \u201cwas positively associated with aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, and aggressive affect,\u201d and that \u201cplaying violent video games is a <em>causal </em>risk factor for long-term harmful outcomes.\u201d Anderson et al., Violent Video Game Effects on Aggression, Empathy, and Prosocial Behavior in Eastern and Western Countries: A Meta-Analytic Review, 136 Psychological Bull. 151, 167, 169 (2010) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-14\">Some of these studies take care to explain in a common-sense way why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>video games are potentially more harmful than, say, films or books or television. In essence, they say that the closer a child\u2019s behavior comes, not to watching, but to <em>acting </em>out horrific violence, the greater the potential psychological harm. See Bushman &amp; Huesmann, Aggression, in 2 Handbook of Social Psychology 833, 851 (S. Fiske, D. Gilbert, &amp; G. Lindzey eds., 5th ed. 2010) (video games stimulate more aggression because \u201c[p]eople learn better when they are actively involved,\u201d players are \u201cmore likely to identify with violent characters,\u201d and \u201cviolent games directly reward violent behavior\u201d); Polman, de Castro, &amp; van Aken, Experimental Study of the Differential Effects of Playing Versus Watching Violent Video Games on Children\u2019s Aggressive Behavior, 34 Aggressive Behavior 256 (2008) (finding greater aggression resulting from playing, as opposed to watching, a violent game); C. Anderson, D. Gentile, &amp; K. Buckley, Violent Video Game Effects on Children and Adolescents 136-137 (2007) (three studies finding greater effects from games as opposed to television). See also <em>infra,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">[564 U.S. 853]</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">at 854-855, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 753-754 (statements of expert public health associations agreeing that interactive games can be more harmful than \u201cpassive\u201d media like television); <em>ante, </em>at 816-821, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 730-733 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Experts debate the conclusions of all these studies. Like many, perhaps most, studies of human behavior, each study has its critics, and some of those critics have produced studies of their own in which they reach different conclusions. (I list both sets of research in the appendixes.) I, like most judges, lack the social science expertise to say definitively who is right. But associations of public health professionals who do possess that expertise have reviewed many of these studies and found a significant risk that violent video games, when compared with more passive media, are particularly likely to cause children harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">Eleven years ago, for example, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Psychological Association, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Psychiatric Association released a joint statement, which said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-10\">\u201c[0]ver 1000 studies . . . point overwhelmingly to a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children . . . [and, though less research had been done at that time, preliminary studies indicated that] the impact of violent interactive entertainment (video games and other interactive media) on young people . . . may be <em>significantly more severe </em>than that wrought by television, movies, or music.\u201d Joint Statement on the Impact of Entertainment Violence on Children (2000) (emphasis added), online at http://www.aap.org/ advocacy/releases/jstmtevc.htm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">Five years later, after more research had been done, the American Psychological Association adopted a resolution that said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-12\">[564 U.S. 854]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-13\">\u201c[C]omprehensive analysis of violent interactive video game research suggests such exposure . . . increases aggressive behavior, . . . increases aggressive thoughts, . . . increases angry feelings, . . . decreases helpful behavior, and . . . increases physiological arousal.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Resolution on Violence in Video Games and Interactive Media (2005), online at http://www.apa. org/about/governance/council/policy/ interactive-media.pdf.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The association added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">\u201c[T]he practice, repetition, and rewards for acts of violence may be <em>more conducive </em>to increasing aggressive behavior among children and youth than passively watching violence on TV and in films.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Four years after that, in 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a statement in significant part about interactive media. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-7\">\u201cStudies of these rapidly growing and ever-more-sophisticated types of media have indicated that the effects of child-initiated virtual violence may be <em>even more profound than those of passive media </em>such as television. In many games, the child or teenager is \u2018embedded\u2019 in the game and uses a \u2018joystick\u2019 (handheld controller) that enhances both the experience and the aggressive feelings.\u201d Policy Statement\u2014 Media Violence, 124 Pediatrics 1495, 1498 (2009) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">It added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-10\">\u201cCorrelational and experimental studies have revealed that violent video games lead to increases in aggressive behavior and aggressive thinking and decreases in prosocial behavior. Recent longitudinal studies ... have revealed that in as little as 3 months, high exposure to violent video games increased physical aggression.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-11\">[564 U.S. 855]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-12\">Other recent longitudinal studies . . . have revealed similar effects across 2 years.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">Unlike the majority, I would find sufficient grounds in these studies and expert opinions for this Court to defer to an elected legislature\u2019s conclusion that the video games in question are particularly likely to harm children. This Court has always thought it owed an elected legislature some degree of deference in respect to legislative facts of this kind, particularly when they involve technical matters that are beyond our competence, and even in First Amendment cases. See <em>Holder, </em>561 U.S., at 33-34, 130 S. Ct. 2705, 177 L. Ed. 2d 355 (deferring, while applying strict scrutiny, to the Government\u2019s national security judgments); <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>520 U.S. 180, 195-196, 117 S. Ct. 1174, 137 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1997) (deferring, while applying intermediate scrutiny, to the Government\u2019s technological judgments). The majority, in reaching its own, opposite conclusion about the validity of the relevant studies, grants the legislature no deference at all. Compare <em>ante, </em>at 800, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 720-721 (stating that the studies do not provide evidence that violent video games \u201ccause\u201d harm (emphasis deleted)), with <em>supra, </em>at 851, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 752 (citing longitudinal studies finding causation).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b796-15\">I can find no \u201cless restrictive\u201d alternative to California\u2019s law that would be \u201cat least as effective.\u201d See <em>Reno, </em>521 U.S., at 874, 117 S. Ct. 2329, 138 L. Ed. 2d 874. The majority points to a voluntary alternative: The industry tries to prevent those under 17 from buying extremely violent games by labeling those games with an \u201cM\u201d (Mature) and encouraging retailers to restrict their sales to those 17 and older. See <em>ante, </em>at 803, 180 L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>Ed. 2d, at 722-723. But this voluntary system has serious enforcement gaps. When California enacted its law, a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) study had found that nearly 70% of unaccompanied 13- to 16-year-olds were able to buy M-rated video games. FTC, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children 27 (2004), online at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2004/ 07/040708kidsviolencerpt.pdf.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">[564 U.S. 856]</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Subsequently the voluntary program has become more effective. But as of the FTC\u2019s most recent update to Congress, 20% of those under 17 are still able to buy M-rated video games, and, breaking down sales by store, one finds that this number rises to nearly 50% in the case of one large national chain. FTC, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children 28 (2009), online at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2009/ 12/P9945 llviolententertainment.pdf. And the industry could easily revert back to the substantial noncompliance that existed in 2004, particularly after today\u2019s broad ruling reduces the industry\u2019s incentive to police itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The industry also argues for an alternative technological solution, namely, \u201c[filtering at the console level.\u201d Brief for Respondents 53. But it takes only a quick search of the Internet to find guides explaining how to circumvent any such technological controls. YouTube viewers, for example, have watched one of those guides (called \u201cHow to bypass parental controls on the Xbox 360\u201d) more than 47,000 times. See http://www. youtube. com/watch?v=CFlVfVmvN 6k.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">The upshot is that California\u2019s statute, as applied to its heartland of applications <em>(i.e., </em>buyers under 17; extremely violent, realistic video games), imposes a restriction on speech that is modest at most. That restriction is justified by a compelling interest (supplementing parents\u2019 efforts to prevent their children from purchasing potentially harmful violent, interactive material). And there is no equally effective, less restrictive alternative. California\u2019s statute is consequently constitutional on its face\u2014though litigants remain free to challenge the statute as applied in particular instances, including any effort by the State to apply it to minors aged 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">I add that the majority\u2019s different conclusion creates a serious anomaly in First Amendment law. <em>Ginsberg </em>makes</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">[564 U.S. 857]</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">clear that a State can prohibit the sale to minors of depictions of nudity; today the Court makes clear that a State cannot prohibit the sale to minors of the most violent interactive video games. But what sense does it make to forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with an image of a nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13-year-old of an interactive video game in which he actively, but virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures and kills her? What kind of First Amendment would permit the government to protect children by restricting sales of that extremely violent video game <em>only </em>when the woman\u2014bound, gagged, tortured, and killed\u2014is also topless?</p>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">This anomaly is not compelled by the First Amendment. It disappears once one recognizes that extreme violence, where interactive, and <em>without literary, artistic, or similar justification, </em>can prove at least as, if not more, harmful to children as photographs of nudity. And the record here is more than adequate to support such a view. That is why I believe that <em>Ginsberg </em>controls the outcome here <em>a fortiori. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>And it is why I believe California\u2019s law is constitutional on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is about education. Our Constitution cannot succeed in securing the liberties it seeks to protect unless we can raise future generations committed cooperatively to making our system of government work. Education, however, is about choices. Sometimes, children need to learn by making choices for themselves. Other times, choices are made for children\u2014by their parents, by their teachers, and by the people acting democratically through their governments. In my view, the First Amendment does not disable government from helping parents make such a choice here\u2014a choice not to have their children buy extremely violent, interactive video games, which they more than reasonably fear pose only the risk of harm to those children.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">[564 U.S. 858]</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">APPENDIXES</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">With the assistance of the Supreme Court Library, I have compiled these two appendixes listing peer-reviewed academic journal articles on the topic of psychological harm resulting from playing violent video games. The library conducted a search for relevant articles on the following databases: PsycINFO, PubMed, Academic Search Premier, ArticleFirst (OCLC), and Dialog (files 1, 7, 34, 98, 121, 142, 144, 149). The following search terms were used: \u201c(video* or computer or arcade or online) and (game*) and (attack* or fight* or aggress* or vio-len* or hostil* or ang* or arous* or prosocial or help* or desens* or empathy).\u201d After eliminating irrelevant matches based on title or abstract, I categorized these articles as either supporting the hypothesis that violent video games are harmful (listed in Appendix A), or not supporting/ rejecting the hypothesis that violent video games are harmful (listed in Appendix B).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">Many, but not all, of these articles were available to the California Legislature or the parties in briefing this case. I list them because they suggest that there is substantial (though controverted) evidence supporting the expert associations of public health professionals that have concluded that violent video games can <em>cause </em>children psychological harm. See <em>supra, </em>at 853-855, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 753-754. And consequently, these studies help to substantiate the validity of the original judgment of the California Legislature, as well as that judgment\u2019s continuing validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b798-12\">Anderson &amp; Bushman, Effects of Violent Video Games on Aggressive Behavior, Aggressive Cognition, Aggressive Affect, Physiological Arousal, and Prosocial Behavior: A Meta-Analytic Review of the Scientific Literature, 12 Psychological Science: J.
