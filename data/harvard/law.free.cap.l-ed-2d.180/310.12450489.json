Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966). It is beyond dispute that children will often feel bound to submit to police questioning when an adult in the same circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b360-15\">[564 U.S. 265]</p>\n<p id=\"b360-16\">would feel free to leave. Seeing no reason for police officers or courts to blind themselves to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>commonsense reality, we hold that  a child\u2019s age properly informs the <em>Miranda </em>custody analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Petitioner J. D. B. was a 13-year-old, seventh-grade student attending class at Smith Middle School in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, when he was removed from his classroom by a uniformed police officer, escorted to a closed-door conference room, and questioned by police for at least half an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">This was the second time that police questioned J. D. B. in the span of a week. Five days earlier, two home break-ins occurred, and various items were stolen. Police stopped and questioned J. D. B. after he was seen behind a residence in the neighborhood where the crimes occurred. That same day, police also spoke to J. D. B.\u2019s grandmother\u2014his legal guardian\u2014as well as his aunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Police later learned that a digital camera matching the description of one of the stolen items had been found at J. D. B.\u2019s middle school and seen in J. D. B.\u2019s possession. Investigator DiCostanzo, the juvenile investigator with the local police force who had been assigned to the case, went to the school to question J. D. B. Upon arrival, DiCostanzo informed the uniformed police officer on detail to the school (a so-called school resource officer), the assistant principal, and an administrative intern that he was there to question J. D. B. about the break-ins. Although DiCostanzo asked the school administrators to verify J. D. B.\u2019s date of birth, address, and parent contact information from school records, neither the police officers nor the school administrators contacted J. D. B.\u2019s grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">The uniformed officer interrupted J. D. B.\u2019s afternoon social studies class, removed J. D. B. from the classroom, and</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">[564 U.S. 266]</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">escorted him to a school conference room.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There, J. D. B. was met by DiCostanzo, the assistant principal, and the administrative intern. The door to the conference room was closed. With the two police officers and the two administrators present, J. D. B. was questioned for the next 30 to 45 minutes. Prior to the commencement of questioning, J. D. B. was given neither <em>Miranda </em>warnings nor the opportunity to speak to his grandmother. Nor was he informed that he was free to leave the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">Questioning began with small talk\u2014 discussion of sports and J. D. B.\u2019s family life. DiCostanzo asked, and J. D. B. agreed, to discuss the events of the prior weekend. Denying any wrongdoing, J. D. B. explained that he had been in the neighborhood where the crimes occurred because he was seeking work mowing lawns. DiCostanzo pressed J. D. B. for additional detail about his efforts to obtain work; asked J. D. B. to explain a prior incident, when one of the victims returned home to find J. D. B. behind her house; and confronted J. D. B. with the stolen camera. The assistant principal urged J. D. B. to \u201cdo the right thing,\u201d warning J. D. B. that \u201cthe truth always comes out in the end.\u201dApp. 99a, 112a.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Eventually, J. D. B. asked whether he would \u201cstill be in trouble\u201d if he returned the \u201cstuff.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In response, DiCostanzo explained that return of the stolen items would be helpful, but \u201cthis thing is going to court\u201d regardless. <em>Id., </em>at 112a; <em>ibid. </em>(\u201c[W]hat\u2019s done is done[;] now you need to help yourself by making it right\u201d); see also <em>id., </em>at 99a. DiCostanzo then warned that he may need to seek a secure custody order if he believed that J. D. B. would continue to break into other homes. When J. D. B. asked what a secure custody</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">[564 U.S. 267]</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">order was, DiCostanzo explained that \u201cit\u2019s where you get sent to juvenile detention before court.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 112a.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">After learning of the prospect of juvenile detention, J. D. B. confessed that he and a friend were responsible for the break-ins. DiCostanzo only then informed J. D. B. that he could refuse to answer the investigator\u2019s questions and that he was free to leave.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Asked whether he understood, J. D. B. nodded and provided further detail, including information about the location of the stolen items. Eventually J. D. B. wrote a statement, at DiCostanzo\u2019s request. When the bell rang indicating the end of the school-day, J. D. B. was allowed to leave to catch the bus home.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Two juvenile petitions were filed against J. D. B., each alleging one count of breaking and entering and one count of larceny. J. D. B.\u2019s public defender moved to suppress his statements and the evidence derived therefrom, arguing that suppression was necessary because J. D. B. had been \u201cinterrogated by police in a custodial setting without being afforded <em>Miranda </em>warning[s],\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 89a, and because his</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">[564 U.S. 268]</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">statements were involuntary under the totality of the circumstances test, <em>id., </em>at 142a; see <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 226, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1973) (due process precludes admission of a confession where \u201ca defendant\u2019s will was overborne\u201d by the circumstances of the interrogation). After a suppression hearing at which DiCostanzo and J. D. B. testified, the trial court denied the motion, deciding that J. D. B. was not in custody at the time of the schoolhouse interrogation and that his statements were voluntary. As a result, J. D. B. entered a transcript of admission to all four counts, renewing his objection enial of his motion to suppress, and the court adjudicated J. D. B. delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">A divided panel of the North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>In re J. D. B., </em>196 N.C. App. 234, 674 S.E.2d 795 (2009). The North Carolina Supreme Court held, over two dissents, that J. D. B. was not in custody when he confessed, \u201cdeclin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>[ing] to extend the test for custody to include consideration of the age ... of an individual subjected to questioning by police.\u201d <em>In re J.

B., </em>363 N.C. 664, 672, 686 S.E.2d 135, 140 (2009) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">We granted certiorari to determine whether the <em>Miranda </em>custody analysis includes consideration of a juvenile suspect\u2019s age. 562 U.S. 1001, 131 S.

Ed. 2d 368 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Any police interview of an individual suspected of a crime has \u201ccoercive aspects to it.\u201d <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S. Ct. 711, 50 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1977) <em>(per curiam). </em>Only those interrogations that occur while a suspect is in police custody, however, \u201cheighte[n] the risk\u201d that statements obtained are not the</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">[564 U.S. 269]</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">product of the suspect\u2019s free choice. <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>530 U.S. 428, 435, 120 S. Ct. 2326, 147 L. Ed. 2d 405 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">By its very nature, custodial police interrogation entails \u201cinherently compelling pressures.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S., at 467, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694. Even for an adult, the physical and psychological isolation of custodial interrogation can \u201cundermine the individual\u2019s will to resist and . . . compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Indeed, the pressure of custodial interrogation is so immense that it \u201ccan induce a frighteningly high percentage of people to confess to crimes they never committed.\u201d <em>Corley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>556 U.S. 303, 321, 129 S. Ct. 1558, 173 L. Ed. 2d 443 (2009) (citing Drizin <em>&amp; </em>Leo, The Problem of False Confessions in the Post-DNA World, 82 N.C. L. Rev. 891, 906-907 (2004)); see also <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S., at 455, n. 23, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694. That risk is all the more troubling\u2014and recent studies suggest, all the more acute\u2014when the subject of custodial interrogation is a juvenile. See Brief for Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>21-22 (collecting empirical studies that \u201cillustrate the heightened risk of false confessions from youth\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">Recognizing that the inherently coercive nature of custodial interrogation \u201cblurs the line between voluntary and involuntary statements,\u201d <em>Dickerson, </em>530 U.S., at 435, 120 S. Ct. 2326, 147 L. Ed. 2d 405, this Court in <em>Miranda </em>adopted a set of prophylactic measures designed to safeguard the constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination. Prior to questioning, a suspect \u201cmust be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.\u201d 384 U.S., at 444, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694; see also <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>559 U.S. 50, 60, 130 S. Ct. 1195, 175 L. Ed. 2d 1009 (2010) (\u201cThe four warnings <em>Miranda </em>requires are invariable, but this Court has not dictated the words in which the essential information must be conveyed\u201d). And, if a suspect makes a statement during custodial interrogation, the burden is on the Government to show, as a \u201cprerequisitje]\u201d to the statement\u2019s admissibility as evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>dence</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">[564 U.S. 270]</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">in the Government\u2019s case in chief, that the defendant \u201cvoluntarily, knowingly and intelligently\u201d waived his <em>rights.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> Miranda, </em>384 U.S., at 444, 475-476, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694; <em>Dickerson, </em>530 U.S., at 443-444, 120 S. Ct. 2326, 147 L. Ed. 2d 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Because these measures protect the individual against the coercive nature of custodial interrogation, they are required \u201c \u2018only where there has been such a restriction on a person\u2019s freedom as to render him \u201cin custody.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Stansbury </em>v. <em>California, </em>511 U.S. 318, 322, 114 S. Ct. 1526, 128 L. Ed. 2d 293 (1994) <em>(per curiam) </em>(quoting <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S., at 495, 97 S. Ct. 711, 50 L. Ed. 2d 714). As we have repeatedly emphasized,  whether a suspect is \u201cin custody\u201d is an objective inquiry.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">\u201cTwo discrete inquiries are essential to the determination: first, what were the circumstances surrounding the interrogation; and second, given those circumstances, would a reasonable person have felt he or she was at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave. Once the scene is set and the players\u2019 lines and actions are reconstructed, the court must apply an objective test to resolve the ultimate inquiry: was there a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with formal arrest.\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Keohane, </em>516 U.S. 99, 112, 116 S. Ct. 457, 133 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1995) (internal quotation marks, alteration, and footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">See also <em>Yarborough </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. 652, 662-663, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938 (2004); <em>Stansbury, </em>511 U.S., at 323; <em>Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 442, and n. 35, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317 (1984).  Rather than demarcate a limited set of relevant circumstances, we have required police officers and courts to \u201cexamine all of the circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">[564 U.S. 271]</p>\n<p id=\"anf-dedup-1\">surrounding the interrogation,\u201d <em>Stansbury, </em>511 U.S., at 322, 114 S. Ct. 1526, 128 L. Ed. 2d 293, including any circumstance that \u201cwould have affected how a reasonable person\u201d in the suspect\u2019s position \u201cwould perceive his or her freedom to leave,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 325, 114 S. Ct. 1526, 128 L. Ed. 2d 293. On the other hand, the \u201csubjective views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned\u201d are irrelevant. <em>Id., </em>at 323, 114 S. Ct. 1526, 128 L. Ed. 2d 293. The test, in other words, involves no consideration of the \u201cactual mindset\u201d of the particular suspect subjected to police questioning. <em>Alvarado, </em>541 U.S., at 667, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938; see also <em>California </em>v. <em>Beheler, </em>463 U.S. 1121, 1125, n. 3, 103 S. Ct. 3517, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1275 (1983) <em>(per curiam).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">The benefit of the objective custody analysis is that it is \u201cdesigned to give clear guidance to the police.\u201d <em>Alvarado, </em>541 U.S., at 668, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938. But see <em>Berkemer, </em>468 U.S., at 441, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317 (recognizing the \u201coccasional!] . . . difficulty\u201d that police and courts nonetheless have in \u201cdeciding exactly when a suspect has been taken into custody\u201d). Police must make in-the-moment judgments as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>when to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings. By limiting analysis to the objective circumstances of the interrogation, and asking how a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s position would understand his freedom to terminate questioning and leave, the objective test avoids burdening police with the task of anticipating the idiosyncrasies of every individual suspect and divining how those particular traits affect each person\u2019s subjective state of mind. See <em>id., </em>at 430-431, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317 (officers are not required to \u201cmake guesses\u201d as to circumstances \u201cunknowable\u201d to them at the time); <em>Alvarado, </em>541 U.S., at 668, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938 (officers are under no duty \u201cto consider . . . contingent psychological factors when deciding when suspects should be advised of their <em>Miranda </em>rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The State and its <em>amici </em>contend that a child\u2019s age has no place in the custody analysis, no matter how young the child subjected to police questioning. We cannot agree.  In some circumstances, a child\u2019s age \u201cwould have affected how a reasonable</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">[564 U.S. 272]</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">person\u201d in the suspect\u2019s position \u201cwould perceive his or her freedom to leave.\u201d <em>Stansbury, </em>511 U.S., at 325, 114 S. Ct. 1526, 128 L. Ed. 2d 293. That is, a reasonable child subjected to police questioning will sometimes feel pressured to submit when a reasonable adult would feel free to go. We think it clear that courts can account for that reality without doing any damage to the objective nature of the custody analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">A child\u2019s age is far \u201cmore than a chronological fact.\u201d <em>Eddings </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>455 U.S. 104, 115, 102 S. Ct. 869, 71 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1982); accord, <em>Gall </em>v. <em>United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 58, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445 (2007); <em>Roper </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>543 U.S. 551, 569, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2005); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>509 U.S. 350, 367, 113 S. Ct. 2658, 125 L. Ed. 2d 290 (1993). It is a fact that \u201cgenerates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception.\u201d <em>Alvarado, </em>541 U.S., at 674, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Such conclusions apply broadly to children as a class. And, they are self-evident to anyone who was a child once himself, including any police officer or judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">Time and again, this Court has drawn these commonsense conclusions for itself. We have observed that children \u201cgenerally are less mature and responsible than adults,\u201d <em>Eddings, </em>455 U.S., at 115-116, 102 S. Ct. 869, 71 L. Ed. 2d 1; that they \u201coften lack the experience, perspective, and judgment to recognize and avoid choices that could be detrimental to them,\u201d <em>Bellotti </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>443 U.S. 622, 635, 99 S. Ct. 3035, 61 L. Ed. 2d 797 (1979) (plurality opinion); that they \u201care more vulnerable or susceptible to . . . outside pressures\u201d than adults, <em>Roper, </em>543 U.S., at 569, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1; and so on. See <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>560 U.S. 48, 68, 130 S. Ct. 2011, 176 L. Ed. 2d 825 (2010) (finding no reason to \u201creconsider\u201d these observations about the common \u201cnature of juveniles\u201d). Addressing the specific context of police interrogation, we have observed that events that \u201cwould leave a man cold and unimpressed can overawe and overwhelm a lad in his early teens.\u201d <em>Haley </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>332 U.S. 596, 599, 68 S. Ct. 302, 92 L. Ed. 224 (1948) (plurality opinion); see also <em>Gallegos </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>370 U.S. 49, 54, 82 S. Ct. 1209, 8 L.

Describing no one child in particular, these observations restate what \u201cany parent knows\u201d\u2014indeed, what any person knows\u2014about children generally. <em>Roper, </em>543 U.S., at 569, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Our various statements to this effect are far from unique. The law has historically reflected the same assumption that children characteristically lack the capacity to exercise mature judgment and possess only an incomplete ability to understand the world around them. See, <em>e.g., </em>1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England *464-*465 (hereinafter Blackstone) (explaining that limits on children\u2019s legal capacity under the common law \u201csecure them from hurting themselves by their own improvident acts\u201d). Like this Court\u2019s own generalizations, the legal disqualifications placed on children as a <em>class\u2014e.g., </em>limitations on their ability to alienate property, enter a binding contract enforceable against them, and marry without parental consent\u2014exhibit the settled understanding that the differentiating characteristics of youth are universal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">[564 U.S. 274]</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">Indeed,  even where a \u201creasonable person\u201d standard otherwise applies, the common law has reflected the reality that children are not adults. In negligence suits, for instance, where liability turns on what an objectively reasonable person would do in the circumstances, \u201c[a]ll American jurisdictions accept the idea that a person\u2019s childhood is a relevant circumstance\u201d to be considered. Restatement (Third) of Torts \u00a7 10, Comment <em>b, </em>p. 117 (2005); see also <em>id., </em>Reporters\u2019 Note, pp. 121-122 (collecting cases); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 283A, Comment <em>b, </em>p. 15 (1963-1964) (\u201c[T]here is a wide basis of community experience upon which it is possible, as a practical matter, to determine what is to be expected of [children]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">As this discussion establishes,  \u201c[o]ur history is replete with laws and judicial recognition\u201d that children cannot be viewed simply as miniature adults. <em>Eddings, </em>455 U.S., at 115-116, 102 S. Ct. 869, 71 L. Ed. 2d 1. We see no justification for taking a different course here. So long as the child\u2019s age <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>was known to the officer at the time of the interview, or would have been objectively apparent to any reasonable officer, including age as part of the custody analysis requires officers neither to consider circumstances \u201cunknowable\u201d to them, <em>Berkemer, </em>468 U.S., at 430, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317, nor to \u201canticipat[e] the frailties or idiosyncrasies\u201d of the particular suspect whom they question, <em>Alvarado, </em>541 U.S., at 662, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938 (internal quotation marks omitted). The same \u201cwide basis of community experience\u201d that makes it possible, as an objective matter, \u201cto determine what is to be expected\u201d of children in other contexts, Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 283A, at 15; see <em>supra, </em>at 273, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 324, and n. 6, likewise makes it possible to know what to expect of children subjected to police questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">[564 U.S. 275]</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In other words, a child\u2019s age differs from other personal characteristics that, even when known to police, have no objectively discernible relationship to a reasonable person\u2019s understanding of his freedom of action. <em>Alvarado </em>holds, for instance, that a suspect\u2019s prior interrogation history with law enforcement has no role to play in the custody analysis because such experience could just as easily lead a reasonable person to feel free to walk away as to feel compelled to stay in place. 541 U.S., at 668, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938. Because the effect in any given case would be \u201ccontingent [on the] psycholog [y]\u201d of the individual suspect, the Court explained, such experience cannot be considered without compromising the objective nature of the custody analysis. <em>Ibid. </em>A child\u2019s age, however, is different. Precisely because childhood yields objective conclusions like those we have drawn ourselves\u2014 among others, that children are \u201cmost susceptible to influence,\u201d <em>Eddings, </em>455 U.S., at 115, 102 S. Ct. 869, 71 L. Ed. 2d 1, and \u201coutside pressures,\u201d <em>Roper, </em>543 U.S., at 569, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1\u2014considering age in the custody analysis in no way involves a determination of how youth \u201csubjectively affect[s] the mindset\u201d of any particular child, Brief for Respondent 14.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">In fact, in many cases involving juvenile suspects, the custody analysis would be nonsensical absent some consideration of the suspect\u2019s age. This case is a prime example. Were the court precluded from taking J. D. B.\u2019s youth into account, it would be forced to evaluate the circumstances present here through the eyes of a reasonable person of average years. In other words, how would a reasonable adult understand his situation, after being removed from a seventh-grade social studies class by a uniformed school resource</p>\n<p id=\"a3j-dedup-0\">[564 U.S. 276]</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">officer; being encouraged by his assistant principal to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d; and being warned by a police investigator of the prospect of juvenile detention and separation from his guardian and primary caretaker? To describe such an inquiry is to demonstrate its absurdity. Neither officers nor courts can reasonably evaluate the effect of objective circumstances that, by their nature, are specific to children with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>out accounting for the age of the child subjected to those circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Indeed, although the dissent suggests that concerns \u201cregarding the application of the <em>Miranda </em>custody rule to minors can be accommodated by considering the unique circumstances present when minors are questioned in school,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 297, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 339 (opinion of Alito, J.),  the effect of the schoolhouse setting cannot be disentangled from the identity of the person questioned. A student\u2014 whose presence at school is compulsory and whose disobedience at school is cause for disciplinary action\u2014is in a far different position than, say, a parent volunteer on school grounds to chaperone an event, or an adult from the community on school grounds to attend a basketball game. Without asking whether the person \u201cquestioned in school\u201d is a \u201cminor,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>the coercive effect of the schoolhouse setting is unknowable.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Our prior decision in <em>Alvarado </em>in no way undermines these conclusions. In that case, we held that a state-court decision that failed to mention a 17-year-old\u2019s age as part of the <em>Miranda </em>custody analysis was not objectively unreasonable under the deferential standard of review set forth by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214. Like the North Carolina Supreme Court here, see 363 N.C., at 672, 686 S.E.2d, at 140,  we observed that accounting for a juvenile\u2019s age in the <em>Miranda </em>custody analysis \u201ccould be viewed as creating a subjective inquiry,\u201d 541 U.S., at 668, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938. We said nothing, however, of whether such a view would be correct under the law. Cf. <em>Renico </em>v. <em>Lett, </em>559 U.S. 766, 778, n. 3, 130 S. Ct. 1855, 176 L. Ed. 2d 678 (2010) (\u201c[W]hether</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">[564 U.S. 277]</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">the [state court] was right or wrong is not the pertinent question under AEDPA\u201d). To the contrary, Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s concurring opinion explained that a suspect\u2019s age may indeed \u201cbe relevant to the \u2018custody\u2019 inquiry.\u201d <em>Alvarado, </em>541 U.S., at 669, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Reviewing the question <em>de novo </em>today, we hold that  so long as the child\u2019s age was known to the officer at the time of police questioning, or would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer, its inclusion in the custody analysis is consistent with the objective nature of that test.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This is not to say that a child\u2019s age will be a determinative, or even a significant, factor in every case. Cf. <em>ibid. </em>(O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (explaining that a state-court decision omitting any mention of the defendant\u2019s age was not unreasonable under AEDPA\u2019s deferential standard of review where the defendant \u201cwas almost 18 years old at the time of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>interview\u201d); <em>post, </em>at 296, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 339 (suggesting that \u201cteenagers nearing the age of majority\u201d are likely to react to an interrogation as would a \u201ctypical 18-year-old in similar circumstances\u201d). It is, however, a reality that courts cannot simply ignore.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The State and its <em>amici </em>offer numerous reasons that courts must blind themselves to a juvenile defendant\u2019s age. None is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">[564 U.S. 278]</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">To start, the State contends that a child\u2019s age must be excluded from the custody inquiry because age is a personal characteristic specific to the suspect himself rather than an \u201cexternal\u201d circumstance of the interrogation. Brief for Respondent 21; see also <em>id., </em>at 18-19 (distinguishing \u201cpersonal characteristics\u201d from \u201cobjective facts related to the interrogation itself\u2019 such as the location and duration of the interrogation). Despite the supposed significance of this distinction, however, at oral argument counsel for the State suggested without hesitation that  at least some undeniably personal characteristics\u2014for instance, whether the individual being questioned is blind\u2014are circumstances relevant to the custody analysis. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41. Thus, the State\u2019s quarrel cannot be that age is a personal characteristic, without more.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The State further argues that age is irrelevant to the custody analysis because it \u201cgo[es] to how a suspect may internalize and perceive the circumstances of an interrogation.\u201d Brief for Respondent 12; see also Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>21 (hereinafter U. S. Brief) (arguing that a child\u2019s age has no place in the custody analysis because it goes to whether a suspect is \u201cparticularly susceptible\u201d to the external circumstances of the interrogation (some internal quotation marks omitted)). But the same can be said of every objective circumstance that the State agrees is relevant to the custody analysis: Each circumstance goes to how a reasonable person would \u201cinternalize and perceive\u201d every other. See, <em>e.g., Stansbury, </em>511 U.S., at 325, 114 S. Ct. 1526, 128 L. Ed. 2d 293. Indeed, this is the very reason that we ask whether the objective circumstances \u201cadd up to custody,\u201d <em>Keohane, </em>516 U.S., at 113, 116 S. Ct. 457, 133 L. Ed. 2d 383, instead of evaluating the circumstances one by one.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">[564 U.S. 279]</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">In the same vein, the State and its <em>amici </em>protest that the \u201ceffect of... age on [the] perception of custody is internal,\u201d Brief for Respondent 20, or \u201cpsychological,\u201d U. S. Brief 21.  But the whole point of the custody analysis is to determine whether, given the circumstances, \u201ca reasonable person [would] have felt he or she was ... at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\u201d <em>Keohane, </em>516 U.S., at 112, 116 S. Ct. 457, 133 L. Ed. 2d 383. Because the <em>Miranda </em>custody inquiry turns on the mindset of a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s position, it cannot be the case that a circumstance is subjective simply because it has an \u201cinternal\u201d or \u201cpsychological\u201d impact on perception. Were that so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>there would be no objective circumstances to consider at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Relying on our statements that the objective custody test is \u201cdesigned to give clear guidance to the police,\u201d <em>Alvarado, </em>541 U.S., at 668, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938, the State next argues that a child\u2019s age must be excluded from the analysis in order to preserve clarity. Similarly, the dissent insists that the clarity of the custody analysis will be destroyed unless a \u201cone-size-fits-all reasonable-person test\u201d applies. <em>Post, </em>at 293, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 337. In reality, however, ignoring a juvenile defendant\u2019s age will often make the inquiry more artificial, see <em>supra, </em>at 275-276, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 325-326, and thus only add confusion. And in any event, a child\u2019s age, when known or apparent, is hardly an obscure factor to assess. Though the State and the dissent worry about gradations among children of different ages, that concern cannot justify ignoring a child\u2019s age altogether. Just as police officers are competent to account for other objective circumstances that are a matter of degree such as the length of questioning or the number of officers present, so too are they competent to evaluate the effect of relative age. Indeed, they are competent to do so even though an interrogation room lacks the \u201creflective atmosphere of a [jury] deliberation room,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 295, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 338. The same is true of judges, including those whose childhoods have long since passed, see <em>post, </em>at 293, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 337. In short, officers and judges need no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, training in cognitive science, or expertise</p>\n<p id=\"atz-dedup-0\">[564 U.S. 280]</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">in social and cultural anthropology to account for a child\u2019s age. They simply need the common sense to know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">There is, however, an even more fundamental flaw with the State\u2019s plea for clarity and the dissent\u2019s singular focus on simplifying the analysis:  Not once have we excluded from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial and noncustodial \u201cbrighter.\u201d Indeed, were the guiding concern clarity and nothing else, the custody test would presumably ask only whether the suspect had been placed under formal arrest. <em>Berkemer, </em>468 U.S., at 441, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317; see <em>ibid. </em>(acknowledging the \u201coccasional!] . . . difficulty\u201d police officers confront in determining when a suspect has been taken into custody). But we have rejected that \u201cmore easily administered line,\u201d recognizing that it would simply \u201cenable the police to circumvent the constraints on custodial interrogations established by Miranda.\u201d <em>Ibid.; </em>see also <em>ibid., </em>n. 33.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Finally, the State and the dissent suggest that excluding age from the custody analysis comes at no cost to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>juveniles\u2019 constitutional rights because the due process voluntariness test independently accounts for a child\u2019s youth. To be sure,  that test permits consideration of a child\u2019s age, and it erects its own barrier to admission of a defendant\u2019s inculpatory statements at trial. See <em>Gallegos, </em>370 U.S., at 53-55, 82 S. Ct. 1209, 8 L. Ed. 2d 325; <em>Haley, </em>332 U.S., at 599-601, 68 S. Ct. 302, 92 L. Ed. 224 (plurality opinion); see also <em>post,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">[564 U.S. 281]</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">at 297, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 340 (\u201c[C]ourts should be instructed to take particular care to ensure that [young children\u2019s] incriminating statements were not obtained involuntarily\u201d). But <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>procedural safeguards exist precisely because the voluntariness test is an inadequate barrier when custodial interrogation is at stake. See 384 U.S., at 458, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (\u201cUnless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings, no statement obtained from the defendant can truly be the product of his free choice\u201d); <em>Dickerson, </em>530 U.S., at 442, 120 S. Ct. 2326, 147 L. Ed. 2d 405 (\u201c[R]eliance on the traditional totality-of-the-circumstances test raise [s] a risk of overlooking an involuntary custodial confession\u201d); see also <em>supra, </em>at 268-270, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 321-322. To hold, as the State requests, that a child\u2019s age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custody\u2014and thus to ignore the very real differences between children and adults\u2014would be to deny children the full scope of the procedural safeguards that <em>Miranda </em>guarantees to adults.</p>\n<p id=\"pA12W\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"64\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAVIAAABAAQAAAABgx8JmAAAAqklEQVR4nO2TPQrCQBCFd0Ow1TKl5gTiDTyVbY6QG2muIxbpXCT6LDLrTOGDNIsIM0349n2zP5CJCEtrqBarIZR2k10kkN2bjQkUvu+j7nWNgbj3jemnAABAOq3xKQIX2Xd13ms7BWkaYOo75H1Dax9MILsHGxMQ97nbaspA3Ok4asygnj+pazRmEOe5eF2Tnksgz0U1mSsyKPWfxT+dY3fdddddd939hfsGZXGCQnMUtgoAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"337\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">The question remains whether J.

It is fundamentally inconsistent with one of the main justifications for the Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rule: the perceived need for a clear</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">[564 U.S. 282]</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">rule that can be easily applied in all cases. And today\u2019s holding is not needed to protect the constitutional rights of minors who are questioned by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\"><em>Miranda\u2019s </em>prophylactic regime places a high value on clarity and certainty. Dissatisfied with the highly fact-specific constitutional rule against the admission of involuntary confessions, the <em>Miranda </em>Court set down rigid standards that often require courts to ignore personal characteristics that may be highly relevant to a particular suspect\u2019s actual susceptibility to police pressure. This rigidity, however, has brought with it one of <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>principal strengths\u2014\u201cthe ease and clarity of its application\u201d by law enforcement officials and courts. See <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Bur</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number><em>bine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 425-426, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1986). A key contributor to this clarity, at least up until now, has been <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>objective reasonable-person test for determining custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><em>Miranda\u2019s </em>custody requirement is based on the proposition that the risk of unconstitutional coercion is heightened when a suspect is placed under formal arrest or is subjected to some functionally equivalent limitation on freedom of movement. When this custodial threshold is reached, <em>Miranda </em>warnings must precede police questioning. But in the interest of simplicity, the custody analysis considers only whether, under the circumstances, a hypothetical reasonable person would consider himself to be confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Many suspects, of course, will differ from this hypothetical reasonable person. Some, including those who have been hardened by past interrogations, may have no need for <em>Miranda </em>warnings at all. And for other suspects\u2014 those who are unusually sensitive to the pressures of police questioning\u2014 <em>Miranda </em>warnings may come too late to be of any use. That is a necessary consequence of <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>rigid standards, but it does not mean that the constitutional rights of these especially sensitive suspects are left unprotected. A vulnerable defendant can still turn to the constitutional rule</p>\n<p id=\"agj-dedup-2\">[564 U.S. 283]</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">against <em>actual </em>coercion and contend that his confession was extracted against his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Today\u2019s decision shifts the <em>Miranda </em>custody determination from a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test into an inquiry that must account for at least one individualized characteristic\u2014age\u2014that is thought to correlate with susceptibility to coercive pressures. Age, however, is in no way the only personal characteristic that may correlate with pliability, and in future cases the Court will be forced to choose between two unpalatable alternatives. It may choose to limit today\u2019s decision by arbitrarily distinguishing a suspect\u2019s age from other personal characteristics\u2014such as intelligence, education, occupation, or prior experience with law enforcement\u2014that may also correlate with susceptibility to coercive pressures. Or, if the Court is unwilling to draw these arbitrary lines, it will be forced to effect a fundamental transformation of the <em>Miranda </em>custody test\u2014 from a clear, easily applied prophylactic rule into a highly fact-intensive standard resembling the voluntariness test that the <em>Miranda </em>Court found to be unsatisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">For at least three reasons, there is no need to go down this road. First, many minors subjected to police interrogation are near the age of majority, and for these suspects the one-size-fits-all <em>Miranda </em>custody rule may not be a bad fit. Second, many of the difficulties in applying the <em>Miranda </em>custody rule to minors arise because of the unique circumstances present when the police conduct interrogations at school. The <em>Miranda </em>custody rule has always taken into account the setting in which questioning occurs, and accounting for the school setting in such cases will address many of these problems. Third, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is especially young, courts applying the constitutional voluntariness standard can take special care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained through coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">[564 U.S. 284]</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">Safeguarding the constitutional rights of minors does not require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>extreme makeover of <em>Miranda </em>that today\u2019s decision may portend.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In the days before <em>Miranda, </em>this Court\u2019s sole metric for evaluating the admissibility of confessions was a vol-untariness standard rooted in both the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Self-Incrimination Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See <em>Bram </em>v. <em>United States, </em>168 U.S. 532, 542, 18 S. Ct. 183, 42 L. Ed. 568 (1897) (Self-Incrimination Clause); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>297 U.S. 278, 56 S. Ct. 461, 80 L. Ed. 682 (1936) (due process). The question in these voluntariness cases was whether the particular \u201cdefendant\u2019s will\u201d had been \u201coverborne.\u201d <em>Lynumn </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>372 U.S. 528, 534, 83 S. Ct. 917, 9 L. Ed. 2d 922 (1963). Courts took into account both \u201cthe details of the interrogation\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cthe characteristics of the accused,\u201d <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 226, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1973), and then \u201cweighted] . . . the circumstances of pressure against the power of resistance of the person confessing.\u201d <em>Stein </em>v. <em>New York, </em>346 U.S. 156, 185, 73 S. Ct. 1077, 97 L. Ed. 1522 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">All manner of individualized, personal characteristics were relevant in this voluntariness inquiry. Among the most frequently mentioned factors were the defendant\u2019s education, physical condition, intelligence, and mental health. <em>Withrow </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>507 U.S. 680, 693, 113 S. Ct. 1745, 123 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993); see <em>Clewis </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>386 U.S. 707, 712, 87 S. Ct. 1338, 18 L. Ed. 2d 423 (1967) (\u201conly a fifth-grade education\u201d); <em>Greenwald </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>390 U.S. 519, 520-521, 88 S. Ct. 1152, 20 L. Ed. 2d 77 (1968) <em>(per curiam) </em>(had not taken blood-pressure medication); <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>356 U.S. 560, 562, n. 4, 567, 78 S. Ct. 844, 2 L. Ed. 2d 975 (1958) (\u201cmentally dull\u201d and \u201c \u2018slow to learn\u2019 \u201d); <em>Fikes </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>352 U.S. 191, 193, 196, 198, 77 S. Ct. 281, 1 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1957) (\u201clow mentality, if not mentally ill\u201d). The suspect\u2019s age also received prominent attention in several cases, <em>e.g., Gallegos </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>370 U.S. 49, 54, 82 S. Ct. 1209, 8 L. Ed. 2d 325 (1962), especially when the suspect was a \u201cmere child,\u201d <em>Haley </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>332 U.S. 596, 599, 68 S. Ct. 302, 92 L. Ed. 224 (1948) (plurality opinion). The weight assigned to any one consideration varied from case to case. But all of these factors, along with</p>\n<p id=\"An1\">[564 U.S. 285]</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">anything else that might have affected the \u201cindividual\u2019s . . . capacity for effective choice,\u201d were relevant in determining whether the confession was coerced or compelled. See <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 506-507, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966) (Harlan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">The all-encompassing nature of the voluntariness inquiry had its benefits. It allowed courts to accommodate a \u201ccomplex of values,\u201d <em>Schneckloth, supra, </em>at 223, 224, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854, and to make a careful, highly individualized determination as to whether the police had wrung \u201ca confession out of [the] accused against his will,\u201d <em>Blackburn </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>361 U.S. 199, 206-207, 80 S. Ct. 274, 4 L. Ed. 2d 242 (1960). But with this flexibility came a decrease in both certainty and predictability, and the vol-untariness standard proved difficult \u201cfor law enforcement officers to conform to, and for courts to apply in a consistent manner.\u201d <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>530 U.S. 428, 444, 120 S. Ct. 2326, 147 L. Ed. 2d 405 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">In <em>Miranda, </em>the Court supplemented the voluntariness inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>with a \u201cset of prophylactic measures\u201d designed to ward off the \u201c \u2018inherently compelling pressures\u2019 of custodial interrogation.\u201d See <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Shatzer, </em>559 U.S. 98, 103, 130 S. Ct. 1213, 175 L. Ed. 2d 1045 (2010) (quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S., at 467, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694). <em>Miranda </em>greatly simplified matters by requiring police to give suspects standard warnings before commencing any custodial interrogation. See <em>id., </em>at 479, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694. Its requirements are no doubt \u201crigid,\u201d see <em>Fare </em>v. <em>Michael C., </em>439 U.S. 1310, 1314, 99 S. Ct. 3, 58 L. Ed. 2d 19 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers), and they often require courts to suppress \u201ctrustworthy and highly probative\u201d statements that may be perfectly \u201cvoluntary under [a] traditional Fifth Amendment analysis,\u201d <em>Fare </em>v. <em>Michael C., </em>442 U.S. 707, 718, 99 S. Ct. 2560, 61 L. Ed. 2d 197 (1979). But with this rigidity comes increased clarity. <em>Miranda </em>provides \u201ca workable rule to guide police officers,\u201d <em>New York </em>v. <em>Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 658, 104 S. Ct. 2626, 81 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted), and an administrable standard for the courts. As has often been recognized, this gain in clarity and admin-istrability is one of <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>\u201cprincipal advantages.\u201d <em>Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 430, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317 (1984); see</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">[564 U.S. 286]</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">also <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Seibert, </em>542 U.S. 600, 622, 124 S. Ct. 2601, 159 L. Ed. 2d 643 (2004) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">No less than other facets of <em>Miranda, </em>the threshold requirement that the suspect be in \u201ccustody\u201d is \u201cdesigned to give clear guidance to the police.\u201d <em>Yarborough </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. 652, 668, 669, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938 (2004). Custody under <em>Miranda </em>attaches where there is a \u201cformal arrest\u201d or a \u201crestraint on freedom of movement\u201d akin to formal arrest. <em>California </em>v. <em>Beheler, </em>463 U.S. 1121, 1125, 103 S. Ct. 3517, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1275 (1983) <em>(per curiam) </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). This standard is \u201cobjective\u201d and turns on how a hypothetical \u201creasonable person in the position of the individual being questioned would gauge the breadth of his or her freedom of action.\u201d <em>Stansbury </em>v. <em>California, </em>511 U.S. 318, 322-323, 325, 114 S. Ct. 1526, 128 L. Ed. 2d 293 (1994) <em>(per curiam) </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Until today, the Court\u2019s cases applying this test have focused solely on the \u201cobjective circumstances of the interrogation,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 323, 114 S. Ct. 1526, 128 L. Ed. 2d 293, not the personal characteristics of the interrogated. <em>E.g., Berkemer, supra, </em>at 442, and n. 35, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317; but cf. <em>Schneckloth, supra, </em>at 226, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854 (volun-tariness inquiry requires consideration of \u201cthe details of the interrogation\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cthe characteristics of the accused\u201d). Relevant factors have included such things as where the questioning occurred,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> how long it lasted,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> what was said,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> any physical restraints placed on the suspect\u2019s movement,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and whether the suspect was allowed to leave when the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>tioning was through.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The totality of <em>these </em>circumstances\u2014the external circumstances, that is, of the interrogation itself\u2014is what has mattered in this Court\u2019s cases. Personal characteristics of suspects have consistently been rejected or ignored as irrelevant under a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person standard. <em>Stansbury, supra, </em>at 323, 114 S. Ct. 1526, 128 L. Ed. 2d 293 (\u201c[C]ustody depends on the objective</p>\n<p id=\"a3o-dedup-0\">[564 U.S. 287]</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">circumstances of the interrogation, not on the subjective views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">For example, in <em>Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, supra, </em>police officers conducting a traffic stop questioned a man who had been drinking and smoking marijuana before he was pulled over. <em>Id., </em>at 423, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317. Although the suspect\u2019s inebriation was readily apparent to the officers at the scene, <em>ibid., </em>the Court\u2019s analysis did not advert to this or any other individualized consideration. Instead, the Court focused only on the external circumstances of the interrogation itself. The opinion concluded that a typical \u201ctraffic stop\u201d is akin to a <em>\u201cTerry </em>stop\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and does not qualify as the equivalent of \u201cformal arrest.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 439, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\"><em>California </em>v. <em>Beheler, supra, </em>is another useful example. There, the circumstances of the interrogation were \u201cremarkably similar\u201d to the facts of the Court\u2019s earlier decision in <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 97 S. Ct. 711, 50 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1977) <em>(per </em>curiam)\u2014the suspect was \u201cnot placed under arrest,\u201d he \u201cvoluntarily [came] to the police station,\u201d and he was \u201callowed to leave unhindered by police after a brief interview.\u201d 463 U.S., at 1123, 1121, 103 S. Ct. 3517, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1275. A California court in <em>Beheler </em>had nonetheless distinguished <em>Mathiason </em>because the police knew that Beheler \u201chad been drinking earlier in the day\u201d and was \u201cemotionally distraught.\u201d 463 U.S., at 1124-1125, 103 S. Ct. 3517, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1275. In a summary reversal, this Court explained that the fact \u201c[t]hat the police knew more\u201d personal information about Beheler than they did about Mathiason was \u201cirrelevant.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1125, 103 S. Ct. 3517, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1275. Neither one of them was in custody under the objective reasonable-person standard. <em>Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Alvarado, supra, </em>at 668, 669, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938 (experience with law enforcement irrelevant to <em>Miranda </em>custody analysis \u201cas a <em>de novo </em>matter\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">[564 U.S. 288]</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">The glaring absence of reliance on personal characteristics in these and other custody cases should come as no surprise. To account for such individualized considerations would be to contradict <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>central premise. The <em>Miranda </em>Court\u2019s decision to adopt its inflexible prophylactic requirements was expressly based on the notion that \u201c[assessments of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>knowledge the defendant possessed, based on information as to his age, education, intelligence, or prior contact with authorities, can never be more than speculation.\u201d 384 U.S., at 468-469, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In light of this established practice, there is no denying that, by incorporating age into its analysis, the Court is embarking on a new expansion of the established custody standard. And since <em>Miranda </em>is this Court\u2019s rule, \u201cnot a constitutional command,\u201d it is up to the Court \u201cto justify its expansion.\u201d Cf. <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Roberson, </em>486 U.S. 675, 688, 108 S. Ct. 2093, 100 L. Ed. 2d 704 (1988) (Kennedy, J., dissenting). This the Court fails to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In its present form, <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>prophylactic regime already imposes \u201chigh cost[s]\u201d by requiring suppression of confessions that are often \u201chighly probative\u201d and \u201cvoluntary\u201d by any traditional standard. <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 312, 105 S. Ct. 1285, 84 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1985); see <em>Dickerson, </em>530 U.S., at 444, 120 S. Ct. 2326, 147 L. Ed. 2d 405 (under <em>Miranda </em>\u201cstatements which may be by no means involuntary, made by a defendant who is aware of his \u2018rights,\u2019 may nonetheless be excluded and a guilty defendant go free as a result\u201d). Nonetheless, a \u201ccore virtue\u201d of <em>Miranda </em>has been the clarity and precision of its guidance to \u201cpolice and courts.\u201d <em>Withrow, </em>507 U.S., at 694, 113 S.

Ed. 2d 410 (\u201c[O]ne of the principal advantages of <em>Miranda </em>is the ease and clarity of its application\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). This</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">[564 U.S. 289]</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">increased clarity \u201chas been thought to outweigh the burdens\u201d that <em>Miranda </em>imposes. <em>Fare, </em>442 U.S., at 718, 99 S. Ct. 2560, 61 L. Ed. 2d 197. The Court has, however, repeatedly cautioned against upsetting the careful \u201cbalance\u201d that <em>Miranda </em>struck, <em>Moran, supra, </em>at 424, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410, and it has \u201crefused to sanction attempts to expand [the] <em>Miranda </em>holding\u201d in ways that would reduce its \u201cclarity,\u201d <em>Quarles, </em>467 U.S., at 658, 104 S. Ct. 2626, 81 L. Ed. 2d 550 (citing cases). Given this practice, there should be a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d against the Court\u2019s new departure from the established custody test. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Patane, </em>542 U.S. 630, 640, 124 S. Ct. 2620, 159 L. Ed. 2d 667 (2004) (plurality opinion). In my judgment, that presumption cannot be overcome here.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">The Court\u2019s rationale for importing age into the custody standard is that minors tend to lack adults\u2019 \u201ccapacity to exercise mature judgment\u201d and that failing to account for that \u201creality\u201d will leave some minors unprotected under <em>Miranda </em>in situations where they perceive themselves to be confined. See <em>ante, </em>at 273, 272, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 324, 323. I do not dispute that many suspects who are under 18 will be more susceptible to police pressure than the average adult. As the Court notes, our <em>pre-Miranda </em>cases were particularly attuned to this \u201creality\u201d in applying the constitutional requirement of voluntariness in fact. <em>Ante, </em>at 272-273, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 323-324 (relying on <em>Haley, </em>332 U.S., at 599, 68 S. Ct. 302, 92 L. Ed. 224 (plurality opinion), and <em>Gallegos, </em>370 U.S., at 54, 82 S. Ct. 1209, 8 L. Ed. 2d 325). It is no less a \u201creality,\u201d however, that many persons <em>over </em>the age of 18 are also more susceptible to police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>pressure than the hypothetical reasonable person. See <em>Payne, </em>356 U.S., at 567, 78 S. Ct. 844, 2 L. Ed. 2d 975 (fact that defendant was a \u201cmentally dull 19-year-old youth\u201d relevant in voluntariness inquiry). Yet the <em>Miranda </em>custody standard has never accounted for the personal characteristics of these or any other individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Indeed, it has always been the case under <em>Miranda </em>that the unusually meek or compliant are subject to the same fixed rules, including the same custody requirement, as those who are unusually resistant to police pressure. <em>Berkemer,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">[564 U.S. 290]</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">468 U.S., at 442, and n. 35, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317 (\u201conly relevant inquiry is how a reasonable man in the suspect\u2019s position would have understood his situation\u201d). <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>rigid standards are both overinclusive and underinclu-sive. They are overinclusive to the extent that they provide a windfall to the most hardened and savvy of suspects, who often have no need for <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>protections. Compare <em>Miranda, supra, </em>at 471-472, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (\u201c[N]o amount of circumstantial evidence that the person may have been aware of\u2019 his rights can overcome <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>requirements), with <em>Orozco </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>394 U.S. 324, 329, 89 S. Ct. 1095, 22 L. Ed. 2d 311 (1969) (White, J., dissenting) (\u201cWhere the defendant himself [w]as a lawyer, policeman, professional criminal, or otherwise has become aware of what his right to silence is, it is sheer fancy to assert that his answer to every question asked him is compelled unless he is advised of those rights with which he is already intimately familiar\u201d). And <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>requirements are underin-clusive to the extent that they fail to account for \u201cfrailties,\u201d \u201cidiosyncrasies,\u201d and other individualized considerations that might cause a person to bend more easily during a confrontation with the police. <em>Alvarado, </em>541 U.S., at 662, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938 (internal quotation marks omitted). Members of this Court have seen this rigidity as a major weakness in <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>\u201ccode of rules for confessions.\u201d See 384 U.S., at 504, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (Harlan, J., dissenting); <em>Fare, </em>439 U.S., at 1314, 99 S. Ct. 3, 58 L. Ed. 2d 19 (Rehnquist, J., in chambers) (\u201c[T]he rigidity of [.Miranda\u2019s] prophylactic rules was a principal weakness in the view of dissenters and critics outside the Court\u201d). But if it is, then the weakness is an inescapable consequence of the <em>Miranda </em>Court\u2019s decision to supplement the more holistic volun-tariness requirement with a one-size-fits-all prophylactic rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">That is undoubtedly why this Court\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>cases have never before mentioned \u201cthe suspect\u2019s age\u201d or any other individualized consideration in applying the custody standard. <em>See Alvarado, supra, </em>at 666, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938. And unless the <em>Miranda </em>custody rule is now to be radically transformed into one that takes into account the wide range of individual characteristics</p>\n<p id=\"Ae_\">[564 U.S. 291]</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">that are relevant in determining whether a confession is voluntary, the Court must shoulder the burden of explaining why age is different from these other personal characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Why, for example, is age different from intelligence? Suppose that an officer, upon going to a school to question a student, is told by the principal that the student has an IQ of 75 and is in a special-education class. Cf. <em>In re J. D. B., </em>363 N.C. 664, 666, 686 S.E.2d 135, 136-137 (2009). Are those facts more or less important than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>student\u2019s age in determining whether he or she \u201cfelt... at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave\u201d? <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Keohane, </em>516 U.S. 99, 112, 116 S. Ct. 457, 133 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1995). An IQ score, like age, is more than just a number. <em>Ante, </em>at 272, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 323 (\u201c[A]ge is far \u2018more than a chronological fact\u2019 \u201d). And an individual\u2019s intelligence can also yield \u201cconclusions\u201d similar to those \u201cwe have drawn ourselves\u201d in cases far afield of <em>Miranda. Ante, </em>at 275, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 325. Compare <em>ibid. </em>(relying on <em>Eddings </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>455 U.S. 104, 102 S. Ct. 869, 71 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1982), and <em>Roper </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>543 U.S. 551, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2005)) with <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>543 U.S. 37, 44-45, 125 S. Ct. 400, 160 L. Ed. 2d 303 (2004) <em>(per curiam).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">How about the suspect\u2019s cultural background? Suppose the police learn (or should have learned, see <em>ante, </em>at 274, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 324-325) that a suspect they wish to question is a recent immigrant from a country in which dire consequences often befall any person who dares to attempt to cut short any meeting with the police.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Is this really less relevant than the fact that a suspect is a month or so away from his 18th birthday?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The defendant\u2019s education is another personal characteristic that may generate \u201cconclusions about behavior and perception.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 272, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 323 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under today\u2019s decision, why should police officers and courts</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">[564 U.S. 292]</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\u201cblind themselves,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 265, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 318, to the fact that a suspect has \u201conly a fifth-grade education\u201d? <em>Clewis, </em>386 U.S., at 712, 87 S. Ct. 1338, 18 L. Ed. 2d 423 (voluntariness case). Alternatively, what if the police know or should know that the suspect is \u201ca college-educated man with law school training\u201d? <em>Crooker </em>v. <em>California, </em>357 U.S. 433, 440, 78 S. Ct. 1287, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1448 (1958), overruled by <em>Miranda, supra, </em>at 479, and n. 48, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694. How are these individual considerations meaningfully different from age in their \u201crelationship to a reasonable person\u2019s understanding of his freedom of action\u201d? <em>Ante, </em>at 275, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 325. The Court proclaims that \u201c[a] child\u2019s age ... is different,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>but the basis for this <em>ipse dixit </em>is dubious.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">I have little doubt that today\u2019s decision will soon be cited by defendants\u2014and perhaps by prosecutors as well\u2014for the proposition that all manner of other individual characteristics should be treated like age and taken into account in the <em>Miranda </em>custody calculus. Indeed, there are already lower court decisions that take this approach. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beraun-Panez, </em>812 F.2d 578, 581 (\u201creasonable person who was an alien\u201d), modified, 830 F.2d 127 (CA9 1987); <em>In re Jorge D., </em>202 Ariz. 277, 280, 43 P.3d 605, 608 (App. 2002) (age, maturity, and experience); <em>State </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>130 Idaho 811, 818, 948 P.2d 166, 173 (App. 1997) (same); <em>In re Joshua David C., </em>116 Md. App. 580, 594, 698 A.2d 1155, 1162 (1997) (\u201ceducation, age, and intelligence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">In time, the Court will have to confront these issues, and it will be faced with a difficult choice. It may choose to distinguish today\u2019s decision and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>adhere to the arbitrary proclamation that \u201cage ... is different.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 275, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 325. Or it may choose to extend today\u2019s holding and, in doing so, further undermine the very rationale for the <em>Miranda </em>regime.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">If the Court chooses the latter course, then a core virtue of <em>Mi</em>randa\u2014the \u201cease and clarity of its application\u201d\u2014will be lost. <em>Moran, </em>475 U.S., at 425, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410; see <em>Fare, </em>442 U.S., at 718, 99 S. Ct. 2560, 61 L. Ed. 2d 197 (noting that the clarity of <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>requirements \u201chas been</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">[564 U.S. 293]</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">thought to outweigh the burdens that the decision . . . imposes\u201d). However, even today\u2019s more limited departure from <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test will produce the very consequences that prompted the <em>Miranda </em>Court to abandon exclusive reliance on the voluntariness test in the first place: The Court\u2019s test will be hard for the police to follow, and it will be hard for judges to apply. See <em>Dickerson, </em>530 U.S., at 444, 120 S. Ct. 2326, 147 L. Ed. 2d 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">The Court holds that age must be taken into account when it \u201cwas known to the officer at the time of the interview,\u201d or when it \u201cwould have been objectively apparent\u201d to a reasonable officer. <em>Ante, </em>at 274, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 325. The first half of this test overturns the rule that the \u201cinitial determination of custody\u201d does not depend on the \u201csubjective views harbored by . . . interrogating officers.\u201d <em>Stansbury, </em>511 U.S., at 323, 114 S. Ct. 1526, 128 L. Ed. 2d 293. The second half will generate time-consuming satellite litigation over a reasonable officer\u2019s perceptions. When, as here, the interrogation takes place in school, the inquiry may be relatively simple. But not all police questioning of minors takes place in schools. In many cases, courts will presumably have to make findings as to whether a particular suspect had a sufficiently youthful look to alert a reasonable officer to the possibility that the suspect was under 18, or whether a reasonable officer would have recognized that a suspect\u2019s ID was a fake. The inquiry will be both \u201ctime-consuming and disruptive\u201d for the police and the courts. See <em>Berkemer, </em>468 U.S., at 432, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317 (refusing to modify the custody test based on similar considerations). It will also be made all the more complicated by the fact that a suspect\u2019s dress and manner will often be different when the issue is litigated in court than it was at the time of the interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">Even after courts clear this initial hurdle, further problems will likely emerge as judges attempt to put themselves in the shoes of the average 16-year-old, or 15-year-old, or 13-year-old, as the case may be. Consider, for example, a 60-year-old judge attempting to make a custody determination</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">[564 U.S. 294]</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">through the eyes of a hypothetical, average 15-year-old. Forty-five years of personal experience and societal change separate this judge from the days when he or she was 15 years old. And this judge may or may not have been an average 15-year-old. The Court\u2019s answer to these difficulties is to state that \u201cno imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, [or] training in cognitive science\u201d will be necessary. <em>Ante, </em>at 279, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 328. Judges \u201csimply need the common sense,\u201d the Court assures, \u201cto know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>an adult.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 280, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 328. It is obvious, however, that application of the Court\u2019s new rule demands much more than this.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Take a fairly typical case in which today\u2019s holding may make a difference. A 16-year-old moves to suppress incriminating statements made prior to the administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The circumstances are such that, if the defendant were at least 18, the court would not find that he or she was in custody, but the defendant argues that a reasonable 16-year-old would view the situation differently. The judge will not have the luxury of merely saying: \u201cIt is common sense that a 16-year-old is not an 18-year-old. Motion granted.\u201d Rather, the judge will be required to determine whether the differences between a typical 16-year-old and a typical 18-year-old with respect to susceptibility to the pressures of interrogation are sufficient to change the outcome of the custody determination. Today\u2019s opinion contains not a word of actual guidance as to how judges are supposed to go about making that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Petitioner and the Court attempt to show that this task is not unmanageable by pointing out that age is taken into account in other legal contexts. In particular, the Court relies on the fact that the age of a defendant is a relevant factor under the reasonable-person standard applicable in negligence suits. <em>Ante, </em>at 274, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 324 (citing Restatement (Third) of</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">[564 U.S. 295]</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Torts \u00a7 10, Comment <em>b, </em>p. 117 (2005)). But negligence is generally a question for the jury, the members of which can draw on their varied experiences with persons of different ages. It also involves a <em>post hoc </em>determination, in the reflective atmosphere of a deliberation room, about whether the defendant conformed to a standard of care. The <em>Miranda </em>custody determination, by contrast, must be made in the first instance by police officers in the course of an investigation that may require quick decisionmaking. See <em>Quarles, </em>467 U.S., at 658, 104 S. Ct. 2626, 81 L. Ed. 2d 550 (noting \u201cthe importance\u201d under <em>Miranda </em>of providing \u201ca workable rule \u2018to guide police officers, who have only limited time and expertise to reflect on and balance the social and individual interests involved in the specific circumstances they confront\u2019 \u201d); <em>Alvarado, </em>541 U.S., at 668, 669, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938 (\u201c[T]he custody inquiry states an objective rule designed to give clear guidance to the police\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Equally inapposite are the Eighth Amendment cases the Court cites in support of its new rule. <em>Ante, </em>at 272, 274, 275, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 323, 324, 325 (citing <em>Eddings, </em>455 U.S. 104, 102 S. Ct. 869, 71 L. Ed. 2d 1, <em>Roper, </em>543 U.S. 551, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1, and <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>560 U.S. 48, 130 S. Ct. 2011, 176 L. Ed. 2d 825 (2010)). Those decisions involve the \u201cjudicial exercise of independent judgment\u201d about the constitutionality of certain punishments. <em>E.g., id., </em>at 67, 130 S. Ct. 2011, 176 L. Ed. 2d 825. Like the negligence standard, they do not require on-the-spot judgments by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">Nor do state laws affording extra protection for juveniles during custodial interrogation provide any support for petitioner\u2019s arguments. See Brief for Petitioner 16-17. States are free to enact additional restrictions on the police over and above those demanded by the Constitution or <em>Miranda. </em>In addition, these state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>statutes generally create clear, workable rules to guide police conduct. See Brief for Petitioner 16-17 (citing statutes that require or permit parents to be present during custodial interrogation of a minor, that require minors to be advised of a statutory right to communicate with a parent or guardian, and that require parental consent to custodial interrogation). Today\u2019s decision, by</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">[564 U.S. 296]</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">contrast, injects a new, complicating factor into what had been a clear, easily applied prophylactic rule. See <em>Alvarado, supra, </em>at 668-669, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The Court\u2019s decision greatly diminishes the clarity and administrability that have long been recognized as \u201cprincipal advantages\u201d of <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>prophylactic requirements. See, <em>e.g., Moran, </em>475 U.S., at 425, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410. But what is worse, the Court takes this step unnecessarily, as there are other, less disruptive tools available to ensure that minors are not coerced into confessing.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">As an initial matter, the difficulties that the Court\u2019s standard introduces will likely yield little added protection for most juvenile defendants. Most juveniles who are subjected to police interrogation are teenagers nearing the age of majority.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> These defendants\u2019 reactions to police pressure are unlikely to be much different from the reaction of a typical 18-year-old in similar circumstances. A one-size-fits-all <em>Miranda</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">[564 U.S. 297]</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">custody rule thus provides a roughly reasonable fit for these defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">In addition, many of the concerns that petitioner raises regarding the application of the <em>Miranda </em>custody rule to minors can be accommodated by considering the unique circumstances present when minors are questioned in school. See Brief for Petitioner 10-11 (reciting at length the factors petitioner believes to be relevant to the custody determination here, including the fact that petitioner was removed from class by a police officer, that the interview took place in a school conference room, and that a uniformed officer and a vice principal were present). The <em>Miranda </em>custody rule has always taken into account the setting in which questioning occurs, restrictions on a suspect\u2019s freedom of movement, and the presence of police officers or other authority figures. See <em>Alvarado, supra, </em>at 665, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938; <em>Shatzer, </em>559 U.S., at 112-114, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>130 S. Ct. 1213, 175 L. Ed. 2d 1045. It can do so here as well.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Finally, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is much younger than the typical juvenile defendant, courts should be instructed to take particular care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained involuntarily. The voluntariness inquiry is flexible and accommodating by nature, see <em>Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S., at 224, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854, and the Court\u2019s precedents already make clear that \u201cspecial care\u201d must be exercised in applying the voluntariness test where the confession of a \u201cmere child\u201d is at issue, <em>Haley, </em>332 U.S., at 599, 68 S. Ct. 302, 92 L. Ed. 224 (plurality opinion). If <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>rigid, one-size-fits-all standards fail to account for the unique needs of juveniles, the response should be to rigorously apply the constitutional rule against coercion to ensure that the rights of</p>\n<p id=\"ajq-dedup-2\">[564 U.S. 298]</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">minors are protected. There is no need to run <em>Miranda </em>off the rails.</p>\n<p id=\"padt-dedup-0\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"73\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAQAAAABJAQAAAAD6KcXbAAAAs0lEQVR4nO2VIQ7CQBBF/w4IgiAVWBIO0gQkx8Gi6ElQHAIPEu5QIKkurgmkH0eHL1oSSDA77v19ycyY2UC0l3W8RyEKUYjCn4W3M1YrGFBnLrtD4PsZQKY3vqpeXQUMvPixDgqGUJauY54LGLArmiwsjwpkNWvaslwLgHz4rKKAAcXcDXbKBAzY9l22GCiQo7NbfbIXMDBJ3OrTqYAhbIZN1kvHCh9s0V6dQojfYhR+KjwBJkq4vZgdrXoAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"255\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The Court rests its decision to inject personal characteristics into the <em>Miranda </em>custody inquiry on the principle that judges applying <em>Miranda </em>cannot \u201cblind themselves to . . . commonsense reality.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 265, 272, 273-274, 277, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 318-319, 323, 324-325, 327. But the Court\u2019s shift is fundamentally at odds with the clear prophylactic rules that <em>Miranda </em>has long enforced. <em>Miranda </em>frequently requires judges to blind themselves to the reality that many un-Mirandized custodial confessions are \u201cby no means involuntary\u201d or coerced. <em>Dickerson, </em>530 U.S., at 444, 120 S. Ct. 2326, 147 L. Ed. 2d 405. It also requires police to provide a rote recitation of <em>Miranda </em>warnings that many suspects already know and could likely recite from memory.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Under today\u2019s new, \u201creality\u201d-based approach octrine, perhaps these and other principles of our <em>Miranda </em>jurisprudence will, like the custody standard, now be ripe for modification. Then, bit by bit, <em>Miranda </em>will lose the clarity and ease of application that has long been viewed as one of its chief justifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-16\">.

The Court claims that \u201c[n]ot once\u201d have any of our cases \u201cexcluded from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial and noncustodial \u2018brighter.\u2019 <em>\"Ante, </em>at 280, 180 L.

The very act of adopting a reasonable-person test necessarily excludes all sorts of \u201crelevant and objective\u201d circumstances\u2014for example, all the objective circumstances of a suspect\u2019s life history\u2014that might otherwise bear on a custody determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b378-11\">.

The Court also relies on North Carolina\u2019s concession at oral argument that a court could take into account a suspect\u2019s blindness as a factor relevant to the <em>Miranda </em>custody determination. <em>Ante, </em>at 278, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 327, and n. 9. This is a farfetched hypothetical, and neither the parties nor their <em>amici </em>cite any case in which such a problem has actually arisen. Presumably such a case would involve a situation in which a blind defendant was given \u201ca typed document advising him that he [was] free to leave.\u201d Brief for Juvenile Law Center et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>23. In such a case, furnishing this advice in a form calculated to be unintelligible to the suspect would be tantamount to failing to provide the advice at all. And advice by the police that a suspect is or is not free to leave at will has always been regarded asa circumstance regarding the conditions of the interrogation that must be taken into account in making the <em>Miranda </em>custody determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b381-14\">.
