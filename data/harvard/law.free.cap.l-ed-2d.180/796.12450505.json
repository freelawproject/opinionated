We address, in particular, this question:  Are foreign subsidiaries of a United States parent corporation amenable to suit in state court on claims unrelated to any activity of the subsidiaries in the forum State?</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">A bus accident outside Paris that took the lives of two 13-year-old boys from North Carolina gave rise to the litigation we here consider. Attributing the accident to a defective tire manufactured in Turkey at the plant of a foreign subsidiary of The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company (Goodyear USA), the boys\u2019 parents commenced an action for damages in a North Carolina state court; they named as defendants Goodyear USA, an Ohio corporation, and three of its subsidiaries, organized and operating, respectively, in Turkey, France, and Luxembourg. Goodyear USA, which had plants in North Carolina and regularly engaged in commercial activity there, did not contest the North Carolina court\u2019s jurisdiction over it; Goodyear USA\u2019s foreign subsidiaries, however, maintained that North Carolina lacked adjudicatory authority over them.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-15\">A state court\u2019s assertion of juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>diction exposes defendants to the State\u2019s coercive power, and is therefore subject to review for compatibility with the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">[564 U.S. 919]</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">326 U.

Ed. 95 (1945) (assertion of jurisdiction over out-of-state corporation must comply with \u201c \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Milliken </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>311 U.S. 457, 463, 61 S. Ct. 339, 85 L. Ed. 278 (1940))).  Opinions in the wake of the path-marking <em>International Shoe </em>decision have differentiated between general or all-purpose jurisdiction, and specific or case-linked jurisdiction. <em>Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>466 U.S. 408, 414, nn. 8, 9, 104 S. Ct. 1868, 80 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">A court may assert general jurisdiction over foreign (sister-state or foreign-country) corporations to hear any and all claims against them when their affiliations with the State are so \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d as to render them essentially at home in the forum State. See <em>International Shoe, </em>326 U.S., at 317, 66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95. Specific jurisdiction, on the other hand, depends on an \u201caffili-atio[n] between the forum and the underlying controversy,\u201d principally, activity or an occurrence that takes place in the forum State and is therefore subject to the State\u2019s regulation, von Mehren &amp; Trautman, Jurisdiction To Adjudicate: A Suggested Analysis, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 1121, 1136 (1966) (hereinafter von Mehren &amp; Trautman); see Brilmayer et ah, A General Look at General Jurisdiction, 66 Texas L. Rev. 721, 782 (1988) (hereinafter Brilmayer). In contrast to general, all-purpose jurisdiction, specific jurisdiction is confined to adjudication of \u201cissues deriving from, or connected with, the very controversy that establishes jurisdiction.\u201d von Mehren &amp; Trautman 1136.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">Because the episode-in-suit, the bus accident, occurred in France, and the tire alleged to have caused the accident was manufactured and sold abroad, North Carolina courts lacked specific jurisdiction to adjudicate the controversy. The North Carolina Court of Appeals so acknowledged. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Meter, </em>199 N.C. App. 50, 57-58, 681 S.E.2d 382, 388 (2009). Were the foreign subsidiaries nonetheless amenable to general jurisdiction in North Carolina courts? Confusing or blending general and specific jurisdictional inquiries, the</p>\n<p id=\"Ai3\">[564 U.S. 920]</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">North Carolina courts answered yes. Some of the tires made abroad by Goodyear\u2019s foreign subsidiaries, the North Carolina Court of Appeals stressed, had reached North Carolina through \u201cthe stream of commerce\u201d; that connection, the Court of Appeals believed, gave North Carolina courts the handle needed for the exercise of general jurisdiction over the foreign corporations. <em>Id., </em>at 67-68, 681 S.E.2d, at 394-395.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">A connection so limited between the forum and the foreign corporation, we hold, is an inadequate basis for the exercise of general jurisdiction. Such a connection does not establish the \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d affiliation necessary to empower North Carolina courts to entertain claims unrelated to the foreign corporation\u2019s contacts with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">On April 18, 2004, a bus destined for Charles de Gaulle Airport overturned on a road outside Paris, France. Passengers on the bus were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>young soccer players from North Carolina beginning their journey home. Two 13-year-olds, Julian Brown and Matthew Helms, sustained fatal injuries. The boys\u2019 parents, respondents in this Court, filed a suit for wrongful-death damages in the Superior Court of Onslow County, North Carolina, in their capacity as administrators of the boys\u2019 estates. Attributing the accident to a tire that failed when its plies separated, the parents alleged negligence in the \u201cdesign, construction, testing, and inspection\u201d of the tire. 199 N.C. App., at 51, 681 S.E.2d, at 384 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Goodyear Luxembourg Tires, SA (Goodyear Luxembourg), Goodyear Lastikleri T. A. S. (Goodyear Turkey), and Goodyear Dunlop Tires France, SA (Goodyear France), petitioners here, were named as defendants. Incorporated in Luxembourg, Turkey, and France, respectively, petitioners are indirect subsidiaries of Goodyear USA, an Ohio corporation also named as a defendant in the suit. Petitioners manufacture</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">[564 U.S. 921]</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">tires primarily for sale in European and Asian markets. Their tires differ in size and construction from tires ordinarily sold in the United States. They are designed to carry significantly heavier loads, and to serve under road conditions and speed limits in the manufacturers\u2019 primary markets.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">In contrast to the parent company, Goodyear USA, which does not contest the North Carolina courts\u2019 personal jurisdiction over it, petitioners are not registered to do business in North Carolina. They have no place of business, employees, or bank accounts in North Carolina. They do not design, manufacture, or advertise their products in North Carolina. And they do not solicit business in North Carolina or themselves sell or ship tires to North Carolina customers. Even so, a small percentage of petitioners\u2019 tires (tens of thousands out of tens of millions manufactured between 2004 and 2007) were distributed within North Carolina by other Goodyear USA affiliates. These tires were typically custom ordered to equip specialized vehicles such as cement mixers, waste haulers, and boat and horse trailers. Petitioners state, and respondents do not here deny, that the type of tire involved in the accident, a Goodyear Regional RHS tire manufactured by Goodyear Turkey, was never distributed in North Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">Petitioners moved to dismiss the claims against them for want of personal jurisdiction. The trial court denied the motion, and the North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed. Acknowledging that the claims neither \u201crelated to, nor . . . ar[o]se from, [petitioners\u2019] contacts with North Carolina,\u201d the Court of Appeals confined its analysis to \u201cgeneral rather</p>\n<p id=\"apa-dedup-0\">[564 U.S. 922]</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">than specific jurisdiction,\u201d which the court recognized required a \u201chigher threshold\u201d showing: A defendant must have \u201ccontinuous and systematic contacts\u201d with the forum. <em>Id., </em>at 58, 681 S.E.2d, at 388 (internal quotation marks omitted). That threshold was crossed, the court determined, when petitioners placed their tires \u201cin the stream of interstate commerce without any limitation on the extent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>which those tires could be sold in North Carolina.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 67, 681 S.E.2d, at 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">Nothing in the record, the court observed, indicated that petitioners \u201ctook any affirmative action to cause tires which they had manufactured to be shipped into North Carolina.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 64, 681 S.E.2d, at 392. The court found, however, that tires made by petitioners reached North Carolina as a consequence of a \u201chighly-organized distribution process\u201d involving other Goodyear USA subsidiaries. <em>Id., </em>at 67, 681 S.E.2d, at 394. Petitioners, the court noted, made \u201cno attempt to keep these tires from reaching the North Carolina market.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 66, 681 S.E.2d, at 393. Indeed, the very tire involved in the accident, the court observed, conformed to tire standards established by the U. S. Department of Transportation and bore markings required for sale in the United States. <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As further support, the court invoked North Carolina\u2019s \u201cinterest in providing a forum in which its citizens are able to seek redress for [their] injuries,\u201d and noted the hardship North Carolina plaintiffs would experience \u201c[were they] required to litigate their claims in France,\u201d a country to which they have no ties. <em>Id., </em>at 68, 681 S.E.2d, at 394. The North Carolina Supreme Court</p>\n<p id=\"Ae_5\">[564 U.S. 923]</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">denied discretionary review. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Meter, </em>364 N.C. 128, 695 S.E.2d 756 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">We granted certiorari to decide whether the general jurisdiction the North Carolina courts asserted over petitioners is consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 561 U.S. 1508, 131 S. Ct. 63, 177 L. Ed. 2d 1152 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment sets the outer boundaries of a state tribunal\u2019s authority to proceed against a defendant. <em>Shaffer </em>v. <em>Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186, 207, 97 S. Ct. 2569, 53 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1977). The canonical opinion in this area remains <em>International Shoe, </em>326 U.S. 310, 66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95, in which we held that a State may authorize its courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant if the defendant has \u201ccertain minimum contacts with [the State] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 316, 66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95 <em>(quoting Meyer, </em>311 U.S., at 463, 61 S. Ct. 339, 85 L. Ed. 278).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">Endeavoring to give specific content to the \u201cfair play and substantial justice\u201d concept, the Court in <em>International Shoe </em>classified cases involving out-of-state corporate defendants. First, as in <em>International Shoe </em>itself, jurisdiction unquestionably could be asserted where the corporation\u2019s instate activity is \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d and <em>that activity gave rise to the episode-in-suit. </em>326 U.S., at 317, 66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95. Further, the Court observed, the commission of certain \u201csingle or occasional acts\u201d in a State may be sufficient to render a corporation answerable in that State with respect to those acts, though not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>with respect to matters unrelated to the forum connections. <em>Id., </em>at 318, 66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95. The heading courts today use to encompass these two <em>International Shoe </em>categories is \u201cspecific jurisdiction.\u201d See von Mehren &amp; Trautman 1144-1163. Adjudicatory authority is \u201cspecific\u201d when the suit \u201caris[es]</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">[564 U.S. 924]</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">out of or relate [s] to the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum.\u201d <em>Helicopteros, </em>466 U.S., at 414, n. 8, 104 S. Ct. 1868, 80 L. Ed. 2d 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\"><em>International Shoe </em>distinguished from cases that fit within the \u201cspecific jurisdiction\u201d categories, \u201cinstances in which the continuous corporate operations within a state [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.\u201d 326 U.S., at 318, 66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95. Adjudicatory authority so grounded is today called \u201cgeneral jurisdiction.\u201d Helico<em>pteros, </em>466 U.S., at 414, n. 9, 104 S. Ct. 1868, 80 L. Ed. 2d 404. For an individual, the paradigm forum for the exercise of general jurisdiction is the individual\u2019s domicile; for a corporation, it is an equivalent place, one in which the corporation is fairly regarded as at home. See Bril-mayer 728 (identifying domicile, place of incorporation, and principal place of business as \u201cparadig[m]\u201d bases for the exercise of general jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Since <em>International Shoe, </em>this Court\u2019s decisions have elaborated primarily on circumstances that warrant the exercise of specific jurisdiction, particularly in cases involving \u201csingle or occasional acts\u201d occurring or having their impact within the forum State. As a rule in these cases, this Court has inquired whether there was \u201csome act by which the defendant purposefully avail [ed] itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Denckla, </em>357 U.S. 235, 253, 78 S. Ct. 1228, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1283 (1958). See, <em>e.g., World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>444 U.S. 286, 287, 297, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L.

Ed. 2d, at 808-809, has this Court considered whether an out-of-state corporate defendant\u2019s instate contacts were sufficiently \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d to justify the exercise of general jurisdiction over claims unrelated to those contacts: <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Benguet Consol. Mining Co., </em>342 U.S. 437, 72 S. Ct. 413, 96 L. Ed. 485 (1952) (general jurisdiction appropriately exercised over Philippine corporation sued in Ohio, where the company\u2019s affairs were overseen during World War II); and <em>Helicopteros, </em>466 U.S. 408, 104 S. Ct. 1868, 80 L. Ed. 2d 404 (helicopter owned by Colombian corporation crashed in Peru; survivors of U. S. citizens who died in the crash, the Court held, could not maintain wrongful-death actions against the Colombian corporation in Texas, for the corporation\u2019s helicopter purchases and purchase-linked activity in Texas were insufficient to subject it to Texas court\u2019s general jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">[564 U.S. 926]</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">To justify the exercise of general jurisdiction over petitioners, the North Carolina courts relied on the petitioners\u2019 placement of their tires in the \u201cstream of commerce.\u201d See <em>supra, </em>at 921-923, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 804-805. The stream-of-commerce metaphor has been invoked frequently in lower court decisions permitting \u201cjurisdiction in products liability cases in which the product has traveled through an extensive chain of distribution before reaching the ultimate consumer.\u201d 18 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations \u00a7 8640.40, p. 133 (rev. ed. 2007). Typically, in such cases, a nonresident defendant, acting <em>outside </em>the forum, places in the stream of commerce a product that ultimately causes harm <em>inside </em>the forum. See generally Dayton, Personal Jurisdiction and the Stream of Commerce, 7 Rev. Litigation 239, 262-268 (1988) (discussing origins and evolution of the stream-of-commerce doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">Many States have enacted long-arm statutes authorizing courts to exercise specific jurisdiction over manufacturers when the events in suit, or some of them, occurred within the forum state. For example, the \u201cLocal Injury; Foreign Act\u201d subsection of North Carolina\u2019s long-arm statute authorizes North Carolina courts to exercise personal jurisdiction in \u201cany action claiming injury to person or property within this State arising out of [the defendant\u2019s] act or omission outside this State,\u201d if, \u201cin addition[,] at or about the time of the injury,\u201d \u201c[p]roducts . . . manufactured by the defendant were used or consumed, within this State in the ordinary course of trade.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 1\u201475.4(4)(b) (Lexis 2009) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the North Carolina Court of Appeals recognized, this provision of the State\u2019s long-arm statute \u201cdoes not apply to this case,\u201d for both the act alleged to have caused injury (the fabrication of the allegedly defective tire) and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>impact (the</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">[564 U.S. 927]</p>\n<p id=\"A5e\">accident) occurred outside the forum. See 199 N.C. App., at 61, n. 6, 681 S.E.2d, at 390, n. 6.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The North Carolina court\u2019s stream-of-commerce analysis elided the essential difference between case-specific and all-purpose (general) jurisdiction.  Flow of a manufacturer\u2019s products into the forum, we have explained, may bolster an affiliation germane to <em>specific </em>jurisdiction. See, <em>e.g., World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 U.S., at 297, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490 (where \u201cthe sale of a product ... is not simply an isolated occurrence, but arises from the efforts of the manufacturer or distributor to serve . . . the market for its product in [several] States, it is not unreasonable to subject it to suit in one of those States if its allegedly defective merchandise <em>has there been the source of injury to its owner or to </em>others\u201d (emphasis added)). But ties serving to bolster the exercise of specific jurisdiction do not warrant a determination that, based on those ties, the forum has <em>general </em>jurisdiction over a defendant. See, <em>e.g., Stabilisierungsfonds Fur Wein </em>v. <em>Kaiser Stuhl Wine Distributors Pty. Ltd., </em>647 F.2d 200, 203, n. 5 (CADC 1981) (defendants\u2019 marketing arrangements, although \u201cadequate to permit litigation of claims relating to [their] introduction of. . . wine into the United States stream of commerce, . . . would not be adequate to support general, \u2018all purpose\u2019 adjudicatory authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\"> A corporation\u2019s \u201ccontinuous activity of some sorts within a state,\u201d <em>International Shoe </em>instructed, \u201cis not enough to support the demand that the corporation be amenable to suits unrelated to that activity.\u201d 326 U.S., at 318, 66 S.

To the extent that the company was conducting any business during and immediately after the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, it was doing so in Ohio: The corporation\u2019s president maintained his office there, kept the company files in that office, and supervised from the Ohio office \u201cthe necessarily limited wartime activities of the company.\u201d 342 U.S., at 447-448, 72 S. Ct. 413, 96 L. Ed. 485. Although the claim-in-suit did not arise in Ohio, this Court ruled that it would not violate due process for Ohio to adjudicate the controversy. <em>Ibid.; </em>see <em>Keeton </em>v. <em>Hustler Magazine, Inc., </em>465 U.S. 770, 779-780, n. 11, 104 S.

Ed. 2d 790 (1984) (Ohio\u2019s exercise of general jurisdiction was permissible in <em>Perkins </em>because \u201cOhio was the corporation\u2019s principal, if temporary, place of business\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">We next addressed the exercise of general jurisdiction over an out-of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>state corporation over three decades later, in <em>Helic\u00f3pteros. </em>In that case, survivors of United States citizens who died in a helicopter crash in Peru instituted wrongful-death actions in a Texas state court against the owner and operator of the helicopter, a Colombian corporation. The Colombian corporation had no place of business in Texas and was not licensed to do business there. \u201cBasically, [the company\u2019s] contacts with Texas consisted of sending its chief executive officer to Houston for a contract-negotiation session; accepting into its New York bank account checks drawn on a Houston bank; purchasing helicopters, equipment, and training services from [a Texas enterprise] for substantial sums; and sending personnel to [Texas] for training.\u201d 466 U.S., at 416, 104 S. Ct. 1868, 80 L. Ed. 2d 404. These links to Texas, we determined, did not \u201cconstitute the kind of continuous and</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">[564 U.S. 929]</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">systematic general business contacts . . . found to exist in Perkins,\u201d and were insufficient to support the exercise of jurisdiction over a claim that neither \u201car[o]se out of . . . no[r] related to\u201d the defendant\u2019s activities in Texas. <em>Id., </em>at 415-416, 104 S. Ct. 1868, 80 L. Ed. 2d 404 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\"><em>Helic\u00f3pteros </em>concluded that  \u201cmere purchases [made in the forum State], even if occurring at regular intervals, are not enough to warrant a State\u2019s assertion of [general] jurisdiction over a nonresident corporation in a cause of action not related to those purchase transactions.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 418, 104 S. Ct. 1868, 80 L. Ed. 2d 404. We see no reason to differentiate from the ties to Texas held insufficient in <em>Heli-c\u00f3pteros, </em>the sales of petitioners\u2019 tires sporadically made in North Carolina through intermediaries. Under the sprawling view of general jurisdiction urged by respondents and embraced by the North Carolina Court of Appeals, any substantial manufacturer or seller of goods would be amenable to suit, on any claim for relief, wherever its products are distributed. But cf. <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 U.S., at 296, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490 (every seller of chattels does not, by virtue of the sale, \u201cappoint the chattel his agent for service of process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Measured against <em>Helic\u00f3pteros </em>and <em>Perkins, </em>North Carolina is not a forum in which it would be permissible to subject petitioners to general jurisdiction. Unlike the defendant in <em>Perkins, </em>whose sole wartime business activity was conducted in Ohio, petitioners are in no sense at home in North Carolina. Their attenuated connections to the State, see <em>supra, </em>at 921, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 804, fall far short of the \u201cthe continuous and systematic general business contacts\u201d necessary to empower North Carolina to entertain suit against them on claims unrelated to anything that connects them to the State. <em>Helicopteros, </em>466 U.S., at 416, 104 S.

See Brief for Respondents 44-50. In effect, respondents would have us pierce Goodyear corporate veils, at least for jurisdictional purposes. See Brilmayer &amp; Paisley, Personal Jurisdiction and Substantive Legal Relations: Corporations, Conspiracies, and Agency, 74 Cal. L.

App., at 64, 681 S.E.2d, at 392 (North Carolina Court of Appeals understood that petitioners are \u201cseparate corporate entities . . . not directly responsible for the presence in North Carolina of tires that they had manufactured\u201d). Neither below nor in their brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari did respondents urge disregard of petitioners\u2019 discrete status as subsidiaries and treatment of all Goodyear entities as a \u201cunitary business,\u201d so that jurisdiction over the parent would draw in the subsidiaries as well.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Brief for Respondents</p>\n<p id=\"AaQH\">[564 U.S. 931]</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">44.

Respondents portray Goodyear USA\u2019s structure as a reprehensible effort to \u201coutsource\u201d all manufacturing, and correspondingly, tort litigation, to foreign jurisdictions.

Such markings do not necessarily show that any of the tires were destined for sale in the United States.

As earlier noted, see <em>supra, </em>at 922, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 804-805, the North Carolina Court of Appeals invoked the State\u2019s \u201cwell-recognized interest in providing a forum in which its citizens are able to seek redress for injuries that they have sustained.\u2019\u2019 199 N.C. App., at 68, 681 S.E.2d, at 394.  But \u201c[g]eneral jurisdiction to adjudicate has in [United States] practice never been based on the plaintiffs relationship to the forum. There is nothing in [our] law comparable to . . . article 14 of the Civil Code of France (1804) under which the French nationality of the plaintiff is a sufficient ground for jurisdiction.\u2019\u2019 von Mehren &amp; Trautman 1137; see Clermont &amp; Palmer, Exorbitant Jurisdiction, 58 Me. L. Rev. 474, 492-495 (2006) (French law permitting plaintiff-based jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>tion is rarely invoked in the absence of other supporting factors). When a defendant\u2019s act outside the forum causes injury in the forum, by contrast, a plaintiffs residence in the forum may strengthen the case for the exercise of <em>specific jurisdiction. </em>See <em>Calder </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>465 U.S. 783, 788, 104 S.

In the brief they filed in the North Carolina Court of Appeals, respondents stated that petitioners were part of integrated world-wide efforts to design, manufacture, market and sell <em>their tires </em>in the United States, including in North Carolina.\u201d App. 485 (emphasis added). See also Brief in Opposition 18. Read in context, that assertion was offered in support of a narrower proposition: The distribution of petitioners\u2019 tires in North Carolina, respondents maintained, demonstrated petitioners\u2019 own \u201ccalculated and deliberate efforts to take advantage of the North Carolina market.\u201d App. 485. As already explained, see <em>supra, </em>at 929, 180 L.
