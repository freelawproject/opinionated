Ct. 2267, 180 L. Ed. 2d 60 (Scalia, J., dissenting), are crimes of violence under the residual provision of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-22\">\u2022 <em>Derby </em>v. <em>United States, </em>No. 10-8373. Relying on its decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>560 F.3d 948 (2009), the Ninth Circuit held that Oregon\u2019s first-degree burglary statute, Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 164.225 (2009), falls within ACCA\u2019s residual provision. In <em>Mayer, </em>the Ninth Circuit conceded that Oregon\u2019s statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>does not qualify as the enumerated offense of generic \u201cburglary\u201d under ACCA because it applies to unlawful entries into \u201cbooths, vehicles, boats, and aircraft,\u201d 560 F.3d, at 959, and not just buildings and structures. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 598, 110 S. Ct. 2143, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1990). Nevertheless, it held that Oregon\u2019s statute falls within the residual provision, because burglaries under that statute lead to a \u201crisk of a physical confrontation.\u201d 560 F.3d, at 962; but see <em>id., </em>at 952 (Kozinski, C. J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (noting that \u201cOregon prosecutes as burglars people who pose <em>no </em>risk of injury to anyone,\u201d such as an individual who \u201center[ed] public telephone booths to steal change from coin boxes\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-3\">\u2022 <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>No. 10-8607. The Second Circuit, over a dissent, held that the Connecticut offense of \u201crioting at a correctional institution,\u201d Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 53a-179b(a) (2011), which punishes a defendant who \u201cincites, instigates, organizes, connives at, causes, aids, abets, assists or takes part in any disorder, disturbance, strike, riot or other organized disobedience of the rules and regulations of [a correctional] institution,\u201d falls within ACCA\u2019s residual provision. In response to the defendant\u2019s argument that the statute punishes activities such as \u201c \u2018inciting or participating in a hunger strike\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018refusal to work at a prison job,\u2019 \u201d the court reasoned that even \u201chypothetical acts of\u2018passive disobedience\u2019. . . involve deliberate and purposeful conduct.\u201d 616 F.3d 85, 90 (2010). It also held that such activities were risky because \u201cprisons are like powder kegs, where even the slightest disturbance can have explosive consequences.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 94.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-4\">\u2022 <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>No. 10-8768. The Fifth Circuit held that the federal offense of theft of a firearm from a licensed dealer, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(u), falls within ACCA\u2019s residual provision. It held that this offense is \u201cinherently dangerous\u201d because it involves \u201cstealing from a person who probably either possesses or has easy access to firearms,\u201d and because \u201cstolen firearms are more likely to be used in connection with illegal and inherently harmful activities than are lawfully possessed guns.\u201d 623 F.3d 257, 264 (CA5 2010).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-6\">\u2022 <em>Turner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>No. 10-8885. Relying on its decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jamnon, </em>596 F.3d 228 (2010), the Fourth Circuit held that ACCA\u2019s residual provision covers the Virginia offense of larceny from the person, Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2\u201495(i) (Lexis 2009), defined as theft of over $5 in money or goods from another person\u2014in other words, pickpocketing. In <em>Jarmon, </em>the court justified its apparent view that Oliver Twist was a violent felon by noting that larceny \u201crequires the offender to make purposeful, aggressive moves to part the victim from his or her property, creating a . . . risk of violent confrontation\u201d similar to the risk of violent confrontation during burglaries. 596 F.3d, at 232.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">How we would resolve these cases if we granted certiorari would be a fine subject for a law-office betting pool. No one knows for sure. Certainly our most recent decision interpreting ACCA\u2019s residual clause, <em>Sykes </em>v. <em>United States, ante, </em>p. 1, 131 S. Ct. 2267, 180 L. Ed. 2d 60, would be of no help. The \u201crule\u201d we announced there, as far as I can tell, is as follows: A court must compare the degree of risk of the crime in question with the degree of risk of ACCA\u2019s enumerated offenses (burglary, extortion, arson, and crves) as a \u201cbeginning point,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 9, 131 S. Ct. 2267, 180 L. Ed. 2d 60; look at the statistical record, which is not \u201cdispositive\u201d but sometimes confirms \u201ccommonsense conclusion[s],\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 10, 131 S. Ct. 2267, 180 L. Ed. 2d 60; and check whether the crime is \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive,\u201d unless of course the crime is among the unspecified \u201cmany cases\u201d in which that test is \u201credundant with the inquiry into risk,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 13, 131 S. Ct. 2267, 180 L. Ed. 2d 60. And of course given our track record of adding a new animal to our bestiary of ACCA residual-clause standards in each of the four successive cases we have thus far decided, see <em>ante, </em>at 29-31, 131 S. Ct. 2267, 180 L. Ed. 2d 60 (Scalia, J., dissenting), who knows what new beasties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>our fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth tries would produce? Surely a perfectly fair wager.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">If it is uncertain how this Court will apply <em>Sykes </em>and the rest of our ACCA cases going forward, it is even more uncertain how our lower-court colleagues will deal with them. Conceivably, they will simply throw the opinions into the air in frustration, and give free rein to their own feelings as to what offenses should be considered crimes of violence\u2014which, to tell the truth, seems to be what we have done. (Before throwing the opinions into the air, however, they should check whether littering\u2014or littering in a purposeful, violent, and aggressive fashion\u2014is a felony in their jurisdiction. If so, it may be a violent felony under ACCA; or perhaps not.)</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Since our ACCA cases are incomprehensible to judges, the statute obviously does not give \u201cperson [s] of ordinary intelligence fair notice\u201d of its reach. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114, 123, 123, 99 S. Ct. 2198, 60 L. Ed. 2d 755 (1979) (internal quotation marks omitted). I would grant certiorari, declare ACCA\u2019s residual provision to be unconstitutionally vague, and ring down the curtain on the ACCA farce playing in federal courts throughout the Nation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
