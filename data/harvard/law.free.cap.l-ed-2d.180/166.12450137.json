Rule 10b-5 prohibits \u201cmak[ing] any untrue statement of a material fact\u201d in connection with the purchase or sale of</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">[564 U.S. 138]</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">securities. 17 CFR \u00a7 240.10b-5 (2010). We conclude that JCM cannot be held liable because it did not make the statements in the prospectuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">Janus Capital Group, Inc. (JCG), is a publicly traded company that created the Janus family of mutual funds. These mutual funds are organized in a Massachusetts business trust, the Janus Investment Fund. Janus Investment Fund retained JCG\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, JCM, to be its investment adviser and administrator. JCG and JCM are the petitioners here.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">Although JCG created Janus Investment Fund, Janus Investment Fund is a separate legal entity owned entirely by mutual fund investors. Janus Investment Fund has no assets apart from those owned by the investors. JCM provides Janus Investment Fund with investment advisory services, which include \u201cthe management and administrative services necessary for the operation of [Janus] Fun[d],\u201d App. 225a, but the two entities maintain legal independence. At all times relevant to this case, all of the officers of Janus Investment Fund were also officers of JCM, but only one member of Janus Investment Fund\u2019s board of trustees was associated with JCM. This is more independence than is required:  By statute, up to 60 percent of the board of a mutual fund may be composed of \u201cinterested persons.\u201d See 54 Stat. 806, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-10(a); see also see also \u00a7 80a-2(a)(19) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV) (defining \u201cinterested person\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-13\">As the securities laws require, Janus Investment Fund issued prospectuses describing the investment strategy and operations of its mutual funds to investors. See \u00a7\u00a7 77b(a)(10), 77e(b)(2), 80a-8(b), 80a-2(a)(31), 80a-29(a)-(b) (2006 ed.). The prospectuses for several funds represented that the funds were not suitable for market timing and can be read to suggest that JCM would implement policies to</p>\n<p id=\"b214-15\">[564 U.S. 139]</p>\n<p id=\"ADLP\">curb the practice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For example, the Janus Mercury Fund prospectus dated February 25, 2002, stated that the fund was \u201cnot intended for market timing or exces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>sive trading\u201d and represented that it \u201cmay reject any purchase request . . . if it believes that any combination of trading activity is attributable to market timing or is otherwise excessive or potentially disruptive to the Fund.\u201d App. 141a. Although market timing is legal, it harms other investors in the mutual fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">In September 2003, the attorney general of the State of New York filed a complaint against JCG and JCM alleging that JCG entered into secret arrangements to permit market timing in several funds run by JCM. After the complaint\u2019s allegations became public, investors withdrew significant amounts of money from the Janus Investment Fund mutual funds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Janus Investment Fund compensated JCM based on the total value of the funds and JCM\u2019s management</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">[564 U.S. 140]</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">fees constituted a significant percentage of JCG\u2019s income, Janus Investment Fund\u2019s loss of value affected JCG\u2019s value as well. JCG\u2019s stock price fell nearly 25 percent, from $17.68 on September 2 to $13.50 on September 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Respondent First Derivative Traders (First Derivative) represents a class of plaintiffs who owned JCG stock as of September 3, 2003. Its complaint asserts claims against JCG and JCM for violations of Rule 10b-5 and \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b). First Derivative alleges that JCG and JCM \u201ccaused mutual fund prospectuses to be issued for Janus mutual funds and made them available to the investing public, which created the misleading impression that [JCG and JCM] would implement measures to curb market timing in the Janus [mutual funds].\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a. \u201cHad the truth been known, Janus [mutual funds] would have been less attractive to investors, and consequently, [JCG] would have realized lower revenues, so [JCG\u2019s] stock would have traded at lower prices.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 72a.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">First Derivative contends that JCG and JCM \u201cmaterially misled the investing public\u201d and that class members relied \u201cupon the integrity of the market price of [JCG] securities and market information relating to [JCG and JCM].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 109a. The complaint also alleges that JCG should be held liable for the acts of JCM as a \u201ccontrolling person\u201d under \u00a7 78t(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (\u00a7 20(a) of the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>In re Mutual Funds Inv. Litigation, </em>487 F. Supp. 2d 618, 620 (D Md. 2007). The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that First Derivative</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">[564 U.S. 141]</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">had sufficiently alleged that \u201cJCG and JCM, by participating in the writing and dissemination of the prospectuses, <em>made </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>misleading statements contained in the documents.\u201d <em>In re Mutual Funds Inv. Litigation, </em>566 F.3d 111, 121 (2009) (emphasis in original). With respect to the element of reliance, the court found that investors would infer that JCM \u201cplayed a role in preparing or approving the content of the Janus fund prospectuses,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 127, but that investors would not infer the same about JCG, which could be liable only as a \u201ccontrol person\u201d of JCM under \u00a7 20(a). <em>Id., </em>at 128, 129-130.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">We granted certiorari to address whether JCM can be held liable in a private action under Rule 10b-5 for false statements included in Janus Investment Fund\u2019s prospectuses. 561 U.S. 1024, 130 S. Ct. 3499, 177 L. Ed. 2d 1088 (2010).  Under Rule 10b-5, it is unlawful for \u201cany person, directly or indirectly,. . . [t]o make any untrue statement of a material fact\u201d in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. 17 CFR \u00a7 240.10b-5(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To be liable, therefore, JCM must have \u201cmade\u201d the material misstatements in the prospectuses. We hold that it did not.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The SEC promulgated Rule 10b-5 pursuant to authority granted under \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">[564 U.S. 142]</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b).  Although neither Rule 10b-5 nor \u00a7 10(b) expressly creates a private right of action, this Court has held that \u201ca private right of action is implied under \u00a7 10(b).\u201d <em>Superintendent of Ins. of N. Y. </em>v. <em>Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>404 U.S. 6, 13, n. 9, 92 S. Ct. 165, 30 L. Ed. 2d 128 (1971). That holding \u201cremains the law,\u201d <em>Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC </em>v. <em>Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., </em>552 U.S. 148, 165, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627 (2008), but \u201c[c]oncerns with the judicial creation of a private cause of action caution against its expansion,\u201d <em>ibid. </em>Thus, in analyzing whether JCM \u201cmade\u201d the statements for purposes of Rule 10b-5, we are mindful that we must give \u201cnarrow dimensions ... to a right of action Congress did not authorize when it first enacted the statute and did not expand when it revisited the law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 167, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">One \u201cmakes\u201d a statement by stating it. When \u201cmake\u201d is paired with a noun expressing the action of a verb, the resulting phrase is \u201capproximately equivalent in sense\u201d to that verb. 6 Oxford English Dictionary 66 (def. 59) (1933) (hereinafter OED); accord, Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 1485 (def. 43) (2d ed. 1934) <em>(\u201cMake </em>followed by a noun with the indefinite article is often nearly equivalent to the verb intransitive corresponding to that noun\u201d). For instance, \u201cto make a proclamation\u201d is the approximate equivalent of \u201cto pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>claim,\u201d and \u201cto make a promise\u201d approximates \u201cto promise.\u201d See 6 OED 66 (def. 59). The phrase at issue in Rule 10b-5, \u201c[t]o make any . . . statement,\u201d is thus the approximate equivalent of \u201cto state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">For purposes of Rule 10b-5, the maker of a statement is the person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement, including its content and whether and how to communicate it. Without control, a person or entity can merely suggest what to say, not \u201cmake\u201d a statement in its own right. One who prepares or publishes a statement on behalf of another is not its maker. And in the ordinary case, attribution within a statement or implicit from surrounding circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">[564 U.S. 143]</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">is strong evidence that a statement was made by\u2014and only by\u2014the party to whom it is attributed. This rule might best be exemplified by the relationship between a speechwriter and a speaker. Even when a speechwriter drafts a speech, the content is entirely within the control of the person who delivers it. And it is the speaker who takes credit\u2014or blame\u2014for what is ultimately said.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">This rule follows from <em>Central Bank of Denver, N. A. </em>v. <em>First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., </em>511 U.S. 164, 114 S. Ct. 1439, 128 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1994), in which we held that  Rule 10b-5\u2019s private right of action does not include suits against aiders and abettors. See <em>id., </em>at 180, 114 S. Ct. 1439, 128 L. Ed. 2d 119. Such suits\u2014 against entities that contribute \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to the making of a statement but do not actually make it\u2014may be brought by the SEC, see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(e), but not by private parties. A broader reading of \u201cmake,\u201d including persons or entities without ultimate control over the content of a statement, would substantially undermine <em>Central Bank. </em>If persons or entities without control over the content of a statement could be considered primary violators who \u201cmade\u201d the statement, then aiders and abettors would be almost nonexistent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">This interpretation is further supported by our recent decision in <em>Stoneridge. </em>There, investors sued \u201centities who, acting both as customers and suppliers, agreed to arrangements that allowed the investors\u2019 company to mislead its auditor</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">[564 U.S. 144]</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">and issue a misleading financial statement.\u201d 552 U.S., at 152-153, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627. We held that dismissal of the complaint was proper because the public could not have relied on the entities\u2019 undisclosed deceptive acts. <em>Id., </em>at 166-167, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627. Significantly, in reaching that conclusion we emphasized that \u201cnothing [the defendants] did made it necessary or inevitable for [the company] to record the transactions as it did.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 161, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Ed. 2d 627.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This emphasis suggests the rule we adopt today: that  the maker of a statement is the entity with authority over the content of the statement and whether and how to communicate it. Without such authority, it is not \u201cnecessary or inevitable\u201d that any falsehood will be contained in the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Our holding also accords with the narrow scope that we must give the implied private right of action. <em>Id., </em>at 167, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627. Although the existence of the private right is now settled, we will not expand liability beyond the person or entity that ultimately has authority over a false statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The Government contends that \u201cmake\u201d should be defined as \u201ccreate.\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>14-15 (citing Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 1485 (2d ed. 1958) (defining \u201cmake\u201d as \u201c[t]o cause to exist, appear, or occur\u201d)). This definition, although perhaps appropriate when \u201cmake\u201d is directed at an object unassociated with a verb <em>(e.g., </em>\u201cto make a chair\u201d), fails to capture its meaning when directed at an object expressing the action of a verb.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Adopting the Government\u2019s definition of \u201cmake\u201d would also lead to results inconsistent with our precedent. The Government\u2019s definition would permit private plaintiffs</p>\n<p id=\"AUn\">[564 U.S. 145]</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">to sue a person who \u201cprovides the false or misleading information that another person then puts into the statement.\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>13.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But in <em>Stoneridge, </em>we rejected a private Rule 10b-5 suit against companies involved in deceptive transactions, even when information about those transactions was later incorporated into false public statements. 552 U.S., at 161, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627. We see no reason to treat participating in the drafting of a false statement differently from engaging in deceptive transactions, when each is merely an undisclosed act preceding the decision of an independent entity to make a public statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">For its part, First Derivative suggests that the \u201cwell-recognized and uniquely close relationship between a mutual fund and its investment adviser\u201d should inform our decision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Brief for Respondent 21. It suggests that an investment adviser should generally be understood to be the \u201cmaker\u201d of statements by its client mutual fund, like a playwright whose lines are delivered by an actor. We decline this invitation to disregard the corporate form. Although First Derivative and its <em>amici </em>persuasively argue that investment advisers</p>\n<p id=\"APU\">[564 U.S. 146]</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">exercise significant influence over their client funds, see <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Harris Associates L. P., </em>559 U.S. 335, 338, 130 S. Ct. 1418, 176 L. Ed. 2d 265 (2010), it is undisputed that the corporate formalities were observed here. JCM and Janus Investment Fund remain legally separate entities, and Janus Investment Fund\u2019s board of trustees was more independent than the statute requires. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-10 (2006 ed.).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n                   Any reapportionment of liability in the securities industry in light of the close relationship between investment advisers and mutual funds is properly the responsibility of Congress and not the courts. Moreover, just as with the Government\u2019s theory, First Derivative\u2019s rule would create the broad liability that we rejected in <em>Stoneridge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Congress also has established liability in \u00a7 20(a) for \u201c[e]very person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable\u201d for violations of the securities laws. \u00a7 78t(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). First Derivative\u2019s theory of liability based on a relationship of influence resembles the liability imposed by Congress for control. To adopt First Derivative\u2019s theory would read into Rule 10b-5 a theory of liability similar to\u2014but broader in application than, see <em>post, </em>at 156, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 183\u2014what Congress has already created expressly elsewhere.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Under this rule, JCM did not \u201cmake\u201d any of the statements in the Janus Investment Fund prospectuses; Janus Investment</p>\n<p id=\"ABL\">[564 U.S. 147]</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Fund did. Only Janus Investment Fund\u2014not JCM\u2014bears the statutory obligation to file the prospectuses with the SEC. \u00a7\u00a7 77e(b)(2), 80a-8(b), 80a-29(a)-(b); see also 17 CFR \u00a7 230.497 (imposing requirements on \u201cinvestment companies\u201d). The SEC has recorded that Janus Investment Fund filed the prospectuses. See JIF Group 1 Standalone Prospectuses (Feb. 25, 2002), online at http://www. sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/277 751/ 000027775102000049/0000277751-02-000049.txt (as visited June 10, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (recording the \u201cFiler\u201d of the Janus Mercury Fund prospectus as \u201cJanus Investment Fund\u201d). There is no allegation that JCM in fact filed the prospectuses and falsely attributed them to Janus Investment Fund. Nor did anything on the face of the prospectuses indicate that any statements therein came from JCM rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>than Janus Investment Fund\u2014a legally independent entity with its own board of trustees.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">First Derivative suggests that both JCM and Janus Investment Fund might have \u201cmade\u201d the misleading statements</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">[564 U.S. 148]</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">within the meaning of Rule 10b-5 because JCM was significantly involved in preparing the prospectuses. But this assistance, subject to the ultimate control of Janus Investment Fund, does not mean that JCM \u201cmade\u201d any statements in the prospectuses. Although JCM, like a speechwriter, may have assisted Janus Investment Fund with crafting what Janus Investment Fund said in the prospectuses, JCM itself did not \u201cmake\u201d those statements for purposes of Rule lOb-5.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAZd\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"48\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAWoAAAAvAQAAAADiQb0lAAAAm0lEQVR4nGP8z0ACOMhEimoGhlHlo8oHp/J/yIK4OTDlv5EFcXPo4vb/jU8QYrg5MOX/jiCJ4ebAlDM9eIAkhpMDU85YcAYhhpsD92ryByRB3BxGaLH0kx1JECcHXiydbUBSgZsDU+7BgSSImwMLdwEbhBhuDjzcFRQQYrg5MOXMNiIIMdwcckOGSECmcmTr8XAGZUkwqnxQKwcAEhU4bwLxMQgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"362\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">The statements in the Janus Investment Fund prospectuses were made by Janus Investment Fund, not by JCM.

Market timing is a trading strategy that exploits time delay in mutual funds\u2019 daily valuation system. The price for buying or selling shares of a mutual fund is ordinarily determined by the next net asset value (NAV) calculation after the order is placed. The NAV calculation usually happens once a day, at the close of the major U. S. markets. Because of certain time delays, however, the values used in these calculations do not always accurately reflect the true value of the underlying assets. For example, a fund may value its foreign securities based on the price at the close of the foreign market, which may have occurred several hours before the calculation. But events might have taken place after the close of the foreign market that could be expected to affect their price. If the event were expected to increase the price of the foreign securities, a market-timing investor could buy shares of a mutual fund at the artificially low NAV and sell the next day when the NAV <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>corrects itself upward.

We note, however, that we have previously expressed skepticism over the degree to which the SEC should receive deference regarding the private right of action.

First Derivative suggests that \u201cindirectly\u201d in Rule 10b-5 may broaden the meaning of \u201cmake.\u201d We disagree.  The phrase \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d is set off by itself in Rule 10b-5 and modifies not just \u201cto make,\u201d but also \u201cto employ\u201d and \u201cto engage.\u201d We think the phrase merely clarifies that as long as a statement is made, it does not matter whether the statement was communicated directly or indirectly to the recipient. A different understanding of \u201cindirectly\u201d would, like a broad definition of \u201cmake,\u201d threaten to erase the line between primary violators and aiders and abettors established by <em>Central Bank.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-18\">In this case, we need not define precisely what it means to communicate a \u201cmade\u201d statement indirectly because none of the statements in the prospectuses were attributed, explicitly or implicitly, to JCM. Without attribution, there is no indication that Janus Investment Fund was quoting or otherwise repeating a statement originally \u201cmade\u201d by JCM. Cf. <em>Anixter </em>v. <em>Home-Stake Production Co., </em>77 F.3d 1215, 1220, and n. 4 (CA10 1996) (quoting a signed \u201c \u2018Auditor\u2019s Report\u2019 \u201d included in a prospectus); <em>Basic, supra, </em>at 227, n. 4, 108 S.

That JCM provided access to Janus Investment Fund\u2019s prospectuses on its Web site is also not a basis for liability.

Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>577 F.3d 442, 448 (CA2 2009) (involving the issuance of false press releases through innocent companies). In doing so, we do not think JCM made any of the statements in Janus Investment Fund\u2019s prospectuses for purposes of Rule 10b-5 liability, just as we do not think that the SEC \u201cmakes\u201d the statements in the many prospectuses available on its Web site.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b220-7\">SEPARATE OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b220-8\">Justice Breyer,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqd1\">with whom Justice Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">This case involves a private Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-5 action brought by a group of investors against Janus Capital Group, Inc., and Janus Capital Management LLC (Janus Management), a firm that acted as an investment adviser to a family of mutual funds (collectively, the Janus Fund or Fund). The investors claim</p>\n<p id=\"AKu\">[564 U.S. 149]</p>\n<p id=\"b220-15\">that Janus Management knowingly made materially false or misleading statements that appeared in prospectuses issued by the Janus Fund.

Each of the Fund\u2019s officers is a Janus Management employee. Janus Management, acting through those employees (and other of its employees), manages the purchase, sale, redemption, and distribution of the Fund\u2019s investments. Janus Management prepares, modifies, and implements the Janus Fund\u2019s long-term strategies. And Janus Management, acting through those employees, carries out the Fund\u2019s daily activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Rule 10b-5 says in relevant part that it is unlawful for \u201cany person, directly or indirectly . .. <em>[t]o make </em>any untrue statement of a material fact\u201d in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. 17 CFR \u00a7 240.10b-5(b) (2010) (emphasis added). See also 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (\u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). The specific legal question before us is whether Janus Management can be held responsible under the Rule for having \u201cma[d]e\u201d certain false statements about the Janus Fund\u2019s activities. The statements in question appear in the Janus Fund\u2019s prospectuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The Court holds that only the Janus Fund, not Janus Management, could have \u201cma[d]e\u201d those statements. The majority points out that the Janus Fund\u2019s board of trustees has \u201cultimate authority\u201d over the content of the statements in a Fund prospectus. And in the majority\u2019s view, only \u201cthe person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement, including its content and whether and how to communicate it,\u201d can \u201cmake\u201d a statement within the terms of Rule 10b-5. <em>Ante, </em>at 142, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In my view, however, the majority has incorrectly interpreted the Rule\u2019s word \u201cmake.\u201d Neither common English</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">[564 U.S. 150]</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">nor this Court\u2019s earlier cases limit the scope of that word to those with \u201cultimate authority\u201d over a statement\u2019s content. To the contrary, both language and case law indicate that, depending upon the circumstances, a management company, a board of trustees, individual company officers, or others, separately or together, might \u201cmake\u201d statements contained in a firm\u2019s prospectus\u2014even if a board of directors has ultimate content-related responsibility. And the circumstances here are such that a court could find that Janus Management made the statements in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">Respondent\u2019s complaint sets forth the basic elements of a typical Rule 10b-5 \u201cfraud on the market\u201d claim. It alleges that Janus Management made statements that \u201ccreated the misleading impression that\u201d it \u201cwould implement measures to curb\u201d a trading strategy called \u201cmarket timing.\u201d Second Amended Complaint \u00b6 6 (hereinafter Complaint), App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a. The complaint adds that Janus Management knew that these \u201cmarket timing\u201d statements were false; that the statements were material; that the market, in pricing securities (including related securities) relied upon the statements; that as a result, when the truth came out (that Janus Management indeed permitted \u201cmarket timing\u201d in the Janus Fund), the price of relevant shares fell; and the false statements thereby caused respondent significant economic losses. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 4-10, <em>id., </em>at 60a-63a. Cf. <em>Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC </em>v. <em>Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., </em>552 U.S. 148, 157, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 627 (2008) (identifying the elements of \u201ca typical \u00a7 10(b) private action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The majority finds the complaint fatally flawed, however, because (1) Rule 10b-5 says that no \u201cperson\u201d shall \u201cdirectly or indirectly . . . <em>make </em>any untrue statement of a material fact,\u201d (2) the statements at issue appeared in the <em>Janus Fund\u2019s </em>prospectuses, and (3) only \u201cthe person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement, including its content</p>\n<p id=\"A8P\">[564 U.S. 151]</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">and whether and how to communicate it\u201d can \u201cmake\u201d a false statement. <em>Ante, </em>at 138-139, 141-143, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 172-173, 174-175.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">But where can the majority find legal support for the rule that it enunciates? The English language does not impose upon the word \u201cmake\u201d boundaries of the kind the majority finds determinative. Every day, hosts of corporate officials make statements with content that more senior officials or the board of directors have \u201cultimate authority\u201d to control. So do cabinet officials make statements about matters that the Constitution places within the ultimate authority of the President. So do thousands, perhaps millions, of other employees make statements that, as to content, form, or timing, are subject to the control of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Nothing in the English language prevents one from saying that several different individuals, separately or together, \u201cmake\u201d a statement that each has a hand in producing. For example, as a matter of English, one can say that a national political party has made a statement even if the only written communication consists of uniform press releases issued in the name of local party branches; one can say that one foreign nation has made a statement even when the officials of a different nation (subject to its influence) speak about the matter; and one can say that the President has made a statement even if his press officer issues a communication, sometimes in the press officer\u2019s own name. Practical matters related to context, including control, participation, and relevant audience, help determine who \u201cmakes\u201d a statement and to whom that statement may properly be \u201cattributed,\u201d see <em>ante, </em>at 147, n. 11, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 178\u2014at least as far as ordinary English is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Neither can the majority find support in any relevant precedent. The majority says that its rule \u201cfollows from <em>Central Bank of Denver, N. A. </em>v. <em>First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., </em>511 U.S. 164 [114 S. Ct. 1439, 128 L. Ed. 2d 119] (1994),\u201d in which the Court \u201cheld that Rule 10b-5\u2019s private right of action does not include suits against aiders and abettors.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 143, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 175. But <em>Central</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">[564 U.S. 152]</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\"><em>Bank </em>concerns a different matter. And it no more requires the majority\u2019s rule than free air travel for small children requires free air travel for adults.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\"><em>Central Bank </em>is a case about <em>secondary </em>liability, liability attaching, not to an individual making a false statement, but to an individual helping <em>someone else </em>do so. <em>Central Bank </em>involved a bond issuer accused of having made materially false statements, which overstated the values of property that backed the bonds. <em>Central Bank </em>also involved a defendant that was a bank, serving as indenture trustee, which was supposed to check the bond issuer\u2019s valuations. The plaintiffs claimed that the bank delayed its valuation checks and thereby <em>helped </em>the issuer make its false statements credible. The ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>tion before the Court concerned the bank\u2019s liability\u2014a <em>secondary </em>liability for \u201caiding and abetting\u201d the bond issuer, who (on the theory set forth) was primarily liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The Court made this clear. The question presented was \u201cwhether private civil liability under \u00a7 10(b) extends ... to those <em>who do not engage in the manipulative or deceptive practice, </em>but who aid and abet the violation.\u201d 511 U.S., at 167, 114 S. Ct. 1439, 128 L. Ed. 2d 119 (emphasis added). The Court wrote that \u201caiding and abetting liability reaches persons <em>who do not engage in the proscribed, activities at all, </em>but who give a degree of aid to those who do.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 176 (emphasis added). The Court described civil law \u201caiding and abetting\u201d as \u201c \u2018knowing] that <em>the other\u2019s conduct constitutes a breach of duty </em>and giv[ing] substantial assistance or encouragement to the other ....\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 181, 114 S. Ct. 1439, 128 L. Ed. 2d 119 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 876(b) (1977); emphasis added). And it reviewed a Court of Appeals decision that had defined the elements of aiding and abetting as \u201c(1) <em>a primary violation </em>of \u00a7 10(b); (2) recklessness by the aider and abettor as to the existence of the primary violation; and (3) <em>substantial assistance given to the primary violator </em>by the aider and abettor.\u201d 511 U.S., at 168, 114 S. Ct. 1439, 128 L. Ed. 2d 119 (emphasis added). Faced with this question,</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">[564 U.S. 153]</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">the Court answered that \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 do not provide for this kind of \u201caiding and abetting\u201d liability in private suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">By way of contrast, the present case is about <em>primary </em>liability\u2014about individuals who allegedly themselves \u201cmake\u201d materially false statements, not about those who help <em>others </em>to do so. The question is whether Janus Management is <em>pnmanly </em>liable for violating the Act, not whether it simply helped others violate the Act. The <em>Central Bank </em>defendant concededly did <em>not </em>make the false statements in question (others did), while here the defendants allegedly <em>did. </em>make those statements. And a rule (the majority\u2019s rule) absolving those who allegedly <em>did. </em>make false statements does not \u201cfollow from\u201d a rule <em>(Central Bank\u2019s </em>rule) absolving those who concededly did <em>not </em>do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">The majority adds that to interpret the word \u201cmake\u201d as including those \u201cwithout ultimate control over the content of a statement\u201d would \u201csubstantially undermine\u201d <em>Central Bank\u2019s </em>holding. Ante, at 143, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 175. Would it? The Court in <em>Central Bank </em>specifically wrote that its holding did</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-11\">\u201cnot mean that secondary actors in the securities markets are always free from liability under the securities Acts. <em>Any person or entity, including a lawyer, accountant, or bank., who </em>employs a manipulative device or <em>makes a material misstatement </em>(or omission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies <em>may be liable as a primary violator under 10b-5, </em>assuming <em>all </em>of the requirements for primary liability under Rule 10b-5 are met.\u201d 511 U.S., at 191, 114 S. Ct. 1439, 128 L. Ed. 2d 119 (some emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">Thus, as far as <em>Central Bank </em>is concerned, depending upon the circumstances, board members, senior firm officials, officials tasked to develop a marketing document, large investors, or others (taken together or separately) all might \u201cmake\u201d materially false statements subjecting themselves to</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">[564 U.S. 154]</p>\n<p id=\"b223-14\">primary liability. The ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>jority\u2019s rule does not protect, it <em>extends, Central Bank\u2019s </em>holding of no-liability into new territory that <em>Central Bank </em>explicitly placed outside that holding. And by ignoring the language in which <em>Central Bank </em>did so, the majority\u2019s rule itself undermines <em>Central Bank. </em>Where is the legal support for the majority\u2019s \u201cdraw[ing] a clean line,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 143, n. 6, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 175, that so seriously conflicts with <em>Central Bank? </em>Indeed, where is the legal support for the majority\u2019s suggestion that plaintiffs must show some kind of \u201cattribution\u201d of a statement to a defendant, <em>ante, </em>at 147, n. 11, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 178\u2014if it means plaintiffs must show, not only that the defendant \u201cma[d]e\u201d the statement, but something more?</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The majority also refers to <em>Stoneridge, </em>but that case offers it no help. In <em>Stoneridge, </em>firms that supplied electronic equipment to a cable television company agreed with the cable television company to enter into a series of fraudulent sales and purchases, for example, a sale at an unusually high price, thereby providing funds which the suppliers would use to buy advertising from the cable television company. These arrangements enabled the cable television company to fool its accountants (and ultimately the public) into believing that it had more revenue (for example, advertising revenue) than it really had. As part of the agreement, the companies exchanged letters and backdated contracts to conceal the fraud. Investors subsequently sued the cable television company, some of its officers, its auditors, and the equipment suppliers, as well, claiming that all of them had engaged in a scheme to defraud securities purchasers. In respect to most of the defendants, investors identified allegedly materially false statements contained in the cable television company\u2019s financial statements or similar documents. But in respect to the equipment suppliers, investors claimed that the relevant deceptive conduct was in the letters, backdated contracts, and related oral conversations about the scheme. The investors argued that the</p>\n<p id=\"ABy\">[564 U.S. 155]</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">equipment suppliers, \u201cby participating in the transactions,\u201d violated \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. <em>Stoneridge, </em>552 U.S., at 155, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The Court held that the equipment suppliers could not be found liable for securities fraud in a private suit under \u00a7 10(b). But in doing so, it did not deny that the equipment suppliers <em>had. made </em>the false statements contained in the letters, contracts, and conversations. See <em>id., </em>at 158-159, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627. Rather, the Court said the issue in the case was whether \u201cany deceptive statement or act respondents made was not actionable because it did not have the requisite <em>proximate relation </em>to the investors\u2019 harm.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). And it held that these deceptive statements or actions could not provide a basis for liability because the investors could not prove sufficient <em>reliance </em>upon the particular false statements that the equipment suppliers had made.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">The Court pointed out that the equipment suppliers \u201chad no duty to disclose; and their deceptive acts were not communicated to the public.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 159, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627. And the Court went on to say that \u201cas a result,\u201d the investors \u201ccannot show reliance upon any\u201d of the equipment suppliers\u2019 actions, \u201cexcept in an indirect chain that we find too remote for liability.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">\u201c[The equipment suppliers\u2019] decep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>tive acts, which were not disclosed to the investing public, are too remote to satisfy the requirement of reliance. It was [the cable company], not [the equipment suppliers], that misled its auditor and filed fraudulent financial statements; nothing [the equipment suppliers] did made it necessary or inevitable for [the cable company] to record the transactions as it did.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 161, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Insofar as the equipment suppliers\u2019 conduct was at issue, the fraudulent \u201carrangement . . . took place in the marketplace for goods and services, not in the investment sphere.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 166, 128 S. Ct. 761, 169 L. Ed. 2d 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">[564 U.S. 156]</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">It is difficult for me to see how <em>Stoneridge </em>\u201csupport[s]\u201d the majority\u2019s rule. <em>Ante, </em>at 143, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 175. No one in <em>Stoneridge </em>disputed the <em>making </em>of the relevant statements, the fraudulent contracts, and the like. And no one in <em>Stoneridge </em>contended that the equipment suppliers were, in fact, the <em>makers </em>of the cable company\u2019s misstatements. Rather, <em>Stoneridge </em>was concerned with whether the equipment suppliers\u2019 <em>separate </em>statements were sufficiently disclosed in the securities marketplace so as to be the basis for investor reliance. They were not. But this is a different inquiry than whether statements acknowledged to have been disclosed in the securities marketplace and ripe for reliance can be said to have been \u201cma[d]e\u201d by one or another actor. How then does <em>Stoneridge </em>support the majority\u2019s new rule?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The majority adds that its rule is necessary to avoid \u201ca theory of liability similar to\u2014but broader in application than\u201d\u2014\u00a7 20(a)\u2019s liability, for \u201c \u2018[e]very person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable\u2019 for violations of the securities laws.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 146, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 177 (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a)). But that is not so. This Court has explained that the possibility of an express remedy under the securities laws does not preclude a claim under \u00a7 10(b). <em>Herman &amp; MacLean </em>v. <em>Huddleston, </em>459 U.S. 375, 388, 103 S. Ct. 683, 74 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">More importantly, a person who is liable under \u00a7 20(a) controls another <em>\u201cperson\u201d who is \u201cliable\u201d </em>for a securities violation. <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>National Australia Bank Ltd., </em>561 U.S. 247, 253, n. 2, 130 S. Ct. 2869, 177 L. Ed. 2d 535 (2010) (\u201cLiability under \u00a7 20(a) is obviously derivative of liability under some other provision of the Exchange Act\u201d). We here examine whether a person is primarily liable whether they do, or they do not, control another person <em>who is liable. </em>That is to say, here, the liability of some \u201cother person\u201d is not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">And there is at least one significant category of cases that \u00a7 10(b) may address that derivative forms of liability, such as under \u00a7 20(a), cannot, namely, cases in which one actor exploits another as an innocent intermediary for its misstatements.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">[564 U.S. 157]</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">Here, it may well be that the Fund\u2019s board of trustees knew nothing about the falsity of the prospectuses. See, <em>e.g., In re Lammert, </em>Release No. 348, 93 S. E. C. Docket 5676, 5700 (2008) (Janus Management was aware of market timing in the Janus Fund no later than 2002, but \u201c[t]his knowledge was never shared with the Board\u201d). And if so, \u00a7 20(a) would not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">The possibility of guilty management and innocent board is the 13th stroke of the new rule\u2019s clock. What is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>to happen when guilty management writes a prospectus (for the board) containing materially false statements and fools both board and public into believing they are true? Apparently under the majority\u2019s rule, in such circumstances <em>no one </em>could be found to have \u201cma[d]e\u201d a materially false statement\u2014even though under the common law the managers would likely have been guilty or liable (in analogous circumstances) for doing so as <em>principals </em>(and not as aiders and abettors). See, <em>e.g., </em>2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 13.1(a) (2d ed. 2003); 1 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 617 (1736); Perkins, Parties to Crime, 89 U. Pa. L. Rev. 581, 583 (1941) (one is guilty as a principal when one uses an innocent third party to commit a crime); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 533 (1976). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Giles, </em>300 U.S. 41, 48-49, 57 S. Ct. 340, 81 L. Ed. 493 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Indeed, under the majority\u2019s rule it seems unlikely that the SEC itself in such circumstances could exercise the authority Congress has granted it to pursue primary violators who \u201cmake\u201d false statements or the authority that Congress has specifically provided to prosecute aiders and abettors to securities violations. See \u00a7 104, 109 Stat. 757 (codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(e)) (granting SEC authority to prosecute aiders and abettors). That is because the managers, not having \u201cma[d]e\u201d the statement, would not be liable as principals and there would be no other primary violator they might have tried to \u201caid\u201d or \u201cabet.\u201d <em>Ibid.; SEC </em>v. <em>DiBella, </em>587 F.3d 553, 566 (CA2 2009) (prosecution for aiding and abetting requires</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">[564 U.S. 158]</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">primary violation to which offender gave \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">If the majority believes, as its footnote hints, that \u00a7 20(b) could provide a basis for liability in this case, <em>ante, </em>at 146, n. 10, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 177, then it should remand the case for possible amendment of the complaint. \u201cThere is a dearth of authority construing Section 20(b),\u201d which has been thought largely \u201csuperfluous in 10b-5 cases.\u201d 5B A. Jacobs, Disclosure and Remedies Under the Securities Law \u00a7 11-8, p. 11-72 (2011). Hence respondent, who reasonably thought that it referred to the proper securities law provision, is faultless for failing to mention \u00a7 20(b) as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">In sum, I can find nothing in \u00a7 10(b) or in Rule 10b-5, its language, its history, or in precedent suggesting that Congress, in enacting the securities laws, intended a loophole of the kind that the majority\u2019s rule may well create.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Rejecting the majority\u2019s rule, of course, does not decide the question before us. We must still determine whether, in light of the complaint\u2019s allegations, Janus Management could have \u201cma[d]e\u201d the false statements in the prospectuses at issue. In my view, the answer to this question is \u201cYes.\u201d The specific relationships alleged among Janus Management, the Janus Fund, and the prospectus statements warrant the conclusion that Janus Management did \u201cmake\u201d those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">In part, my conclusion reflects the fact that this Court and lower courts have made clear that at least <em>sometimes </em>corporate officials and others can be held liable under Rule 10b-5 for having \u201cma[d]e\u201d a materially false statement even when that statement appears in a document (or is made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>a third person) that the officials do not legally control. In <em>Herman &amp; MacLean, </em>for example, this Court pointed out that \u201ccertain individuals who play a part in preparing the registration statement,\u201d including corporate officers, lawyers, and</p>\n<p id=\"Al8\">[564 U.S. 159]</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">accountants, may be primarily liable even where \u201cthey are not named as having prepared or certified\u201d the registration statement. 459 U.S., at 386, n. 22, 103 S. Ct. 683, 74 L. Ed. 2d 548. And as I have already pointed out, this Court wrote in <em>Central Bank </em>that a \u201clawyer, accountant, or bank, who . . . makes a material misstatement (or omission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies <em>may be liable as a primary violator under 10b-5, </em>assuming <em>all </em>of the requirements for primary liability under Rule 10b-5 are met.\u201d 511 U.S., at 191, 114 S. Ct. 1439, 128 L. Ed. 2d 119 (some emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Given the statements in our opinions, it is not surprising that lower courts have found primary liability for actors without \u201cultimate authority\u201d over issued statements. One court, for example, concluded that an accountant could be primarily liable for having \u201cma[d]e\u201d false statements, where he issued fraudulent opinion and certification letters reproduced in prospectuses, annual reports, and other corporate materials for which he was not ultimately responsible. <em>Anixter </em>v. <em>Home-Stake Production Co., </em>77 F.3d 1215, 1225-1227 (CA10 1996). In a later case postdating <em>Stoneridge, </em>that court reaffirmed that an outside consultant could be primarily liable for having \u201cma[d]e\u201d false statements, where he drafted fraudulent quarterly and annual filing statements later reviewed and certified by the firm\u2019s auditor, officers, and counsel. <em>SEC </em>v. <em>Wolfson, </em>539 F.3d 1249, 1261 (CA10 2008). And another court found that a corporation\u2019s chief financial officer could be held primarily liable as having \u201cma[d]e\u201d misstatements that appeared in a form 10-K that she prepared but did not sign or file. <em>McConville </em>v. <em>SEC, </em>465 F.3d 780, 787 (CA7 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">One can also easily find lower court cases explaining that corporate officials may be liable for having \u201cma[d]e\u201d false statements where those officials use innocent persons as conduits through which the false statements reach the public (without necessarily attributing the false statements to the officials). See, <em>e.g., In re Navarre Corp. Securities Litigation,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">[564 U.S. 160]</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">299 F.3d 735, 743 (CA8 2002) (liability may be premised on use of analysts as a conduit to communicate false statements to market); <em>In re Cabletron Systems, Inc., </em>311 F.3d 11, 38 (CA1 2002) (rejecting a test requiring legal \u201ccontrol\u201d over third parties making statements as giving \u201ccompany officials too much leeway to commit fraud on the market by using analysts as their mouthpieces\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Novak </em>v. <em>Kasaks, </em>216 F.3d 300, 314-315 (CA2 2000); <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Pickett, </em>137 F.3d 616, 624 (CA9 1997); <em>Freeland </em>v. <em>Iridium World Communications, Ltd., </em>545 F. Supp. 2d 59, 75-76 (DC 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">My conclusion also reflects the particular circumstances that the complaint alleges. The complaint states that \u201cJanus Management, as investment advisor to the funds, is responsible for the day-to-day management of its investment portfolio and other business affairs of the funds. Janus Management furnishes advice and recommendations concerning the funds\u2019 investments, as well as administrative, compliance and accounting services for the funds.\u201d Complaint \u00b6 18, App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a. Each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>the Fund\u2019s 17 officers was a vice president of Janus Management. App. 250a-258a. The Fund has \u201cno assets separate and apart from those they hold for shareholders.\u201d <em>In re Mutual Funds Inv. Litigation, </em>384 F. Supp. 2d 845, 853, n. 3 (Md. 2005). Janus Management disseminated the Fund prospectuses through its parent company\u2019s Web site. Complaint \u00b6 38, App. to Pet. for Cert. 72a. Janus Management employees drafted and reviewed the Fund prospectuses, including language about \u201cmarket timing.\u201d Complaint \u00b6 31, <em>id., </em>at 69a; <em>In re Mutual Funds Inv. Litigation, </em>590 F. Supp. 2d 741, 747 (Md. 2008). And Janus Management may well have kept the trustees in the dark about the true \u201cmarket timing\u201d facts. Complaint \u00b6 51, App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a; <em>In re Lammert, </em>93 S. E. C. Docket, at 5700.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Given these circumstances, as long as some managers, sometimes, can be held to have \u201cma[d]e\u201d a materially false</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">[564 U.S. 161]</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">statement, Janus Management can be held to have done so on the facts alleged here. The relationship between Janus Management and the Fund could hardly have been closer. Janus Management\u2019s involvement in preparing and writing the relevant statements could hardly have been greater. And there is a serious suggestion that the board itself knew little or nothing about the falsity of what was said. See <em>supra, </em>at 157, 160, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 183, 186. Unless we adopt a formal rule (as the majority here has done) that would arbitrarily exclude from the scope of the word \u201cmake\u201d those who manage a firm\u2014even when those managers perpetrate a fraud through an unknowing intermediary\u2014the management company at issue here falls within that scope. We should hold the allegations in the complaint in this respect legally sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">With respect, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
