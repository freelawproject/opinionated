Innumerable children have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>been born into the cause: innumerable young people have married into it;\u201d and, sadly, the original parties \u201chave died out of it.\u201d A \u201clong procession of [judges] has come in and gone out\u201d during that time, and still the suit \u201cdrags its weary length before the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Those words were not written about this case, see C. Dickens, Bleak House, in 1 Works of Charles Dickens 4-5 (1891), but they could have been. This is the second time we have had occasion to weigh in on this long-running dispute between Vickie Lynn Marshall and E. Pierce Marshall over the fortune of J. Howard Marshall II, a man believed to have been one of the richest people in Texas. The Mar-shalls\u2019 litigation has worked its way through state and federal courts in Louisiana, Texas, and California, and two of those courts\u2014a Texas state probate court and the Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California\u2014have reached contrary decisions on its merits. The Court of Appeals below held that the Texas state decision controlled, after concluding that the Bankruptcy Court lacked the authority to enter final judgment on a counterclaim that Vickie brought against</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">[564 U.S. 469]</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Pierce in her bankruptcy proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To determine whether the Court of Appeals was correct in that regard, we must resolve two issues: (1) whether the Bankruptcy Court had the statutory authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b) to issue a final judgment on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim; and (2) if so, whether conferring that authority on the Bankruptcy Court is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Although the history of this litigation is complicated, its resolution ultimately turns on very basic principles.  Article III, \u00a7 1, of the Constitution commands that \u201c[t]he judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\u201d That Article further provides that the judges of those courts shall hold their offices during good behavior, without diminution of salary. <em>Ibid. </em>Those requirements of Article III were not honored here. The Bankruptcy Court in this case exercised the judicial power of the United States by entering final judgment on a common law tort claim, even though the judges of such courts enjoy neither tenure during good behavior nor salary protection. We conclude that, although the Bankruptcy Court had the statutory authority to enter judgment on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim, it lacked the constitutional authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Because we have already recounted the facts and procedural history of this case in detail, see <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>547 U.S. 293, 300-305, 126 S. Ct. 1735, 164 L. Ed. 2d 480 (2006), we do not repeat them in full here. Of current relevance are two claims Vickie filed in an attempt to secure half of J. Howard\u2019s fortune. Known to the public as Anna Nicole Smith, Vickie was J. Howard\u2019s third wife and married him about a year before his death. Id., at</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">[564 U.S. 470]</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">300, 126 S. Ct. 1735, 164 L. Ed. 2d 480; see <em>In re Marshall, </em>392 F.3d 1118, 1122 (CA9 2004). Although J. Howard bestowed on Vickie many monetary and other gifts during their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>courtship and marriage, he did not include her in his will. 547 U.S., at 300, 126 S. Ct. 1735, 164 L. Ed. 2d 480. Before J. Howard passed away, Vickie filed suit in Texas state probate court, asserting that Pierce\u2014J. Howard\u2019s younger son\u2014fraudulently induced J. Howard to sign a living trust that did not include her, even though J. Howard meant to give her half his property. Pierce denied any fraudulent activity and defended the validity of J. Howard\u2019s trust and, eventually, his will. 392 F.3d, at 1122-1123, 1125.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">After J. Howard\u2019s death, Vickie filed a petition for bankruptcy in the Central District of California. Pierce filed a complaint in that bankruptcy proceeding, contending that Vickie had defamed him by inducing her lawyers to tell members of the press that he had engaged in fraud to gain control of his father\u2019s assets. 547 U.S., at 300-301, 126 S. Ct. 1735, 164 L. Ed. 2d 480; <em>In re Marshall, </em>600 F.3d 1037, 1043-1044 (CA9 2010). The complaint sought a declaration that Pierce\u2019s defamation claim was not dis-chargeable in the bankruptcy proceedings. <em>Ibid.; </em>see 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a). Pierce subsequently filed a proof of claim for the defamation action, meaning that he sought to recover damages for it from Vickie\u2019s bankruptcy estate. See \u00a7 501(a). Vickie responded to Pierce\u2019s initial complaint by asserting truth as a defense to the alleged defamation and by filing a counterclaim for tortious interference with the gift she expected from J. Howard. As she had in state court, Vickie alleged that Pierce had wrongfully prevented J. Howard from taking the legal steps necessary to provide her with half his property. 547 U.S., at 301, 126 S. Ct. 1735, 164 L. Ed. 2d 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">On November 5, 1999, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order granting Vickie summary judgment on Pierce\u2019s claim for defamation. On September 27, 2000, after a bench trial, the Bankruptcy Court issued a judgment on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim in her favor. The court later awarded Vickie over $400 million in compensatory damages and $25 million in punitive</p>\n<p id=\"AKB9\">[564 U.S. 471]</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">damages. 600 F.3d, at 1045; see 253 B.R. 550, 561-562 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal. 2000); 257 B.R. 35, 39-40 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">In post-trial proceedings, Pierce argued that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction over Vickie\u2019s counterclaim. In particular, Pierce renewed a claim he had made earlier in the litigation, asserting that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s authority over the counterclaim was limited because Vickie\u2019s counterclaim was not a \u201ccore proceeding\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(2)(C). See 257 B.R., at 39. As explained below,  bankruptcy courts may hear and enter final judgments in \u201ccore proceedings\u201d in a bankruptcy case. In noncore proceedings, the bankruptcy courts instead submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court, for that court\u2019s review and issuance of final judgment. The Bankruptcy Court in this case concluded that Vickie\u2019s counterclaim was \u201ca core proceeding\u201d under \u00a7 157(b)(2)(C), and the court therefore had the \u201cpower to enter judgment\u201d on the counterclaim under \u00a7 157(b)(1). <em>Id., </em>at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">The District Court disagreed. It recognized that \u2018Vickie\u2019s counterclaim for tortious interference falls within the literal language\u201d of the statute designating certain proceedings as \u201ccore,\u201d see \u00a7 157(b)(2)(C), but understood this Court\u2019s precedent to \u201csuggest[] that it would be unconstitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>tional to hold that any and all counterclaims are core.\u201d 264 B.R. 609, 629-630 (CD Cal. 2001) <em>(citing Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Marathon Pipe Line Co., </em>458 U.S. 50, 79, n. 31, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1982) (plurality opinion)). The District Court accordingly concluded that a \u201ccounterclaim should not be characterized as core\u201d when it \u201cis only somewhat related to the claim against which it is asserted, and when the unique characteristics and context of the counterclaim place it outside of the normal type of set-off or other counterclaims that customarily arise.\u201d 264 B.R., at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Because the District Court concluded that Vickie\u2019s counterclaim was not core, the court determined that it was required</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">[564 U.S. 472]</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">to treat the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s judgment as \u201cproposed[,] rather than final,\u201d and engage in an \u201cindependent review\u201d of the record. <em>Id., </em>at 633; see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(c)(1). Although the Texas state court had by that time conducted a jury trial on the merits of the parties\u2019 dispute and entered a judgment in Pierce\u2019s favor, the District Court declined to give that judgment preclusive effect and went on to decide the matter itself. 271 B.R. 858, 862-867 (CD Cal. 2001); see 275 B.R. 5, 56-58 (CD Cal. 2002). Like the Bankruptcy Court, the District Court found that Pierce had tortiously interfered with Vickie\u2019s expectancy of a gift from J. Howard. The District Court awarded Vickie compensatory and punitive damages, each in the amount of $44,292,767.33. <em>Id., </em>at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court on a different ground, 392 F.3d, at 1137, and we\u2014in the first visit of the case to this Court\u2014reversed the Court of Appeals on that issue. 547 U.S., at 314-315, 126 S. Ct. 1735, 164 L. Ed. 2d 480. On remand from this Court, the Court of Appeals held that \u00a7 157 mandated \u201ca two-step approach\u201d under which a bankruptcy judge may issue a final judgment in a proceeding only if the matter both \u201cmeets Congress\u2019 definition of a core proceeding <em>and. </em>arises under or arises in title 11,\u201d the Bankruptcy Code. 600 F.3d, at 1055. The court also reasoned that allowing a bankruptcy judge to enter final judgments on all counterclaims raised in bankruptcy proceedings \u201cwould certainly run afoul\u201d of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Northern Pipeline, </em>600 F.3d, at 1057. With those concerns in mind, the court concluded that \u201ca counterclaim under \u00a7 157(b)(2)(C) is properly a \u2018core\u2019 proceeding \u2018arising in a case under\u2019 the [Bankruptcy] Code only if the counterclaim is so closely related to [a creditor\u2019s] proof of claim that the resolution of the counterclaim is necessary to resolve the allowance or disal-lowance of the claim itself.\u201d Id., at 1058 (internal quotation marks omitted; second brackets added). The court ruled that Vickie\u2019s counterclaim did not meet that test. Id., at 1059. That holding made \u201cthe</p>\n<p id=\"Aa2c\">[564 U.S. 473]</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Texas probate court\u2019s judgment . . . the earliest final judgment entered on matters relevant to this proceeding,\u201d and therefore the Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court should have \u201cafford [ed] preclusive effect\u201d to the Texas \u201ccourt\u2019s determination of relevant legal and factual issues.\u201d Id., at 1064-1065.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>We again granted certiorari. 561 U.S. 1058, 131 S. Ct. 63, 177 L. Ed. 2d 1152 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">With certain exceptions not relevant here, the district courts of the United States have \u201coriginal and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under title 11.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(a). Congress has divided bankruptcy proceedings into three categories: those that \u201caris[e] under title 11\u201d; those that \u201caris[e] in\u201d a Title 11 case; and those that are \u201crelated to a case under title 11.\u201d \u00a7 157(a). District courts may refer any or all such proceedings to the bankruptcy judges of their district, <em>ibid., </em>which is how the Bankruptcy Court in this case came to preside over Vickie\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. District courts also may withdraw a case or proceeding referred to the bankruptcy court \u201cfor cause shown.\u201d \u00a7 157(d). Since Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984 (1984 Act), bankruptcy judges for each district have been appointed to 14-year terms by the courts of appeals for the circuits in which their district is located. \u00a7 152(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The manner in which a bankruptcy judge may act on a referred matter depends on the type of proceeding involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">[564 U.S. 474]</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">Bankruptcy judges may hear and enter final judgments in \u201call core proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a case under title 11.\u201d \u00a7 157(b)(1). \u201cCore proceedings include, but are not limited to,\u201d 16 different types of matters, including \u201ccounterclaims by [a debtor\u2019s] estate against persons filing claims against the estate.\u201d \u00a7 157(b)(2)(C).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">[564 U.S. 475]</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">may appeal final judgments of a bankruptcy court in core proceedings to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>district court, which reviews them under traditional appellate standards. See \u00a7 158(a); Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 8013.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">When a bankruptcy judge determines that a referred \u201cproceeding . . . is not a core proceeding but ... is otherwise related to a case under title 11,\u201d the judge may only \u201csubmit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court.\u201d \u00a7 157(c)(1). It is the district court that enters final judgment in such cases after reviewing <em>de novo </em>any matter to which a party objects. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Vickie\u2019s counterclaim against Pierce for tortious interference is a \u201ccore proceeding\u201d under the plain text of \u00a7 157(b)(2)(C). That provision specifies that core proceedings include \u201ccounterclaims by the estate against persons filing claims against the estate.\u201d In past cases, we have suggested that a proceeding\u2019s \u201ccore\u201d status alone authorizes a bankruptcy judge, as a statutory matter, to enter final judgment in the proceeding. See, e.g., <em>Granfinanciera, S. A. </em>v. <em>Nordberg, </em>492 U.S. 33, 50, 109 S. Ct. 2782, 106 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1989) (explaining that Congress had designated certain actions as \u201c \u2018core proceedings,\u2019 which bankruptcy judges may adjudicate and in which they may issue final judgments, if a district court has referred the matter to them\u201d (citations omitted)). We have not directly addressed the question, however, and Pierce argues that a bankruptcy judge may enter final judgment on a core proceeding only if that proceeding also \u201carisfes] in\u201d a Title 11 case or \u201carisfes] under\u201d Title 11 itself. Brief for Respondent 51 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Section 157(b)(1) authorizes bankruptcy courts to \u201chear and determine all cases under title 11 and all core proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a case under title 11.\u201d As written, \u00a7 157(b)(1) is ambiguous. The \u201carising under\u201d and \u201carising in\u201d phrases might, as Pierce suggests, be read as referring to a limited category of those core proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"A3E\">[564 U.S. 476]</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">that are addressed in that section. On the other hand, the phrases might be read as simply describing what core proceedings are: matters arising under Title 11 or in a Title 11 case. In this case the structure and context of \u00a7 157 contradict Pierce\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 157(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">As an initial matter, Pierce\u2019s reading of the statute necessarily assumes that there is a category of core proceedings that neither arise under Title 11 nor arise in a Title 11 case. The manner in which the statute delineates the bankruptcy courts\u2019 authority, however, makes plain that no such category exists.  Section 157(b)(1) authorizes bankruptcy judges to enter final judgments in \u201ccore proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a case under title 11.\u201d Section 157(c)(1) instructs bankruptcy judges to instead submit proposed findings in \u201ca proceeding that is not a core proceeding but that is otherwise related to a case under title 11.\u201d Nowhere does \u00a7 157 specify what bankruptcy courts are to do with respect to the category of matters that Pierce posits\u2014core proceedings that do <em>not </em>arise under Title 11 or in a Title 11 case. To the contrary, \u00a7 157(b)(3) only instructs a bankruptcy judge to \u201cdetermine, on the judge\u2019s own motion or on timely motion of a party, whether a proceeding is a core proceeding under this subsection or is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>proceeding that is otherwise related to a case under title 11.\u201d Two options. The statute does not suggest that any other distinctions need be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Under our reading of the statute,  core proceedings are those that arise in a bankruptcy case or under Title 11. The detailed list of core proceedings in \u00a7 157(b)(2) provides courts with ready examples of such matters. Pierce\u2019s reading of \u00a7 157, in contrast, supposes that some core proceedings will arise in a Title 11 case or under Title 11 and some will not. Under that reading, the statute provides no guidance on how to tell which are which.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">We think it significant that Congress failed to provide any framework for identifying or adjudicating the asserted category of core but not \u201carising\u201d proceedings, given the otherwise</p>\n<p id=\"AqlC\">[564 U.S. 477]</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">detailed provisions governing bankruptcy court authority. It is hard to believe that Congress would go to the trouble of cataloging 16 different types of proceedings that should receive \u201ccore\u201d treatment, but then fail to specify how to determine whether those matters arise under Title 11 or in a bankruptcy case if\u2014as Pierce asserts\u2014the latter inquiry is determinative of the bankruptcy court\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Pierce argues that we should treat core matters that arise neither under Title 11 nor in a Title 11 case as proceedings \u201crelated to\u201d a Title 11 case. Brief for Respondent 60 (internal quotation marks omitted). We think that a contradiction in terms. It does not make sense to describe a \u201ccore\u201d bankruptcy proceeding as merely \u201crelated to\u201d the bankruptcy case; oxymoron is not a typical feature of congressional drafting. See <em>Northern Pipeline, </em>458 U.S., at 71, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (plurality opinion) (distinguishing \u201cthe restructuring of debtor-creditor relations, which is at the core of the federal bankruptcy power, . . . from the adjudication of state-created private rights\u201d); 1 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 3.02[2], p. 3-26, n. 5 (16th ed. 2010) (\u201cThe terms \u2018non-core\u2019 and \u2018related\u2019 are synonymous\u201d); see also <em>id., </em>at 3-26 (\u201cThe phraseology of section 157 leads to the conclusion that there is no such thing as a core matter that is \u2018related to\u2019 a case under title 11. Core proceedings are, at most, those that arise in title 11 cases or arise under title 11\u201d (footnote omitted)). And, as already discussed, the statute simply does not provide for a proceeding that is simultaneously core and yet only related to the bankruptcy case. See \u00a7 157(c)(1) (providing only for \u201ca proceeding that is not a core proceeding but that is otherwise related to a case under title 11\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">As we explain in Part III, we agree with Pierce that designating all counterclaims as \u201ccore\u201d proceedings raises serious constitutional concerns. Pierce is also correct that  we will, where possible, construe federal statutes so as \u201cto avoid serious doubt of their constitutionality.\u201d <em>Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Schor, </em>478 U.S. 833, 841, 106 S. Ct. 3245, 92 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1986) (internal</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">[564 U.S. 478]</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">quotation marks omitted). But that \u201ccanon of construction does not give [us] the prerogative to ignore the legislative will in order to avoid constitutional adjudication.\u201d <em>Ibid- </em>In this case, we do not think the plain text of \u00a7 157(b)(2)(C) leaves any room for the canon of avoidance. We would have to \u201crewrit[e]\u201d the statute, not interpret it, to bypass the constitutional issue \u00a7 157(b)(2)(C) presents. <em>Id., </em>at 841, 106 S. Ct. 3245, 92 L.

Section 157(b)(5) provides that  \u201c[t]he district court shall order that personal injury tort and wrongful death claims shall be tried in the district court in which the bankruptcy case is pending, or in the district court in the district in which the claim arose.\u201d Pierce asserts that his defamation claim is a \u201cpersonal injury tort,\u201d that the Bankruptcy Court therefore had no jurisdiction over that claim, and that the court therefore necessarily lacked jurisdiction over Vickie\u2019s counterclaim as well. Brief for Respondent 65-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Vickie objects to Pierce\u2019s statutory analysis across the board. To begin, Vickie contends that \u00a7 157(b)(5) does not address subject matter jurisdiction at all, but simply specifies the venue in which \u201cpersonal injury tort and wrongful death claims\u201d should be tried. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 16-17, 19; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 23 (Deputy Solicitor General) (Section \u201c157(b)(5) is, in [the United States\u2019] view, not jurisdictional\u201d). Given the limited scope of that provision, Vickie argues, a party may waive or forfeit any objections under \u00a7 157(b)(5), in the same way that a party may waive or forfeit an objection to the bankruptcy court finally resolving a non-core claim. Reply Brief for Petitioner 17-20;</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">[564 U.S. 479]</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">see \u00a7 157(c)(2) (authorizing the district court, \u201cwith the consent of all the parties to the proceeding,\u201d to refer a \u201crelated to\u201d matter to the bankruptcy court for final judgment). Vickie asserts that in this case Pierce consented to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s adjudication of his defamation claim, and forfeited any argument to the contrary, by failing to seek withdrawal of the claim until he had litigated it before the Bankruptcy Court for 27 months. <em>Id., </em>at 20-23. On the merits, Vickie contends that the statutory phrase \u201cpersonal injury tort and wrongful death claims\u201d does not include non-physical torts such as defamation. Id., at 25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">We need not determine what constitutes a \u201cpersonal injury tort\u201d in this case because we agree with Vickie that \u00a7 157(b)(5) is not jurisdictional, and that Pierce consented to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s resolution of his defamation claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n                   Because \u201c[b] ran ding a rule as going to a court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction alters the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>normal operation of our adversarial</p>\n<p id=\"AY0q\">[564 U.S. 480]</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">system,\u201d <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Shinseki, </em>562 U.S. 428, 434, 131 S. Ct. 1197, 179 L. Ed. 2d 159 (2011), we are not inclined to interpret statutes as creating a jurisdictional bar when they are not framed as such. See generally <em>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 516, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (2006) (\u201cwhen Congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdic-tional in character\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Section 157(b)(5) does not have the hallmarks of a jurisdictional decree. To begin, the statutory text does not refer to either district court or bankruptcy court \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d instead addressing only where personal injury tort claims \u201cshall be tried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The statutory context also belies Pierce\u2019s jurisdictional claim.  Section 157 allocates the authority to enter final judgment between the bankruptcy court and the district court. See \u00a7\u00a7 157(b)(1), (c)(1). That allocation does not implicate questions of subject matter jurisdiction. See \u00a7 157(c)(2) (parties may consent to entry of final judgment by bankruptcy judge in noncore case). By the same token, \u00a7 157(b)(5) simply specifies where a particular category of cases should be tried. Pierce does not explain why that statutory limitation may not be similarly waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">We agree with Vickie that Pierce not only could but did consent to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s resolution of his defamation claim. Before the Bankruptcy Court, Vickie objected to Pierce\u2019s proof of claim for defamation, arguing that Pierce\u2019s claim was unenforceable and that Pierce should not receive any amount for it. See 29 Court of Appeals Supplemental Excerpts of Record 6031, 6035 (hereinafter Supplemental Record). Vickie also noted that the Bankruptcy Court could defer ruling on her objection, given the litigation posture of Pierce\u2019s claim before the Bankruptcy Court. See <em>id., </em>at 6031. Vickie\u2019s filing prompted Pierce to advise the Bankruptcy Court that \u201c[a]ll parties are in agreement that the amount of the contingent Proof of Claim filed by [Pierce] shall be determined by the adversary proceedings\u201d that had</p>\n<p id=\"AjBN\">[564 U.S. 481]</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">been commenced in the Bankruptcy Court. 31 <em>id., </em>at 6801. Pierce asserted that Vickie\u2019s objection should be overruled or, alternatively, that any ruling on the objection \u201cshould be continued until the resolution of the pending adversary proceeding litigation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Pierce identifies no point in the record where he argued to the Bankruptcy Court that it lacked the authority to adjudicate his proof of claim because the claim sought recompense for a personal injury tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">Indeed, Pierce apparently did not object to any court that \u00a7 157(b)(5) prohibited the Bankruptcy Court from resolving his defamation claim until over two years\u2014and several adverse discovery rulings\u2014after he filed that claim in June 1996. The first filing Pierce cites as raising that objection is his September 22, 1998 motion to the District Court to withdraw the reference of the case to the Bankruptcy Court. See Brief for Respondent 26-27. The District Court did initially withdraw the reference as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>requested, but it then returned the proceeding to the Bankruptcy Court, observing that Pierce \u201cimplicated the jurisdiction of that bankruptcy court. He chose to be a party to that litigation.\u201d App. 129. Although Pierce had objected in July 1996 to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over Vickie\u2019s counterclaim, he advised the court at that time that he was \u201chappy to litigate [his] claim\u201d there. 29 Supplemental Record 6101. Counsel stated that even though Pierce thought it was \u201cprobably cheaper for th[e] estate if [Pierce\u2019s claim] were sent back or joined back with the State Court litigation,\u201d Pierce \u201cdid choose\u201d the Bankruptcy Court forum and \u201cwould be more than pleased to do it [t]here.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 6101-6102; see also App. to Pet. for Cert. 266, n. 17 (District Court referring to these statements).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">Given Pierce\u2019s course of conduct before the Bankruptcy Court, we conclude that he consented to that court\u2019s resolution of his defamation claim (and forfeited any argument to the contrary). We have recognized \u201cthe value of waiver and forfeiture rules\u201d in \u201ccomplex\u201d cases, <em>Exxon Shipping Co. </em>v.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">[564 U.S. 482]</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\"><em>Baker, </em>554 U.S. 471, 487-488, n. 6, 128 S.

In such cases, as here, the consequences of \u201ca litigant . . . \u2018sandbagging\u2019 the court\u2014remaining silent about his objection and belatedly raising the error only if the case does not conclude in his favor,\u201d <em>Puckett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 134, 129 S.

If Pierce believed that the Bankruptcy Court lacked the authority to decide his claim for defamation, then he should have said so\u2014and said so promptly. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 123 L.

As Hamilton put it, quoting Montesquieu, \u201c \u2018there is no liberty if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting 1 Montesquieu, Spirit of Laws 181).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">We have recognized that the three branches are not hermetically sealed from one another, see <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Administrator of General Services, </em>433 U.S. 425, 443, 97 S. Ct. 2777, 53 L. Ed. 2d 867 (1977), but it remains true that Article III imposes some basic limitations that the other branches may not transgress. Those limitations serve two related purposes. \u201cSeparation-of-powers principles are intended, in part, to protect each branch of government from incursion by the others. Yet the dynamic between and among the branches is not the only object of the Constitution\u2019s concern. The structural principles secured by the separation of powers protect the individual as well.\u201d <em>Bond </em>v. <em>United States, ante, </em>at 222, 131 S. Ct. 2355, 180 L. Ed. 2d 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Article III protects liberty not only through its role in implementing the separation of powers, but also by specifying the defining characteristics of Article III judges. The colonists had been subjected to judicial abuses at the hand</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">[564 U.S. 484]</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">of the Crown, and the Framers knew the main reasons why: because the King of Great Britain \u201cmade Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\u201d The Declaration of Independence \u00b6 11. The Framers undertook in Article III to protect citizens subject to the judicial power of the new Federal Government from a repeat of those abuses. By appointing judges to serve without term limits, and restricting the ability of the other branches to remove judges or diminish their salaries, the Framers sought to ensure that each judicial decision would be rendered, not with an eye toward currying favor with Congress or the Executive, but rather with the \u201c[c]lear heads . . . and honest hearts\u201d deemed \u201cessential to good judges.\u201d 1 Works of James Wilson 363 (J. Andrews ed. 1896).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">Article III could neither serve its purpose in the system of checks and balances nor preserve the integrity of judicial decisionmaking if the other branches of the Federal Government could confer the Government\u2019s \u201cjudicial Power\u201d on entities outside Article III. That is why we have long recognized that,  in general, Congress may not \u201cwithdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty.\u201d <em>Murray\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co., </em>18 How. 272, 284, 15 L.

The Constitution assigns that job\u2014resolution of \u201cthe mundane as well as the glamorous, matters of common law and statute as well as constitutional law, issues of fact as well as issues of law\u201d\u2014to the Judiciary. <em>Id., </em>at 86-87, n. 39, 102 S.

In <em>Northern Pipeline, </em>we considered whether bankruptcy judges serving under the Bankruptcy Act of 1978\u2014appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, but lacking the tenure and salary guarantees of Article III\u2014could \u201cconstitutionally be vested with jurisdiction to decide [a] state-law contract claim\u201d against an entity that was not otherwise part of the bankruptcy proceedings. <em>Id., </em>at 53, 87, n. 40, 102 S.

That opinion concluded that this \u201cpublic rights\u201d exception extended \u201conly to matters arising between\u201d individuals and the Government \u201cin connection with the performance of the constitutional functions of the executive or legislative departments . . . that historically could have been determined exclusively by those\u201d branches. <em>Id., </em>at 67-68, 102 S.

A full majority of the Court, while not agreeing on the scope of the exception, concluded that the doctrine did not encompass adjudication of the state law claim at issue in that case. <em>Id., </em>at 69-72, 102 S.

In the 1984 Act, Congress provided that the judges of the new bankruptcy courts would be appointed by the courts of appeals for the circuits in which their districts are located. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(a). And, as we have explained, Congress permitted the newly constituted bankruptcy courts to enter final judgments only in \u201ccore\u201d proceedings. See <em>supra, </em>at 473-475, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 488-489.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">With respect to such \u201ccore\u201d matters, however, the bankruptcy courts under the 1984 Act exercise the same powers they wielded under the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 (1978 Act), 92 Stat. 2549. As in <em>Northern Pipeline, </em>for example, the newly constituted bankruptcy courts are charged under \u00a7 157(b)(2)(C) with resolving \u201c[a] 11 matters of fact and law in whatever domains of the law to which\u201d a counterclaim may lead. 458 U.S., at 91, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment); see, <em>e.g., </em>275 B.R., at 50-51 (noting that Vickie\u2019s counterclaim required the bankruptcy court to determine whether Texas recognized a cause of action for tortious interference with an <em>inter vivos </em>gift\u2014something the Supreme Court of Texas had yet to do).

Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (plurality opinion). And, as in <em>Northern Pipeline, </em>the district courts review the judgments of the bankruptcy courts in core proceedings only under the usual limited appellate standards. That requires marked deference to, among other things, the bankruptcy judges\u2019 findings of fact. See \u00a7 158(a); Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 8013 (findings of fact \u201cshall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Vickie and the dissent argue that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s entry of final judgment on her state common law counterclaim was constitutional, despite the similarities between the bankruptcy courts under the 1978 Act and those exercising core jurisdiction under the 1984 Act. We disagree. It is clear that the Bankruptcy Court in this case exercised the \u201cjudicial Power of the United States\u201d in purporting to resolve and enter final judgment on a state common law claim, just as the court did in <em>Northern Pipeline, </em>No \u201cpublic right\u201d exception excuses the failure to comply with Article III in doing so, any more than in <em>Northern Pipeline, </em>Vickie argues that this case is different because the defendant is a creditor in the bankruptcy. But the debtors\u2019 claims in the cases on which she relies were themselves federal claims under bankruptcy law, which would be completely resolved in the bankruptcy process of allowing or disallowing claims. Here Vickie\u2019s claim is a state law action independent of the federal bankruptcy law and not necessarily resolvable by a ruling on the creditor\u2019s proof of claim in bankruptcy. Not<em>hern Pipeline </em>and our subsequent decision in <em>Granfinanciera, </em>492 U.S. 33, 109 S. Ct. 2782, 106 L. Ed. 2d 26, rejected the application of the \u201cpublic rights\u201d exception in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">Nor can the bankruptcy courts un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>der the 1984 Act be dismissed as mere adjuncts of Article III courts, any more than could the bankruptcy courts under the 1978 Act. The judicial powers the courts exercise in cases such as this remain</p>\n<p id=\"AKIa\">[564 U.S. 488]</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">the same, and a court exercising such broad powers is no mere adjunct of anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Vickie\u2019s counterclaim cannot be deemed a matter of \u201cpublic right\u201d that can be decided outside the Judicial Branch. As explained above, <em>in Northern Pipeline </em>we rejected the argument that the public rights doctrine permitted a bankruptcy court to adjudicate a state law suit brought by a debtor against a company that had not filed a claim against the estate. See 458 U.S., at 69-72, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (plurality opinion); <em>id., </em>at 90-91, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment). Although our discussion of the public rights exception since that time has not been entirely consistent, and the exception has been the subject of some debate, this case does not fall within any of the various formulations of the concept that appear in this Court\u2019s opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">We first recognized the category of public rights in <em>Murray\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co., </em>18 How. 272, 15 L.

Ed. 372. The plaintiff, who claimed title to the same land through a different transfer, objected that the Treasury Department\u2019s calculation of the deficiency and sale of the property was void, because it was a judicial act that could not be assigned to the Executive under Article III. <em>Id., </em>at 274-275, 282-283, 15 L.

It confirmed that Congress cannot \u201cwithdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court also recognized that \u201c [a]t the same time there are matters, involving public rights, which may be presented in such form that the judicial power is capable of acting on them, and which are susceptible of judicial determination,</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">[564 U.S. 489]</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">but which congress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the courts of the United States, as it may deem proper.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-15\">As an example of such matters, the Court referred to \u201c[elquitable claims to land by the inhabitants of ceded territories\u201d and cited cases in which land issues were conclusively resolved by Executive Branch officials. <em>Ibid. </em>(citing <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>15 How. 433, 14 L.

In those cases \u201cit depends upon the will of congress whether a remedy in the courts shall be allowed at all,\u201d so Congress could limit the extent to which a judicial forum was available. <em>Murray\u2019s Lessee, </em>18 How., at 284, 15 L.

The challenge in <em>Murray\u2019s Lessee </em>to the Treasury Department\u2019s sale of the collector\u2019s land likewise fell within the \u201cpublic rights\u201d category of cases, because it could only be brought if the Federal Government chose to allow it by waiving sovereign immunity. <em>Id., </em>at 283-284, 15 L.

The point of <em>Murray\u2019s Lessee </em>was simply that Congress may set the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>terms of adjudicating a suit when the suit could not otherwise proceed at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Subsequent decisions from this Court contrasted cases within the reach of the public rights exception\u2014 those arising \u201cbetween the Government and persons subject to its authority in connection with the performance of the constitutional functions of the executive or legislative departments\u201d\u2014and those that were instead matters \u201cof private right, that is, of the liability of one individual to another under the law as defined.\u201d <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>285 U.S. 22, 50, 51, 52 S.

Ct. 3245, 92 L. Ed. 2d 675. A customer filed such a claim to recover a debit balance in his account, while the broker filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court to recover the same amount as lawfully due from the customer. The broker later submitted its claim to the CFTC, but after that agency ruled against the customer, the customer argued that agency jurisdiction over the broker\u2019s counterclaim violated Article III. <em>Id., </em>at 837-838, 106 S.

This Court disagreed, but only after observing that (1) the claim and the counterclaim concerned a \u201csingle dispute\u201d\u2014the same account balance; (2) the CFTC\u2019s assertion of authority involved only \u201ca narrow class of common law claims\u201d in a \u201c \u2018particularized area of law\u2019 (3) the area of law in question was governed by \u201ca specific and limited federal regulatory scheme\u201d as to which the agency had \u201cobvious expertise\u201d; (4) the parties had freely elected to resolve their differences before the CFTC; and (5) CFTC orders were \u201cenforceable only by order of the district <em>court.\u201d Id., </em>at 844, 852-856, 106 S.

Most significantly, given that the customer\u2019s reparations claim before the agency and the broker\u2019s counterclaim were competing claims to the same amount, the Court repeatedly emphasized that it was \u201cnecessary\u201d to allow the agency to exercise jurisdiction over the broker\u2019s claim, or else \u201cthe reparations procedure would have been confounded.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 856, 106 S. Ct. 3245, 92 L. Ed. 2d 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">The most recent case in which we considered application of the public rights exception\u2014and the only case in which we have considered that doctrine in the bankruptcy context since <em>Northern </em>Pipeline\u2014is <em>Granfinanciera, S. A. </em>v. <em>Nordberg, </em>492 U.S. 33, 109 S. Ct. 2782, 106 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1989). In <em>Granfinanciera </em>we rejected a bankruptcy trustee\u2019s argument that a fraudulent conveyance action filed on behalf of a bankruptcy estate against a noncreditor in a bankruptcy proceeding fell within the \u201cpublic rights\u201d exception. We explained that, \u201c [i]f a statutory right is not closely intertwined with a federal regulatory program Congress has power to enact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>and if that right neither belongs to nor exists against the Federal Government, then it must be adjudicated by an Article III court.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 54-55, 109 S. Ct. 2782, 106 L. Ed. 2d 26. We reasoned that fraudulent conveyance suits were \u201cquintessentially suits at common law that more nearly resemble state law contract claims brought by a bankrupt corporation to augment the bankruptcy estate than they do creditors\u2019 hierarchically ordered claims to a pro rata share of the bankruptcy res.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 56, 109 S. Ct. 2782, 106 L. Ed. 2d 26. As a consequence, we concluded that fraudulent conveyance actions were \u201cmore accurately characterized as a private rather than a public right as we have used those terms in our Article III decisions.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 55, 109 S. Ct. 2782, 106 L. Ed. 2d 26.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">[564 U.S. 493]</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Vickie\u2019s counterclaim\u2014like the fraudulent conveyance claim at issue in Granfinanciera\u2014does not fall within any of the varied formulations of the public rights exception in this Court\u2019s cases. It is not a matter that can be pursued only by grace of the other branches, as in <em>Murray\u2019s Lessee, </em>18 How., at 284, 15 L. Ed. 372, or one that \u201chistorically could have been determined exclusively by\u201d those branches, <em>Northern Pipeline, </em>458 U.S., at 68, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (citing <em>Ex parte Bakelite Corp., </em>279 U.S., at 458, 49 S. Ct. 411, 73 L. Ed. 789). The claim is instead one under state common law between two private parties. It does not \u201cdepend\u00fc upon the will of congress,\u201d <em>Murray\u2019s Lessee, supra, </em>at 284, 15 L. Ed. 372; Congress has nothing to do with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">In addition, Vickie\u2019s claimed right to relief does not flow from a federal statutory scheme, as in <em>Thomas, supra, </em>at 584-585, 105 S. Ct. 3325, 87 L. Ed. 2d 409, or <em>Atlas Roofing, </em>430 U.S., at 458, 97 S. Ct. 1261, 51 L. Ed. 2d 464. It is not \u201ccompletely dependent upon\u201d adjudication of a claim created by federal law, as in <em>Schor, </em>478 U.S., at 856, 106 S. Ct. 3245, 92 L. Ed. 2d 675. And in contrast to the objecting party in <em>Schor, id., </em>at 855-856, 106 S. Ct. 3245, 92 L. Ed. 2d 675, Pierce did not truly consent to resolution of Vickie\u2019s claim in the bankruptcy court proceedings. He had nowhere else to go if he wished to recover from Vickie\u2019s estate. See <em>Granfinanciera, supra, </em>at 59, n. 14, 109 S. Ct. 2782, 106 L. Ed. 2d 26 (noting that \u201c[plarallel reasoning [to Schor] is unavailable in the context of bankruptcy proceedings, because creditors lack an alternative forum to the bankruptcy court in which to pursue their claims\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Furthermore, the asserted authority to decide Vickie\u2019s claim is not limited to a \u201cparticularized area of the law,\u201d as in <em>Crowell, Thomas, </em>and <em>Schor. Northern Pipeline, </em>458 U.S., at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>85, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (plurality opinion). We deal here not with an</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">[564 U.S. 494]</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">agency but with a court, with substantive jurisdiction reaching any area of the <em>corpus juris, See ibid.; id., </em>at 91, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment). This is not a situation in which Congress devised an \u201cexpert and inexpensive method for dealing with a class of questions of fact which are particularly suited to examination and determination by an administrative agency specially assigned to that task.\u201d <em>Crowell, </em>285 U.S., at 46, 52 S. Ct. 285, 76 L. Ed. 598; see <em>Schor, supra, </em>at 855-856, 106 S. Ct. 3245, 92 L. Ed. 2d 675. The \u201cexperts\u201d in the federal system at resolving common law counterclaims such as Vickie\u2019s are the Article III courts, and it is with those courts that her claim must stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The dissent reads our cases differently, and in particular contends that more recent cases view <em>Northern Pipeline </em>as \u201c \u2018establish [ing] only that Congress may not vest in a non-Article III court the power to adjudicate, render final judgment, and issue binding orders in a traditional contract action arising under state law, without consent of the litigants, and subject only to ordinary appellate review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Post, </em>at 510, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 511 (quoting <em>Thomas, </em>473 U.S., at 584, 105 S. Ct. 3325, 87 L. Ed. 2d 409). Just so: Substitute \u201ctort\u201d for \u201ccontract,\u201d and that statement directly covers this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">We recognize that there may be instances in which the distinction between public and private rights\u2014at least as framed by some of our recent cases\u2014fails to provide concrete guidance as to whether, for example, a particular agency can adjudicate legal issues under a substantive regulatory scheme. Given the extent to which this case is so markedly distinct from the agency cases discussing the public rights exception in the context of such a regime, however, we do not in this opinion express any view on how the doctrine might apply in that different context.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">What is plain here is that this case involves the most prototypical exercise of judicial power: the entry of a final, binding judgment <em>by a court </em>with broad substantive jurisdiction, on a common law cause of action, when the action neither derives from nor depends upon any agency regulatory regime.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">[564 U.S. 495]</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">If such an exercise of judicial power may nonetheless be taken from the Article III Judiciary simply by deeming it part of some amorphous \u201cpublic right,\u201d then Article III would be transformed from the guardian of individual liberty and separation of powers we have long recognized into mere wishful thinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">Vickie and the dissent next attempt to distinguish <em>Northern Pipeline </em>and <em>Granfinanciera </em>on the ground that Pierce, unlike the defendants in those cases, had filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceedings. Given Pierce\u2019s participation in those proceedings, Vickie argues, the Bankruptcy Court had the authority to adjudicate her counterclaim under our decisions in <em>Katchen </em>v. <em>Landy, </em>382 U.S. 323, 86 S. Ct. 467, 15 L. Ed. 2d 391 (1966), and <em>Langenkamp </em>v. <em>Culp, </em>498 U.S. 42, 111 S. Ct. 330, 112 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1990) <em>(per curiam).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">We do not agree. As an initial matter, it is hard to see why Pierce\u2019s decision to file a claim should make any difference with respect to the characterization of Vickie\u2019s counter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>claim.  \u201c \u2018[P]roperty interests are created and defined by state law,\u2019 and \u2018[u]nless some federal interest requires a different result, there is no reason why such interests should be analyzed differently simply because an interested party is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding.\u201d <em>Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co. of America </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>549 U.S. 443, 451, 127 S. Ct. 1199, 167 L. Ed. 2d 178 (2007) (quoting <em>Butner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>440 U.S. 48, 55, 99 S. Ct. 914, 59 L. Ed. 2d 136 (1979)). Pierce\u2019s claim for defamation in no way affects the nature of Vickie\u2019s counterclaim for tortious interference as one at common law that simply attempts to augment the bankruptcy estate\u2014the very type of claim that we held in <em>Northern Pipeline </em>and <em>Granfinanciera </em>must be decided by an Article III court.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Contrary to Vickie\u2019s contention, moreover, our decisions in <em>Katchen </em>and <em>Langenkamp </em>do not suggest a different result. <em>Katchen </em>permitted a bankruptcy referee acting under the Bankruptcy Acts of 1898 and 1938 (akin to a bankruptcy court today) to exercise what was known as \u201csummary jurisdiction\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">[564 U.S. 496]</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">over a voidable preference claim brought by the bankruptcy trustee against a creditor who had filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding. See 382 U.S., at 325, 327-328, 86 S. Ct. 467, 15 L. Ed. 2d 391. A voidable preference claim asserts that a debtor made a payment to a particular creditor in anticipation of bankruptcy, to in effect increase that creditor\u2019s proportionate share of the estate. The preferred creditor\u2019s claim in bankruptcy can be disallowed as a result of the preference, and the amounts paid to that creditor can be recovered by the trustee. See <em>id., </em>at 330, 86 S. Ct. 467, 15 L. Ed. 2d 391; see also 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 502(d), 547(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Although the creditor in <em>Katchen </em>objected that the preference issue should be resolved through a \u201cplenary suit\u201d in an Article III court, this Court concluded that summary adjudication in bankruptcy was appropriate, because it was not possible for the referee to rule on the creditor\u2019s proof of claim without first resolving the voidable preference issue. 382 U.S., at 329-330, 332-333, and n. 9, 334, 86 S. Ct. 467, 15 L. Ed. 2d 391. There was no question that the bankruptcy referee could decide whether there had been a voidable preference in determining whether and to what extent to allow the creditor\u2019s claim. Once the referee did that, \u201cnothing remains for adjudication in a plenary suit\u201d; such a suit \u201cwould be a meaningless gesture.\u201d Id<em>., </em>at 334, 86 S. Ct. 467, 15 L. Ed. 2d 391. The plenary proceeding the creditor sought could be brought into the bankruptcy court because \u201cthe same issue [arose] as part of the process of allowance and disallowance of claims.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 336, 86 S. Ct. 467, 15 L. Ed. 2d 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">It was in that sense that the Court stated that \u201che who invokes the aid of the bankruptcy court by offering a proof of claim and demanding its allowance must abide the consequences of that procedure.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 333, n. 9, 86 S. Ct. 467, 15 L. Ed. 2d 391. In <em>Katchen, </em>one of those consequences was resolution of the preference issue as part of the process of allowing or disallowing claims, and accordingly there was no basis for the creditor to insist that the issue be resolved in an Article III court. See <em>id., </em>at 334, 86 S. Ct. 467, 15 L. Ed. 2d 391. Indeed, the <em>Katchen </em>Court expressly noted that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>\u201cintimate [d] no opinion concerning whether\u201d the bankruptcy</p>\n<p id=\"aks-dedup-0\">[564 U.S. 497]</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">referee would have had \u201csummary jurisdiction to adjudicate a demand by the [bankruptcy] trustee for affirmative relief, all of the substantial factual and legal bases for which ha[d] not been disposed of in passing on objections to the [creditor\u2019s proof of] claim.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 333, n. 9, 86 S. Ct. 467, 15 L. Ed. 2d 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Our <em>per curiam </em>opinion in <em>Langen-kamp </em>is to the same effect. We explained there that a preferential transfer claim can be heard in bankruptcy when the allegedly favored creditor has filed a claim, because <em>then </em>\u201cthe ensuing preference action by the trustee become [s] integral to the restructuring of the debtor-creditor relationship.\u201d 498 U.S., at 44, 111 S. Ct. 330, 112 L. Ed. 2d 343. If, in contrast, the creditor has not filed a proof of claim, the trustee\u2019s preference action does <em>not </em>\u201cbecome [] part of the claims-allowance process\u201d subject to resolution by the bankruptcy court. <em>Ibid.; </em>see <em>id., </em>at 45, 111 S. Ct. 330, 112 L. Ed. 2d 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">In ruling on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim, the Bankruptcy Court was required to and did make several factual and legal determinations that were not \u201cdisposed of in passing on objections\u201d to Pierce\u2019s proof of claim for defamation, which the court had denied almost a year earlier. <em>Katchen, supra, </em>at 332, n. 9, 86 S. Ct. 467, 15 L. Ed. 2d 391. There was some overlap between Vickie\u2019s counterclaim and Pierce\u2019s defamation claim that led the courts below to conclude that the counterclaim was compulsory, 600 F.3d, at 1057, or at least in an \u201cattenuated\u201d sense related to Pierce\u2019s claim, 264 B.R., at 631. But there was never any reason to believe that the process of adjudicating Pierce\u2019s proof of claim would necessarily resolve Vickie\u2019s counterclaim. See <em>id., </em>at 631, 632 (explaining that \u201cthe primary facts at issue on Pierce\u2019s claim were the relationship between Vickie and her attorneys and her knowledge or approval of their statements,\u201d and \u201cthe counterclaim raises issues of law entirely different from those raise [d] on the defamation claim\u201d). The United States acknowledges the point. See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae, </em>p. (I) (question presented concerns authority of a bankruptcy court to enter final judgment on a compulsory counterclaim \u201cwhen adjudication</p>\n<p id=\"Al4a\">[564 U.S. 498]</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">of the counterclaim requires resolution of issues that are not implicated by the claim against the estate\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">The only overlap between the two claims in this case was the question whether Pierce had in fact tortiously taken control of his father\u2019s estate in the manner alleged by Vickie in her counterclaim and described in the allegedly defamatory statements. From the outset, it was clear that, even assuming the Bankruptcy Court would (as it did) rule in Vickie\u2019s favor on that question, the court could not enter judgment for Vickie unless the court additionally ruled on the questions whether Texas recognized tor-tious interference with an expected gift as a valid cause of action, what the elements of that action were, and whether those elements were met in this case. 275 B.R., at 50-53. Assuming Texas accepted the elements adopted by other jurisdictions, that meant Vickie would need to prove, above and beyond Pierce\u2019s tortious interference, (1) the existence of an expectancy of a gift; (2) a reasonable certainty that the expectancy would have been realized but for the interference; and (3) damages. <em>Id., </em>at 51; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>see 253 B.R., at 558-561. Also, because Vickie sought punitive damages in connection with her counterclaim, the Bankruptcy Court could not finally dispose of the case in Vickie\u2019s favor without determining whether to subject Pierce to the sort of \u201cretribution,\u201d \u201cpunishment[,] and deterrence,\u201d <em>Exxon Shipping Co., </em>554 U.S., at 492, 504, 128 S. Ct. 2605, 171 L. Ed. 2d 570 (internal quotation marks omitted), those damages are designed to impose. There thus was never reason to believe that the process of ruling on Pierce\u2019s proof of claim would necessarily result in the resolution of Vickie\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">In both <em>Katchen </em>and <em>Langenkamp, </em>moreover, the trustee bringing the preference action was asserting a right of recovery created by federal bankruptcy law.

In <em>Katchen, </em>\u201c[t]he Trustee . . . [asserted] that the payments made [to the creditor] were preferences inhibited by Section 60a of the Bankruptcy Act.\u201d Memorandum Opinion (Feb. 8, 1963), Tr. of Record in O.

(\u00a7 60(b) of the then-applicable Bankruptcy Act) (\u201cpreference may be avoided by the trustee if the creditor receiving it or to be benefited thereby . . . has, at the time when the transfer is made, reasonable cause to believe that the debtor is insolvent\u201d). Vickie\u2019s claim, in contrast, is in no way derived from or dependent upon bankruptcy law; it is a state tort action that exists without regard to any bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">In light of all the foregoing, we disagree with the dissent that there are no \u201crelevant distinction [s]\u201d between Pierce\u2019s claim in this case and the claim at issue in <em>Langenkamp, Post, </em>at 517, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 516. We see no reason to treat Vickie\u2019s counterclaim any differently from the fraudulent conveyance action in <em>Granfinanciera, </em>492 U.S., at 56, 109 S. Ct. 2782, 106 L. Ed. 2d 26. <em>Granfinanciera\u2019s </em>distinction between actions that seek \u201cto augment the bankruptcy estate\u201d and those that seek \u201ca pro rata share of the bankruptcy res,\u201d <em>ibid.., </em>reaffirms that  Congress may not bypass Article III simply because a proceeding may have <em>some </em>bearing on a bankruptcy case; the question is whether the action at issue stems from the bankruptcy itself or would necessarily be resolved in the claims allowance process. Vickie has failed to demonstrate that her counterclaim falls within one of the \u201climited circumstances\u201d covered by the public rights exception, particularly given our conclusion that, \u201ceven with respect to matters that arguably fall within the scope of the \u2018public rights\u2019 doctrine, the presumption is in favor of Art. Ill courts.\u201d <em>Northern Pipeline, </em>458 U.S., at 69, n. 23, 77, n. 29, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L.

Brief for Petitioner 61-64. We rejected a similar argument in <em>Northern Pipeline, </em>see 458 U.S., at 84-86, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (plurality opinion); <em>id., </em>at 91, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment), and our reasoning there holds true today.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">To begin, as explained above, it is still the bankruptcy court itself that exercises the essential attributes of judicial power over a matter such as Vickie\u2019s counterclaim. See <em>supra, </em>at 487-488, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 496-497. The new bankruptcy courts, like the old, do not \u201cma[k]e only specialized, narrowly confined factual determinations regarding a particularized area of law\u201d or engage in \u201cstatutorily channeled factfinding functions.\u201d <em>Northern Pipeline, </em>458 U.S., at 85, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (plurality opinion). Instead, bankruptcy courts under the 1984 Act resolve \u201c[a]ll matters of fact and law in whatever domains of the law to which\u201d the parties\u2019 counterclaims might lead. Id., at 91, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In addition, whereas the adjunct agency in <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Benson </em>\u201cpossessed only a limited power to issue compensation orders . . . [that] could be enforced only by order of the district court,\u201d <em>Northern Pipeline, supra, </em>at 85, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598, a bankruptcy court resolving a counterclaim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(2)(C) has the power to enter \u201cappropriate orders and judgments\u201d\u2014 including final judgments\u2014subject to review only if a party chooses to appeal, see \u00a7\u00a7 157(b)(1), 158(a)-(b). It is thus no less the case here than it was in <em>Northern Pipeline </em>that \u201c [t]he authority\u2014and the responsibility\u2014to make an informed, final determination . .. remains with\u201d the bankruptcy judge, not the district court. 458 U.S., at 81, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). Given that authority, a bankruptcy court can no more be deemed a mere \u201cadjunct\u201d of the district court than a district court can be deemed such an \u201cadjunct\u201d of the court of appeals. We certainly</p>\n<p id=\"AsYs\">[564 U.S. 501]</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">cannot accept the dissent\u2019s notion that judges who have the power to enter final, binding orders are the \u201cfunctional []\u201d equivalent of \u201claw clerks [] and the Judiciary\u2019s administrative officials.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 515, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 514. And even were we wrong in this regard, that would only confirm that such judges should not be in the business of entering final judgments in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">It does not affect our analysis that, as Vickie notes, bankruptcy judges under the current Act are appointed by the Article III courts, rather than the President. See Brief for Petitioner 59. If\u2014as we have concluded\u2014the bankruptcy court itself exercises \u201cthe essential attributes of judicial power [that] are reserved to Article III courts,\u201d <em>Schor, </em>478 U.S., at 851, 106 S. Ct. 3245, 92 L. Ed. 2d 675 (internal quotation marks omitted), it does not matter who appointed the bankruptcy judge or authorized the judge to render final judgments in such proceedings. The constitutional bar remains. See The Federalist No. 78, at 471 (\u201cPeriodical appointments, however regulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in some way or other, be fatal to [a judge\u2019s] necessary independence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Finally, Vickie and her <em>amici </em>predict as a practical matter that restric<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>tions on a bankruptcy court\u2019s ability to hear and finally resolve compulsory counterclaims will create significant delays and impose additional costs on the bankruptcy process. See, <em>e.g., </em>Brief for Petitioner 34-36, 57-58; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>29-30. It goes without saying that  \u201cthe fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in facilitating functions of government, standing alone, will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution.\u201d <em>INS </em>v. <em>Chadha, </em>462 U.S. 919, 944, 103 S. Ct. 2764, 77 L. Ed. 2d 317 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">In addition, we are not convinced that the practical consequences of such limitations on the authority of bankruptcy courts to enter final judgments are as significant as Vickie and the dissent suggest. See <em>post, </em>at 519-520, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 517-518. The dissent</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">[564 U.S. 502]</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">asserts that it is important that counterclaims such as Vickie\u2019s be resolved \u201cin a bankruptcy court,\u201d and that, \u201cto be effective, a single tribunal must have broad authority to restructure [debtor-creditor] relations.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 518, 519, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 516, 517 (emphasis deleted). But the framework Congress adopted in the 1984 Act already contemplates that certain state law matters in bankruptcy cases will be resolved by judges other than those of the bankruptcy courts. Section 1334(c)(2), for example, requires that bankruptcy courts abstain from hearing specified noncore, state law claims that \u201ccan be timely adjudicated [] in a State forum of appropriate jurisdiction.\u201d Section 1334(c)(1) similarly provides that bankruptcy courts may abstain from hearing any proceeding, including core matters, \u201cin the interest of comity with State courts or respect for State law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">As described above, the current bankruptcy system also requires the district court to review <em>de novo </em>and enter final judgment on any matters that are \u201crelated to\u201d the bankruptcy proceedings, \u00a7 157(c)(1), and permits the district court to withdraw from the bankruptcy court any referred case, proceeding, or part thereof, \u00a7 157(d). Pierce has not argued that the bankruptcy courts \u201care barred from \u2018hearing\u2019 all counterclaims\u201d or proposing findings of fact and conclusions of law on those matters, but rather that it must be the district court that \u201cfinally decide[s]\u201d them. Brief for Respondent 61. We do not think the removal of counterclaims such as Vickie\u2019s from core bankruptcy jurisdiction meaningfully changes the division of labor in the current statute; we agree with the United States that the question presented here is a \u201cnarrow\u201d one. Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>23.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">If our decision today does not change all that much, then why the fuss? Is there really a threat to the separation of powers where Congress has conferred the judicial power outside Article III only over certain counterclaims in bankruptcy? The short but emphatic answer is yes. A statute</p>\n<p id=\"AMsp\">[564 U.S. 503]</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">may no more lawfully chip away at the authority of the Judicial Branch than it may eliminate it entirely. \u201cSlight encroachments create new boundaries from which legions of power can seek new territory to capture.\u201d <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Covert, </em>354 U.S. 1, 39, 77 S. Ct. 1222, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1148 (1957) (plurality opinion). Although \u201c[i]t may be that it is the obnoxious thing in its mildest and least repulsive form,\u201d we cannot overlook the intrusion: \u201cillegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing in that way, namely, by silent approaches and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>slight deviations from legal modes of procedure.\u201d <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>United States, </em>116 U.S. 616, 635, 6 S. Ct. 524, 29 L. Ed. 746 (1886). We cannot compromise the integrity of the system of separated powers and the role of the Judiciary in that system, even with respect to challenges that may seem innocuous at first blush.</p>\n<p id=\"pazb-dedup-0\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"69\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAS0AAABFAQAAAAA3SI3AAAAAqUlEQVR4nGP8z0AE+MlEjCoGhlFlo8pGlZGj7AGyGBYOVNkGZBksHFq47QW/A0IIGwei7A6SBFYORJncPyQZrJz////////jxn8EwML5wQgpuDh+IJmAyYEVXB3I3sLCgSj7ewJJAivn//////9/uFGPcA4Wzg+IaR9ZDiAMwMaBKHuEHBnYOBDS5KADQgYrB+KEfqSgwsL5Qd0UwjhafYwqG1U2qowCZQAVR5g1xJ8f/AAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"301\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Article III of the Constitution provides that the judicial power of the United States may be vested only in courts whose judges enjoy the protections set forth in that Article. We conclude today that Congress, in one isolated respect, exceeded that limitation in the Bankruptcy Act of 1984. The Bankruptcy Court below lacked the constitutional authority to enter a final judgment on a state law counterclaim that is not resolved in the process of ruling on a creditor\u2019s proof of claim.

Those issues include: (1) the scope of the phrase \u201cpersonal injury tort\u2019\u2019\u2014a question over which there is at least a three-way divide, see <em>In re Arnold, </em>407 B.R. 849, 851-853 (Bkrtcy.

Although the Court in <em>Crowell </em>went on to decide that the facts of the private dispute before it could be determined by a non-Article III tribunal in the first instance, subject to judicial review, the Court did so only after observing that the administrative adjudicator had only limited authority to make specialized, narrowly confined factual determinations regarding a particularized area of law and to issue orders that could be enforced only by action of the District Court. 285 U.S., at 38, 44-45, 54, 52 S.

Ed. 2d 26 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">[564 U.S. 504]</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">The sheer surfeit of factors that the Court was required to consider in this case should arouse the suspicion that something is seriously amiss with our jurisprudence in this area. I count at least seven different reasons given in the Court\u2019s opinion for concluding that an Article III judge was required to adjudicate this lawsuit: that it was one \u201cunder state common law\u201d which was \u201cnot a matter that can be pursued only by grace of the other branches,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 493, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 500; that it was \u201cnot \u2018completely dependent upon\u2019 adjudication of a claim created by federal law,\u201d <em>ibid.; </em>that \u201cPierce did not truly consent to resolution of Vickie\u2019s claim in the bankruptcy court proceedings,\u201d <em>ibid.; </em>that \u201cthe asserted authority to decide Vickie\u2019s claim is not limited to a \u2018particularized area of the law,\u2019 \u201d ibid.; that \u201cthere was never any reason to believe that the process of adjudicating Pierce\u2019s proof of claim would necessarily resolve Vickie\u2019s counterclaim,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 497, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 503; that the trustee was not \u201casserting a right of recovery created by federal bankruptcy law,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 498, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 504; and that the Bankruptcy Judge \u201cha[d] the power to enter \u2018appropriate orders and judgments\u2019\u2014including final judgments\u2014 subject to review only if a party chooses to appeal,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 500, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">Apart from their sheer numerosity, the more fundamental flaw in the many tests suggested by our jurisprudence is that they have nothing to do with the text or tradition of Article III. For example, Article III gives no indication that state-law claims have preferential entitlement to an Article III judge; nor does it make pertinent the extent to which the area of the law is \u201cparticularized.\u201d The multifactors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>relied upon today seem to have entered our jurisprudence almost randomly.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Leaving aside certain adjudications by federal administrative agencies, which are governed (for better or worse) by our landmark decision in <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>285 U.S. 22, 52 S. Ct. 285, 76 L. Ed. 598 (1932), in my view an Article III judge is required in <em>all </em>federal adjudications, unless there is a firmly established historical</p>\n<p id=\"An2\">[564 U.S. 505]</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">practice to the contrary. For that reason\u2014 and not because of some intuitive balancing of benefits and harms\u2014I agree that Article III judges are not required in the context of territorial courts, courts-martial, or true \u201cpublic rights\u201d cases. See <em>Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Marathon Pipe Line Co., </em>458 U.S. 50, 71, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1982) (plurality opinion). Perhaps historical practice permits non-Article III judges to process claims against the bankruptcy estate, see, <em>e.g., </em>Plank, Why Bankruptcy Judges Need Not and Should Not Be Article III Judges, 72 Am. Bankr. L. J. 567, 607-609 (1998); the subject has not been briefed, and so I state no position on the matter. But Vickie points to no historical practice that authorizes a non-Article III judge to adjudicate a counterclaim of the sort at issue here.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b550-6\">Justice Breyer,</author>\n<p id=\"AqiA\">with whom Justice Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Pierce Marshall filed a claim in Federal Bankruptcy Court against the estate of Vickie Marshall. His claim asserted that Vickie Marshall had, through her lawyers, accused him of trying to prevent her from obtaining money that his father had wanted her to have; that her accusations violated state defamation law; and that she consequently owed Pierce Marshall damages. Vickie Marshall filed a compulsory counterclaim in which she asserted that Pierce Marshall had unlawfully interfered with her husband\u2019s efforts to grant her an <em>inter vivos </em>gift and that he consequently owed her damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">The Bankruptcy Court adjudicated the claim and the counterclaim. In doing so, the court followed statutory procedures applicable to \u201ccore\u201d bankruptcy proceedings. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b). And ultimately the Bankruptcy Court entered judgment in favor of Vickie Marshall. The question before us is whether the Bankruptcy Court possessed jurisdiction to adjudicate Vickie Marshall\u2019s counterclaim. I agree with the Court that the bankruptcy statute,</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">[564 U.S. 506]</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">\u00a7 157(b)(2)(C), authorizes a bankruptcy court to adjudicate the counterclaim. But I do not agree with the majority about the statute\u2019s constitutionality. I believe the statute is consistent with the Constitution\u2019s delegation of the \u201cjudicial Power of the United States\u201d to the Judicial Branch of Government. Art. Ill, \u00a7 1. Consequently, it is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">My disagreement with the majority\u2019s conclusion stems in part from my disagreement about the way in which it interprets, or at least emphasizes, certain precedents. In my view, the majority overstates the current relevance of statements this Court made in an 1856 case, <em>Murray\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co., </em>18 How. 272, 15 L. Ed. 372, and it overstates the importance of an analysis that did not command a Court majority in <em>Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Marathon Pipe Line Co., </em>458 U.S. 50, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>2d 598 (1982), and that was subsequently disavowed. At the same time, I fear the Court understates the importance of a watershed opinion widely thought to demonstrate the constitutional basis for the current authority of administrative agencies to adjudicate private disputes, namely, <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>285 U.S. 22, 52 S. Ct. 285, 76 L. Ed. 598 (1932). And it fails to follow the analysis that this Court more recently has held applicable to the evaluation of claims of a kind before us here, namely, claims that a congressional delegation of adjudicatory authority violates separation-of-powers principles derived from Article III. See <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co., </em>473 U.S. 568, 105 S. Ct. 3325, 87 L. Ed. 2d 409 (1985); <em>Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Schor, </em>478 U.S. 833, 106 S. Ct. 3245, 92 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">I shall describe these cases in some detail in order to explain why I believe we should put less weight than does the majority upon the statement in <em>Murray\u2019s Lessee </em>and the analysis followed by the <em>Northern Pipeline </em>plurality and instead should apply the approach this Court has applied in <em>Crowell, Thomas, </em>and <em>Schor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">[564 U.S. 507]</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">In <em>Murray\u2019s Lessee, </em>the Court held that the Constitution permitted an executive official, through summary, nonjudicial proceedings, to attach the assets of a customs collector whose account was deficient. The Court found evidence in common law of \u201csummary method [s] for the recovery of debts due to the crown, and especially those due from receivers of the revenues,\u201d 18 How., at 277, 15 L. Ed. 372, and it analogized the Government\u2019s summary attachment process to the kind of self-help remedies available to private parties, <em>id., </em>at 283, 15 L. Ed. 372. In the course of its opinion, the Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">\u201c[W]e do not consider congress can either withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty; nor, on the other hand, can it bring under the judicial power a matter which, from its nature, is not a subject for judicial determination. At the same time there are matters, involving public rights, which may be presented in such form that the judicial power is capable of acting on them, and which are susceptible of judicial determination, but which congress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the courts of the United States, as it may deem proper.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 284, 15 L. Ed. 372.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">The majority reads the first part of the statement\u2019s first sentence as authoritatively defining the boundaries of Article III. <em>Ante, </em>at 484, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 494. I would read the statement in a less absolute way. For one thing, the statement is in effect dictum. For another, it is the remainder of the statement, announcing a distinction between \u201cpublic rights\u201d and \u201cprivate rights,\u201d that has had the more lasting impact. Later Courts have seized on that distinction when <em>upholding </em>non-Article III adjudication, not when striking it down. See <em>Ex parte Bakelite Corp., </em>279 U.S. 438, 451-452, 49 S. Ct. 411, 73 L. Ed. 789 (1929) (Court of Customs Appeals); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>United States, </em>289 U.S. 553, 579-580, 53 S. Ct. 751, 77 L. Ed. 1372 (1933) (Court of Claims). The one exception is <em>Northern</em></p>\n<p id=\"AonL\">[564 U.S. 508]</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\"><em>Pipeline, </em>where the Court struck down the Bankruptcy Act of 1978. But in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>case there was no majority. And a plurality, not a majority, read the statement roughly in the way the Court does today. See 458 U.S., at 67-70, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">At the same time, I believe the majority places insufficient weight on <em>Crowell, </em>a seminal case that clarified the scope of the dictum in <em>Murray\u2019s Lessee, </em>In that case, the Court considered whether Congress could grant to an Article I administrative agency the power to adjudicate an employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim against his employer. The Court assumed that an Article III court would review the agency\u2019s decision <em>de novo </em>in respect to questions of law but it would conduct a less searching review (looking to see only if the agency\u2019s award was \u201csupported by evidence in the record\u201d) in respect to questions of fact. <em>Crowell, </em>285 U.S., at 48-50, 52 S. Ct. 285, 76 L. Ed. 598. The Court pointed out that the case involved a dispute between private persons (a matter of \u201cprivate rights\u201d) and (with one exception not relevant here) it upheld Congress\u2019 delegation of primary factfinding authority to the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Justice Brand\u00e9is, dissenting (from a here-irrelevant portion of the Court\u2019s holding), wrote that the adjudicatory scheme raised only a due process question: When does due process require decision by an Article III judge? He answered that question by finding constitutional the statute\u2019s delegation of adjudicatory authority to an agency. <em>Id., </em>at 87, 52 S. Ct. 285, 76 L. Ed. 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\"><em>Crowell </em>has been hailed as \u201cthe greatest of the cases validating administrative adjudication.\u201d Bator, The Constitution as Architecture: Legislative and Administrative Courts Under Article III, 65 Ind. L. J. 233, 251 (1990). Yet, in a footnote, the majority distinguishes <em>Crowell </em>as a case in which the Court upheld the delegation of adjudicatory authority to an administrative agency simply because the agency\u2019s power to make the \u201cspecialized, narrowly confined</p>\n<p id=\"Al9\">[564 U.S. 509]</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">factual determinations\u201d at issue arising in a \u201cparticularized area of law\u201d made the agency a \u201ctrue \u2018adjunct\u2019 of the District Court.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 489-490, n. 6, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 498. Were <em>Crowell\u2019s </em>holding as narrow as the majority suggests, one could question the validity of Congress\u2019 delegation of authority to adjudicate disputes among private parties to other agencies such as the National Labor Relations Board, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Surface Transportation Board, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, thereby resurrecting important legal questions previously thought to have been decided. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160; 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 18; 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10704; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">The majority, in my view, overemphasizes the precedential effect of the plurality opinion in <em>Northern Pipeline. Ante, </em>at 485-487, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 495-496. There, the Court held unconstitutional the jurisdictional provisions of the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 granting adjudicatory authority to bankruptcy judges who lack the protections of tenure and compensation that Article III provides. Four Members of the Court wrote that Congress could grant adjudicatory authority to a non-Article III judge only where (1) the judge sits on a \u201cterritorial cour[t],\u201d (2) the judge conducts a \u201ccourts-martial,\u201d or (3) the case in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>involves a \u201cpublic right,\u201d namely, a \u201cmatter\u201d that \u201cat a minimum arise[s] \u2018between the government and others.\u2019 \u201d 458 U.S., at 64-70, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (plurality opinion) (quoting <em>Ex parte Bakelite Corp., supra, </em>at 451, 49 S. Ct. 411, 73 L. Ed. 789). Two other Members of the Court, without accepting these limitations, agreed with the result because the case involved a breach-of-contract claim brought by the bankruptcy trustee on behalf of the bankruptcy estate against a third party who was not part of the bankruptcy proceeding, and none of the Court\u2019s preceding cases (which, the two Members wrote, \u201cdo not admit of easy synthesis\u201d) had \u201cgone so far as to sanction th [is] type of adjudication.\u201d 458 U.S., at 90-91, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (Rehnquist, J. concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">[564 U.S. 510]</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Three years later, the Court held that <em>NoHhern Pipeline</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">\u201cestablishes only that Congress may not vest in a non-Article III court the power to adjudicate, render final judgment, and issue binding orders in a traditional contract action arising under state law, without consent of the litigants, and subject only to ordinary appellate review.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>473 U.S., at 584, 105 S. Ct. 3325, 87 L. Ed. 2d 409.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Rather than leaning so heavily on the approach taken by the plurality in <em>Northern Pipeline, </em>I would look to this Court\u2019s more recent Article III cases <em>Thomas </em>and Schor\u2014cases that commanded a clear majority. In both cases the Court took a more pragmatic approach to the constitutional question. It sought to determine whether, in the particular instance, the challenged delegation of adjudicatory authority posed a genuine and serious threat that one branch of Government sought to aggrandize its own constitutionally delegated authority by encroaching upon a field of authority that the Constitution assigns exclusively to another branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">In <em>Thomas, </em>the Court focused directly upon the nature of the Article III problem, illustrating how the Court should determine whether a delegation of adjudicatory authority to a non-Article III judge violates the Constitution. The statute in question required pesticide manufacturers to submit to binding arbitration claims for compensation owed for the use by one manufacturer of the data of another to support its federal pesticide registration. After describing <em>Northern Pipeline\u2019s </em>holding in the language I have set forth above, <em>supra </em>this page, the Court stated that <em>\u201cpractical attention to substance </em>rather than doctrinaire reliance on formal categories should inform application of Article III.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>473 U.S., at 587, 105 S. Ct. 3325, 87 L. Ed. 2d 409 (emphasis added). It indicated that Article Ill\u2019s requirements could not be \u201cdetermined\u201d by \u201cthe identity of the parties alone,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>or by the \u201cprivate rights\u201d/\u201cpublic</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">[564 U.S. 511]</p>\n<p id=\"A2JI\">rights\u201d distinction, <em>id., </em>at 585-586, 105 S. Ct. 3325, 87 L. Ed. 2d 409. And it upheld the arbitration provision of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">The Court pointed out that the right in question was created by a federal statute, it \u201crepresent[s] a pragmatic solution to the difficult problem of spreading [certain] costs,\u201d and the statute \u201cdoes not preclude review of the arbitration proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>by an Article III court.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 589-592, 105 S. Ct. 3325, 87 L. Ed. 2d 409. The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">\u201cGiven the nature of the right at issue and the concerns motivating the Legislature, we do not think this system threatens the independent role of the Judiciary in our constitutional scheme.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 590, 105 S. Ct. 3325, 87 L. Ed. 2d 409.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Most recently, in <em>Schor, </em>the Court described in greater detail how this Court should analyze this kind of Article III question. The question at issue in <em>Schor </em>involved a delegation of authority to an agency to adjudicate a counterclaim. A customer brought before the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) a claim for reparations against his commodity futures broker. The customer noted that his brokerage account showed that he owed the broker money, but he said that the broker\u2019s unlawful actions had produced that debit balance, and he sought damages. The broker brought a counterclaim seeking the money that the account showed the customer owed. This Court had to decide whether agency adjudication of such a counterclaim is consistent with Article III.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">In doing so, the Court expressly \u201cdeclined to adopt formalistic and unbending rules.\u201d <em>Schor, </em>478 U.S., at 851, 106 S. Ct. 3245, 92 L. Ed. 2d 675. Rather, it \u201cweighed a number of factors, none of which has been deemed determinative, with an eye to the practical effect that the congressional action will have on the constitutionally assigned role of the federal judiciary.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Those relevant factors include (1) \u201cthe origins and importance of the right to be adjudicated\u201d; (2) \u201cthe extent to which</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">[564 U.S. 512]</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">the non-Article III forum exercises the range of jurisdiction and powers normally vested only in Article III courts\u201d; (3) the extent to which the delegation nonetheless reserves judicial power for exercise by Article III courts; (4) the presence or \u201cabsence of consent to an initial adjudication before a non-Article III tribunal\u201d; and (5) \u201cthe concerns that drove Congress to depart from\u201d adjudication in an Article III court. <em>Id., </em>at 849, 851, 106 S. Ct. 3245, 92 L. Ed. 2d 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">The Court added that where \u201cprivate rights,\u201d rather than \u201cpublic rights,\u201d are involved, the \u201cdanger of encroaching on the judicial powers\u201d is greater. <em>Id., </em>at 853-854, 106 S. Ct. 3245, 92 L. Ed. 2d 675 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, while non-Article III adjudication of \u201cprivate rights\u201d is not necessarily unconstitutional, the Court\u2019s constitutional \u201cexamination\u201d of such a scheme must be more \u201csearching.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">Applying this analysis, the Court upheld the agency\u2019s authority to adjudicate the counterclaim. The Court conceded that the adjudication might be of a kind traditionally decided by a court and that the rights at issue were \u201cprivate,\u201d not \u201cpublic.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 853, 106 S. Ct. 3245, 92 L. Ed. 2d 675. But, the Court said, the CFTC deals only with a \u201c \u2018particularized area of law\u2019 \u201d; the decision to invoke the CFTC forum is \u201cleft entirely to the parties\u201d; Article III courts can review the agency\u2019s findings of fact under \u201cthe same \u2018weight of the evidence\u2019 standard sustained in Crowell\u201d and review its \u201clegal determinations . . . <em>de novo\u201d; </em>and the agency\u2019s \u201ccounterclaim jurisdiction\u201d was necessary to make \u201cworkable\u201d a \u201creparations procedure,\u201d which constitutes an important part of a congressionally enacted \u201cregula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>tory scheme.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 852-856, 106 S. Ct. 3245, 92 L. Ed. 2d 675. The Court concluded that for these and other reasons \u201cthe magnitude of any intrusion on the Judicial Branch can only be termed <em>de minimis.\u201d Id., </em>at 856, 106 S. Ct. 3245, 92 L. Ed. 2d 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">This case law, as applied in <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Schor, </em>requires us to determine pragmatically whether a congressional delegation</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">[564 U.S. 513]</p>\n<p id=\"AQzd\">of adjudicatory authority to a non-Article III judge violates the separation-of-powers principles inherent in Article III. That is to say, we must determine through an examination of certain relevant factors whether that delegation constitutes a significant encroachment by the Legislative or Executive Branches of Government upon the realm of authority that Article III reserves for exercise by the Judicial Branch of Government. Those factors include (1) the nature of the claim to be adjudicated; (2) the nature of the non-Article III tribunal; (3) the extent to which Article III courts exercise control over the proceeding; (4) the presence or absence of the parties\u2019 consent; and (5) the nature and importance of the legislative purpose served by the grant of adjudicatory authority to a tribunal with judges who lack Article Ill\u2019s tenure and compensation protections. The presence of \u201cprivate rights\u201d does not automatically determine the outcome of the question but requires a more \u201csearching\u201d examination of the relevant factors. <em>Schor, supra, </em>at 854, 106 S. Ct. 3245, 92 L. Ed. 2d 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Insofar as the majority would apply more formal standards, it simply disregards recent, controlling precedent. <em>Thomas, </em>473 U.S., at 587, 105 S. Ct. 3325, 87 L. Ed. 2d 409 (\u201c[Practical attention to substance rather than doctrinaire reliance on formal categories should inform application of Article III\u201d); <em>Schor, supra, </em>at 851, 106 S.

A grant of authority to a bankruptcy court to adjudicate compulsory counterclaims does not violate any constitutional separation-of-powers principle related to Article III.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">First, I concede that <em>the nature of the claim to he adjudicated </em>argues against my conclusion.

Ed. 2d 675, a delegation of authority to a non-Article III judge to adjudicate a claim of that kind poses a heightened risk of encroachment on the Federal Judiciary, <em>id., </em>at 854, 106 S. Ct. 3245, 92 L. Ed. 2d 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-15\">At the same time the significance of this factor is mitigated here by the fact that bankruptcy courts often decide claims that similarly resemble various common-law actions. Suppose, for example, that ownership of 40 acres of land in the bankruptcy debtor\u2019s possession is disputed by a creditor. If that creditor brings a claim in the bankruptcy court, resolution of that dispute requires the bankruptcy court to apply the same state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>property law that would govern in a state-court proceeding. This kind of dispute arises with regularity in bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Of course, in this instance the state-law question is embedded in a debt- or\u2019s counterclaim, not a creditor\u2019s claim. But the counterclaim is \u201ccompulsory.\u201d It \u201carises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\u2019s claim.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 13(a); Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7013. Thus, resolution of the counterclaim will often turn on facts identical to, or at least related to, those at issue in a creditor\u2019s claim that is undisputedly proper for the bankruptcy court to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Second, <em>the nature of the non-Article III tribunal </em>argues in favor of constitutionality. That is because the tribunal is made up of judges who enjoy considerable protection from improper political influence. Unlike the 1978 Act which provided for the appointment of bankruptcy judges by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 152 (1976 ed., Supp. IV), current law provides that the federal courts of appeals appoint federal bankruptcy judges, \u00a7 152(a)(1) (2006 ed.). Bankruptcy judges are removable by the circuit judicial council (made up of federal court of appeals and district court judges) and only for cause. \u00a7 152(e). Their salaries are pegged to those of federal district court judges, \u00a7 153(a), and the cost of their courthouses and other</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">[564 U.S. 515]</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">work-related expenses are paid by the Judiciary, \u00a7 156. Thus, although Congress technically exercised its Article I power when it created bankruptcy courts, functionally, bankruptcy judges can be compared to magistrate judges, law clerks, and the Judiciary\u2019s administrative officials, whose lack of Article III tenure and compensation protections do not endanger the independence of the Judicial Branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Third, <em>the control exercised by Article III judges over bankruptcy proceedings </em>argues in favor of constitutionality. Article III judges control and supervise the bankruptcy court\u2019s determinations\u2014at least to the same degree that Article III judges supervised the agency\u2019s determinations in <em>Crowell, </em>if not more so. Any party may appeal those determinations to the federal district court, where the federal judge will review all determinations of fact for clear error and will review all determinations of law <em>de novo. </em>Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 8013; 10 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 8013.04 (16th ed. 2011). But for the here-irrelevant matter of what <em>Crowell </em>considered to be special \u201cconstitutional\u201d facts, the standard of review for factual findings here (\u201cclearly erroneous\u201d) is more stringent than the standard at issue in <em>Crowell </em>(whether the agency\u2019s factfinding was \u201csupported by evidence in the record\u201d). 285 U.S., at 48, 52 S. Ct. 285, 76 L. Ed. 598; see <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Zurko, </em>527 U.S. 150, 152, 153, 119 S. Ct. 1816, 144 L. Ed. 2d 143 (1999) (\u201cunsupported by substantial evidence\u201d more deferential than \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). And, as <em>Crowell </em>noted, \u201cthere is no requirement that, in order to maintain the essential attributes of the judicial power, all determinations of fact in constitutional courts shall be made by judges.\u201d 285 U.S., at 51, 52 S. Ct. 285, 76 L. Ed. 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">Moreover, in one important respect Article III judges maintain greater control over the bankruptcy court proceedings at issue here than they did over the relevant proceedings in any of the previous cases in which this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Court has upheld a delegation of adjudicatory power. The District Court here may \u201cwithdraw, in whole or in part, any case or</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">[564 U.S. 516]</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">proceeding referred [to the Bankruptcy Court] ... on its own motion or on timely motion of any party, for cause shown.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(d); cf. <em>Northern Pipeline, </em>458 U.S., at 80, n. 31, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (plurality opinion) (contrasting pre-1978 law where \u201cpower to withdraw the case from the [bankruptcy] referee\u201d gave district courts \u201ccontrol\u201d over case with the unconstitutional 1978 statute, which provided no such district court authority).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Fourth, the fact that <em>the parties have consented </em>to Bankruptcy Court jurisdiction argues in favor of constitutionality, and strongly so. Pierce Marshall, the counterclaim defendant, is not a stranger to the litigation, forced to appear in Bankruptcy Court against his will. Cf. <em>id., </em>at 91, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment) (suit was litigated in Bankruptcy Court \u201cover [the defendant\u2019s] objection\u201d). Rather, he appeared voluntarily in Bankruptcy Court as one of Vickie Marshall\u2019s creditors, seeking a favorable resolution of his claim against Vickie Marshall to the detriment of her other creditors. He need not have filed a claim, perhaps not even at the cost of bringing it in the future, for he says his claim is \u201cnon-dischargeable,\u201d in which case he could have litigated it in a state or federal court after distribution. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6). Thus, Pierce Marshall likely had \u201can alternative forum to the bankruptcy court in which to pursue [his] clai[m].\u201d <em>Granfinanciera, S. A. </em>v. <em>Nordberg, </em>492 U.S. 33, 59, n. 14, 109 S. Ct. 2782, 106 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The Court has held, in a highly analogous context, that this type of consent argues strongly in favor of using ordinary bankruptcy court proceedings. In <em>Granfinanciera, </em>the Court held that when a bankruptcy trustee seeks to void a transfer of assets from the debtor to an individual on the ground that the transfer to that individual constitutes an unlawful \u201cpreference,\u201d the question whether the individual has a right to a jury trial \u201cdepends upon whether the creditor has submitted a claim against the estate.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 58, 109 S. Ct. 2782, 106 L. Ed. 2d 26. The following year, in <em>Langenkamp </em>v. <em>Culp, </em>498</p>\n<p id=\"AEGt\">[564 U.S. 517]</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">U.S. 42, 111 S. Ct. 330, 112 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1990) <em>(per curiam), </em>the Court emphasized that when the individual files a claim against the estate, that individual has</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-10\">\u201ctriggered] the process of \u2018allowance and disallowance of claims,\u2019 thereby subjecting himself to the bankruptcy court\u2019s equitable power. If the creditor is met, in turn, with a preference action from the trustee, that action becomes part of the claims-allowance process which is triable only in equity. In other words, the creditor\u2019s claim and the ensuing preference action by the trustee become integral to the restructuring of the debtor-creditor relationship through the bankruptcy court\u2019s <em>equity jurisdiction,\u201d Id., </em>at 44, 111 S. Ct. 330, 112 L. Ed. 2d 343 (quoting <em>Granfinanciera, </em>492 U.S., at 58, 109 S. Ct. 2782, 106 L. Ed. 2d 26; citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">As we have recognized, the jury trial question and the Article III question are highly analogous. See <em>id., </em>at 52-53, 109 S. Ct. 2782, 106 L. Ed. 2d 26. And to that extent, Granfinanciera\u2019s and Langenkamp\u2019s basic reasoning and conclusion apply here: Even when private rights are at issue, non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Article III adjudication may be appropriate when both parties consent. Cf. <em>Northern Pipeline, supra, </em>at 80, n. 31, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (plurality opinion) (noting the importance of consent to bankruptcy jurisdiction). See also <em>Schor, </em>478 U.S., at 849, 106 S. Ct. 3245, 92 L. Ed. 2d 675 (\u201c[A]bsence of consent to an initial adjudication before a non-Article III tribunal was relied on [in <em>Northern Pipeline] </em>as a significant factor in determining that Article III forbade such adjudication\u201d). The majority argues that Pierce Marshall \u201cdid not truly consent\u201d to bankruptcy jurisdiction, <em>ante, </em>at 493, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 500, but filing a proof of claim was sufficient in <em>Langenkamp </em>and <em>Granfi-nanciera, </em>and there is no relevant distinction between the claims filed in those cases and the claim filed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Fifth, <em>the nature and importance of the legislative purpose served </em>by the grant of adjudicatory authority to bankruptcy tribunals argues strongly in favor of constitutionality. Congress\u2019 delegation of adjudicatory powers over counterclaims</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">[564 U.S. 518]</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">asserted against bankruptcy claimants constitutes an important means of securing a constitutionally authorized end. Article I, \u00a7 8, of the Constitution explicitly grants Congress the \u201cPower To . . . establish . . . uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.\u201d James Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">\u201cpower of establishing uniform laws of bankruptcy is so intimately connected with the regulation of commerce, and will prevent so many frauds where the parties or their property may lie or be removed into different States, that the expediency of it seems not likely to be drawn into question.\u201d The Federalist No. 42, p. 271 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">Congress established the first Bankruptcy Act in 1800. 2 Stat. 19. From the beginning, the \u201ccore\u201d of federal bankruptcy proceedings has been \u201cthe restructuring of debtor-creditor relations.\u201d <em>Northern Pipeline, supra, </em>at 71, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598 (plurality opinion). And, to be effective, a single tribunal must have broad authority to restructure those relations, \u201chaving jurisdiction of the parties to controversies brought before them,\u201d \u201cdecid [ing] all matters in dispute,\u201d and \u201cdecree[ing] complete relief.\u201d <em>Katchen </em>v. <em>Landy, </em>382 U.S. 323, 335, 86 S. Ct. 467, 15 L. Ed. 2d 391 (1966) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">The restructuring process requires a creditor to file a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 501; Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3002(a). In doing so, the creditor \u201ctriggers the process of \u2018allowance and disallowance of claims,\u2019 thereby subjecting himself to the bankruptcy court\u2019s equitable power.\u201d <em>Langenkamp, supra, </em>at 44, 111 S. Ct. 330, 112 L. Ed. 2d 343 (quoting <em>Granfinanciera, supra, </em>at 58, 109 S. Ct. 2782, 106 L. Ed. 2d 26). By filing a proof of claim, the creditor agrees to the bankruptcy court\u2019s resolution of that claim, and if the creditor wins, the creditor will receive a share of the distribution of the bankruptcy estate. When the bankruptcy estate has a related claim against that creditor, that counterclaim may offset the creditor\u2019s claim, or even</p>\n<p id=\"AbvE\">[564 U.S. 519]</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">yield additional damages that augment the estate and may be distributed to the other creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">The consequent importance to the total bankruptcy scheme of permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>ting the trustee in bankruptcy to assert counterclaims against claimants, <em>and resolving those counterclaims in a bankruptcy court, </em>is reflected in the fact that Congress included \u201ccounterclaims by the estate against persons filing claims against the estate\u201d on its list of \u201c[c]ore proceedings.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(2)(C). And it explains the difference, reflected in this Court\u2019s opinions, between a claimant\u2019s and a non-claimant\u2019s constitutional right to a jury trial. Compare <em>Granfinanciera, </em>492 U.S., at 58-59, 109 S. Ct. 2782, 106 L. Ed. 2d 26 (\u201cBecause petitioners . . . have not filed claims against the estate\u201d they retain \u201ctheir Seventh Amendment right to a trial by jury\u201d), with <em>Langenkamp, </em>498 U.S., at 45, 111 S. Ct. 330, 112 L. Ed. 2d 343 (\u201cRespondents filed claims against the bankruptcy estate\u201d and \u201c[c]onse-quently, they were not entitled to a jury trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Consequently a bankruptcy court\u2019s determination of such matters has more than \u201csome bearing on a bankruptcy case.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 499, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 504 (emphasis deleted). It plays a critical role in Congress\u2019 constitutionally based effort to create an efficient, effective federal bankruptcy system. At the least, that is what Congress concluded. We owe deference to that determination, which shows the absence of any legislative or executive motive, intent, purpose, or desire to encroach upon areas that Article III reserves to judges to whom it grants tenure and compensation protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Considering these factors together, I conclude that, as in <em>Schor, </em>\u201cthe magnitude of any intrusion on the Judicial Branch can only be termed <em>de minimis,\u201d </em>478 U.S., at 856, 106 S. Ct. 3245, 92 L. Ed. 2d 675. I would similarly find the statute before us constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The majority predicts that as a \u201cpractical matter\u201d today\u2019s decision \u201cdoes not change all that much.\u201d Ante, at 501-502, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 505-506. But I doubt that is so. Consider a typical case: A tenant</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">[564 U.S. 520]</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">files for bankruptcy. The landlord files a claim for unpaid rent. The tenant asserts a counterclaim for damages suffered by the landlord\u2019s (1) failing to fulfill his obligations as lessor, and (2) improperly recovering possession of the premises by misrepresenting the facts in housing court. (These are close to the facts presented in <em>In re Beugen, </em>81 B.R. 994 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Cal. 1988).) This state-law counterclaim does not \u201cste[m] from the bankruptcy itself,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 499, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 504, it would not \u201cnecessarily be resolved in the claims allowance process,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>and it would require the debtor to prove damages suffered by the lessor\u2019s failures, the extent to which the landlord\u2019s representations to the housing court were untrue, and damages suffered by improper recovery of possession of the premises, cf. <em>ante, </em>at 497-498, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 504. Thus, under the majority\u2019s holding, the federal district judge, not the bankruptcy judge, would have to hear and resolve the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">Why is that a problem? Because these types of disputes arise in bankruptcy court with some frequency. See, <em>e.g., In re CBI Holding Co., </em>529 F.3d 432 (CA2 2008) (state-law claims and counterclaims); <em>In re Winstar Communications, Inc., </em>348 B.R. 234 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Del. 2005) (same); <em>In re Ascher, </em>128 B.R. 639 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ill. 1991) (same); <em>In re Sun West Distributors, Inc., </em>69 B.R. 861 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SD Cal. 1987) (same). Because the volume of bankruptcy cases is staggering, involving almost 1.6 million <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>filings last year, compared to a federal district court docket of around 280,000 civil cases and 78,000 criminal cases. Administrative Office of the United States Courts, J. Duff, Judicial Business of the United States Courts: Annual Report of the Director 14 (2010). Because unlike the \u201crelated\u201d noncore state-law claims that bankruptcy courts must abstain from hearing, see, <em>ante, </em>at 502, 180 L. Ed. 2d, at 505, compulsory counterclaims involve the same factual disputes as the claims that may be finally adjudicated by the bankruptcy courts. Because under these circumstances, a constitutionally required game of jurisdictional</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">[564 U.S. 521]</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">ping-pong between courts would lead to inefficiency, increased cost, delay, and needless additional suffering among those faced with bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
