The question in this case concerns how a federal court should determine the maximum sentence for a prior state drug offense for ACCA purposes. We hold that</p>\n<p id=\"AqB\">[563 U.S. 818]</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\u201d for a defendant\u2019s prior state drug offense is the maximum sentence applicable to his offense when he was convicted of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">After an extended chase, police officers in Fayetteville, North Carolina, apprehended petitioner Clifton Te-relle McNeill. McNeill was caught with 3.1 grams of crack cocaine packaged for distribution and a .38-caliber revolver. In August 2008, he pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-19\">At sentencing, the District Court determined that McNeill qualified for ACCA\u2019s sentencing enhancement.  Under ACCA, a person who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and \u201chas three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense\u201d is subject to a 15-year minimum prison sentence. \u00a7 924(e)(1). McNeill conceded that two of his prior convictions\u2014assault with a deadly weapon and robbery\u2014were for \u201cviolent felonies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-20\">McNeill argued, however, that none of his six state drug-trafficking convictions were for \u201cserious drug offense[s]\u201d because those crimes no longer carried a \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more.\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). When McNeill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>committed those crimes between 1991 and 1994, each carried a 10-year maximum sentence, and McNeill in fact received 10-year sentences. See N. C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 14-1.1(a)(8), 90-95(a)(1) and (b)(1) (Michie 1993) (sale of cocaine and possession with intent to sell cocaine). But as of October 1, 1994, North Carolina reduced the maximum sentence for selling cocaine to 38 months and the maximum sentence for possessing cocaine with intent to sell to 30 months. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 15A-1340.17(c) and (d), 90-95(a)(1) and (b)(1) (Lexis 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The District Court rejected Mc-Neill\u2019s request that it look to current state law and instead relied on the 10-year</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">[563 U.S. 819]</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">maximum sentence that applied to McNeill\u2019s drug offenses at the time he committed them. No. 5:08-CR-2-D-1 (EDNC, Jan. 26, 2009), App. 118. Finding that McNeill therefore had three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses, the court applied ACCA\u2019s sentencing enhancement. The court then departed upward from the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range and sentenced McNeill to 300 months in prison in light of his \u201clong and unrelenting history of serious criminal conduct\u201d and \u201cnear certain likelihood of recidivism.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 119, 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. Although the court consulted the maximum sentence under <em>current </em>state law, it reached the same conclusion as the District Court because North Carolina\u2019s revised sentencing scheme does not apply to crimes committed before October 1, 1994. 598 F.3d 161, 165 (2010) (agreeing with <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hinojosa, </em>349 F.3d 200 (CA5 2003), and disagreeing with <em>United States </em>v. <em>Darden, </em>539 F.3d 116 (CA2 2008)). Thus, even if McNeill were convicted today for his 1991, 1992, and September 1994 drug offenses, he would still be subject to the old 10-year statutory maximum. 598 F.3d, at 165 (citing N. C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.10 and <em>State </em>v. <em>Branch, </em>134 N.C. App. 637, 639-640, 518 S.E.2d 213, 215 (1999)). We granted certiorari, 562 U.S. 1128, 131 S. Ct. 856, 178 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2011), and now affirm, albeit for a different reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">As in all statutory construction cases, we begin with \u201cthe language itself [and] the specific context in which that language is used.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., </em>519 U.S. 337, 341, 117 S. Ct. 843, 136 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1997).  ACCA\u2019s sentencing enhancement applies to individuals who have \u201cthree previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(1). As relevant here, the statute defines a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d as \u201can offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing,</p>\n<p id=\"b82-13\">[563 U.S. 820]</p>\n<p id=\"b82-14\">or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance . . . , for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-15\">The plain text of ACCA requires a federal sentencing court to consult the maximum sentence applicable to a defendant\u2019s previous drug offense at the time of his conviction for that offense. The statute requires the court to determine whether a \u201cprevious con-victio[n]\u201d was for a serious drug offense. The only way to answer this backward-looking question is to consult the law that applied at the time of that conviction. We did precisely that in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>553 U.S. 377, 128 S. Ct. 1783, 170 L. Ed. 2d 719 (2008), where we addressed whether the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\u201d includes recidivism enhancements. In assessing the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\u201d for Rodriguez\u2019s state drug offenses, we consulted the version of state law \u201cthat [he] was convicted of violating,\u201d that is, the 1994 statutes and penalties that applied to his offenses at the time of his state convictions. <em>Id., </em>at 380-381, 128 S. Ct. 1783, 170 L. Ed. 2d 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Use of the present tense in the definition of \u201cserious drug offense\u201d does not suggest otherwise. McNeill argues that the present-tense verb in the phrase \u201cis prescribed by law\u201d requires federal courts to determine the maximum sentence for a potential predicate offense by looking to the state law in effect at the time of the federal sentencing, as if the state offense were committed on the day of federal sentencing. That argument overlooks the fact that  ACCA is concerned with convictions that have already occurred. Whether the prior conviction was for an offense \u201cinvolving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance\u201d can only be answered by reference to the law under which the defendant was convicted. Likewise, the maximum sentence that \u201cis prescribed by law\u201d for that offense must also be determined according to the law applicable at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">[563 U.S. 821]</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">McNeill\u2019s interpretation contorts the plain meaning of the statute. Although North Carolina courts actually sentenced him to 10 years in prison for his drug offenses, McNeill now contends that the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\u201d for those offenses is 30 or 38 months. We find it \u201chard to accept the proposition that a defendant may lawfully [have] be[en] sentenced to a term of imprisonment that exceeds the \u2018maximum term of imprisonment. . . prescribed by law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 383, 128 S. Ct. 1783, 170 L. Ed. 2d 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">The \u201cbroader context of the statute as a whole,\u201d specifically the adjacent definition of \u201cviolent felony,\u201d confirms this interpretation. <em>Robinson, supra, </em>at 341, 117 S. Ct. 843, 136 L. Ed. 2d 808.  ACCA defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d in part as a crime that <em>\u201chas </em>as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d or <em>\u201cis </em>burglary, arson, or extortion, <em>involves </em>use of explosives, or otherwise <em>involves </em>conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Despite Congress\u2019 use of present tense in that definition, when determining whether a defendant was convicted of a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d we have turned to the version of state law that the defendant was actually convicted of violating. In <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S. Ct. 2143, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1990), the Court held that whether Taylor\u2019s 1963 and 1971 convictions were for a crime that <em>\u201cis </em>burglary\u201d depended on the \u201cformer Missouri statutes defining second-degree burglary\u201d that \u201cwere the bases for Taylor\u2019s prior convictions.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 602, 110 S. Ct. 2143, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607; see <em>id., </em>at 578, n. 1, 110 S. Ct. 2143, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607 (noting a subsequent change in state law, but relying on the burglary statutes in force \u201c [i]n those years\u201d in which Taylor was convicted). Similarly, in <em>James </em>v. <em>United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>127 S. Ct. 1586, 167 L. Ed. 2d 532 (2007), this Court looked to the versions of Florida\u2019s burglary and criminal attempt statutes that were in effect \u201cat the time of James\u2019 [1993 state] conviction.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 197, 127 S. Ct. 1586, 167 L. Ed. 2d 532; see <em>ibid. </em>(quoting the 1993 versions of the Florida statutes). The present-tense verbs in the</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">[563 U.S. 822]</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d did not persuade us to look anywhere other than the law under which the defendants were actually convicted to determine the elements of their offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Having repeatedly looked to the historical statute of conviction in the context of violent felonies, we see no reason to interpret \u201cserious drug offense[s]\u201d in the adjacent section of the same statute any differently. In both definitions, Congress used the present tense to refer to past convictions. Cf. <em>Nijhawan </em>v. <em>Holder, </em>557 U.S. 29, 39, 129 S. Ct. 2294, 174 L. Ed. 2d 22 (2009) (\u201cWhere, as here, Congress uses similar statutory language ... in two adjoining provisions, it normally intends similar interpretations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">This natural reading of ACCA also avoids the absurd results that would follow from consulting current state law to define a previous offense. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 334, 112 S. Ct. 1351, 117 L. Ed. 2d 593 (1992) (  \u201c[A]bsurd results are to be avoided\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">For example, McNeill concedes that under his approach, a prior conviction could \u201cdisappear\u201d entirely for ACCA purposes if a State reformulated the offense between the defendant\u2019s state conviction and federal sentencing. Tr. of Oral Arg. 12-13. The Sixth Circuit confronted a similar scenario in <em>Mallett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>334 F.3d 491 (2003), where Ohio had substantially changed how drug quantities were measured since Mallett\u2019s state drug conviction. <em>Id., </em>at 502 (addressing this issue in the context of the career offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines). The Sixth Circuit could not \u201cdetermine how Mallett would now be sentenced under Ohio\u2019s revised drug laws\u201d because the offense for which he had been convicted \u201cno longer exist[ed] and no conversion between the former and amended statutes [wa]s facially apparent.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court therefore was compelled to look to state law \u201cas of the time of the state-court</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">[563 U.S. 823]</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">conviction\u201d to determine the maximum possible sentence for Mallet\u2019s prior offense. <em>Id., </em>at 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-13\">It cannot be correct that subsequent changes in state law can erase an earlier conviction for ACCA purposes. A defendant\u2019s history of criminal activity\u2014and the culpability and dangerousness that such history demonstrates\u2014does not cease to exist when a State reformulates its criminal statutes in a way that prevents precise translation of the old conviction into the new statutes. Congress based ACCA\u2019s sentencing enhancement on prior convictions and could not have expected courts to treat those convictions as if they had simply disappeared. To the contrary, Congress has expressly directed that a prior violent felony conviction remains a \u201cconviction\u201d unless it has been \u201cexpunged, or set aside or [the] person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20); see also <em>Custis </em>v. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number><em>States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 491, 114 S. Ct. 1732, 128 L. Ed. 2d 517 (1994) (explaining that \u00a7 921(a)(20) \u201ccreates a clear negative implication that courts <em>may </em>count a conviction that has <em>not </em>been set aside\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">In addition, McNeill\u2019s interpretation would make ACCA\u2019s applicability depend on the timing of the federal sentencing proceeding. McNeill cannot explain why two defendants who violated \u00a7 922(g) on the same day and who had identical criminal histories\u2014down to the dates on which they committed and were sentenced for their prior offenses\u2014should receive dramatically different federal sentences solely because one\u2019s \u00a7 922(g) sentencing happened to occur after the state legislature amended the punishment for one of the shared prior offenses. In contrast, the interpretation we adopt permits a defendant to know even before he violates \u00a7 922(g) whether ACCA would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Applying our holding to this case, we conclude that the District Court properly applied ACCA\u2019s sentencing enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">[563 U.S. 824]</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">to McNeill. In light of his two admitted violent felony convictions, McNeill needed only one conviction for a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d to trigger ACCA, but we note that all six of his prior drug convictions qualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">In November 1992, McNeill pleaded guilty and was sentenced in a North Carolina court for five offenses: selling cocaine on four separate occasions in October 1991 and possessing cocaine with intent to sell on one occasion in February 1992. At the time of McNeill\u2019s November 1992 conviction and sentencing, North Carolina law dictated that the maximum sentence for selling cocaine in 1991 and the maximum sentence for possessing cocaine with intent to sell in 1992 was 10 years in prison. See N. C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 14-1.1(a)(8), 90-95(a)(1) and (b)(1) (Michie 1993). McNeill\u2019s 1992 convictions were therefore for \u201cserious drug offense [s]\u201d within the meaning of ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">McNeill\u2019s sixth drug offense was possessing cocaine with intent to sell in September 1994. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced in a North Carolina court in April 1995. By April 1995, North Carolina had changed the sentence applicable to that type of drug offense but still provided that the maximum sentence for possessing cocaine with intent to sell in September 1994 was 10 years in prison. See 1993 N. C. Sess. Laws, ch. 538, \u00a7 2 (repealing N. C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-1.1); 1993 N. C. Sess. Laws, ch. 538, \u00a7 56 (as modified by Extra Session 1994 N. C. Sess. Laws, ch. 24, \u00a7 14(b)) (\u201cThis act becomes effective October 1, 1994, and applies only to offenses occurring on or after that date. Prosecutions for, or sentences based on, offenses occurring before the effective date of this act [are controlled by] the statutes that would be applicable to those prosecutions or sentences but for the provisions of this act\u201d). Therefore, McNeill\u2019s 1995 conviction was also for a \u201cserious drug offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"pA2\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"44\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAARwAAAArAQAAAACChwrsAAAAlUlEQVR4nO3TMQrCQBCF4T9DasmBBL2ZHsZDWHgZU6SedILis9wRHqRJIcHtvsc8mIXdTiyeOZZn4FeHvi7oEMD7XHKH9XZC0n5WOwYZoLF2HAK6zJZbBHCdSttC0uNQ1jDIAPpjKTsEMNXcIYBLX3ILSbt7WcMgAzQMresh6fYsZYNE0utUcoNc7xV0m/93/6END30Ajc7OA3OSp5sAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"284\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">[563 U.S. 825]</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">We conclude that  a federal sentencing court must determine whether \u201can offense under State law\u201d is a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d by consulting the \u201cmaximum term of imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>ment\u201d applicable to a defendant\u2019s previous drug offense at the time of the defendant\u2019s state conviction for that offense.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).
