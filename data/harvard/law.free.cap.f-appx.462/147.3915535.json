Because no substantial question is presented by this appeal, we will summarily affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-22\">Fontanez was convicted in 1989 for numerous drug charges arising out of the activities of the \u201cFontanez Cocaine Organization,\u201d including conspiracy to distribute cocaine; conducting a continuing criminal enterprise (\u201cCCE\u201d), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848; unlawful use of a telephone; distribution of cocaine; and distribution of cocaine at or near a school. His judgment and life sentence were affirmed by this Court in 1990. <em>Appeal of Fontanez, </em>919 F.2d 134 (Table) (3d Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>500 U.S. 936, 111 S.Ct. 2062, 114 L.Ed.2d 467 (1991). In January 1996, Fontanez filed a motion for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; it was denied on its merits and no certificate of appealability issued. <em>United States v. Fontanez, </em>C.A. No. 96-2038 (3d Cir.1997). In 1999, Fontanez filed another \u00a7 2255 motion claiming that his CCE conviction must be vacated in light of <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999) (holding a jury must be instructed to unanimously agree as to the specific \u201cviolations\u201d that support a CCE offense). In a separate action filed in November 2000, Fontanez sought permission to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion raising the same claim. The motion was dismissed, and permission to file was denied. <em>United States v. Fontanez, </em>C.A. No. 00-1663 (3d Cir.2000) (denying Fontanez\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability); <em>In re: Efraim Fontanez, </em>C.A. No. 00-3503 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"ALn\">In May 2011, Fontanez filed the instant petition for a writ of audita querela under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651. He claimed that the District Court improperly imposed a mandatory life sentence and, once again, that his CCE conviction should be vacated in light of <em>Richardson. </em>The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>denied the motion, finding that such a challenge must be brought in a \u00a7 2255 motion. Fontanez appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The writ of audita querela is available as residual post-conviction relief \u201cto the extent that it fills in gaps in the current system of post-conviction relief.\u201d <em>Massey v. United States, </em>581 F.3d 172, 174 (3d Cir.2009). Thus, relief via a petition for a writ of audita querela is not available where a specific statute addresses the issue at hand. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he means to collaterally challenge a federal conviction or sentence\u201d is through a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, not a petition for a writ of audita querela. <em>Id. </em>The restrictions in \u00a7 2255 on filing successive habeas motions do not create a gap which may be filled by the writ of audita querela. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in denying Fontanez\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">As this appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
