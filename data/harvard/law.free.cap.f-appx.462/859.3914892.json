Prater challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, rulings about his conduct as a <em>pro se </em>litigant, the denial of his requests for a continuance and <em>for </em>additional resources, and the reasonableness of his sentence. Prater also challenges, for the first time, evi-dentiary rulings, alleged misconduct by the prosecution, and the effectiveness of his standby counsel. We affirm Prater\u2019s convictions and sentence, but we decline to review his argument about ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">Ample evidence supports Prater\u2019s convictions. Prater interfered corruptly with the laws of the Revenue Service and committed criminal contempt when he continued to solicit and perform services for clientele despite admonitions from the Service and others about the illegality of his tax avoidance scheme and a ruling of a Texas court in 2002 that his scheme was \u201cfrivolous\u201d and that enjoined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>him advising or aiding persons in evading income taxes. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(a); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(3). The government presented testimony from Prater\u2019s former wife, Rebecca Anderson; a prosecutor, Ann Bibeau; a special master for a Texas court, Dennis O\u2019Leary; an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, John Osa; a special agent of the Service, Norm Meadows; and several former clients that, between 2002 and 2005, Prater was compensated for counseling and filing fraudulent tax documents for his clientele and that Prater disregarded the decision of the Texas court and newspaper articles, letters from the Service and his clientele, and a pamphlet from the Service warning that Prater\u2019s tax avoidance, scheme was frivolous and he would be prosecuted. In October 2002, Prater counseled and assisted Robert and Evangelia Reid in filing a fraudulent tax return that failed to report any income and sought a refund of more than $9,000 dollars, but Gloria Jackson of the Service and an accountant, Frederick Lugar, testified that the Reids later met with the Service and filed an amended return stating that they owed taxes. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(2). Prater failed to file tax returns in 2002 and 2003 although, as explained by special agent James Cortier, Prater received between $668 and $727 monthly from the Social Security Administration; Prater\u2019s bank records established that he earned over $130,000 in 2002 and over $50,000 in 2003; Prater stated on a lease application in 2002 that he earned over $200,000; and Prater reported to an insurance company in 2003 that he had an income of $100,000. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 7203. Prater also testified falsely before the grand jury that he had not advised others to or attempted personally to hide assets from the Revenue Service and that he had not continued to operate his business after issuance of the injunction or concealed those operations from O\u2019Leary, who was responsible for monitoring Prater\u2019s compliance with the injunction. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623(a). Prater divulged his plan to evade the injunction to Agent Osa, and Prater opened a bank account in the name of Osa\u2019s fictitious business, Texas Carribe, in which Prater deposited thousands of dollars for services that he had performed in violation of the injunction, including advising his wife to conceal assets and Wallace Bishop to quitclaim property to avoid paying taxes. Prater argues that he acted in good faith and he did not intend to defraud the Service, but the evidence supports the jury\u2019s \u201cresolution of [this] factual issue[].\u201d <em>United States v. Lankford, </em>955 F.2d 1545, 1560 (11th Cir.1992). Prater admitted as true allegations that he had engaged in \u201cfalse, misleading, and deceptive acts and practices\u201d in Texas; Prater admitted violating the injunction to Osa; Prater plotted with Anderson and Osa to conceal assets from the Service; and Prater ignored warnings from the Service and numerous clients that his tax avoidance scheme was fraudulent. Prater cannot turn a blind eye to the \u201cduties imposed upon him by the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d <em>Cheek v. United States, </em>498 U.S. 192, 206, 111 S.Ct. 604, 613, 112 L.Ed.2d 617 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by circumscribing Prater\u2019s opening statement, his examination of government witnesses, or the documents that he sought to introduce into evidence. The district court ordered Prater before trial to refrain from challenging the legality of income tax laws, and Prater does not challenge the validity of that order. The district court was entitled to enforce its order by prohibiting Prater from arguing, cross-examining agent James Cortier, or admitting evidence about tax laws. <em>See United States v. Zielie, </em>734 F.2d 1447, 1455 (11th Cir.1984), <em>abrogated on another ground by Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 177-79, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 2779-80, 97 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>L.Ed.2d 144 (1987); <em>United States v. Baptista-Rodriguez, </em>17 F.3d 1354, 1366 (11th Cir.1994). The district court also reasonably prohibited Prater from arguing about his entrapment defense instead of questioning Osa. These limitations enabled the district court, to \u201cmaintain the pace of the trial\u201d and to control Prater\u2019s open defiance of the pre-trial order, and the district court acted even handedly by also limiting questioning and the admission of evidence by the government. <em>Moore v. United States, </em>598 F.2d 439, 442 (5th Cir.1979). Moreover, the district court eradicated any potential prejudice to Prater by instructing the jury not to \u201creflect upon\u201d any objections, motions, or \u201cguidance\u201d provided to Prater and not to allow those rulings to \u201cplay any part in [determining] the merits of the case\u201d or in \u201cassessing] ... the evidence.\u201d We presume that the jury complied with that instruction. <em>See United States v. Brazel, </em>102 F.3d 1120, 1145 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion when it denied Prater\u2019s requests for a continuance or for additional resources to prepare for trial. Prater had six months to examine and prepare a response to discovery delivered by the government, and Prater does not argue that \u201cadditional time to examine the [discovery materials] would have affected the outcome of his case.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>473 F.3d 1147, 1151 (11th Cir.2006). The district court satisfied Prater\u2019s right of \u201cmeaningful access to the courts\u201d by appointing standby counsel to aid Prater and giving him access to a law library, a resource that Prater used to prepare numerous pre-trial motions. <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 350-51, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 2179-80, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). Prater argues that he was denied subpoenas, but the district court advised Prater about his right to subpoena witnesses and granted his request to subpoena Brenda Vicario.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The district court did not err, much less plainly err, in its evidentiary rulings. The government was entitled to admit evidence about the annual income that Prater reported to an insurance company and the social security benefits that he received to prove that Prater was required to file tax returns in 2002 and 2003. The government also was entitled to admit a tape-recorded conversation authenticated by William Bishop during which Prater advocated evading taxes by transferring property using a quitclaim deed, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Evid. 901(a), and to admit documents and testimony from Bibeau to establish that Prater violated the injunction issued by the Texas court, <em>see id. </em>404(b), 902(4). Because Osa was Prater\u2019s confidante, Osa could testify that he found credible Prater\u2019s statements about concealing $25,000 from the Service by depositing the funds in four different banks. <em>See id. </em>701. Prater waived any objection to Exhibit 130 by telling the district court that he did \u201c[n]ot really\u201d object to its admission, <em>see United States v. Thayer, </em>204 F.3d 1352, 1355 (11th Cir.2000), and the district court eliminated any possible prejudice created by Anderson\u2019s testimony about an article disparaging tax avoidance schemes by instructing the jury to consider the article, not for its truth, but to determine Prater\u2019s \u201creaction\u201d and response to its contents, <em>see Brazel, </em>102 F.3d at 1145.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Prater has failed to establish that the government engaged in any conduct that was prejudicial to Prater\u2019s substantial rights. Comments by the government during its opening argument that Prater \u201cfalsely claimed\u201d that he could evade tax laws and that he was a \u201cdefier of the law\u201d were \u201cmerely a characterization of the evidence to be adduced at trial, subject, of course, to the jury\u2019s evaluation of the accuracy of the characterization.\u201d <em>United States v. Correa-Arroyave, </em>721 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>F.2d 792, 795 (11th Cir.1983). Likewise, remarks by the government during closing statements that the \u201cJudge had told [Prater that] his positions were frivolous\u201d and that Prater \u201clied intentionally,\u201d were supported by the evidence about the ruling of the Texas court and Prater\u2019s false statements to the grand jury. Prater argues that the government failed to disclose that his former girlfriend, Margaret Tilus, would testify, but Prater does not argue that his cross-examination or trial strategy would have differed had Tilus been included on the pretrial witness list provided by the government. <em>See United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682-83, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3383-84, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). That the government was admonished not to lead witnesses or seek to admit certain evidence does not equate to misconduct, and the government is not to blame for Bibeau\u2019s characterization of Prater\u2019s tax program as a \u201ctax scam.\u201d Because Prater has failed to identify any individual instances of prosecutorial misconduct, \u201cno cumulative error[ ] can exist.\u201d <em>United States v. Waldon, </em>363 F.3d 1103, 1110 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">We decline to address Prater\u2019s argument that standby counsel was ineffective. Prater complains that counsel \u201cdid nothing whatsoever to assist [him]\u201d and he identifies two purported errors by counsel, but \u201c[t]he record is not sufficiently developed for us to decide this claim.\u201d <em>United States v. Hill, </em>643 F.3d 807, 879 n. 38 (11th Cir.2011) (applying <em>United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002)). Prater can present his argument in a post-conviction motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Prater\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable. Prater was subject to enhancements for having \u201corganize[d] or l[ed]\u201d a tax avoidance scheme \u201cthat involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive,\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) (Nov. 2009), and having \u201cwillfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede,\u201d the investigation and prosecution of his crimes, <em>id., </em>\u00a7 3C1.1. Prater\u2019s misconduct is extensive: his tax avoidance scheme involved over 700 clients; he violated an injunction of a Texas court by continuing to operate his tax avoidance scheme and attempting to conceal his wrongdoing; he attempted to hide assets for himself and others from the Service; Prater asked Osa to lie to and prepare fraudulent statements to submit to the Service; Prater made false statements to a grand jury denying his crimes; Prater solicited Vicario to testify falsely before the grand jury; and Prater during trial defied repeatedly an order that prohibited him from challenging the tax laws. In a telephone call to Vicario from jail, Prater boasted that he was \u201cgonna try to offer things into evidence\u201d knowing that \u201cthe Judge is gonna deny it\u201d then \u201cask the same question and ... ask to offer it as an exhibit ... just so the jury can hear me say this 50 times and the Judge say denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">Prater\u2019s sentence also is substantively reasonable. Prater stated falsely at sentencing that he \u201cretired back in 2002,\u201d insisted, that he had \u201cnever seen a law that says [American citizens] have to pay tax on our income,\u201d and asserted that he \u201cwould probably do the same thing if [he] were a young man again.\u201d Based on his statements and conduct at trial, the district court \u201cconsidered the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d and reasonably concluded that Prater was a \u201ccongenitally predetermined con m[a]n\u201d who, having been arrested previously for insurance and credit card fraud and been dismissive of the injunction entered by the Texas court, required a sentence of imprisonment that would \u201cdisable[] [him as much] as possible\u201d from \u201ccontinuing] exactly the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>behavior.\u201d Presented with an advisory guideline range between 292 and 365 months of imprisonment, the district court reasonably determined that imprisonment for 336 months was necessary \u201cto protect the public from further episodes of [Prater\u2019s] malevolence,\u201d punish Prater for his crimes, promote respect for the law, and address Prater\u2019s unrepentant recidivism. The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">We AFFIRM Prater\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
