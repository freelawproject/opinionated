The district court departed below the 46-to 57-month guideline range pursuant to \u00a7 5K3.1 and sentenced him to 37 months of imprisonment. On appeal, he argues that the district court failed to give an adequate explanation of the reasons for the sentence. Rios-Rojas also contends that the sentence was unreasonably high in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He argues that the 16-level drug trafficking enhancement was excessive and that his family circumstances made him less culpable.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The Government moves for summary af-firmance, asserting that this court has rejected defendants\u2019 disagreements with the weight given by the district court to the various 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In the alternative, the Government seeks an extension of time to file an appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">We review Rios-Rojas\u2019s challenge to his sentence for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The sentencing transcript reveals that the sentencing judge reviewed the presentence report, considered Rios-Rojas\u2019s written submissions to the court, acknowledged defense counsel\u2019s arguments and Rios-Rojas\u2019s statement, stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, yet refused to further depart or deviate below the guideline range. Thus, the district court\u2019s statement of reasons for the sentence was adequate. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 359, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 564-65 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">This court applies a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness to a within-guidelines sentence. <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008). Rios-Rojas seeks to preserve for potential future review his claim that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply to sentences calculated under \u00a7 2L1.2 because that Guideline is flawed, but he concedes that this claim is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 367 (5th Cir.2009). We need not decide whether Rios-Rojas\u2019s sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because he cannot show that the sentence was unreasonable even without the presumption. Specifically, he has failed to show that his sentence \u201c(1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance or in the alternative for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b509-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
