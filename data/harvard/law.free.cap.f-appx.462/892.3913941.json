On appeal, Barranco-Millares argues that the district court (1) erred in finding that the City was a \u201cvictim\u201d eligible for receiving restitution, as defined by the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A; and (2) erred in determining the restitution amount. After review, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Barranco-Millares contests the district court\u2019s determination that the City is owed restitution. His argument is two-fold. First, Barranco-Millares argues that his offense was not the direct and proximate cause of the electrical costs incurred. Second, he disputes the court\u2019s determination that the City is the \u201cvictim\u201d liable for the repairs to the electrical infrastructure.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">The MVRA defines a victim as \u201ca person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(2). Barranco-Mil-lares\u2019s conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a) is an offense for which restitution may be ordered. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(c)(l)(A)(ii). In order to show direct and proximate causation, the government \u201cmust show not only that a particular loss would not have occurred but for the conduct underlying the offense of conviction, but also that the causal connection between the conduct and the loss is not too attenuated (either factually or temporally).\u201d <em>United States v. Robertson, </em>493 F.3d 1322, 1334 (11th Cir.2007). The \u201c[djefen-dant\u2019s conduct need not be the sole cause of the loss, but any subsequent action that contributes to the loss ... must be directly related to the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review <em>de novo </em>whether an entity is properly classified as a victim under the MVRA, but we review for clear error the factual finding of whether the defendant was the proximate cause of the harm suffered by that entity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">The district court found that the diversion and theft of electricity was necessary for the operation of the lamps and air conditioning unit that fostered a proper climate for the marijuana plants to thrive. The district court therefore determined that the City was directly and proximately harmed by Barranco-Millares\u2019s offense because it would not have suffered losses\u2014 the theft of electricity and the damage to the infrastructure \u2014 but for the operation of the grow house. Additionally, representatives from the City testified that the City would be repairing the electrical infrastructure that had been damaged to allow the diversion of the power. Although Bar-ranco-Millares contends that it is possible that the property owner, rather than the City, is responsible for these repairs, he points to no evidence to support this conjecture or to discredit the City\u2019s testimony that it will handle the repairs. Therefore, we find no error in the district court\u2019s determination that Barranco-Millares was the proximate cause of the harm suffered by the City, and that such harm included both the costs of diverted electricity and the repairs to the electrical infrastructure. We thus find that the City was properly classified as a victim under the MVRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">Barranco-Millares next challenges the district court\u2019s determination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>restitution amount he owes. The MVRA requires that if the defendant\u2019s offense resulted in loss of or damage to property and the return of such property is impossible or inadequate, the defendant must pay the victim \u201cthe value of the property on the date of the damage, loss, or destruction.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(b)(1)(B)(i)(I). We have acknowledged that the determination of the proper restitution amount is an \u201cinexact science.\u201d <em>United States v. Huff, </em>609 F.3d 1240, 1248 (11th Cir.2010). We review the district court\u2019s use of a particular measure of value for abuse of discretion and the court\u2019s findings as to the specific amount of restitution for clear error. <em>United States v. Shugart, </em>176 F.3d 1373, 1375 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">The district court heard a substantial amount of testimony from representatives of the City about how the electricity damages were calculated. The City gave detailed explanations regarding its determination of the time frame of the electricity theft, the process of counting the devices using electricity, and the formulas used for calculating the billing rates. The City also explained the repairs that would need to be made to the electrical infrastructure and presented a spreadsheet detailing the projected costs associated with those repairs. Barranco-Millares claims that the costs calculated are speculative but neither points to specific errors in the City\u2019s testimony nor advocates an alternate methodology for tabulating costs. We find the district court\u2019s reliance on the City\u2019s testimony to be reasonable and affirm the district court\u2019s reasonable determination of the restitution amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
