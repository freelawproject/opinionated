Futch, P.C. (collectively, the \u201cLaw Firms\u201d) sued Zurich American Insurance Company, and its subsidiary, Fidelity &amp; Deposit Company of Maryland (collectively, \u201cF &amp; D\u201d) for tortious interference with their contractual relations, seeking compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. The gist of the alleged tortious interference is that F &amp; D interfered with the ability of the Law Firms to recover attorneys\u2019 fees due them for representing Douglas Asphalt Company and its principals, Joel Spivey and Kyle Spivey, in various lawsuits. F &amp; D denied liability and moved the district court for summary judgment. The court granted the motion, in an order entered August 10, 2011, concluding that the Law Firms presented nothing of evidentiary value to support their tortious interference claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-21\">The Law Firms now appeal the judgment the district court entered pursuant to its August 10 order. They ask us to vacate the judgment and remand the case for further consideration because material issues of fact exist that precluded the granting of summary judgment. For the reasons the district court explained in its August 10 order, there is absolutely nothing in the record \u2014 save the Law Firms\u2019 conclusory allegations \u2014 to support the Law Firms\u2019 claim. The district court\u2019s judgment is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b917-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
