The Liebmans raise three arguments on appeal: (1) the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over this case; (2) the district court erred by dismissing their complaint; and (3) the district court abused its discretion by denying their motion for recusal and reconsideration. After a thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-18\">In July 2010, the Liebmans filed a civil complaint against Deutsche Bank in state court as representatives of a putative class of similarly situated individuals, alleging mortgage fraud and various other state-law claims, as well as violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985; Article I, \u00a7 10 of the U.S. Constitution; ' and the Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments. The defendants removed the complaint to federal court citing both federal-question and diversity jurisdiction. Thereafter, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8(a), 9,12(b)(6), and 23(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-19\">The district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice, giving the Lieb-mans leave to file an amended complaint. Although the Liebmans filed a document styled as an \u201cAmended Complaint,\u201d the filing challenged the removal of the complaint to federal court, and was thus construed as a motion for remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-20\">Thereafter, the district court issued a final order of dismissal, finding that the Liebmans had not complied with the court\u2019s order. The Liebmans then filed a motion for recusal and reconsideration, asserting that the district court was biased and that their complaint should be remanded to state court. The district court summarily denied the motion. This is the Liebmans\u2019 appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether the district court had subject-matter jurisdiction following removal. <em>Castleberry v. Goldome Credit Corp., </em>408 F.3d 773, 780-81 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">District courts have federal-question jurisdiction over civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. <em>Hill v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., </em>364 F.3d 1308, 1314 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331). Whether a claim \u201carises under\u201d federal law is determined by the well-pleaded complaint rule, which provides for federal-question jurisdiction when a federal question is presented on the face of the plaintiffs\u2019 properly pleaded complaint. <em>Id. </em>A district court may also exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the federal case or controversy, or, more specifically, \u201carise out of a common nucleus of operative fact with a substantial federal claim.\u201d <em>Parker v. Scrap Metal Processors, Inc., </em>468 F.3d 733, 742-43 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. A claim premised on federal-question jurisdiction is removable without regard to the citizenship or residence of the parties. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Here, the Liebmans\u2019 complaint alleged violations of federal law by Deutsche Bank, and therefore, the complaint was properly removed to federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(b). The district court was also entitled to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over the Liebmans\u2019 state-law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b), \u201c[i]f the plaintiff fails to ... comply with [the Rules of Civil Procedure] or a court order, a defendant may move to dismiss the action or any claim against it.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b). We review a Rule 41(b) dismissal without prejudice for abuse of discretion. <em>Gratton v. Great Am. Commc\u2019ns, </em>178 F.3d 1373, 1374 (11th Cir.1999). Although \u201cdismissal is an extraordinary remedy, dismissal upon disregard of an order, especially where the litigant has been forewarned, generally is not an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Moon v. Newsome, </em>863 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">Rule 8 requires that a complaint contain \u201ca short and plain statement\u201d of the grounds for relief, and that each allegation be pleaded in a \u201csimple, concise, and direct\u201d manner. Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2), (d)(1). The complaint must give the defendants fair notice of the bases for relief and the grounds upon which the claim rests. <em>Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 93, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007). A pleading that uses just labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not meet Rule 8(a)(2). <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Rather, to survive a motion to dismiss, \u201ca complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>We have routinely condemned \u201cshotgun\u201d pleadings. <em>Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol., </em>516 F.3d 955, 979 &amp; n. 54 (11th Cir.2008). A \u201cshotgun pleading\u201d is a pleading that \u201cincorporate^] every antecedent allegation by reference into each subsequent claim for relief or affirmative defense.\u201d <em>Wagner v. First Horizon Pharm. Corp., </em>464 F.3d 1273, 1279 (11th Cir.2006). Shotgun pleadings make it \u201cvirtually impossible to know which allegations of fact are intended to support which claim(s) for relief.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Dist. Bd. of Trs. of Cent. Fla. Cmty. Coll, </em>77 F.3d 364, 366 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Even construing the Liebmans\u2019 complaint liberally, <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008), our review confirms that the Liebmans have filed what amounts to an improper shotgun pleading. The complaint named numerous individual defendants in addition to several business entities. The complaint alleged numerous violations of state and federal law, but did not provide any explanation of how the defendants\u2019 actions violated those laws. The Liebmans also failed to allege why the purported violations entitled them to their requested relief. Accordingly, the district court properly granted Deutsche Bank\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Moreover, the district court instructed the Liebmans to file an amended complaint, curing these deficiencies. The Liebmans failed to comply with the court\u2019s instruction. The court was therefore permitted to dismiss the complaint for failure to comply with its order. <em>Byrne v. Nezhat, </em>261 F.3d 1075, 1129-34 (11th Cir.2001) (discussing shotgun pleadings and approving of dismissal as a remedy when a party fails to cure the deficiency).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of motions for recusal and for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>175 F.3d 966, 968 (11th Cir.1999) (recusal motions); <em>Corwin v. Walt Disney Co., </em>475 F.3d 1239, 1254 (11th Cir.2007) (motions for reconsideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), a federal judge must disqualify himself if his \u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). Section 455(b) requires disqualification under specific circumstances, including situations where a judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, has participated as counsel in the matter, or has a financial interest in the matter. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(b)(1), (2), (4). The judge\u2019s bias or prejudice must be personal and extrajudicial, and must derive from something other than what the judge learned by participating in the case. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 828 (11th Cir.2007). The standard under \u00a7 455 is an objective one, requiring the district court to ask whether a disinterested observer, fully informed of the facts underlying the grounds on which recusal was sought, would entertain a significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality. <em>Bolin v. Story, </em>225 F.3d 1234, 1239 (11th Cir.2000). As a general rule, a judge\u2019s rulings in a case are not valid grounds for recusal. <em>Loranger v. Stierheim, </em>10 F.3d 776, 780 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Lieb-mans\u2019 motion for recusal because their arguments regarding the necessity of recusal rested solely on the district court\u2019s judicial rulings, which are not valid grounds for a recusal motion. <em>Loranger, </em>10 F.3d at 780. We see no other evidence in the record from which a reasonable observer could draw any doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality. <em>Story, </em>225 F.3d at 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the Liebmans\u2019 motion for recusal. Additionally, because recusal was the basis for the Liebmans\u2019 motion for reconsidera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>tion, and there were no grounds requiring recusal, the district court properly denied the Liebmans\u2019 motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-16\">. We disagree with Deutsche Bank that there is no final order and that we therefore lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>appellate jurisdiction. \"[Wjhere an order dismisses a complaint with leave to amend within a specified period, the order becomes final (and therefore appealable) when the time period allowed for amendment expires.\u201d <em>Garfield v. NDC Health Corp., </em>466 F.3d 1255, 1260 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). In this case, the time to file an amended complaint had expired when the court issued the final order of dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
