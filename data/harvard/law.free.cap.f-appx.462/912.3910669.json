No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-16\">U.S. Stove manufactures solid fuel stoves and furnaces. Insurer issued U.S. Stove a commercial general liability insurance policy (the \u201cPolicy\u201d) which provided insurance coverage to U.S. Stove for liability arising from defective products. U.S. Stove\u2019s Model 6300 stove had a design defect \u2014 soot emissions caused property damage to purchasers\u2019 homes \u2014 that resulted in 128 claims being filed against U.S. Stove. The claims began to be received by U.S. Stove around November 2008; the claims were separated in time, location, and the extent of damages. U.S. Stove then designed a \u201cfix\u201d that was applied to the Model 6300 to prevent soot emissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-17\">The parties agree that the Policy covers U.S. Stove\u2019s liability for claims arising from the Model 6300 defect. The parties also agree that no material facts are in dispute and filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The crux of the parties\u2019 disagreement \u2014 and the issue on appeal \u2014 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>what deductible applies to the 128 claims filed against U.S. Stove. U.S. Stove maintains \u2014 and the district court concluded \u2014 a single deductible applies to all sooting claims arising from the design defect. Insurer maintains that a separate deductible applies to each sooting claim arising from the defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">The Policy provided commercial general liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage caused by an occurrence. And the Policy defined an \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions, that results in \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage.\u2019 \u201d Endorsement No. 5 to the Policy, entitled \u201cDeductible Endorsement,\u201d sets out a deductible of $25,000. And, about that deductible, Insurer offered U.S. Stove a choice of a per claim or per occurrence deductible. Endorsement No. 5 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-5\">(A) PER CLAIM BASIS \u2014 If the deductible is on a \u201cper claim\u201d basis, the deductible amount applies to all damages and \u201cdefense costs\u201d because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d, \u201cproperty damage\u201d, \u201cpersonal injury\u201d and \u201cadvertising injury\u201d sustained by one person or organization as a result of any one \u201coccurrence\u201d or offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-6\">(B) PER OCCURRENCE BASIS \u2014 If the deductible is on a \u201cper occurrence\u201d basis, the deductible amount applies to all damages and \u201cdefense costs\u201d because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d, \u201cproperty damage\u201d, \u201cpersonal injury\u201d and \u201cadvertising injury\u201d as the result of any one \u201coccurrence\u201d or offense regardless of the number of persons or organizations who sustain damages and \u201cdefense costs\u201d because of that \u201coccurrence\u201d or offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">U.S. Stove opted for the \u201cper occurrence basis\u201d for computing the applicable deductible.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">The parties advanced competing interpretations of the term \u201coccurrence\u201d in the Policy; the district court concluded that the language of Endorsement No. 5 resolved any ambiguity that might otherwise exist. As the district court observed, Endorsement No. 5 draws a clear distinction between \u201cclaims\u201d and \u201coccurrences.\u201d Under the \u201cper claim\u201d deductible, each claim for damages sustained by one entity as a result of an \u201coccurrence\u201d is subject to a separate deductible. And under the \u201cper occurrence\u201d deductible, all damages sustained by all entities as a result of a particular event are subject to a single deductible. U.S. Stove opted for a \u201cper occurrence\u201d deductible; it rejected the \u201cper claim\u201d option.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">Citing <em>Kuhn\u2019s of Brownsville, Inc. v. Bituminous Cas. Co., </em>197 Tenn. 60, 270 S.W.2d 358 (1954), Insurer argues that Tennessee law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requires the court to look to the effect of an occurrence rather than its cause. Under the \u201ceffects\u201d test, adopted by a minority of states, the number of occurrences is determined from the vantage point of the injured party. The majority of states have adopted the \u201ccause\u201d test; under the cause test the number of occurrences is determined from the vantage point of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-11\">In <em>Kuhn\u2019s of Brownsville, </em>the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled that a single act by the insured \u2014 a building excavation \u2014 that resulted in two separate building collapses on opposite sides of the excavation site two days apart were two separate \u201caccidents\u201d under a liability policy\u2019s \u201cper accident\u201d limitation of liability. Insurer asserts that under <em>Kuhn\u2019s, </em>it is clear that Tennessee has adopted the \u201ceffects\u201d test to determine whether damages are the result of a single or multiple occurrences, and under the \u201ceffects\u201d test each instance of sooting damage resulting from the single design flaw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>represents a separate occurrence for purposes of determining the applicable deductible.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Applying general principles of contract interpretation and insurance law, the district court rejected Insurer\u2019s arguments. We agree. <em>Kuhn\u2019s </em>is distinguishable: it addressed a liability limitation \u2014 not a deductible provision \u2014 and it involved no policy provision that differentiated specifically between a \u201cclaim\u201d and an \u201coccurrence.\u201d Insurer concedes that, under the particular facts of the'present case, the position it advocates would render the distinction drawn in Endorsement No. 5 between \u201cclaims\u201d and \u201coccurrences\u201d meaningless: the same deductible would be owed under the \u201cper claim\u201d and \u201cper occurrence\u201d options in the Policy. But as the district court observed, to accept Insurer\u2019s position would eviscerate Endorsement No. 5; it would fail to give effect to the intention of the parties as reflected by the choice offered by Endorsement No. 5 and the \u201cper occurrence\u201d option selected by U.S. Stove.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">Insurer argues that it is only the peculiar facts of the present case that render Endorsement No. 5 meaningless; hypothetical scenarios are offered where the Endorsement would have meaning if we were to accept Insurer\u2019s construction of the Policy. But these hypotheticals are strained. The unambiguous purpose of Endorsement No. 5 was to draw a distinction between \u201cclaims\u201d and \u201coccurrences\u201d for purposes of determining the applicable deductible. Insurer elected to draft a policy that allowed the insured to select which deductible option would apply.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> U.S. Stove selected a per occurrence option. The plain and ordinary meaning of the Endorsement, as well as the intent of the parties, support a construction of the Policy that imposes a single deductible for all claims flowing from a single design defect occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-8\">. The parties agree that Tennessee law applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b941-19\">. It is the obligation of the court to determine and effectuate the intention of the parties. <em>See U.S. Bank, N.A. v. Tennessee Farmers Mut. Ins. Co., </em>277 S.W.3d 381, 386-87 (Tenn.2009) \"Insurance contracts, being subject to the same rules of construction as contracts generally, should be interpreted and enforced as written. Absent fraud or mistake, the terms of a contract should be given their plain and ordinary meaning, for the primary rule of contract interpretation is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the parties.'' (Internal citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b941-20\">. The \"per occurrence\" language in Insurer's policy earlier was construed in <em>Parker Hannifin Corp. v. Steadfast Insurance Co., </em>445 F.Supp.2d 827 (N.D.Ohio 2006). In that case, the district court concluded as a matter of law that the malfunction of plaintiff Parker's gaskets \u2014 which caused damages to unrelated claimants over a period of time\u2014 arose from a single occurrence. Insurer seeks to nullify the significance of <em>Parker Han-nifin </em>by arguing that Ohio \u2014 unlike Tennessee \u2014 uses the \"cause test.\" We do not rely on the <em>Parker Hannifin </em>decision in our resolution of the instant appeal; but it does reinforce our construction of the Policy. And, as the <em>Parker Hannifin </em>court noted, Insurer, as draftsmen of the Policy, could have avoided this result.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
