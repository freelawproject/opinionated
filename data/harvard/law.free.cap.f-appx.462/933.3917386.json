Alonso-Escobar sought a court order requiring the USCIS to grant him parole into the United States so he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>could apply to adjust his immigration status under the Cuban Adjustment Act. The district court granted Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Alonso-Escobar\u2019s complaint, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\">The Attorney General\u2019s decision to parole an alien into the United States is discretionary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 212(d)(5)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(5)(A). And \u2014 subject to limited exceptions not applicable to this appeal\u2014 courts lack jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions or actions of the Attorney General or the Secretary of DHS. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(ii), (D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), (D). Because Alonso-Escobar challenged Defendants\u2019 discretionary decision not to parole him into the United States, the district court properly dismissed his complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Alonso-Escobar has also failed to demonstrate that jurisdiction was proper under the Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (\u201cAPA\u201d), or the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 (\u201cDJA\u201d). Mandamus jurisdiction is appropriate only when, among other things, the defendant owes a clear nondiscretionary duty to the plaintiff. <em>Lifestar Ambulance Serv., Inc. v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1293, 1295 (11th Cir.2004). Because Defendants\u2019 decision not to parole Alonso-Escobar was discretionary, the district court lacked jurisdiction under section 1361. In addition, neither the APA nor the DJA serves as an independent source of district court jurisdiction. <em>See Choctaw Mfg. Co., Inc. v. United States, </em>761 F.2d 609, 615 (11th Cir.1985) (addressing section 10 of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702); <em>Borden v. Katz-man, </em>881 F.2d 1035, 1037 (11th Cir.1989) (addressing the DJA).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b960-9\">. Because Alonso-Escobar filed his notice of appeal before the district court denied his motion for reconsideration and failed to amend his notice of appeal to include the court\u2019s denial of that motion, our review is limited to the court's dismissal of Alonso-Escobar's complaint. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b961-7\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's grant of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Sinaltrainal v. Coca-Cola Co., </em>578 F.3d 1252, 1260 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b961-24\">. The Attorney General has delegated the discretion to grant parole to the Secretary of DHS or her designees, including USCIS employees. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.5(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
