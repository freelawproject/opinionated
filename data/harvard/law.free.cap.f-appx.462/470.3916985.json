Puga asserted that he should have received credit on his federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>sentence for the state sentence he had previously served for the same conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Puga argues that the district court committed procedural error by refusing to consider his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. He asserts that his requests for an extension of time to file his objections were timely under the mailbox rule and that he could not have filed his objections any earlier than he did because of a prison lock down. He contends that the refusal to consider his objections was a violation of his due process rights and that his objections were meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Any error in denying Puga\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition without first affording Puga the ability to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation was harmless. <em>See Braxton v. Estelle, </em>641 F.2d 392, 397 (5th Cir.1981); <em>McGill v. Goff, </em>17 F.3d 729, 731 (5th Cir.1994), <em>overruled on other grounds by Kansa Reinsurance Co. v. Congressional Mortgage Co., </em>20 F.3d 1362, 1373-74 (5th Cir.1994). The district court was able to <em>engage </em>in a meaningful review of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation absent Puga\u2019s objections because none of Puga\u2019s claims \u201carose from a factual dispute and the district judge could assess the merits of the petition from its face.\u201d <em>Braxton, </em>641 F.2d at 397 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also McGill, </em>17 F.3d at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Puga argues that the district court erred by not finding that the Government intentionally delayed bringing the charges against him and that the sentencing court erred by not granting him a departure from the guidelines sentence range for his having served a state sentence for the same conduct. He maintains that the delay in bringing the charges against him removed his case from the heartland of typical cases, thus justifying a departux-e.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Puga\u2019s challenge to the sentencing court\u2019s failure to grant him a departure because the Government delayed bringing the charges against him is a challenge to the judgment of conviction and sentence against him. As Puga is challenging only his sentence and not his conviction, his claims do not fall within the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e), and they are not cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 427 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Puga argues that he was entitled to a nunc pro tunc designation of state prison as the place for service of his federal sentence from the BOP that would have effectively made his federal sentence run concurrently with his expired state sentence for the same conduct. He asserts that the BOP violated his equal protection rights by not contacting the sentencing court for its input or granting his request for a nunc pro tunc designation as it did for a similarly situated inmate in <em>Cleveland v. Fox, </em>No. 1:08-cv-886, 2009 WL 1506969, at *l-*2 (E.D.Tex. May 28, 2009). For the first time on appeal, Puga argues that the BOP\u2019s actions were racially motivated because white and black inmates are given preferential treatment over Mexican inmates. In support of this claim, Puga cites viewpoints on immigration matters expressed on talk radio and the lack of any Spanish radio stations near Pollock, Louisiana, where he is incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">Puga\u2019s request for credit for his expired state sentence for the same conduct was raised at sentencing, and the sentencing court declined to give Puga credit for the time served on the state sentence. Instead of giving Puga credit for the expired sentence, the sentencing court explicitly ordered that Puga\u2019s federal sentence run consecutively to his unexpired state sentence for possession of a prohibited item in a correctional facility. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Thus, while the BOP normally contacts the sentencing court in making its determination whether to grant a nunc pro tunc designation, this was unnecessary because the record showed that the sentencing court intended for Puga not to receive credit for his expired state sentence. <em>See Hunter v. Tamez, </em>622 F.3d 427, 429 (5th Cir.2010). Puga\u2019s reliance on <em>Cleveland </em>is unavailing because, unlike in Puga\u2019s case, the sentencing court in that case did not express any intent for the sentences to run consecutively. <em>See Cleveland, </em>2009 WL 1506969, at *l-*2. Furthermore, Puga was not statutorily entitled to credit for his expired state sentence for the same conduct because that detention was credited against a different sentence and because there is no statutory entitlement to credit for a state sentence on a related charge. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b); <em>Newby v. Johnson, </em>81 F.3d 567, 569 (5th Cir.1996). Given the intent of the sentencing court and the lack of statutory entitlement to credit for the expired state sentence, the BOP acted well within its discretion when it denied Puga\u2019s request for a nunc pro tunc designation. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3585(b); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a)-(b); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(b); BOP Program Statement 5160.05; <em>Newby, </em>81 F.3d at 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b497-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
