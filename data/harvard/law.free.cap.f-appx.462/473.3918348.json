(\u201cMarkel International\u201d) and judgment dismissing his suit with prejudice. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-23\">In granting summary judgment to Markel International on the grounds that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Tureaud\u2019s suit was barred by prescription, the district court rejected Tureaud\u2019s arguments that the relation-back provision of Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure operated to make his subsequent state court lawsuit against Markel International timely and that defense counsel\u2019s alleged misconduct was responsible for Tureaud\u2019s pleading deficiencies. In his motion pursuant to Rules 59 and 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Tu-reaud made virtually identical arguments as those in his response to Markel International's summary judgment motion, arguments that the district court had already expressly rejected. Thus, the district court denied Tureaud\u2019s motion. <em>Tureaud v. Markel Ins. Co., </em>No. 10-1853, 2011 WL 2937220, at *1-2 (E.D.La. July 19, 2011). Tureaud appeals only that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">An abuse of discretion standard of review applies to a district court\u2019s denial of a motion under Rule 59. <em>See, e.g., ICEE Distribs., Inc. v. J &amp; J Snack Foods Corp., </em>445 F.3d 841, 847 (5th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). The same standard applies to a district court\u2019s denial of a motion under Rule 60. <em>See, e.g., Martin v. H.M.B. Constr. Co., </em>279 F.2d 495, 496 (5th Cir.1960) (citation omitted). We have carefully considered the pertinent portions of the record, the parties\u2019 briefs, and relevant opinions of the district court. For substantially the same reasons as those set forth in the district court\u2019s order denying Tureaud\u2019s motion, we find no abuse of discretion by the district court warranting reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b499-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
