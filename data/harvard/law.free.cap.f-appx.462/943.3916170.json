On appeal, Barrow argues that his sentence \u2014 the mandatory minimum for violations of \u00a7 2251(a) \u2014 is, as applied to him,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> cruel and unusual and thus prohibited under the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-15\">We review the legality of a sentence under the Eighth Amendment <em>de novo. United States v. Flores, </em>572 F.3d 1254, 1268 (11th Cir.2009). In evaluating an Eighth Amendment challenge in a non-capital case, we must first make the threshold determination that the sentence imposed is grossly disproportionate to the offense committed. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>451 F.3d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). The defendant bears the burden of making this showing. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf the sentence is grossly disproportionate, the court must then consider the sentences imposed on others convicted in the same jurisdiction and the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-16\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251, any person who \u201cemploys, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any minor to engage in, ... with the intent that such minor engage in, any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct or for the purpose of transmitting a live visual depiction of such conduct, ... if that visual depiction was produced or transmitted using materials that have been mailed, shipped, or transported in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer\u201d is subject to a minimum sentence of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment, with a maximum sentence of thirty years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a), (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-17\">In general, \u201ca sentence within the limits imposed by statute is neither excessive nor cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>451 F.3d at 1243. \u201cOutside the context of capital punishment, successful challenges to the proportionality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>of particular sentences have been exceedingly rare.\u201d <em>Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 272, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 1138, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980). This Court \u201chas never found a term of imprisonment to violate the Eighth Amendment, and outside the special category of juvenile offenders the Supreme Court has found only one to do so.\u201d <em>United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1343 (11th Cir.2010). As we noted, the one case wherein the Supreme Court held a sentence to violate the Eighth Amendment \u201cwas for a sentence of life imprisonment without parole imposed on a petty criminal who wrote a bad check for $100, the latest in a string of his relatively minor, nonviolent offenses.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm. We have recognized that sentences within the statutory limits generally do not violate the Eighth Amendment, and that a defendant whose sentence falls below the statutory maximum cannot make the threshold showing of gross disproportionality. <em>Johnson, </em>451 F.3d at 1243. Barrow was sentenced to the statutory <em>minimum </em>length. He cannot carry his burden of showing that his sentence was grossly disproportionate to the offense committed and, therefore, he cannot show that his sentence is cruel and unusual. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b970-12\">. Barrow suffers from spina bifida and is confined to a wheelchair.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b970-18\">. The minimum and maximum sentences can be increased if the defendant has certain previous convictions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
