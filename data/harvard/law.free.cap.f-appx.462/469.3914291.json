For the first time on appeal, De La Garza argues that the district court plainly erred in assessing him a three-level increase in his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). He argues that the presentence report\u2019s characterization of him as a manager or supervisor was entirely conclusional and devoid of fact. He further argues that his conduct was commensurate with the other conspirators, and that there is no indication that any of the conspirators were working for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-24\">Under the plain error standard, De La Garza must show \u201c(1) error (2) that is plain and (3) that affects his substantial rights.\u201d <em>See United States v. Castillo-Estevez, </em>597 F.3d 238, 240 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 457, 178 L.Ed.2d 287 (2010). \u201cTo be plain, legal error must be clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). This court will exercise its discretion to correct plain error if it seriously affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Under \u00a7 SBl.l(b), the defendant\u2019s offense level is increased by three levels if the \u201cdefendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive....\u201d \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) (2009). \u201cThe commentary to Section 3B 1.1(b) provides that even if a defendant was not a manager or supervisor, the enhancement may be warranted if the defendant \u2018exercised management responsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Rose, </em>449 F.3d 627, 633 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), cmt.n.2). \u201cA defendant\u2019s role in the criminal activity for the purpose of applying guideline section 3B1.1 may be deduced inferentially from available facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Ayala, </em>47 F.3d 688, 690 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The presentence report contained a lengthy description of the offense conduct which closely followed the factual basis admitted by De La Garza. The report recounted the observations of law enforcement agents as well as the information obtained from the conspirators following their arrest. Included was the fact that De La Garza admitted that he rented the residence for the prior year and that a co-conspirator told agents that he had retrieved marijuana from the residence on 15 prior occasions. Based on this information, the district court could infer that De La Garza exercised managerial responsibility over a stash house used by the conspiracy. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n.2; <em>see also United States v. Thomas, </em>932 F.2d 1085, 1092 (5th Cir.1991) (noting that appellant\u2019s procurement of apartments in which drug proceeds and undistributed drugs were stored supported the district court\u2019s finding of an enhanced role). Accordingly, De La Garza has failed to show that the district court plainly erred in assessing him a managerial role enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b495-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
