For the following reasons, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">The parties all agree that on June 17, 2009, Brazelton\u2019s hand was injured when it was caught in the hinges of his cell door. They differ, however, on the particulars on the incident. Defendant Corrections Officer Matthew Orner claims he was following standard procedures for the 4:00 P.M. \u201ccount\u201d on the day in question, flicking the dayroom lights to encourage inmates to return to their cells. <em>See </em>Orner Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, ECF No. 84-1. Upon beginning to close Brazelton\u2019s door, Orner heard him yell, and Brazelton told him that his hand was caught in the door\u2019s hinges. Orner Decl. \u00b6 10; Orner Interrogatories Resp. 1, ECF No. 30-15. To Orner, the wound (a blood blister) did not look serious, and Brazelton informed him that he \u201cdid not need medical attention\u201d and that it was his (Brazelton\u2019s) fault, Orner Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-12, 15; nevertheless, Orner called medical services and sent Brazelton to the infirmary after the 4:00 P.M. count was over. Orner Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14; Orner Interrogatories Resp. 5. Medical staff observed mild swelling, and the hand was splinted; follow-up treatment revealed no lasting injuries. <em>See </em>Sullivan Decl. \u00b6 4-11, ECF No. 84-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">But as recounted by Brazelton, Orner, who arrived late to the shift, was \u201crushing\u201d to lock inmates in their assigned cells. <em>See, e.g., </em>Compl. \u00a7 D(3), ECF No. 1; Bra-zelton Dep. Tr. 39:3-9, ECF No. 84-2. In his haste, Orner made several errors, such as closing cell doors before checking to see whether inmates were present. Brazelton Dep. Tr. 41:4-9,12-15. The eventual injury, far from being minor, \u201cgashed\u201d Brazel-ton\u2019s hand open; afterwards, Orner stood at Brazelton\u2019s cell door, apologizing and promising to secure medical treatment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brazelton Dep. Tr. 48:22-49:4. Brazelton was finally seen by medical around 7:00 P.M., and suffered injuries that were significant in scope. <em>See, e.g., </em>Brazelton Dep. Tr. 53:16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">Shortly after the incident, Brazelton commenced pursuit of his administrative remedies, citing (inter alia) Orner\u2019s \u201creckless disregard for [his] safety\u201d and requesting treatment and compensation. Brazelton\u2019s final administrative appeal was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>denied on March 11, 2010. Brazelton separately filed an Administrative Tort Claim that was denied on January 29, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Having exhausted the administrative process, Brazelton filed a civil-rights suit pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), naming as defendants Orner and Warden Ronnie Holt. Brazelton claimed that \u201cOrner, acting under the authority of ... Holt, ... did inflict harm, cruel and unusual punishment ... by slamming cell-door # 220[ ] on [Brazel-ton\u2019s] fingers,\u201d causing lasting injury. Compl. \u00a7 D(3). The District Court read the complaint as also raising a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b), and proceeded accordingly. <em>See </em>Order n. 2, ECF No. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">We need not recount in detail much of what followed; suffice to say, the case quickly metamorphosed into a dispute over discovery in general and missing video recordings of the day in question in particular. Brazelton sought sanctions, arguing that the defendants were \u201cstonewalling\u201d him, committing fraud upon the court, purposefully destroying evidence, and exhibiting \u201c100% disregard for the courtf\u2019s] time, costs, and ... limited resources.\u201d <em>See generally </em>Motion, ECF No. 29. Eventually, the defendants moved to dismiss and for summary judgment. The presiding Magistrate Judge recommended granting<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the motion and denying Brazelton\u2019s request for sanctions, and the District Court (in large part) concurred. <em>See Brazelton v. Holt, </em>No. 4:10-CV-1223, 2011 WL 4553121, at *1, *2 n. 3 (M.D.Pa. Sept.29, 2011). This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and conduct plenary review of summary judgment and dismissal decisions, including those implicating sovereign immunity. <em>See United States v. Virgin Islands, </em>363 F.3d 276, 284 (3d Cir.2004); <em>Air Courier Conference/Int\u2019l Comm. v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>959 F.2d 1213, 1217 (3d Cir.1992). With regard to dismissal, we must accept all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in Brazelton\u2019s favor. <em>Capogrosso v. Sup.Ct. of N.J., </em>588 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir.2009) (per curiam). Leave to amend a defective complaint should generally be granted to pro se plaintiffs when amendment would \u201cneither be inequitable nor futile.\u201d <em>Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir.2002). With regard to summary judgment, we employ the same standard used by the District Court, and will affirm its decision if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law, again viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Brazelton.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., </em>206 F.3d 271, 278 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">We may dispense quickly with the starker defects in this appeal. First, the District Court correctly dismissed the claims against the defendants in their official capacities as being barred by sovereign immunity. \u201c[T]he federal government is generally immune from suit, except where Congress has expressly articulated an exception to the immu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>nity.\u201d <em>Scheafnocker v. Comm\u2019r, </em>642 F.3d 428, 434 (3d Cir.2011).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A <em>Bivens </em>suit \u201cagainst a defendant in his or her official capacity would merely be another way of pleading an action against the United States, which would be barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.\u201d <em>Consejo de Desarrollo Economico de Mexicali, </em>A.C. <em>v. United States, </em>482 F.3d 1157, 1173 (9th Cir.2007). Second, it is clear from the record that Brazelton\u2019s claims against defendant Holt arose from the warden\u2019s conduct in the evidence-gathering phase and in the administrative-remedy process. <em>See, e.g., Ml., </em>ECF No. 30-6. Since \u201crespondeat superior is not a viable theory of <em>Bivens </em>liability,\u201d <em>Rivera v. Riley, </em>209 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir.2000), Brazelton did not state a claim against Holt by merely suggesting that he was Orner\u2019s supervisor or that he participated in the subsequent investigation. We agree, further, that amendment would be futile with regard to these deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Turning, then, to the meat of the suit, we agree with the District Court that summary judgment was warranted. \u201cTo be cruel and unusual punishment [under the Eighth Amendment], conduct that does not purport to be punishment at all must involve more than ordinary lack of due care for the prisoner\u2019s interests or safety[;] ... [i]t is obduracy and wantonness, not inadvertence or error in good faith, that characterize the conduct prohibited by the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.\u201d <em>Whitley v. Albers, </em>475 U.S. 312, 319, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986); <em>see also Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (\u201c[A] prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.\u201d). \u201c[A]n accident or inadvertence or mere negligence does not [in itself] trigger the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Grabowski v. Jackson Cnty. Pub. Defenders Office, </em>47 F.3d 1386, 1395 n. 12 (5th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 105-06, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976)). Simply put, nowhere does Brazelton show that Orner was aware of and disregarded an excessive or substantial risk of harm to inmates due to his alleged haste. In Or-ner\u2019s retelling, Brazelton\u2019s injury was an unfortunate accident; in Brazelton\u2019s, it was an accident compounded by negligence and carelessness. But in neither scenario was Orner\u2019s conduct reflective of the heightened standard required to sustain an Eighth Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">In light of the above, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in declining to sanction the defendants. <em>See Simmerman v. Corino, </em>27 F.3d 58, 61 (3d Cir.1994). Even if videotaped evidence existed that could have supported Brazelton\u2019s version of the events, it would not suffice to elevate his claims above an Eighth Amendment threshold. <em>See Schmid v. Milwaukee Elec. Tool Corp., </em>13 F.3d 76, 79 (3d Cir.1994) (holding that a \u201ckey consideration[ ]\u201d in evaluating sanctions connected with the discovery process is whether a party was prejudiced by the missing evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">While we sympathize with Brazelton\u2019s situation, the Eighth Amendment simply does not provide relief for the conduct about which he complains. For the fore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>going reasons, and as we find that this appeal presents no substantial issue, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court. <em>Murray v. Bledsoe, </em>650 F.3d 246, 248 (3d Cir.2011) (per curiam); <em>see also </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-10\">. Brazelton included numerous inmate affidavits to corroborate his version of the encounter. <em>See </em>ECF No. 30-6. He also maintained that his injuries were far greater than reported in the provided medical records, and accused the Bureau of Prisons of engineering a cover-up by refusing to properly document the damage to his hand. <em>See, e.g., </em>Abraham Statement, ECF No. 30-6; Mot. for Summary Judgment 5, ECF No. 29 (\"Two of my fingers, my hand and wrist were damaged. My fingers, wrist and hand were bleeding.\u201d); Pl.\u2019s Resp. 2, ECF No. 92 (charging the Bureau of Prisons with refusing \"to take photos of my hand on the day of injury. My fingers were smashed flat. I was bleeding from three sites.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b171-7\">. The Magistrate Judge observed that Brazel-ton had explicitly abandoned any Federal Tort Claims Act claim. <em>See </em>PL's Reply Br. 8, ECF No. 88. He therefore recommended \"dismissing\u201d the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion on that ground. <em>Brazelton v. Holt, </em>No. 4:10-1223, 2011 WL 4565776, at *12 (M.D.Pa. Aug.4, 2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b171-11\">. We do not address the propriety of the District Court\u2019s decision to deem the defendants' recitation of facts \"admitted\u201d due to Brazelton\u2019s noncompliance with its local rules. As we discuss below, the outcome is the same under either factual reading; as such, we will give Brazelton\u2019s retelling due weight for the purposes of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b172-6\">. Of course, the Federal Tort Claims Act includes precisely such a (limited) waiver. <em>See White-Squire v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>592 F.3d 453, 456 (3d Cir.2010). On this front, Brazel-ton\u2019s complaint was defective, as he did not name the United States as a defendant. <em>See Galvin v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Admin., </em>860 F.2d 181, 183 (5th Cir.1988). As we agree that the tort claims were abandoned, this defect is of no moment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
