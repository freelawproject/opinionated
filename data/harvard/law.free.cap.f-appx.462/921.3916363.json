Aiken\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 599, which clarified when a weapons enhancement may be applied to an underlying offense if the defendant was also convicted of a \u00a7 924(c) offense. After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Aiken\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">On appeal, Aiken contends the district court erred in finding that he was sentenced as a career offender and thus ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). As to the district court\u2019s alternate ruling that he was not entitled to a sentence reduction, Aiken argues the district court abused its discretion because (1) the court had already incorporated into Aiken\u2019s original sentence all of the concerns it articulated regarding the seriousness of the offense and Aiken\u2019s criminal history, and (2) the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and Aiken\u2019s \u201cpost-sentencing conduct\u201d warranted a sentence reduction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the record sufficiently supports the district court\u2019s alternative basis for denying Aiken\u2019s motion, we need not determine whether Aiken was sentenced as a career offender. <em>See United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1348-50 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that where the district court states it would have imposed the same sentence, even absent the alleged, error, we need only determine whether the district court\u2019s alternative reasoning was reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">If a district court finds it has the authority to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the court is specifically required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as well as \u201cthe nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that may be posed by a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment,\u201d in determining what, if any, reduction is warranted. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1 (B)(i)-(ii). Although not required to do so, the court also \u201cmay consider post-sentencing conduct of the defendant that occurred after imposition of the term of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at cmt. n. 1 (B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Aiken was not originally sentenced as a career offender \u2014 and is thus eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 the record supports the district court\u2019s alternative determination that Aiken was not entitled to a sentence reduction. The record demonstrates that the pertinent re-sentencing factors \u2014 especially Aiken\u2019s demonstrated \u201chistory of extreme violence\u201d under \u00a7 3553(a) \u2014 were reasonably taken into account. <em>See United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 762 (11th Cir.1998)(noting that the district court is not required to \u201carticulate specifically the applicability, if any, of each factor, as long as the record as a whole demonstrates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>that the pertinent factors were taken into account\u201d). In addition, even though the court was not required to consider Aiken\u2019s post-sentencing conduct, the court heard argument with regard to this factor, but ultimately decided there was no basis \u201cto warrant any reduction whatsoever in [its] discretion.\u201d Aiken has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-6\">. We \"review <em>de novo </em>a district court's conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). If \u00a7 3582(c)(2) applies, a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction is reviewed only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 984 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b948-7\">. Aiken further argues he does not qualify as a career offender, and the district court's denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because Amendment 599 recognized that his sentence had resulted in unwarranted \"duplicative punishment.\u201d Because these claims involve \"extraneous re-sentencing issues,\u201d we do not address them on appeal. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not \"grant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
