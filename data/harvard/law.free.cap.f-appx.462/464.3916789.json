He contends: the evidence at trial was insufficient to support his conviction; and, he was entitled to a minor-role sentencing adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-18\">Because Tapia did not move at trial for judgment of acquittal, relief may be granted only for a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>E.g., United States v. Avants, </em>367 F.3d 433, 449 (5th Cir.2004). This standard is met only if \u201cthe record [is] devoid of evidence of guilt or the evidence [is] so tenuous that a conviction is shocking\u201d. <em>Id. </em>Testimony at trial showed: Agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency arranged to buy, through a confidential informant (Cl), a large quantity of methamphetamine from Sebastian de la Garza and Rogelio Estrada; Tapia was the supplier of the methamphetamine involved in that transaction; he arrived with Estrada to complete the deal; at the time of the deal, Tapia carried a gun that he displayed to the Cl and described as protection; and, he provided security and countersurveil-lance for the transaction. Tapia has failed to show either that the record was \u201cdevoid of evidence\u201d that he both knew about and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>participated in the drug transaction or that such evidence was \u201cso tenuous\u201d that a conviction would be shocking.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\">Tapia also contends the court clearly erred in calculating his advisory Guidelines-sentencing range by failing to decrease his offense level, pui\u2019suant to his contention that he was only a minor participant in the offense. <em>See United States v. McElwee, </em>646 F.Sd 328, 346 (5th Cir.2011) (review of minor-role adjustment is for clear error); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. For the adjustment to apply, Tapia must show he was \u201cperipheral to the advancement of the illicit activity\u201d. <em>Id. </em>As reflected above, the evidence at trial showed that Tapia both supplied the methamphetamine involved and provided security for the transaction. Accordingly, the evidence does not support Tapia\u2019s contention that the court clearly erred in finding his role was not \u201cperipheral\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b491-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
