The district court denied the application, and this court dismissed Baca\u2019s appeal from that decision on jurisdictional grounds because his pro se notice of appeal was untimely. <em>See Baca v. Texas, </em>No. 11-50216 (5th Cir. Oct. 5, 2011). Baca\u2019s instant appeal is from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for late filing of a notice of appeal and the denial of his motion for reconsideration of that decision. He also moves for the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-18\">In his pro se appellate brief, Baca reiterates claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel that were raised in his \u00a7 2254 application and contends for the first time that he received ineffective assistance from his counsel in his \u00a7 2254 proceedings in the district court; his right of access to the courts has been denied; and he has been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. Given the earlier dismissal of his appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2254 application, Baca\u2019s arguments concerning his \u00a7 2254 claims are not considered here. Additionally, we will not consider the claims he attempts to raise for the first time in this appeal. See <em>Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-19\">Baca\u2019s opening brief lacks any argument challenging the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for late filing of a notice of appeal. He has thus waived the issue. See <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993) (recognizing that we generally will not consider arguments presented for the first time in a reply brief). In any event, Baca has not shown that he met the requirements of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(5)(A)(i) or (a)(6)(A) and thus has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motions. <em>See Resendiz v. Dretke, </em>452 F.3d 356, 358-62 (5th Cir.2006). Baca\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b511-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
