Facts agreed. A salesman of one ' of the plaintiffs subscribed his employer\u2019s name to the petition and made oath to it as his agent, at his request communicated by telegraph. A part of the defendant\u2019s indebtedness to the plaintiffs consists of a promissory note made by a firm now dissolved, of which the defendant was a member, and the other member of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>which is solvent; and of a promissory note which did not become due and payable until September, 1895. If either note is deducted from the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, the defendant\u2019s indebtedness is less than $300.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b582-5\"><em>F.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMZ\">The creditor\u2019s execution of the petition by the salesman, his authorized agent, was sufficient. <em>Flint </em>v. <em>Clinton Co., </em>12 N. H. 430, 436. The fact that another is equally liable with the defendant upon one of the demands of the plaintiffs does not make the debt any the less an indebtedness of the defendant. Upon the debtor\u2019s assignment he may be declared insolvent although none of his debts is due and payable. It is sufficient if it \u201c shall appear to the satisfaction of the judge that \u201d he \u201c is not able to pay his debts in full.\u201d Debts not due are provable against his estate. P. S., c. 201, <em>ss. </em>6, 7, 13. A petition of creditors in involuntary proceedings must show that the debtor is \u201c owing\u201d them $300 or more, and that \u201chis property within the state, not exempt from attachment, is in their belief insufficient to pay his debts.\u201d If these allegations \u201c are found to be true, the judge shall adjudge the debtor insolvent.\u201d P. S., <em>c. </em>201, <em>s. </em>42. By the word \u201c debts,\u201d the legislature intended all debts, as well those that are not as those that are presently payable. If this were otherwise doubtful, it is made certain by the provision that debts not due may be proved. In ordinary and popular speech, if not in a strict technical and legal sense, one is properly said to be indebted to another, or to be \u201c owing \u201d him a debt, though it is payable at a future day. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>6 Pet. 33, 36, 37. In this sense \u201c owed \u201d is used in the statute providing that the commissioner to allow claims against the estate of a person deceased \u201c shall examine and allow all just demands which the deceased owed, . . . although such demands may not then be payable.\u201d P. S., c. 192, <em>s. </em>8. Any other construction would in some cases defeat the purpose of the statute. A creditor whose demand is due and sufficiently large could, by attachment and levy, appropriate to .its satisfaction the entire property of the debtor in spite of all the other creditors, if their debts did not fall due within three months from the time of the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b582-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
