The defendants admit their liability, either to the plaintiff or to the claimants, as the court may determine. /</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-14\">Prior to October 24, 1893, the plaintiff was engaged in the business of bottling lager beer at Groveton, and selling the same, together with some intoxicating liquors, at wholesale, in New Hampshire and Vermont. On that day he sold the plant and stock of goods to the claimants, and executed a bill of sale thereof; and in payment therefor he took a promissory note of the claimants for $2,000, which has been paid, and four promissory notes of the claimants for $818.92 each, secured by a chattel mortgage of the property, all of the same date. The balance due on the notes amounts to more than the whole sum due from the defendants on the policies in suit. Insurance was effected on the property by the claimants for the benefit of the mortgagee as his interest might appear. The property was afterward mainly consumed by fire, and the loss adjusted by the respective companies. The consideration of the note for $2,000 included all the intoxicating liquors sold the claimants, and the mortgage notes were not taken in payment for any intoxicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>liquors so sold. A part of the consideration of the mortgage notes consisted of machinery and articles adapted to and used in the business of bottling lager beer, and the plaintiff knew when he made the sale and took the mortgage that the claimants intended to engage in that business.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-5\"><em>Drew, Jordan Buckley, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-6\"><em>Ladd Fletcher </em>and <em>Orawford D.

The sale was not rendered illegal by the plaintiff's knowledge that the claimants would use the property sold for the advancement of their illegal business. <em>Delavina </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>65 N.
