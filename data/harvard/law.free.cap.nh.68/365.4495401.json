Facts found by a referee. The plaintiff is the widow of John Dunn, who was admitted to membership in the defendant association, December 28, 1882. In his application for admission he agreed \u201c to abide by the laws, rules, and regulations of the association now in force or that may be hereafter made.\u201d The certificate of membership provided that he \u201c is a member\u201d of the association and he \u201cis entitled to all the privileges and benefits thereof so long as he complies with the bylaws as now made, and such as may hereafter be made, and no longer.\u201d The by-laws provided that, \u201c to retain m\u00e9mbership in this association, the member must retain membership in good standing in his lodge,\u201d and that \u201cshould a member be suspended or expelled from his lodge, his membership immediately ceases in this association; nor is the association bound to his widow . . . for any pecuniary benefit.\u201d At the time of his admission Dunn was a member of a lodge in Gorham. February 16, 1884, he was suspended from membership in that lodge. lie then resided in Connecticut. After his suspension he paid to the association all the assessments that were made until his death, November 20, 1886. These assessments amounted to $28, which the association received in ignorance of the fact that Dunn had been suspended from his lodge. Upon learning that fact, they sent to the plaintiff a draft for $28, which was returned. The insurance feature of the association is entirely distinct from the business of the lodges. The insurance was made payable to the plaintiff, who is entitled to recover $1,000 and interest, if the action can be maintained.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number><em>Daley Goss </em>and <em>Ladd f Fletcher, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b396-5\"><em>William L.

It does not appear that it was the duty of the association to.keep informed of the suspension of members from their respective lodges, or that their ignorance of Dunn\u2019s suspension was due to any fault on their part. Hence their receipt of the assessments from him, who had full knowledge of the fact of his suspension, does not estop them to insist upon the terms of the contract. There is no ground on which the action can be maintained. When the association deposits $28 with the clerk of court for Dunn\u2019s administrator, there will be</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b396-13\">All concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-11\"> See foot-note on page 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
