Plea, the general issue with a brief statement that the defendant arrested and detained the plaintiff under legal process. Verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel in opening the case to the jury-stated that he claimed and proposed to show that the defendant in making the arrest used unnecessary and excessive violence. Evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s character and reputation as a dangerous person to the knowledge of the defendant was admitted, and evidence tending to show that the defendant was a violent man and on a former occasion had used unnecessary force and violence in arresting another person was excluded, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-13\">The defendant testified without objection that he was a constable, and put in evidence the writ upon which the arrest was made, with his return of the arrest thereon signed by him as constable.
