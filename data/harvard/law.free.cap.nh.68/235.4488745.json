Facts found by the court. March 13, 1894, an action was pending between the same parties, including-the trustee, who was then discharged. He then had in his hands $12.60 wages due the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-11\">March 15, 1894, the plaintiff brought suit against the defendant upon a new cause of action, and the writ was served upon the trustee March 16. The trustee disclosed $29.10 due the defendant for wages, including the $12.60. Neither suit was for necessaries. The court charged the trustee for $9.10, and. the defendant filed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-12\"><em>Joseph S.

There-was then nothing to prevent the wages which had been attached in his hands from being paid over to the defendant. A third party could then have attached them and had them applied on his claim. In the absence of fraud, there is no reason why the plaintiff cannot hold the defendant\u2019s wages attached in a second suit on another cause of action after the discharge of the trustee in the first action, in the same manner that a third party could. The trustee was properly charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b265-16\">Carpenter, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
