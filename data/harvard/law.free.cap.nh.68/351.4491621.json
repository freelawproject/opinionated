The defendant admitted that on that day he kept for sale \u201c Mascot beer,\u201d and the defence was that such beer is not malt liquor. Trial by jury. Verdict for the state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-13\">Subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, witnesses testified'that on October 22, 1894, six bottles of beer were obtained by W. of the defendant, who told W. they had been in his possession since September 10, and that he thought they would show more alcohol than when fresh; that the bottles were kept over night without special guard in the police station, to which several officers had access, and the next day were taken to a chemist, who analyzed the contents of five and found they were malt liquor. The jury were instructed to acquit the defendant unless they found that the beer analyzed was apart of the \u201c Mascot beer \u201d kept for sale on September 10,1894, by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-14\">Subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, a witness testified that on September 10, 1894, he saw United States revenue stamps on the beer-kegs in the defendant\u2019s warehouse, and that bottles found there were labeled \u201c Mascot beer.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-15\"><em>Charles H.

Whether the beer analyzed by the chemist and found to be malt liquor was a part of the \u201c Mascot beer \u201d kept for sale by the defendant on September 10, 1894, was purely a question of fact, and was properly submitted to the jury under instructions sufficiently favorable to the defendant. The evidence that United States revenue stamps were seen on beer-kegs in the defendant\u2019s warehouse on September 10, 1894, was competent as tending to show that the kegs contained malt liquor; and the keeping for sale of any malt liquor could properly be proved under the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\n<em>Fxceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b382-6\">Carpenter, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
