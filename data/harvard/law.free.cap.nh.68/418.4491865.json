While this agreement was in force, the plaintiff attended the parents, made his charges to the mother, and was told by her to present his bill to the defendant, who would pay. After the services were rendered, the defendant told the plaintiff that if he would send his bill to her, she would .pay him. This he did, but the bill was not paid.

It is immaterial that the plaintiff did not learn of the defendant\u2019s liability until after the services were rendered. She had assumed the liability in consideration of the conveyance to her, and the debt was her own as it accrued. If the services were necessary and the charges reasonable, the defendant was bound to pay; and her promise to pay if the plaintiff would send his bill was a waiver of any objection to the character of the claim. It was a promise to pay her own debt, and not within the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"ASb\">\"Wallace, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
