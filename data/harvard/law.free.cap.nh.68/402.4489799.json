Pacts agreed. Before October 1, 1895, the bank paid to the state treasurer a tax computed at three fourths of one per cent upon the amount of its deposits after deducting the value of its real estate and the value of its\u00a1 <em>mortgage </em>loans upon land in this state, as authorized by statute. The assessors of Somersworth assessed a tax in 1895 upon shares of bank stock owned by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs duly applied to the assessors for an abatement of this tax, which was refused.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-13\"><em>William F.

The plaintiffs fully complied with this requirement, and ask to be relieved from a further tax upon bank stock which they purchased with a portion of the deposits. The stock in fact represents the deposits which vvere used in its purchase; and to sustain both forms of taxation would be to sanction an unauthorized system of double taxation. <em>Nashua Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Nashua, </em>46 N. H. 389; <em>Rockingham Ten Cent Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Portsmouth, </em>52 N. H. 17; <em>National Banks </em>v. <em>Concord, post. </em>The claim that the statute limiting the rate of taxation of deposits in savings banks is unconstitutional is not sustained. <em>\u201c </em>The savings-bank tax is an anomaly, resting on peculiar grounds of public policy, and is universally understood to have acquired the .position of an exception to the constitutional rule of equality.\u201d <em>B., C. &amp; M. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number><em>Railroad </em>v. <em>State, </em>62 N.
