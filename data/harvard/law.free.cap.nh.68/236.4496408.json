Adams by his first wife, or to his widow. Although by an ordinary life insurance policy made payable to a person named, the rights of the beneficiary are vested when the policy is issued, and cannot afterwards be changed or avoided by the assured <em>(City Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Whittle, </em>63 N. H. 587), yet in the case of a certificate in a benefit society, when the holder has full powers of direction subject to the laws governing the association, and is authorized to designate another beneficiary than the one originally named, as in this case, there is no such fixed and vested interest. All that a beneficiary has during the lifetime of the member to whom the certificate was issued is a contingent interest,\u2014 a mere expectancy which gives no vested rights in the expected benefit, as it is wholly dependent on the will of the holder. <em>Barton </em>v. <em>Association, </em>63 N. H. 535; <em>Knights </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>64 N. H. 517. In the ease of benefit-societies where the right is reserved to the member to control and dispose of the benefit at all times, and the certificate contains no provision giving a right to the beneficiary\u2019s representatives to have the benefit, and the beneficiary dies in the lifetime of the member, the contract will be construed as payable to the beneficiary on condition of his surviving the member and the designation will be treated as revoked or as having lapsed upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>the death of the beneficiary, and, the object of the trust having failed, there is a resulting trust in the holder of the certificate. Bac. Ben. Soc., <em>ss. </em>243-294; <em>Haskins </em>v. <em>Kendall, </em>158 Mass. 224. In this case it was plainly the intention of the parties not to give to the representatives of Martha A. Adams any right in this fund. It was made payable to her by name without any words referring to her representatives. Furthermore, the contract was made <em>\u201c </em>in accordance with and under the provisions of the laws governing said fund.\u201d At the time the certificate was issued, a law of the association provided that \u201c in the event of the death of all the beneficiaries selected by the member before the decease of such member, if no other or further disposition thereof be made,. . . the benefit shall be paid to the dependent-heirs of the deceased member,\u201d not to the heirs or representatives of the beneficiary. This indicates that it was contemplated by the parties that upon the death of the beneficiary no right should inure to her representatives, but that the fund should go to the representatives of the member to whom the certificate was issued. There having been no vested interest in this fund In the beneficiary, the children have no rights therein as her representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Neither have they any rights to it as his representatives. According to a law of the association in force when the certificate was issued, the children would take an interest in the fund as the heirs of their father. But at the regular session of the association, holden in August, 1891, after the death of the beneficiary and in the lifetime of Joseph Gf. Adams, the association unanimously voted to repeal its existing laws, including the one that the benefit should be paid to the dependent heirs of a deceased member, and also voted to adopt new laws, among which was the following : \u201c In the event of the death of all the beneficiaries selected by the member, . . . the benefit shall be paid to the widow. If none, then to the heirs of the deceased member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The constitution provided that all proposed amendments to the laws must be \u201c referred to the committee on laws who shall report thereon as early as practicable, or at the next day\u2019s session \u201d; and, in another place, that the committee \u201c shall examine and report upon all proposed amendments to the constitution and laws of the Supreme Council presented at the Supreme Council.\u201d It is objected that this change of laws was not legally made because the committee on laws did not examine and report thereon as provided by the constitution. It appears that a committee appointed at the last previous session to revise and codify the constitution and laws of the order reported at this session as follows: \u201cWe have given attention to the duty imposed upon us, and have devoted much time and attention to the labor required, and have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>joined and assisted in our work by your committee on laws. We have drafted an entire revision of the laws of the order. We have prepared our report in print, and submit it herewith.\u201d It further appears that \u201c This report was referred to the committee on laws who immediately made the following report to the meeting: \u2018Your committee on laws to whom was referred \u2019 the above, \u2018 report that we have had said report under consideration, and herewith return the same to the Supreme Council, and suggest that the same be considered by the Supreme Council.\u2019 \u201d It thus appears that the committee on laws examined and reported on these changes as required by the constitution, and that this change in the laws of the association was in other respects duly made in accordance with the provisions of the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Joseph Gr. Adams agreed in his application \u201cto conform in all respects to the laws, rules, and usages of the order now in force, or which may hereafter be adopted by the same.\u201d And the certificate was issued to him, \u201c upon condition that the said companion complies in the future with the laws, rules, and regulations now governing the said council and fund, or that may hereafter be enacted by the Supreme Council to govern said council and fund.\u201d It was therefore expressly stipulated that the contract should be governed by after-enacted laws, and that the fund audits destination should be bound by and be subject to them, with reasonable limitations not applicable to this case. Parties may contract with reference to laws to -be enacted in the future, and may agree to be bound by them. They may agree, as in this case, that such laws may enter into and form a part of their contracts. It must be incident to the nature and purposes of an association of this character that it should have the power to change its laws as experience and necessity require, and bind its members thereby. This power does not give these associations the right to repudiate their contracts, or lessen their responsibilities, or defeat vested rights. There was no vested right outside the member, Adams, and he had expressly contracted that he would be subject to the laws and rules then governing the council and fund, or that might thereafter be enacted by the Supreme Council to govern the council and fund. He knew, or was bound to know, of this change, and with this power to direct who should receive the benefit, this law deprived him of no right, because if he had not desired that his second wife should have this fund in accordance with the new law of the association, he could at any moment have directed otherwise. Such subsequent enactments are binding when the contract is made in contemplation of them and when they do not conflict with the law, or the charter, or the articles of association, and are reasonable. Bac. Ben. Soc., <em>ss. </em>82, 85, 185, 188, <em>256; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>Fugure </em>v. Society, 46 Vt. 362; <em>Supreme Commandery </em>v. Ainsworth, 71 Ala. 436. This law is reasonable, is in conformity with law, is not shown to be in conflict with the charter or articles of association, and is consistent with the general purposes of the society. . The contract being controlled by the law as changed, the benefit must be paid to the widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\n<em>Decree for Alice G.
