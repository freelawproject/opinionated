Pacts found by a referee. The plaintiff was a blacksmith, and a partner with one Bartlett in the business of making and repairing carriages. The tools were those of the plaintiff\u2019s occupation, and were used by the firm. The defendant is the assignee in insolvency of the firm; and as assignee he took possession of all the partnership property, including the tools in controversy, and sold the same at public auction. The plaintiff claimed that the tools were exempt from the assignment in insolvency to the value of $100, while the defendant contended that they were the property of the partnership, and not exempted to the individual members thereof.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-9\"><em>Eastman, Young 8p O\u2019Neill, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-10\"><em>Louis G.

P. S., c. 201, <em>s. 6; c. </em>220, <em>s. </em>2. The tools were the property of the firm. The plaintiff claimed 'them as an individual, not as a partner; and his claim cannot be maintained, because the title to the property was in the partner'ship of which he was a member, and not in him as. an individual. If the plaintiff, owning the tools when he became a member of the firm, had retained the exclusive ownership of them, and |had merely allowed them to be used in the partnership business, he might have received the benefit of the statutory exemption. <em>Pond </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>101 Mass. 105. Whether the partnership was entitled to the exemption, is a question that is neither raised nor considered. <em>In re Handlin, </em>3 Dill. 290; <em>Guptil </em>v. <em>McFee, </em>9 Kan. 30; <em>Bonsall </em>v. <em>Comly, </em>44 Pa.
