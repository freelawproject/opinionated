Verdict for the plaintiff. Subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, evidence was received tending to show the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-13\">In 1890, the plaintiff recovered judgment in an action of trespass against Asa Beckman for building a house upon the premises. Owen, claiming to own the premises and that Beckman was his tenant, defended the action. The question of title was the only one tried. The judgment has not been satisfied. Owen and Beckman retaining possession notwithstanding the judgment, the plaintiff filed a bill in equity against them, praying for an injunction to restrain them from committing further trespasses, and to compel them to leave the premises. The bill was taken <em>fro confesso, </em>and a decree made enjoining the defendants to leave the' land forthwith and desist from committing further trespasses upon it, and ordering that a writ of possession be issued against them. Copies of the decree were given to them and a writ of possession issued, by virtue of which an attempt was made to put the plaintiff in possession, but without success. In a subsequent proceeding against Owen, Beckman, and another, for violating the injunction, it was found that they were guilty of contempt. As a result of all these proceedi\u00f1gs, the plaintiff got possession of the premises in 1891. See 66 N. H. 424.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-14\">It was ruled, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the expenses necessarily incurred and actually paid by him in the equity suit and the proceeding for violating the injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-15\">The defendant offered to show that in 1742 the title to the premises was in the Province of New Hampshire, and that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>has ever since been in the province and the state. The evidence was excluded, subject'to the defendant\u2019s exception.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b301-5\"><em>Samuel H. Goodall </em>and <em>John S. H.

PI. *192, *196; 2 Chit. Pl. *870; <em>Aslin </em>v. <em>Parkin, </em>2 Burr. 665; <em>Nowell </em>v. <em>Roake, </em>7 B. &amp; C. 404; <em>Symonds </em>v. <em>Page, </em>1 C. &amp; J. 29; <em>Baron </em>v. <em>Abeel, </em>3 Johns. 481. In <em>Nowell </em>v. <em>Roake, </em>a judgment recovered by the defendant in ejectment was reversed upon a writ of error, and it was held that the costs in the writ of error, taxed as between attorney and client, were recoverable as a part of the damages in the action for mesne profits. Lord <em>Tenterden, </em>C. J., said: \u201c The expenses incurred in the court of error were part of the damages sustained by the plaintiff by reason of his having been wrongfully kept out of possession by the act of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The right to recover the expenses of the former action depends upon the necessity for the action and not upon its particular form. It is immaterial that the plaintiff\u2019s preliminary proceedings were in equity instead of law. The necessary consequence of the defendant\u2019s acts was to compel the plaintiff- to resort to an equitable or legal action in order to obtain his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">It is suggested that there may be cases in which the costs of the previous proceedings may have been, in part at least, unnecessarily incurred and due to the plaintiff\u2019s folly, and in which such a balancing and adjustment of the consequences of wrong are required as can be done only in equity, and hence that the remedy is by bill in equity instead of an action at law. Under the practice in this state, time spent in the consideration of the form of remedy is wasted. <em>Peaslee </em>v. <em>Dudley, </em>63 N. H. 220; <em>Gage </em>v. <em>Gage, </em>66 N. H. 282, 296. The plaintiff may, at any time, file a bill in equity as an amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">The evidence that Owen defended the plaintiff\u2019s action against Beckman was competent. Whatever Beckman did by the procurement of Owen or under his authority was Owen\u2019s act as well as Beckman\u2019s. For such acts they were jointly and severally liable. The plaintiff was at liberty to sue either of them separately. The unsatisfied judgment against Beckman is no bar to the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover in this action. <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>10 N. H. 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>The testimony offered by the defendant, that the title to-the land was in the state and not in the plaintiff, was properly excluded. The defendant made no claim to a right of possession under the state. The plaintiff\u2019s possession was sufficient to enable him to maintain the action against one showing no better right, even if the state had the title. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>March, </em>2 N.
