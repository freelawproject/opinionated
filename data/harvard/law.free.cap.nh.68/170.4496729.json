To show the existence of the alleged highway, the plaintiff introduced in evidence, subject to the defendants\u2019 exception, the record, of the laying out referred to in <em>Grand Trunk Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Berlin, ante, p. </em>168. That case is made a part of this. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that while he was traveling upon this highway with a horse and carriage, the horse took fright at a car left by the defendants upon their branch railroad within the limits of the highway, in consequence of which he was thrown out of the carriage and injured. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>was a verdict for the plaintiff which the defendants moved to set aside.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-5\"><em>TwitcheU Libby, </em>for the plaintiff</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-6\"><em>Almon A.
