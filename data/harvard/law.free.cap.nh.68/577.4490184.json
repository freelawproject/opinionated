Facts found by the court. The policy insured the plaintiff \u201c against loss o\u00ed time . . . resulting from bodily injuries caused solely ... by exter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>nal, violent, and accidental means, which shall, independently of all other causes, immediately and wholly disable him from transacting any and every kind of business pertaining to the occupation under which he is insured,\u201d and provided that it should not cover <em>\u201c </em>any injury, fatal or otherwise, of which there is no visible mark upon the body.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s shoulder was accidentally injured by a fall, causing pain and depriving him of the use of the arm. He was disabled thereby from attending to his business,\u2014 that of a shoe dealer,\u2014 although he went to his store two or three times a week. The only visible mark of the injury was a discoloration of the arm and shoulder. The court found a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b608-5\"><em>Andrews Sp Andrews, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b608-6\"><em>Burnham, Brown \u00a3 Warren, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b608-7\">Pike, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWg\">As long as one is in full possession of his mental faculties, he is capable of transacting some parts of his business, whatever it may be, although he is incapable of physical action. If the words \u201c wholly disable him from transacting any and \u00abvery kind of business pertaining to the occupation under which lie is insured,\u201d were to be construed literally, the defendants would be liable in no case unless, by the accident, the insured should lose his life or his reason. <em>Hooper </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>5 H. &amp; N. 546. It is certain th\u00e1t neither party intended such a result. It cannot be said, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff\u2019s disability was not sufficient to entitle him to compensation under the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">The \u201c visible mark upon the body\u201d required by the policy need not be a bruise, contusion, laceration, or broken limb ; but may be any visible evidence of an internal strain which may appear within a reasonable time after the injury is received. <em>Pennington </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>85 Ia. 468; <em>Mutual Accident Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>181 U.
