Richardson, mentioned in the will and codicil, died in Chicago, July 24, 1891, leaving property of the estimated value of from forty to fifty thousand \u25a0dollars. She left a husband, Lloyd D. Richardson, surviving her, but no lineal descendants. There was a dispute as to her domicile. The husband claimed it was in Illinois, and that under the laws of that state he would inherit all her estate, to-the exclusion of the father. The father claimed it was in Arkansas, and that under the laws of that state he would inherit all her estate, to the exclusion of the husband. The codicil was made by the testator before the estate of his daughter, Josephine W. Richardson, was settled. March 20, 1893, subsequent to the making of the \u2022codicil and before the testator\u2019s death, the testator made a settlement with Lloyd D. Richardson, the husband of Josephine W., by which he received the sum of twenty thousand dollars, in four promissory notes signed by one Reynolds and indorsed by Richardson, for his claim as heir to his daughter\u2019s estate, and assigned his claim to Richardson. Notice of the assignment was given by Isaac Stratton to the administrator of Josephine W. Richardson\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-7\">The probate court ordered and decreed that the twenty thousand dollars and interest, received as before stated under the agreement with Richardson, be distributed among and paid to the legatees named in the codicil to the will, namely, Lucy E. \u25a0Stratton, Menzies E. Stratton, Edwin W. I. Stratton, and Bessie Kendall Stratton. The appellants claim that this money should be distributed according to the terms of the will and not according to the codicil, and appeal from the decree of the judge of probate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b614-8\"><em>Silas Hardy </em>and <em>Eleazer L.

Hayes, 48 N. H. 219, 229) is within the jurisdiction of that court, or whether, in other words, the decision in <em>Hayes </em>v. Hayes, 48 N. H. 219, would embrace the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Subsequent to the making of his will, in which lie disposed of all his property, the testator found that by the death of his daughter he might receive a considerable accession to his estate; and immediately before it was determined what, if anything, he should so receive, he executed a codicil to his will, in which, after making certain changes, rendered necessary or advisable by the death of his daughter, he provides that \u201c Whereas my daughter, Josephine W. Richardson, left considerable property, and if I decease before her estate is settled, and in the end the law gives me her property, I will and bequeath the same,\u201d etc. At the time of the making of the codicil it was uncertain what, if anything, the testator would receive from the daughter\u2019s estate. The testator, as her father, and L. D. Richardson, her husband, entertaining opposing views of the forum by whose law the estate should legally be administered, each claimed the whole. Subsequently the testator made a settlement with L. 11. Richardson, the husband of the deceased daughter, by which the testator received the sum of twenty thousand dollars for his claim as his daughter\u2019s heir and assigned such claim to the husband. The only question raised between the parties is whether the proceeds of this settlement should be distributed according to the provisions of the will, or those of the codicil. The determination of this question,like other questions arising upon the construction of a will, turns upon the testator\u2019s intention as expressed in the will and codicil, which together are his will. The construction of the will is the ascertainment of the testator\u2019s expressed intention,\u2014 what he meant by what he said, \u2014 which is to be determined by the court as a question of fact and not by the application of arbitrary rules of law. <em>Edgerly </em>v. Barker, 66 N. H. 434, 447; <em>Doten </em>v. Doten, 66 N. H. 331, 339; <em>Rice </em>v. Society, 56 N. H. 191, 197, 198, 203; <em>Brown </em>v. Bartlett, 58 N.

Everything contained within the instrument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>itself is competent evidence upon the question of intention. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Chaffee, </em>14 N. H. 215; <em>Sheafe </em>v. <em>Cushing, </em>17 N. H. 508 <em>Healey </em>v. <em>Toppan, </em>45 N. H. 243, <em>264; Perkins </em>v. <em>Motives, </em>49 N. H. 107, 110. The situation of the testator, the surrounding circumstances, his family and relatives, the devisees and legatees, the nature, amount, and situation of his property, facts tending to-place the court in the position of the testator, constitute evidence competent for our consideration upon the issue of what he meant by the words used. <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>4 N. H. 21, 23; Tiltons. <em>Tilton, </em>32 N. H. 257, 263; <em>Goodhue </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>37 N. H. 525; <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Mathes, </em>49 N. H. <em>107; Rice </em>v. <em>Society, </em>56 N. H. <em>191, 197, Kennard </em>v. <em>Kennard, </em>63 N. H. 303, 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Giving due weight to the competent evidence disclosed by the instrument itself and the surrounding circumstances which appear in the case, it is clear the testator intended by the codicil to provide for the just disposition among the claimants to his bounty of the previously unexpected accession to his estate which at the time of the making of the codicil he expected might result from the death of his daughter. The only substantial difference between the codicil and the provisions of the will for the distribution of the residuum of the estate, is that by the codicil the expected accession from his daughter\u2019s estate is divided into four parts, one of which is given to his granddaughter, Bessie K. Stratton, while the residuum by the will is given to the three who receive the remaining shares under the codicil. By the will only a nominal legacy is given the granddaughter, for the reason therein stated that the testator had already given her father the share of his property to which she was entitled and which would become hers upon the testator\u2019s death. Having carefully divided the estate which was then his by the will, by the codicil the unexpected accession which could not have been anticipated in any previous gift to his granddaughter\u2019s father is equitably apportioned by giving her a share therein. The intent of the testator by the codicil being clear to dispose of such estate as should come from his daughter, no rule of law or reasonable construction of the language used prevents us from giving effect to that intent. The language, \u201c If I decease before her estate is settled and in the end the law gives me her property,\u201d does not import a condition Avhich requires us to hold that the testator did not intend to dispose of this estate only in the event that his claim should not be adjusted until after his decease, or as a result of a judicial determination. The receipt and assignment given his son-in-law by him and the notice served upon the executors are sufficient evidence that the parties understood they were making an adjustment of their conflicting claims by which each, in effect, would receive substantially one half the estate; and the fact that the father assigned his whole claim to the husband and ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>cepted his notes in payment does not make the real transaction different from what it would have been had they provided that the daughter\u2019s administrator should pay one half the estate to each, nor does it transform what the parties understood as a settlement of their controversy into a gift by the son-in-law to the father. The intention of the testator that the codicil should operate only on the fund which might be derived from his claim to his daughter\u2019s estate, renders the legacies therein given specific <em>(Wallace </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>23 N. H. 149, 154; <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>23 N. H. 212; <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>41 N. H. 391), and the codicil can operate only upon such fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Considering the proceeding, as requested by the parties, as a bill for the construction of the will, our conclusion is that such of the estate of the testator as was derived from the settlement with L. 13. Richardson, which is now in the hands of the executors, should be distributed as provided by the codicil.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b617-7\">Wallace, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
