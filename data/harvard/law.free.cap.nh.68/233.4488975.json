To the defendants\u2019 plea in bar \u2014 alleging that August 9, 1884, the plaintiff\u2019s wife Mary was seized in fee simple of the land described in the petition and of other land, that on that day she and her husband entered into a contract for a division of property, that pursuant to the terms of \u00abaid contract Mary deeded to the plaintiff one half of the property then standing in her name, that by said contract they mutually agreed with each other in writing that neither one would claim any right, title, or interest in the other\u2019s property, that Mary died in October, 1892, and that the defendants are devisees of the lands not conveyed by her to her husband \u2014 the plaintiff \u25a0demurred.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-9\"><em>Burnham, Brown Warren, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-10\"><em>David A.

Assuming all the allegations to be true, the plaintiff may nevertheless be entitled to judgment for partition. His agreement not to claim any right, title, or interest in Mary\u2019s property is not in terms an agreement not to claim his statutory rights in the property after her decease. P.

P. S., <em>\u2022c. </em>176, <em>s. </em>1. The question whether by any form of contract he could convey or release to his wife, or estop himself from claiming, his statutory rights in her estate after her decease is not considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">\n<em>Demurrer sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b263-14\">.All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
