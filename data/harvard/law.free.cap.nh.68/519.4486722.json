H. 108), ceased to be binding on the parties at the expiration of the time prescribed in the act of 1855, and there was no longer any obligation upon either party to pay or to receive the five cent rate established by the award; but so long as that rate continued to be paid and received without legal objection, the parties would of course be bound by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Such objection having been duly made by the plaintiffs on July 3, 1891, by service of notice on the defendants, the then existing implied contract between the parties as to the rate of compensation was terminated, and the amount which the plaintiff's should thereafter pay the defendants became a matter for legal adjudication under <em>s. </em>12, c. 157, P. S., enacting that if connecting railroad corporations cannot agree upon the terms and conditions of making the interchange of their business, or in regard to the'accommodations to be furnished at their junction point, \u201c the supreme court, upon petition of either party, after notice to the other, shall hear the parties and shall determine all questions arising between them in regard to such interchange and accommodations, having reference to the convenience and interests of the corporations and of the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Subsequently, and in accordance with the notice of July 3, the plaintiff's filed their petition at a trial term of the court for this county, asking for the appointment of a board of referees \u201c who shall hear the parties, and adjust and finally determine all unsettled claims or accounts relative to the use of said Eastern Railroad Company\u2019s tracks, and adjust and determine the rates and terms for such use hereafter, according to the provisions of our statutes \u201d ; and at the following term, after hearing had, the petition was sent to referees agreed upon by the parties, who filed their report September 24, 3894, the material part thereof being as follows : \u201cWe determine that the Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad, as the operator of the Concord &amp; Portsmouth Railroad, shall pay to the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, lessee of the Eastern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Railroad in New Hampshire, for the use of the tracks of said Eastern Railroad between the terminus of said Concord &amp; Portsmouth Railroad in Portsmouth and the side track leading toRindge\u2019s wharf, two and three fourths cents ($0.02f-) per ton for all freight hauled over said Eastern tracks by said Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Upon this finding it is contended by the plaintiffs that, in view of the fact that no contract can be inferred to have existed for the payment of the five cent compensation since their notice of July 3, 1891, the rate of compensation since that date must be regarded as a disputed and unsettled claim and one of the matters referred to the commission making the finding and within their authority, and hence when judgment shall issue upon the report, the rate of compensation established by it should take effect from and after July 8, <em>1891; </em>while the defendants contend that if any judgment can issue upon the report as it now stands, it can only be a judgment for the future,\u2014 not only because the finding says nothing about the compensation to be paid during the time intervening between the notice and the award, but because it does say in express terms that the plaintiffs \u201c shall pay . . '. two and three fourths cents per ton,\u201d etc., the plain meaning of which is that they shall pay it from and after the time of the making of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In view of these contentions, as well as in view of our conclusion that the judgment of 1866 had ceased to be operative at the time of the filing of the plaintiffs\u2019 notice, so that the proper rate of compensation since that time would be one of the matters coming\" within the authority of the referees, we think sufficient uncertainty exists relative to the true construction of the report as to require its recommitment for a specific finding by the-referees whether the two and three fourths cent rate is to take-effect from July 3, 1891, or from 'the date of the filing of their report, September 24, 1894.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\n<em>Recommitted accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b552-8\">Chase, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
