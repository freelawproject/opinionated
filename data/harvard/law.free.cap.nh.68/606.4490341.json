V. Hopkins and bearing the following indorsements: <em>\u201c </em>M. V. Hopkins, J. M. Hopkins. Waiving demand and notice. M. V. Hopkins, J. M. Hopkins.\u201d The plaintiffs are administrators of the estate of Jacob Benton, indorsee of the note. At a hearing before a referee, the defendants moved that J. M. Hopkins be discharged, on the ground that successive indorsers cannot be joined as defendants, offered his evidence in regard to the note, and excepted to a denial of the motion and the exclusion of the evidence. The plaintiffs did not elect to testify.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b636-13\"><em>Brew, Jordan Buckley, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b636-14\"><em>Ladd $ Fletcher, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b636-15\">Clark, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac6\">The question in this case is one of procedure for the trial term.
