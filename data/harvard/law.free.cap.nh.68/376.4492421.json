Facts agreed. Simon Towle and David Towle, now deceased, were brothers, and previous to 1840 they owned the real estate in controversy in common. Simon died in that year, intestate, leaving four children, one of whom, an infant, died soon after, and Mary E. Miller, another child, died intestate in 1877, leaving two children, who are the plaintiffs. G-eorgianna Margerum was another child who died intestate in 1878, leaving no issue. Simon P. Towle, the other child, died in 1890 without issue. The plaintiffs claim to own one half \u2022of their grandfather\u2019s half of the land, or one fourth of the whole, and also the half owned by David Towle, under the residuary clause in his will. He died in May, 1867. The -clause \u25a0of the will referred to is as follows: \u201cAlso I give my nephew, Simon P. Towle, all my real estate and personal property that \u2022can be found, to have and to hold as his own. Then to his heirs if any, if not, to his nearest akin by the name of Towle, or his nearest akin on the father\u2019s side.\u201d The defendant Lamprey \u2022claims title to three fourths of the whole estate -under the will -of Simon P. Towle.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-8\"><em>Galvin Page, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-9\"><em>Prink $ Marvin, Thomas E. 0.

Towle left no \u201c heirs \u201d within the meaning of that word as used in the will of David. The expression, \u201c his heirs,\u201d was not intended as a description of the \u25a0estate devised to Simon P. If the testator had intended to de'vise to him a fee-simple title, oran estate that should vest in him, his heirs and assigns forever, no reason is apparent for the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>sion that in case of the death of Simon P. without heirs, the estate should pass \u201c to his nearest akin by the name of Towle, or his nearest akin on the father\u2019s side.\u201d It is not to be presumed that no meaning was intended to be conveyed by these words. <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>Sanborn, </em>62 N. H. 631. All the competent evidence shows that the testator\u2019s general purpose was to so dispose of the land that it should remaiu in the Towle family; and to accomplish that purpose, he in effect provided that upon the death of his nephew without lineal descendants, it should become the property of the nearest of kin to the nephew by the name of Towle or \u201c on the father\u2019s side.\u201d A construction that would allow Simon P. to dispose of the land by will would contravene the plain intention expressed by David in his will. Upon the reported facts, the plaintiffs are the owners of one fourth of the entire estate by inheritance, and under the will of David they became the owners of an additional half of it. The will of Simon P., therefore, could operate only on the remaining one fourth which he inherited from his uncle, his sister Georgianna, and the infant.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiffs.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b407-6\">Wallace, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-11\"> In this case and others for the same term in which the opinion is <em>Per Curiam, </em>the \u25a0opinions prepared by Chief J ustice Doe were after his death adopted by his surviving associates, and the judgments therein were announced by them at the adjourned law term held March 13, 1896.
