Facts found by a referee. The plaintiff\u2019s ox and three of his other cattle strayed from his pasture to the defendant\u2019s adjoining field through the defendant\u2019s insufficient fence. Afterwards, the defendant in attempting to drive the cattle home left the ox in the highway, where-it wandered upon a railroad track, and was killed by a locomotive under circumstances disclosed in the opinion. The plaintiff moves for leave to amend his declaration by filing a count in trespass.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b149-13\"><em>Smith Sloane, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b149-14\"><em>William F.

When the defendant found them under those circumstances, it was his duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>to drive them back into the plaintiff\u2019s pasture. Instead, he drove the cattle into his barnyard and kept them for about six hours, and then attempted without assistance to drive them to the plaintiff\u2019s house; and in following some of the cattle which escaped into a wood, he abandoned the ox in the highway where for some distance it ran parallel with a railroad with no intervening barrier, and the ox strayed upon the railroad track and was killed. None of these acts were necessary to the performance of the defendant\u2019s duty of returning the ox to the plaintiff\u2019s pasture. The defendant, in all he did after he drove the cattle out of his own enclosure, was a wrongdoer. The death of the ox is legally attributable to. the wrongful acts of the defendant. <em>Carruthers </em>v. <em>Hollis, </em>8 Ad. &amp; El, 113; <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>66 N. H. 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">It having been determined that the defendant is liable in some form of action, it is not a question of any particular importance whether he is liable in case or trespass. If upon examination it were found that case could not be maintained, the plaintiff would be allowed to amend by filing a count in trespass. <em>Peaslee </em>v. <em>Dudley, </em>63 N.
