On one of the warmest days in the summer qf 1891, he transported a hogshead of molasses from the 'freight station to the plaintiff\u2019s store on Elm street, a distance of a little over half a mile. By reason of the fermentation of the molasses, the hogshead burst while being unloaded. The plaintiff\u2019s loss was not caused by any want of ordinary care on the part of the defendant.

The finding, that he was engaged in the business of trucking goods for hire from the railway freight station to different stores in the city, lacks the distinguishing characteristic of a common carrier, namely, the holding of oneself out as ready 44 to carry at reasonable rates such commodities as are in his line of business, for all persons who offer them, as early as his means will allow.\u201d <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>7 N. H. 157, 163; <em>Elkins </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>23 N. H. 275; <em>Moses </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>24 N. H. 71, 80, 88, 89; <em>McDuffee v. Railroad, </em>52 N. H. 430, 448; <em>State </em>v. <em>Express Co., </em>60 N. H. 219, 261; 2 Kent 597, 598; Sto. Bailm., <em>ss. </em>495, 508; <em>Brind </em>v. <em>Dale, </em>8 C. &amp; P. 207; <em>Liver Alkali Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>L. R. 9 Exch. 338, 343; <em>Scaife </em>v. <em>Farrant, </em>L. R. 10 Exch. 358, 365; <em>Nugent vd Smith, </em>1 C. P. Div. 423; <em>Fish v. Chapman, </em>2 Kelly (Ga.) 349; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Sackrider, </em>37 N. Y. 341; <em>Lough v. Outerbridge, </em>143 N. Y. 271, 278. The inference from this finding is as strong, to say the least, that the defendant\u2019s business was limited to trucking for particular customers, at prices fixed in each case by special contract, as it is that he held himself out as ready to truck for the public indiscriminately at reasonable prices. If such was the character of his business, he was not an insurer of the plaintiff\u2019s goods,\u2014 there being no special contract of insurance, \u2014 \u25a0 and was only bound to exercise ordinary care in respect to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">If the defendant was a common carrier, he is not liable for the plaintiff\u2019s loss, since it happened from the operation of natural laws, which a common carrier does not insure against. <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Baxendale, 2 </em>H. <em>&amp; </em>N. 575; <em>Great Western Railway Co. v. Blower, </em>20 W. R. 776; <em>Nugent </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 C. P. Div. 423; <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>1 Black 156; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>12 Allen 531, 533; <em>Swetland </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>102 Mass. 276, 282; <em>Dow </em>v. <em>Packet Co., </em>84 Me. 490; <em>Coupland </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>61 Conn. 531; <em>Rixford </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>52 N. H. 355. In <em>Farrar </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>1 Bull. N. P. 69, it is said that44 if an action were brought against a carrier for negligently driving his cart so that a pipe of wine was burst and was lost, it would be good evidence for the defendant that the wine was upon the ferment, and when the pipe burst he was driving gently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">It being found that the plaintiff\u2019s loss was not due to any want of ordinary care on the part of the defendant, there must be</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b369-10\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
