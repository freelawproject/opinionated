Verdict for the plaintiff. The plaintiff was run over by one of the defendants\u2019 cars, and in consequence of the accident it became necessary to amputate some of the toes on his left foot. The amputated parts, preserved in spirits in a glass jar, were exhibited to the jury, and the defendants excepted. The plaintiff also exhibited his naked foot to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b326-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s left leg had been from his birth a little shorter than the other. His attending physician was allowed to testify, subject to exception, that the damage resulting from the removal of the toes from the left foot would be greater than it would be if the leg had been a perfect one, on account of increased inconvenience and irritation experienced in walking.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-11\"><em>Alb\u00edn Martin </em>and <em>Frank N.

The case does not show that the evidence was incompetent. If the offer to exhibit the toes was not made for the purpose of proving some disputed fact material to the issue, the exhibition should not have been allowed. <em>Louisville &amp; N. R.

The fact that that was one of the points in issue did not render the evidence incompetent. <em>Gault </em>v. <em>Concord Railroad, </em>63 N. H. 356.
