Before February 27, 1891, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>greater part of the timber had been cut. On that day the defendant executed a deed of the land to Abbie II. Lindsey and Harriet L. Smith, who knew the timber was sold to the plaintiffs and that a portion of it had not been cut. The deed was not delivered to them until April 7, 1891. In March, 1891, the plaintiffs obtained from Mr. Lindsey (Abbie\u2019s husband) permission to cut the remaining timber during the next winter (1891-92). But for this permission they would have cut it all before April 1, 1891. The plaintiffs began cutting the next winter, but were stopped by the defendant\u2019s grantees, who denied Lindsey\u2019s authority to extend the time, brought trespass against them for what they had cut, and recovered a judgment for damages.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-5\"><em>Jevoett \u00bf- Plummer, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-6\"><em>Jewell, Stone, Owen Martin, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b229-7\">Carpenter, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIE\">There was no failure of consideration. The plaintiffs received all they bargained and paid for <em>[Paris </em>v. <em>Bryan, </em>6 B. &amp; C. 651), viz., the right to cut all the pine and oak timber on the farm that they chose to cut before April 1, 1891. It is immaterial that by the contract no property in the standing timber passed to the plaintiffs <em>(Kingsley </em>v. <em>Holbrook, </em>45 N. H. 313, 320), and that the agreement operated only as a license revocable at the defendant\u2019s pleasure. <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>49 N. H. 204; <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>61 N. H. 583, 586. It was not revoked. It afforded the plaintiffs full protection for all they did under it. It was not the defendant\u2019s but their own fault that they did not take the remaining timber within the time limited. He did nothing to prevent them. His deed to Lindsey and Smith had no effect until its delivery, April 7. He is not responsible for the result of the plaintiffs\u2019 negotiation with the husband of one of the grantees for an extension of the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b229-9\">Smith, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
