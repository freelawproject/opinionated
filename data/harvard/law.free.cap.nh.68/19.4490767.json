Pacts found by the court. The plaintiff gave the defendant a set of diamond ear-drops upon a certain condition which the defendant did not perform. Subsequently, and upon the plaintiff\u2019s demand, the defendant returned to her the gold settings of the drops with comparatively valueless stones substituted for the diamonds.
