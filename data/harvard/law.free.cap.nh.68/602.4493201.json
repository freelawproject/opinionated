Without passing upon the plaintiff\u2019s motion, the court ordered a nonsuit, which is to be set aside if the plaintiff\u2019s motion should have been granted. It is apparent that the nonsuit was ordered upon the ground that the relation of master and servant, as alleged in the declaration, did not exist between the parties. But the ruling of the court did not amount to a finding that there was no evidence of the defendants\u2019 liability on some other ground. It is inferred from the reported facts that there was evidence of their liability under the rule announced in <em>King </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>66 N. Y. 181, which both parties regard as the correct rule, and the plaintiff\u2019s motion should have been-granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-16\">\n<em>Nonsuit set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b632-17\">Blodgett, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b632-20\"> See foot-note on page 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
