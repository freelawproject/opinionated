Kelley, who died July 21, 1898, at East Kingston, while on a visit. She was last an inhabitant of Manchester, where she had real and personal estate. TJpon the petition of the plaintiff, one of her heirs, filed September 21, 1898, the judge of probate of Rockingham county appointed one Stearns administrator on the eleventh day of October. September 26, 1893, Hurd, another heir, petitioned the judge of probate of Hillsborough county for the appointment of an administrator. After a hearing upon this petition the defendant was appointed. The plaintiff alleged as a reason of appeal, that at the time of the filing of the petition in this proceeding a similar petition was pending in the probate court of Rockingham county.

The fact, that when the petition for the appointment of an administrator was filed in the probate court of Hills-borough county, a similar petition was pending in the probate court of Rockingham county, is immaterial. Priority in the filing of the petition did not determine the question of jurisdiction. As the decedent was last an inhabitant of Hillsborough county, the probate court of that county was authorized to appoint an administrator of her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\"><em>Exception </em>overruled.</p>\n<judges id=\"b245-14\">Chase, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-15\"> See loot-note on page 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
