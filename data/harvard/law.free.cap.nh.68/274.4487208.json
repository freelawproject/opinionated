The statute, in its design to prevent preference and to compel an equal distribution of the debtor\u2019s assets among his creditors, forbids his satisfying or securing a previously existing debt within three months of the beginning of the insolvency proceedings. This transaction was a pledge by Hollins of the bank stock and bond to secure his indebtedness to the Leominster National Bank. If held valid, it will diminish the property available to the creditors of his insolvent estate. The pledge being made less than three months before the beginning of the insolvency proceedings, to secure a previously existing debt, is void by the express terms of the statute. <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>Lovering, </em>64 N.
