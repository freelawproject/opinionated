Facts found by the court. The defendant subscribed for ten shares of the capital stock of the association, at the par value of fifty dollars per share, amounting to $500, which sum he agreed to pay in quarterly payments at specified times. The subscriptions were solicited by one Towner. When the defendant subscribed for his stock, Towner talked about buying the \u201c Nashua Telegraph,\u201d said they had arranged to buy it, and were going to have the Associated Press news. The defendant was induced by this statement to make his subscription. The corporation when afterward organized did not buy the \u201cNashua Telegraph \u201d or get the Associated Press reports. Sometime after the defendant had subscribed for his stock, Towner informed him that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Governor Goodell said he would not have anything to do with the paper if the defendant\u2019s name remained on the list. The defendant told Towner to take his name off the list, and supposed he had done so until notified to the contrary. The corporation was subsequently duly organized. The publication of the paper commenced and afterward suspended for lack of funds. Something over $25,000 was paid in, which was all expended with about $14,750 in addition. The corporation after using all the money and assets still owes over $4,000.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b596-5\"><em>Charles W. </em>Hoitt, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b596-6\"><em>George JB. </em>French, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b596-7\">Wallace, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A04\">The main ground of defence presented is that the defendant was induced to subscribe for the stock by the false and fraudulent representations of Towner, who solicited the subscription, that they had arranged to buy the \u201c Nashua Telegraph \u201d and were going to have the Associated Press news. There is neither a finding of fraud nor any evidence of fraud in the case. No facts were found inconsistent with the utmost good faith on the part of Towner. It does not appear that at the time of the defendant\u2019s subscription they had not in fact arranged to buy the \u201cNashua Telegraph\u201d or that they were not going to have \u2014 that is, proposed to have \u2014 the Associated Press news. There is no evidence tendin'g to show that Towner did not believe what he said to be true and was not acting in perfect good faith. The last expression, that they were going to have the Associated Press news, was a mere statement as to the happening of a future event, and both statements may be fairly considered the expression of a mere opinion, or of an existing intention to do a certain act which was liable to be changed at any time by the act of the majority of the stockholders. <em>Piscataqua Ferry Co. </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>89 N. H. <em>491; Kelsey </em>v. <em>Oil Co., </em>45 N. Y. 505; <em>McAllister </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>15 Ind. 11; 1 Mor. Corp., s. 98; 1 Cook Stock &amp; Stockh., <em>s. </em>138. If the representations had been that they had already purchased the \u201c Nashua Telegraph \u201d and had then secured the Associated Press reports, a question would arise which the case does not now present. If these statements of Towner are regarded as a parol agreement made previous to or contemporaneous with the execution of the contract of subscription, they are inadmissible in evidence and will not be allowed to vary or control the written contract, and are inoperative and void. <em>White Mts. Railroad </em>v. <em>Eastman, </em>34 N. H. 124; <em>Piscataqua Ferry Co. </em>v. <em>Jones, supra; </em>1 Cook Stock &amp; Stockh., <em>ss. </em>136, 137; 1 Mor. Gorp., <em>s. </em>98.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>It does not appear that Towner undertook to release the defendant from his subscription. He had no power to do so because Goodell refused to subscribe, or for any other reason. 1 Mor. Corp., <em>ss. </em>109, 111. The defendant raises the objection that this suit cannot be maintained for the subscription of the stock because no assessments have been collected by sale of the stock subscribed for. This objection was not raised at the trial. But as it appears the defendant, by the terms of his subscription, agreed to pay the amount at specified times, a suit can he maintained on the agreement. It is only where a subscriber for stock agrees to take a specified number of shares without expressly promising to pay the amount of the same or the assessments, that he cannot be personally sued on the contract until his shares have been sold to pay the assessment. <em>N. H. Central Railroad </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>80 N. H. 390, 403; <em>White Mts. Railroad </em>v. <em>Eastman, supra; Company </em>v. <em>Burlingame, </em>67 N. H. 301; <em>Union Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Pray, </em>67 N. H. 435; 1 Mor. Corp., <em>s. </em>144. No question is made but that the whole amount of the capital stock authorized was subscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiffs.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b597-6\">Clark, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
