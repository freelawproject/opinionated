There were holes in the sidewalk above this drain, caused by the sifting of the sand and gravel between the covering stones into the drain. The plaintiff, while walking on the sidewalk in the evening, stepped into one of these holes and was injured. The defendants denied their liability on the ground that the place of\" the injury was not \u201c a bridge, culvert, or sluiceway,\u201d within the meaning of Laws 1893, <em>c. </em>59, <em>s. </em>1.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The plaintiff testified, in substance, that she did not know about the law requiring the filing of a statement of a claim of this nature; that on the eighth day after the injury, her husband, at her request, sent a letter to the selectmen of the town notifying them of the accident, which they supposed was sufficient compliance with the law; and that she was too sick t-o attend to it herself and entrusted the matter to her husband, not understanding that she Avas to do it in person.

Avhich renders it unsuitable for the travel thereon.\u201d Laws 1893, <em>e. </em>59, <em>s. </em>1. <em>\u201c </em>Culvert \u201d is here used in its ordinary sense, namely, a covered drain under a road, designed for the passage of water. The jury would be warranted in finding that the plaintiff\u2019s injury happened by reason of a defect, insufficiency, or want of repair of a culvert, within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that her failure to file a proper statement of her claim within ten days after receiving her injury (P. S., <em>c. 76, s. 7) </em>was due to her ignorance of the law, and was without any neglect or fault upon her part. It justified the court\u2019s finding <em>(Bolles </em>v. <em>Dalton, </em>59 N. H. 479; <em>Kelsea </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>64 N. H. 570); and the finding is conclusive upon the parties. <em>Sewell </em>v. <em>Webster, 59 </em>N.
