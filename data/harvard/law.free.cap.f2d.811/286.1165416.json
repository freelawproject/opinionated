This case does not involve discharge or discrimination against Stephens because of a handicap, and it does not in any way conflict with <em>Colorado Anti-Discrimination Commission v. Continental Airlines, </em>372 U.S. 714 [83 S.Ct. 1022, 10 L.Ed.2d 84] (1963). There are three issues to be decided in this case. First, whether the physical examination was legitimate. Second, whether Stephens could pass the examination. Third, if, as the trial court held, Stephen\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted under the Handicapper\u2019s Act, whether Stephen\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to rely on that Act could take his claim outside the exclusive jurisdiction of the NRAB.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
