Maldonado cross-appeals from the district court\u2019s refusal to apply a multiplier. This court has jurisdiction over the appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">In 1978, Maldonado, an employee at the Mare Island Shipyard, sued the Shipyard for employment discrimination. The suit settled, and Maldonado was promoted. In 1982, Maldonado filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging reprisal for his 1978 suit. After a five-day hearing, the Examiner found that Maldonado had experienced reprisal. The Secretary of the Navy adopted the Examiner\u2019s findings. Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. . \u00a7 1613.271(c), the Secretary also found that Maldonado was a prevailing party and, therefore, that his attorney, Robert Atkins (Atkins), was entitled to present a claim for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the Navy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">Atkins then presented an affidavit to the Navy. He claimed that he had spent 164.1 hours working on Maldonado\u2019s case and asked for a fee of $110 per hour and a multiplier of two. He also requested $398.20 in costs. The Navy accepted as reasonable the amount of costs and the number of hours worked. However, the Navy rejected Atkins\u2019 requested hourly rate, and, instead, awarded $95 per hour for Atkins\u2019 work at administrative hearings and $75 per hour for his non-hearing work. The Navy claimed that these rates were consistent with Atkins\u2019 customary billing rate of $80 per hour. The Navy refused to apply a multiplier because it felt that additional compensation was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-6\">Maldonado, dissatisfied with the Navy\u2019s award of fees, filed a complaint for attorney\u2019s fees in district court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c). In support of his request for a fee of $110 per hour, Maldonado submitted affidavits from attorneys in San Francisco showing that other similarly situated attorneys charged from $90 to $135 per hour. The district court found that $110 was a reasonable hourly rate for Atkins\u2019 services and assessed the fee award accordingly. The court refused to apply a multiplier. The Navy now appeals the district court\u2019s award of fees, and Maldonado cross-appeals the court\u2019s refusal to apply a multiplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-8\">In a civil action filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c), the district court reviews the agency\u2019s decision de novo. <em>Chandler v. Roudebush, </em>425 U.S. 840, 96 S.Ct. 1949, 48 L.Ed.2d 416 (1976). We review the amount of fees awarded by the district court for an abuse of discretion. <em>Chalmers v. City of Los Angeles, </em>796 F.2d 1205, 1210 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-10\">The Navy argues that the district court should have calculated the award of attorney\u2019s fees using Atkins\u2019 customary billing rate rather than the prevailing market rate in San Francisco. <em>See, e.g., Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., </em>746 F.2d 4 (D.C.Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1181, 105 S.Ct. 939, 83 L.Ed.2d 951 (1985). This Circuit does not follow the legal standard set forth in <em>Laffey. </em>\u201cWhile evidence of counsel\u2019s customary hourly rate may be considered by the District Court, it is not a abuse of discretion in this type of case to use the reasonable community standard that was employed here.\u201d <em>White v. City of Richmond, </em>713 F.2d 458, 461 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-12\">Maldonado argues that the district court abused its discretion by not applying a multiplier in calculating the award of attorney\u2019s fees. Maldonado has the burden of proving that an upward adjustment is necessary to award him a reasonable fee. <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 898, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 1548, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984). While adjustments are possible, they are rare and must be supported by specific evidence and detailed findings. <em>Id. </em>at 898-900. Maldonado failed to establish that an upward adjustment was warranted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
