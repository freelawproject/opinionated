The Act establishes a national health insurance plan for individuals who are 65 or older, disabled, or suffering from end-stage renal disease. To carry out this plan the United States reimburses health care providers for the reasonable costs of rendering certain services to Medicare beneficiaries. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1525\">*1525</page-number><em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395f(b)(l), 1395x(v)(l)(A) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-4\">Petitioner Samaritan Health Service owns and operates Good Samaritan Hospital, a short-term acute-care hospital providing medical services to Medicare and non-Medicare beneficiaries. At issue is Good Samaritan\u2019s right to reimbursement for certain costs incurred in the operation of two of its facilities, namely units caring for sick newborns and an ultra-sophisticated emergency room. The Secretary determined that costs incurred in the operation of Good Samaritan\u2019s newborn units constituted \u201cnursery\u201d costs within the meaning of a regulation treating nursery costs as not \u201croutine\u201d and therefore nonreimbursable. <em>Good Samaritan Hosp. v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Ass\u2019n/Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Inc., </em>[1984-2 Transfer Binder] Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) \u00b6 34,167 at 10,262 (Decision No. 84-D146 July 12, 1984). With respect to the emergency room, the Secretary determined that his Provider Reimbursement Manual (the \u201cManual\u201d), by purportedly limiting reimbursement to only one type of \u201cstandby\u201d fee, precluded compensation for fees calculated differently. <em>Id. </em>at 10,261-62. The District Court, sitting as an appellate court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(f)(l) (1982 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. Ill 1985), affirmed the Secretary\u2019s determinations with respect to both facilities. <em>Samaritan Health Service v. Heckler, </em>619 F.Supp. 713 (D.D.C.1985). For the reasons set forth below, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-6\">Good Samaritan operates four infant care units. Each is separate and provides a different level of care. The \u201cA-3 Nursery\u201d cares for healthy newborns while their mothers recover from delivery. The \u201cTransitional Nursery\u201d provides the same level of care as the A-3 Nursery except that newborns vital signs are more frequently monitored. Neither the Transitional Nursery nor the A-3 Nursery contains any medical equipment of note, and the care they offer is essentially custodial and not medical.</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-8\">The other two units care exclusively for sick newborns. The \u201cICU Unit\u201d cares for critically ill newborns and the \u201cBorder Unit\u201d cares for all other sick newborns requiring medical treatment. Unlike the A-3 and Transitional nurseries, these units possess sophisticated medical equipment and comprehensive medical staffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-9\">Each of Good Samaritan\u2019s infant care units is licensed by the state of Arizona as a nursery, and prior to 1975 Good Samaritan classified all four units as nurseries for Medicare purposes. In 1975, Good Samaritan reclassified the Border and ICU units as \u201cpediatric\u201d units in order to obtain Medicare reimbursement for a portion of the costs of providing routine services<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in those units.</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-10\">The Secretary\u2019s method of reimbursing providers is somewhat counter-intuitive. Rather than requiring providers to account for the routine services used by each Medicare patient, Medicare reimburses providers for a portion of their total cost of providing such services to all patients. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.452 (1979). The provider\u2019s hospital-wide routine costs are aggregated to yield a \u201ctotal cost of routine services\u201d which is divided by the provider\u2019s \u201ctotal number of inpatient days\u201d to yield an \u201caverage cost per diem.\u201d The average cost per diem is then multiplied by the number of Medicare beneficiary inpatient days to yield the Medicare reimbursement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This simple formula is complicated by the fact that the regulations specifically exclude certain costs, including \u201cnursery costs,\u201d from a provider\u2019s total cost of routine ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1526\">*1526</page-number>vices, and certain days, including \u201cnewborn days,\u201d from a provider\u2019s total number of inpatient days.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.452(d)(7) (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-4\">Although the Secretary initially accepted Good Samaritan\u2019s reclassification of the Border and ICU units as pediatric, he later reversed field, declaring their routine costs to be ineligible \u201cnursery\u201d costs. The dispute relates only to the Border and IGU units for the 1977, 1978 and 1979 cost years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-6\">The Secretary relies on a regulation excluding from a provider\u2019s total cost of routine services \u201cthe cost of services provided in intensive care units, coronary care units, and other special care inpatient hospital units as well as nursery costs.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.452(d)(7) (1979).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Neither the regulations governing Medicare reimbursement nor the Manual defines the term nursery as it is used here. In disposing of this matter, the Secretary claimed that the term nursery encompasses any unit caring exclusively for newborns. Petitioner asserts that the only reasonable definition is one based on the level of care provided by the unit at issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the Secretary\u2019s definition of the term nursery is not on its face implausible, we agree with petitioner that it conflicts with factual and legal realities. <em>See Jewish Hosp. &amp; Medical Center v. Heckler, </em>83 Civ. 4498, mem.op. (E.D.N.Y. June 30, 1986) [Available on WESTLAW, DCTU database] (reaching same conclusion on similar facts); Transcript of an Extract of Proceedings, <em>Rochester General Hosp. v. Heckler, </em>No. 84-0056T (W.D.N.Y. April 8, 1985) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-12\">The facts of this case demonstrate the arbitrary results that flow from the Secretary\u2019s definition of the term nursery. In addition to its four newborn units, Good Samaritan operates a \u201cPediatrics\u201d unit which cares for both ill newborns and ill children. The Pediatrics unit renders care comparable to that provided in the Border and ICU units. The Secretary concedes that costs incurred in the Pediatrics unit are properly included in Good Samaritan\u2019s total cost of routine services, even though the Pediatrics unit treats newborns as well as children. Thus, under the Secretary\u2019s definition of the term nursery, inclusion of routine services for a sick newborn in Good Samaritan\u2019s total cost of routine services depends entirely upon the happenstance of whether that newborn received treatment in the Pediatrics unit or the Border or ICU units. This arbitrary application of the nursery cost exclusion has no legal basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1527\">*1527</page-number>Although the regulation relied upon by the Secretary does not define the term nursery, it does specifically define all of the other excluded units by the level of care provided: \u201cTo be considered an intensive care unit, coronary care unit or other special care inpatient hospital unit, the unit ... must be one in which the care required is extraordinary and on a concentrated and continuous basis____\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.452(d)(10) (1979). Thus, to sustain the internal logic of the regulations, nursery costs should not be excluded from \u201croutine costs\u201d where the unit in question provides a level of care identical to that of other units incurring \u201croutine\u201d costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-7\">The health care industry \u2014 whose methods and terminology are expressly made relevant by statute and regulation <footnotemark>6</footnotemark>^applies this same \u201clevel of care\u201d criterion to differentiate between units caring for healthy newborns and units caring for sick newborns. The American Medical Record Association\u2019s <em>Glossary of Hospital Terms </em>(1974), cited by both parties as authoritative, defines a \u201chospital newborn inpatient\u201d as \u201c[a] hospital inpatient who was bom in the hospital at the beginning of his current inpatient hospitalization.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. The purpose of this definition is to distinguish newborn inpatients from other hospital inpatients. The definition itself, however reflects the <em>Glossary\u2019s </em>prior distinction between sick and healthy newborns. To qualify as a hospital inpatient, one must be a \u201chospital patient,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 18, and to be such one must be receiving \u201cmedical services,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 17. Thus, only sick newborns qualify as \u201chospital newborn inpatients.\u201d Healthy newborns located in \u201ca special infant care unit ... maintained for babies who do not need or receive medical services\u201d are not hospital patients but are properly classified as \u201chospital boarders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. Thus the <em>Glossary </em>asserts precisely the distinction urged by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-11\">Perhaps most telling is the Secretary\u2019s own interpretation of the nursery cost exclusion regulation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1613-12\">Newborn inpatient days excluded from the count [of total inpatient days] are only those days when an infant occupies a newborn bed in the nursery. An infant remaining in the hospital after the mother is discharged and not occupying a newborn bed in the nursery, or an infant delivered outside the hospital and later admitted to the hospital but not occupying a newborn bed in the nursery, or <em>an infant admitted or transferred out of the nursery for an illness, should be included in the total inpatient days </em>reported____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1613-13\">Manual, Part II, \u00a7 304.3 Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) 119304C, at 3,149-12 (emphasis added). The critical language in this section is \u201cadmitted or transferred out of the nursery for an illness.\u201d Thus the Secretary himself, for purposes of computing the divisor of the fraction, assumes that a sick infant does not belong in \u201cthe nursery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-14\">Finally, this court has recognized that whether a cost qualifies as part of a provider\u2019s total cost of routine services depends upon the level of care provided in the particular unit. \u201c[T]he reason the section excludes newborns from the [routine cost reimbursement] calculation ... is that newborns do not receive any routine care and therefore do not generate any routine costs.\u201d <em>Saint Mary of Nazareth, </em>718 F.2d at 468. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Healthy newborns who receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1528\">*1528</page-number>only custodial care generate no routine costs; sick newborns who receive hospital care do. It logically follows that the cost of providing routine services in the Border and ICU units must be included in Good Samaritan\u2019s total cost of routine services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-4\">The Secretary urges that we must affirm if we can find a rational basis in the record for the agency\u2019s interpretation of the nursery exclusion provision, citing <em>Diplomat Lakewood Inc. v. Harris, </em>613 F.2d 1009, 1018 (D.C.Cir.1979). Given the internal logic of the Secretary\u2019s own regulations and Manual, the terminology of the industry, and the decisions of this court, we find no rational basis for stretching the term nursery to encompass any unit caring exclusively for newborns irrespective of the level of care, and we find the Secretary\u2019s decision to do so arbitrary and capricious. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-6\">The Secretary asserts that regardless of whether the Border and ICU units constitute nurseries, Good Samaritan\u2019s documentation of the units\u2019 costs failed to meet the standards of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.453 (1979). Because the District Court upheld the Secretary\u2019s classification of those units, it never reached this contention. We therefore remand the case to the District Court for resolution of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-8\">The second issue concerns standby fees paid to physicians staffing Good Samaritan\u2019s Level I trauma center. A Level I trauma center is an emergency room caring for those patients so severely injured that survival depends upon receiving treatment within one hour of injury. Such centers must at all times have available the services of a surgeon and an anesthesiologist.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1614-14\">To secure these services, Good Samaritan contracted with surgeons to be on call at all times and anesthesiologists to be on call at all times when Good Samaritan\u2019s staff anesthesiologists were unavailable. While on call the physicians had to remain within a 20-minute range of the hospital and make the trauma center patients their top priority. Good Samaritan paid the physicians a flat on-call fee for their availability ($200 for a 12-hour on-call period and $400 for a 24-hour on-call period) and permitted them to bill the individual patients they treated. During 1979 Good Samaritan incurred a total of $127,900 in on-call fees, all of which the Secretary deemed nonreimbursable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1614-15\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-16\">The Medicare Act entitles Good Samaritan to reimbursement for \u201cthe reasonable cost\u201d of providing services. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395f(b)(l) (1982).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Act defines such cost as \u201cthe cost actually incurred,\u201d and also states that reasonable cost is to be \u201cdetermined in accordance with regulations\u201d of the Secretary. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(A) (1982).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Secretary\u2019s regulations specify that reasonable costs include \u201cnormal standby costs.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.451(c)(3) (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-17\">The Secretary bases his claim that Good Samaritan\u2019s on-call fees were not \u201cnormal standby costs\u201d on a provision of the Manual, purporting to restrict reimbursement to a particular type of standby fee. \u201cThe unmet guarantee ... is the <em>only </em>type of financial arrangement in which the Medicare program will recognize provider stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1529\">*1529</page-number>by costs for payments made to emergency room physicians.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Manual, Part I \u00a7 2109.1, Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) U 5889 (Mar.1978) (emphasis in original). Under an \u201cunmet guarantee,\u201d as defined in the Manual,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the emergency room physician bills all patients for his or her services. If the amount billed falls below a certain minimum the hospital pays the physician the difference. Good Samaritan\u2019s on-call fees, which allow the physician a flat amount regardless of actual demands on his or her time (and therefore regardless of fees earned), do not qualify as unmet guarantees. Relying on \u00a7 2109\u2019s exclusion of all reimbursement methods other than the unmet guarantee, the Secretary declared the fees nonreimbursable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-4\">Since \u00a7 2109 was promulgated without notice and comment, the Secretary cannot claim it as a substantive rule, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1982) (requiring that substantive rules be promulgated by notice-and-comment rulemaking);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> rather he identifies it as an interpretive rule. While substantive rules are typically characterized as having \u201cthe force and effect of law,\u201d <em>see Batterton v. Francis, </em>432 U.S. 416, 425 n. 9, 97 S.Ct. 2399, 2405 n. 9, 53 L.Ed.2d 448 (1977),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> interpretive rules enjoy a lesser deference \u2014 doubtless in part because of the absence of public opportunity to comment. \u201cCertainly regulations subject to the [Administrative Procedure Act] cannot be afforded the 'force and effect of law\u2019 if not promulgated pursuant to the statutory procedural minimum found in that Act.\u201d <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281, 313, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 1723, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979). Any deference that an interpretive rule may claim depends on \u201cthe thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors that give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\u201d <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 164, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944). <em>See also Batterton v. Francis, </em>432 U.S. at 425 n. 9, 97 S.Ct. at 2405 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-9\">The Secretary would apply \u00a7 2109 categorically to preclude reimbursement for emergency room physician standby costs incurred under any compensation scheme other than an unmet guarantee. We conclude that he has attempted to endow \u00a7 2109 with more force than is commanded by its inherent \u201cpower to persuade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-10\">Indeed, its persuasiveness seems slight. Neither the Manual itself nor the Secretary\u2019s decision<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> suggests a reasoned basis for limiting reimbursement to the unmet guarantee. In this litigation the Secretary argues that an on-call fee such as Good Samaritan\u2019s gives the physician a \u201cwindfall.\u201d Secretary\u2019s Brief at 29-30. In fact, the two types of reimbursement simply differ in their allocation of risk. The \u201cunmet guarantee\u201d relieves the physician of risk almost entirely, assuring him of quite sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1530\">*1530</page-number>stantial revenue regardless of the number of patients he treats. In exchange for that guarantee, the physician gets nothing directly from the hospital on those occasions when patient fees meet or exceed the fixed amount. Good Samaritan\u2019s arrangement leaves the physician with the risk that he will receive little or nothing in the way of patient fees; in exchange, the physician receives the fixed sum no matter how lucrative the event proves. There is no reason to think that Good Samaritan\u2019s arrangement will produce any sort of windfall. On a busy night in the emergency room, a physician on call for Good Samaritan can keep his on-call fee, plus patient fees, and thus does better than under the unmet guarantee. But a slow evening produces the opposite result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-4\">Somewhat contradictorily, the Secretary argues that as Good Samaritan did not keep records of physician billings it was \u201cimpossible to determine the extent to which Good Samaritan\u2019s fixed fees were in fact a necessary expense or an unnecessary windfall.\u201d Secretary\u2019s Brief at 30. But, even if we charitably interpret the \u201cwindfall\u201d argument here as a claim that Good Samaritan\u2019s arrangement was inherently more costly than the expressly permitted method, such a claim could be established only by comparing adequate samplings of compensation under the various methods.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1616-5\">Further, the Secretary\u2019s position in this case conflicts with both his earlier and later pronouncements. As originally promulgated in 1970, \u00a7 2109 merely established criteria governing Medicare reimbursement for costs incurred under an unmet guarantee arrangement; it did not purport to limit reimbursement exclusively to such schemes. Provider Reimbursement Manual Revision (\u201cPRMR\u201d) No. 18 (June 1970). That limitation first emerged in the Secretary\u2019s 1971 amendments to \u00a7 2109. PRMR No. 41 (Aug.1971). <em>See also </em>PRMR No. 136 (Oct.1975); PRMR No. 198, Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) \u00b6 5889 (Mar.1978) (both reaffirming the purported limitation). But even after these amendments, the agency\u2019s administrative law judges rebuffed attempts to limit reimbursement exclusively to costs incurred under minimum guarantee arrangements, and ordered reimbursement for costs incurred under other arrangements. <em>Community Hosp. v. Blue Cross Ass\u2019n/Blue Cross/Blue Shield, </em>[1983-1 Transfer Binder] Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH), \u00b6 32,293 at 9435-37 (No. 82-D193, Sept. 3, 1982); <em>D.M. Cogdell Memorial Hosp. v. Blue Cross Ass\u2019n Group Hosp. Service, Inc., </em>[1982 Transfer Binder] Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH), 1131,883 at 9379-80 (No. 82-D63, Mar. 3, 1982). Moreover, in 1980 and 1982 high-level officials of the Health Care Financing Administration, the division of Health and Human Services charged with overseeing Medicare reimbursement, issued pronouncements stating that \u00a7 2109 did not preclude Medicare reimbursement for costs incurred under on-call fee arrangements essentially identical to the one here at issue. Record at 1971, 1981. Finally, in 1985 the Secretary amended \u00a7 2109 to eliminate any pretense that the unmet guarantee was the only compensation arrangement generating reimbursable standby costs. PRMR No. 326, Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) \u00b6 5889 (May 1985).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1616-8\">Because Congress left open the question of when emergency room standby costs are reasonable (and hence reimbursable), we must accept the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the Act on this matter so long as it is reasonable. <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-45, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-83, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). For the reasons set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1531\">*1531</page-number>out above, \u00a7 2109 fails to persuade us that it is a reasonable interpretation of the Act. In reaching this conclusion we rely in part on the Secretary\u2019s failure to manifest his interpretation in substantive rules adopted after proper notice and comment.. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(A) (1982). Conceivably his adoption of the same position in such a rulemaking might satisfy the <em>Chevron </em>standard. This possibility, however, is not before us. Section 2109, and the Secretary\u2019s arguments on its behalf in this litigation, provide no basis for treating Good Samaritan\u2019s on-call fees as ineligible for reimbursement under the Act and regulations.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1617-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-6\">In addition to determining that \u00a7 2109 rendered Good Samaritan\u2019s on-call fees nonreimbursable, the Secretary concluded that \u201cthe on-call fee arrangements resulted in high levels of cost per patient.\u201d <em>Good Samaritan Hosp. v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Ass\u2019n/Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Inc., </em>[1984-1 Transfer Binder] Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) \u00b6 34,167 at 10,261 (Decision No. 84-D146 July 12, 1984). We take this to be, in effect, a contention that the Secretary \u201cfound [a portion of the costs] to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services\u201d and therefore excludable. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v) (1)(A) (1982). Under \u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(A), the sanction for \u201chigh costs\u201d would be nonreimbursement for the unduly high portion, not denial for the whole fee.

Petitioner also argues that nursery costs must be included in the routine cost averaging pool to avoid a subsidization of Medicare beneficiaries in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(A) (1982). <em>See Vista Hill Foundation, Inc. v.

Even putting aside the possibility of newborns with end-stage renal disease, however, the Secretary\u2019s method of reimbursement makes such inclusion appropriate. His averaging principle includes routine costs without regard to use or non-use by Medicare patients. For example, he includes the expense of completing reports used only for Medicare patients, <em>see id, </em>at 798. This might result in non-Medicare patients subsidizing Medicare patients, if routine costs wholly unrelated to Medicare patients were excluded merely for lack of use by the latter. <em>See id. </em>at 798-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-14\">Because we find the nursery cost exclusion inapplicable to the Border and ICU units, we do not reach petitioner\u2019s claim that the averaging principle requires inclusion of \"routine costs\u201d for newborns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1613-8\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(A) (1982) directs the Secretary, in promulgating regulations defining reasonable cost, to consider the principles generally applied by national organizations in computing the amount of payment (to be made by persons other than the recipients of services) to providers of services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-9\">42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.406(a) (1979) provides that \u2018\u2018[sjtandardized definitions ... which are widely accepted in the hospital and related fields are followed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1613-15\">. The issue before the court was whether the Secretary could properly count labor or delivery room days toward the divisor when he excluded labor and delivery costs from the numerator of the fraction. In concluding that he could not, we construed an identical version of the regulation before us, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.452(d)(7), as drawing the line between routine and other levels of care, taking the treatment of newborns as an example.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1614-9\">.

Although \u00a7 2109 was originally promulgated in June 1970, it went through a succession of revisions, and it does not appear to us that any version earlier than that of August 1971 could reasonably be deemed to require use of the unmet guarantee method. <em>See infra </em>pp. 1530-31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1615-11\">.

In light of the Secretary\u2019s own prior approval of similar fee arrangements, Record at 1971, 1981, it is hard to grasp his basis for placing such a burden on the hospital.
