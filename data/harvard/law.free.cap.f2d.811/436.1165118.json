After being sentenced for study under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(d), he was given a dispositive sentence of eighteen years on February 14, 1986. Defendant raises on appeal a number of issues. After careful consideration, for the reasons hereafter elaborated, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">The events giving rise to this prosecution began to unfold when on February 22, 1985, defendant\u2019s son, Tim, aged five, was taken by his mother to a hospital in Winner, South Dakota, and doctors there, and later at Yankton, found his anus abnormal and bloody. They concluded that it had been stretched or dilated by insertion of a foreign body for a distance of at least four inches. The diagnosis of the three doctors who had examined the boy was that his injury was consistent with penetration of Tim\u2019s anus by a penis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Upon release from the hospital, Tim was placed in a foster home. While there, he was interviewed by social workers. It was necessary for them to determine whether it would be appropriate to return him to his home and, accordingly,, to attempt to ascertain whether his father was the party causing his injury. Apparently, the first to discuss the incident with Tim was Carol Kay Horstman on February 23, 1985; the second was Angela Keierleber on February 27, 1985; the third, Michelle Tapken on March 15 and April 18, 1985; and lastly, Mary Carole Curran, Ph.D., O.S.B., an experienced clinical psychologist, on April 4, 1985, and subsequently. Dr. Curran testified at the trial, as did Tim DeNoyer himself. He testified that his father, the defendant, was the perpetrator of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The social workers describe the five-year-old boy as a nonverbalizer; he would not discuss the incident in words. But when held in the lap of the workers, he would, by shaking his head, respond in the affirmative or negative to their questions. None of the workers appear to have proceeded by means of improperly suggestive leading questions. On the contrary, they used a \u201cmultiple choice\u201d method of discussing the incident, and the boy was apparently discerning in his ability to answer negatively or affirmatively in accordance with his recollection in a trustworthy manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">We shall review seriatim the issues raised by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">It is first contended that the out-of-court statements of Tim made to the social workers should have been excluded. The trial judge held them admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 803(4) and 803(24).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">On such evidentiary issues, the standard of review is whether there is a clear abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Renville, </em>779 F.2d 430, 439 (8th Cir.1985), a case quite similar to the case at bar. In <em>Renville, </em>the child\u2019s out-of-court statements were found admissible under both subsections (4) and (24) of Fed.R.Evid. 803. Defendant\u2019s contention that Tim\u2019s statements were not sought for medical treatment purposes is refuted by the explanation in <em>Renville, </em>779 F.2d at 436-37, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-14\">Statements by a child abuse victim * * * that the abuser is a member of the victim\u2019s immediate household <em>are </em>reasonably pertinent to treatment. * * * The exact nature and extent of the psychological problems which ensue from child abuse often depend on the identity of the abuser. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-15\">We emphasize that we agree with <em>United States v. Cree, </em>778 F.2d 474, 478 (8th Cir.1985), that this Circuit follows the modern rule that in cases involving young child witnesses, the administration of justice is served by the admission of statements made in a more relaxed environment without the possible harm of traumatic courtroom encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Another evidentiary ruling attacked by defendant is the admission of statements made by defendant DeNoyer to Paul Schueth, chief of police at Winner, South Dakota. Tim had been taken to a hospital there on February 22, 1985, and four days later, the boy\u2019s parents went to Winner to discuss his condition with Dr. Webb, who had treated him. When they arrived, Dr. Webb called the chief of police. Upon arrival, he identified himself to the DeNoyers and stood by the door while the doctor talked to the DeNoyers about their son. After this conversation, Mrs. DeNoyer was asked to leave the room; and Schueth talked with the defendant, and later drove him to the police station for further interrogation. <em>Miranda </em>warnings <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were not given. However, Schueth testified (but defendant denied) that DeNoyer was told that he did not have to talk to Schueth. In any event, it must be remembered that defendant himself was a policeman, and doubtless could recite the <em>Miranda </em>warnings in his sleep. Moreover, it is doubtful whether he was really in a custodial setting or the type of situation where the <em>Miranda </em>warnings are useful in preventing unsophisticated suspects from being overreached by police misconduct. DeNoyer was never under arrest during the discussions with Schueth.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">There were only two items the admission of which is assailed on appeal. Schueth testified that, without there having been any previous mention of the subject, De-Noyer, out of the blue, asked whether his son had been sexually abused. Schueth responded by asking why DeNoyer had brought up the subject. At another time, Schueth asked defendant whether he \u201cdid it.\u201d DeNoyer answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">These remarks would seem to qualify as admissible under the general rule permitting admissions against penal interest by a party, although they appear to have little probative value. Their admission does not appear to be harmful to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">The dialogue reminds one of the detective story ploy where the sleuth is asked, \u201cWhat time was it when the victim was shot?\u201d and replies, \u201cHow did you know he was shot? The announcement in the media said only that his body was discovered on the railroad track. Only the murderer would know that he was shot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">However, in the case at bar, the detrimental impact of the remark made by defendant would be very slight. The doctors\u2019 diagnosis of a condition \u201cconsistent\u201d with sexual abuse had doubtless been made known to defendant, and possibly mentioned during the DeNoyers\u2019 discussion with Dr. Webb while the chief of police stood by the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">Under all the circumstances, it seems impossible to view the trial judge\u2019s admission of these items as abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">The same is true of defendant\u2019s contention that a psychological examination of Tim to determine his mental state should have been ordered by the Court. Under Eighth Circuit jurisprudence, such an examination is discretionary with the court. <em>United States v. Riley, </em>657 F.2d 1377, 1387 (8th Cir.1981). Such a \u201cdrastic measure\u201d was not called for in the case at bar since the data with respect to Tim\u2019s condition had been fully described in the testimony of Dr. Curran and other witnesses, and could be adequately evaluated by the jury in the light of such points as defense counsel could properly emphasize in cross-examination and argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">Perhaps appellant\u2019s most meritorious contention on appeal is that the trial judge should not have excluded the testimony which would have been given by defendant\u2019s expert in school psychology, Sharon White Hawk.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">The proffered witness had never examined Tim and her testimony would have been based on her listening to the boy\u2019s testimony and Dr. Curran\u2019s testimony in court. As stated in <em>Riley, </em>657 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>1387, \u201cWe find no error in the district court\u2019s refusal to admit this kind of expert testimony.\u201d Very seldom will such expertise serve a useful purpose and amount to more than cumulative surplusage. Sharon White Hawk\u2019s proposed testimony was largely speculative and consisted chiefly in comments that she would have examined Tim in a somewhat different manner than Dr. Curran employed. The criticisms she would have voiced were patent from Dr. Curran\u2019s full and detailed disclosure of her procedures and were adequately presented to the evaluation of the jury without additional cumulative testimony. The rule in this Circuit is that it is discretionary with the trial court whether or not to admit such expert testimony. <em>United States v. Purham, </em>725 F.2d 450, 454 (8th Cir.1984). <em>(Cf. United States Downing, </em>753 F.2d 1224, 1244 (3d Cir.1985)). We find no abuse of discretion in excluding this testimony. At worst, it is harmless error. <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 22, 87 S.Ct. 824, 827, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">As the trial judge noted, defendant\u2019s expert was basically a school psychologist and not a clinical psychologist, as Dr. Cur-ran was, with extensive experience in dealing with sexual abuse cases. Essentially, then, Sharon White Hawk\u2019s testimony would simply have been comment by one witness on the testimony of another witness. Usually, and particularly in view of the state of the record in the case at bar, the jury is capable of evaluating a witness\u2019s testimony in the light of the comments of able counsel in their closing summations, without additional comment offered by other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">We have carefully considered defendant\u2019s points and are convinced that the jury could reasonably have accepted Tim\u2019s testimony and Dr. Curran\u2019s as sufficiently trustworthy, and sufficiently convincing to establish defendant DeNoyer\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Defendant also alleges error in the exclusion of his offers to prove that his wife\u2019s brother undressed a five-year-old girl at a prayer meeting; that a neighbor two houses away from the DeNoyer dwelling had committed sodomy a year previous to the incident in the case at bar; and that other deviant sex offenders were operating in the community. This sort of evidence was properly excluded as remote and speculative. Such efforts to cast suspicion elsewhere fall far short of establishing a \u201cPerry Mason defense.\u201d The preferred testimony was pure \u201cred herring\u201d and had no probative value in establishing the culpability of any party other than the defendant with respect to the offense involved in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Likewise, utterly irrelevant was defendant\u2019s proposal to show that Angela Keierleber\u2019s manner was accusatory when talking to other children about the case. The same is obviously true with respect to the proffered testimony of DeNoyer\u2019s previous wife that he had been a normal husband and father during that marriage. Similarly, there was no error in charging that the testimony of character witnesses regarding defendant's reputation for truth and veracity should be considered by the jury only in evaluating defendant\u2019s credibility. Naturally, the evidence should be used only with respect to the trait concerning which the witnesses testified. Likewise, since no issue of identification was involved in the case at bar, there was no occasion to give any instructions on that topic. Nor does the exclusion of Janell Sully\u2019s testimony that Dr. Curran in preparation for a custody hearing indicated some uncertainty as to defendant\u2019s guilt amount to abuse of discretion or harmful error. It would be natural for her to desire greater certainty on account of the nonverbalized nature of Tim\u2019s responses. Technically, Sully\u2019s testimony might have been admissible impeachment as a prior inconsistent statement, but of a very peripheral nature, and clearly not amounting to an error warranting reversal for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">In addition to evidentiary issues, defendant raises several questions of law: whether instructions regarding lesser included offenses should have been given; whether the charge was defective in not requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>proof that the anal intercourse was accomplished for sexual gratification, and was involuntary on the part of the victim; and that the sentence was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The five requirements for a charge on lesser included offenses in this Circuit<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are clearly enumerated in <em>United States v. Elk, </em>658 F.2d 644, 648-49 (8th Cir.1981), and <em>United States v. Collins, </em>652 F.2d 735, 741-42 (8th Cir.1981).. Defendant\u2019s request for such a charge in the case at bar is precluded by the fourth requirement that \u201cthe proof on the element or elements differentiating the two crimes is sufficiently in dispute so that the jury may consistently find the defendant innocent of the greater and guilty of the lesser included offense * * *. Moreover, it is beyond dispute that a defendant is not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction unless the evidence adduced at the trial provides a rational basis upon which the jury could find him not guilty of the greater but guilty of the lesser offense.\u201d <em>Elk, </em>658 F.2d at 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Furthermore, when defendant\u2019s testimony is completely exculpatory and, if believed, could only lead to acquittal, or where \u201cthe defendant claimed complete innocence throughout the trial\u201d [as DeNoyer did in the case at bar], there is no rational basis for a lesser included offense instruction. 658 F.2d at 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Under the circumstances of the case at bar, it would not be reasonably possible to acquit defendant of the major offense but convict him of a lesser included offense. It is true that there was evidence that defendant had spanked his son hard on the butt. However, no spanking, however severe, could have produced the condition of stretching or dilatation of the anus which was observed by the medical doctors and described as consistent with penetration of a penis. Similarly, the injuries noted by the doctors indicated a consummated offense, not one merely attempted. Defendant\u2019s asserted defense was complete innocence, not perpetration of a less serious infraction. Thus, under our cases, there was no occasion for a charge on lesser included offenses and its denial was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">Little time need be spent on defendant's argument that the jury could not reasonably find that the act of sodomy was intended to arouse or gratify the perpetrator\u2019s sexual desire,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or that the penetration was involuntary on the part of the victim. As the English judge said when a man took a woman to a hotel room, they went not thither to say a paternoster. Nor did De-Noyer\u2019s action have the purpose of advancing the progress of medical science. He did not go to the bathroom to administer an enema to Tim. And it was not, in the often-heard phrase, a transaction between \u201cconsenting adults.\u201d The statute itself eliminates the element of consent when, as here, \u201cthe victim is less than ten years of age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">Nor does the defendant\u2019s contention that the sentence was excessive merit elaborate refutation. The sentence was within the statutory range; indeed, it was not the maximum prescribed by law, but approximately two-thirds thereof, eighteen rather than twenty-five years.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The crime was a serious offense,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a heinous variety of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>malum in se, </em>not a venial <em>malum prohibitum, </em>such as failure to have a driver\u2019s license in the glove compartment. There is no occasion for hesitating to follow the general rule that appellate review of sentencing is extremely limited.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> None of the exceptional circumstances which warrant intrusion by an appellate court is presented in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-10\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-11\"><em>Any Indian who commits against the person </em>or property <em>of another Indian </em>or other person any of the following offenses namely, murder, manslaughter, kidnaping, maiming, rape, <em>involuntary sodomy, </em>carnal knowledge of any female, not his wife, who has not attained the age of sixteen years, assault with intent to commit rape, incest, assault with intent to commit murder, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault resulting in serious bodily injury, arson, burglary, robbery, and a felony under section 661 of this title <em>within the Indian country, </em>shall be subject to the same law and penalties as all other persons committing any of the above offenses, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-12\">As used in this section, the offenses of burglary, <em>involuntary sodomy, </em>and incest <em>shall be defined and punished in accordance with the laws of the State in which such offense was committed as are in force at the time of such offense. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">Involuntary sodomy was added to the enumeration of offenses set forth in section 1153 by section 1009 of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of October 12, 1984, 98 Stat. 2141. <em>See United States v.
