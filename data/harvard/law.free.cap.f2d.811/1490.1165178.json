We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-13\">The pertinent facts are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-14\">In May 1981, the appellant Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (Canadian Bank) filed an application to register COMM-CASH as a service mark for \u201cbanking services.\u201d Crocker National Bank (Crocker), now Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., opposed the application on the basis of Crocker\u2019s prior use and registration of the mark COMMUNICASH for \u201cbanking services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-16\">As the Board stated, the only contested issue in this proceeding was \u201cwhether use of the respective marks on the respective services would be likely to cause confusion as to source or origin under Section 2(d) [of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.. \u00a7 1052(d)].\u201d 228 USPQ at 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-17\">Although Canadian Bank\u2019s application and Crocker\u2019s registration cover the use of their respective marks for \u201cbanking services,\u201d both marks are currently used only in connection with the highly specialized service of electronic cash management. This service apparently is used solely by large corporations and banks. The Board found that Canadian Bank\u2019s proffered testimony supported Canadian Bank\u2019s contention that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWz\">the degree of care taken in purchasing these services is extremely high and the purchaser of the services is much more discerning and sophisticated than a member of the public seeking banking services for his or her personal needs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1577-18\">228 USPQ at 690. Nonetheless, the Board concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1577-19\">[i]t is well settled that in a proceeding such as this, the question of likelihood of confusion must be determined based on an analysis of the mark as applied to the goods and/or services recited in applicant\u2019s application vis-a-vis the .goods and/or services recited in an opposer\u2019s registration, rather than what the evidence shows the goods and/or services to be. See: <em>CBS, Inc. v. Morrow, </em>708 F.2d 1579, 218 USPQ 198 (Fed.Cir.1983); 1 McCarthy, <em>Trademarks and Unfair Competition </em>\u00a7 20: 4A, 1024 (2d. ed. 1984) and cases cited therein [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1577-20\">In the present case, the relevant analysis of likelihood of source confusion may not be limited to electronic banking services to corporate and institutional customers since the recitation of services in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1492\">*1492</page-number>applicant\u2019s application and in opposer\u2019s registration is not so limited. On the contrary, applicant seeks registration of the \u201cCOMMCASH\u201d mark for banking services with no restrictions whatsoever. Similarly, the services covered by opposer\u2019s pleaded registration for \u201cCOMMUNICASH\u201d include banking services, per se. Therefore, applicant\u2019s banking services as well as those of opposer are assumed to be all services that would ordinarily be considered to fall under the heading of banking services____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1578-5\">Turning to the respective marks, it is our view that while they are not identical, they are strikingly similar in appearance, sound and in the commercial impression engendered____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1578-6\">Since we find that \u201cCOMMCASH\u201d and \u201cCOMMUNICASH\u201d are similar in appearance, sound and meaning and since the marks are used in connection with identical banking services which are presumed to be banking services rendered to all ordinary bank customers, we conclude that source confusion is likely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1578-7\">228 USPQ at 690-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-9\">Canadian Bank\u2019s principal contention is that the Board erred in basing its determination of likelihood of confusion upon the use of the mark specified in the application for registration and the existing registration of Crocker for the broad category of \u201cbanking services\u201d instead of the narrower use that Canadian Bank and Crocker made of the marks for the specialized services of electronic cash management.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-10\">Canadian Bank asserts that decisions of this court and its predecessor require the Board to base its decision upon the narrower actual use of the marks in the marketplace, and that because the customers of the specialized service are sophisticated and discerning, there is no likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-11\">Our decisions, however, do not justify the conclusion that Canadian Bank draws from them. Instead, they support the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-13\">A. In <em>CBS, Inc. v. Morrow, </em>708 F.2d 1579, 218 USPQ 198 (Fed.Cir.1983) (which, as noted, the Board cited, but which Canadian Bank did not even refer to in its opening brief), this court reversed a decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board dismissing an opposition to registration of the mark THINKER TOYS based upon the likelihood of confusion with the registered mark TINKERTOY. The application for registration of THINKER TOYS described the goods involved as \u201cincludpng] \u2018electronic components and circuit boards,\u2019 but ... not includpng] \u2018electronic terminals, keyboards, screens, printers, computers or programs or software for games or toys.\u2019 \u201d 708 F.2d at 1580, 218 USPQ at 199. The opposer\u2019s mark TINKERTOY was registered \u201cfor \u2018games, toys, and children\u2019s building-blocks.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1578-14\">In holding that registration of the applicant's mark \u201cshould ... be refused\u201d because \u201cas applied to applicant\u2019s goods, [the mark] so resembles opposer\u2019s registered mark that it is likely to cause confusion,\u201d 708 F.2d at 1582, 218 USPQ at 200, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1578-15\">Where likelihood of confusion is asserted by an opposer with respect to a trademark for which an application for registration has been filed, the issue must be resolved on the basis of not only a comparison of the involved marks, but also on consideration of the goods named in the application and in opposer\u2019s registration and, in the absence of specific limitations in the application and registration, on consideration of the normal and usual channels of trade and methods of distribution. The description of the goods in the application for registration is critical because any registration that issues will carry that description. Moreover, although a registrant\u2019s current business practices may be quite narrow, they may change at any time from, for example, industrial sales to individual consumer sales.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1493\">*1493</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 1581, 218 USPQ at 199 (citations omitted); <em>see also </em>1 J. McCarthy, <em>Trademarks and Unfair Competition, </em>\u00a7 20:4A at 1024 (2d ed. 1984) (\u201cIn determining likelihood of confusion in an opposition, it is the mark as shown in the application and as used on the goods described in the application which must be considered, not the mark as actually used by applicant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-4\">The court also rejected the applicant\u2019s argument that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1579-5\">confusion from use of the marks is not likely because its customers are by and large sophisticated, well-educated, technically oriented persons, in contrast to the generally juvenile buyers of the wooden stick toys that opposer manufactures. However, there is no restriction on the nature of the \u201cgames\u201d identified in opposer\u2019s registration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1579-6\">708 F.2d at 1581, 218 USPQ at 199-200.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-7\"><em>CBS </em>fully supports the Board\u2019s ruling that \u201cin a proceeding such as this, the question of likelihood of confusion must be determined based on an analysis of the mark as applied to the goods and/or services recited in applicant\u2019s application vis-a-vis the goods and/or services recited in an opposer\u2019s registration, rather than what the evidence shows the goods and/or services to be.\u201d In <em>CBS, </em>the court held that the issue of likelihood of confusion must be resolved not only by comparison of the marks themselves, \u201cbut also on consideration of the goods named in the application and in opposer\u2019s registration and, in the absence of specific limitations in the application and registration, on consideration of the normal and usual channels of trade and methods of distribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-8\">In the present case, there is nothing in either Crocker\u2019s registration or Canadian Bank\u2019s application that limits the use of the mark to any services narrower than \u201cbanking services\u201d generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-9\">In basing its likelihood-of-confusion determination on that broad service, the Board also properly heeded this court\u2019s recognition in <em>CBS </em>that the definition of goods in the application was \u201ccritical\u201d because \u201cany registration that issues will carry that description\u201d and because \u201calthough a registrant\u2019s current business practices [in connection with which the mark is used] may be quite narrow, they may change at any time.\u201d The Board pointed out that the application and the registration were not limited to \u201celectronic banking services to corporate and institutional customers\u201d but covered \u201cbanking services with no restrictions whatever.\u201d It was Canadian Bank that sought to register its mark for the broad range of services, and it is on that basis that the Board correctly determined the likelihood-of-confusion issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-11\">B. Canadian Bank relies upon <em>In re E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>476 F.2d 1357, 177 USPQ 563 (CCPA 1973), and <em>Giant Food, Inc. v. Nation\u2019s Foodservice, Inc., </em>710 F.2d 1565, 218 USPQ 390 (Fed.Cir. 1983), to support its position. Neither of those cases, however, dealt with the issue before us of whether the Board properly limited its inquiry into the likelihood of confusion in the use of the marks for the \u201cbanking services\u201d specified in Canadian Bank\u2019s application and Crocker\u2019s registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-12\"><em>Du Pont </em>involved the Board\u2019s refusal to register du Pont\u2019s mark RALLY \u201cfor a combination polishing, glazing and cleaning agent for use on automobiles\u201d because of the likelihood of confusion with Horizon\u2019s registered identical mark \u201cfor an all-purpose detergent.\u201d 476 F.2d at 1359, 177 USPQ at 566. In reversing that ruling, the court announced \u201ca reliable guide for decision-making in cases involving Sec. 2(d) [of the Lanham Act],\u201d which included a consideration of 13 specified \u201cevidentiary elements\u201d that \u201cwhen of record must be considered.\u201d 476 F.2d at 1360-61, 177 USPQ at 566-67. The court further stated: \u201cIn every case turning on likelihood of confusion, it is the duty of the examiner, the board and this court to find, upon consideration of <em>all </em>the evidence, whether or not confusion appears likely.\u201d 476 F.2d at 1362, 177 USPQ at 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-13\">The court\u2019s actual holding, however, was that in view of an agreement between du Pont and Horizon, under which du Pont <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1494\">*1494</page-number>agreed to limit its use of the mark to the automobile markets and Horizon agreed to limit its use to the general purpose cleaning market, confusion was unlikely. The court reasoned that the agreement reflected the belief of businessmen thoroughly familiar with the markets for their products that confusion would not result from the respective uses of the mark for the different purposes. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AReT\">We have no hesitancy in holding, therefore, under the facts of this case, that confusion is not likely to stem from concurrent use of RALLY by Horizon and DuPont on their respective goods under the terms of their agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1580-4\">476 F.2d at 1363, 177 USPQ at 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-5\"><em>Giant Food </em>involved an attempt to register GIANT HAMBURGERS \u201cfor \u2018hamburger and hot dog sandwiches, milk shakes for consumption on or off premises\u2019 and restaurant services.\u201d The application was opposed by the owner of the registered marks GIANT FOOD and GIANT \u201cfor, inter alia, retail grocery and supermarket services and private label food products.\u201d 710 F.2d at 1567, 218 USPQ at 392. In reversing the Board\u2019s determination of no likelihood of confusion, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-R\">In considering the question of likelihood of confusion, the only relevant application of the law to the facts is in the context of the marketplace, because that is where confusion of prospective purchasers would or would not occur____ All evidence of record bearing on the question of likelihood of confusion must be considered in order to determine the circumstances surrounding the use of the mark. <em>Du Pont </em>sets forth a list of 13 evidentiary factors that must be considered, when of record, in testing for likelihood of confusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1580-7\">710 F.2d at 1569, 218 USPQ at 393-94 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-8\">Neither of these cases discussed or considered the question whether the determination of likelihood of confusion should be made with respect to the use of the mark specified in the registration and application. Neither involved a registration and application that were for the identical use, as in the present case. Each case involved the use of the same <em>(du </em>Pont) or similar <em>(Giant Food) </em>marks for different products, and the question was whether that use was likely to cause confusion as to the source of the product. In answering that question, the court necessarily had to consider the impact of the marks upon the customers in the different markets in which the marks were used. Indeed, in each case the court apparently based its analysis upon confusion in the markets specified in the registration and application, where the marks were used.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-10\">In the present case, however, Canadian Bank sought registration of its mark for the identical service that Crocker\u2019s registered mark covered. The Board thus properly considered whether, in the entire market for that service (banking services), there was likelihood of confusion between the marks. That is precisely the approach that CBS requires, and nothing in <em>du Pont </em>or <em>Giant Food </em>is inconsistent with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-11\">Canadian Bank relies on the statement in <em>Giant Food </em>that likelihood of confusion must be determined \u201cin the context of the marketplace, because that is where confusion of prospective purchasers would or would not occur,\u201d and that \u201c[a]ll evidence of record bearing on the likelihood of confusion must be considered to determine the circumstances surrounding the use of the mark.\u201d The statements in an opinion, however, must be read in light of the issue before the court, and broad language cannot be applied uncritically to wholly different factual situations. <em>Armour &amp; Co. v. Wantock, </em>323 U.S. 126, 133, 65 S.Ct. 165, 168, 89 L.Ed. 118 (1944). Here the relevant \u201cmarketplace\u201d is \u201cbanking services,\u201d and those were the services for which Canadian Bank sought to register its mark. In determining likelihood of confusion, the Board properly limited its inquiry to the likelihood of confusion in that broad category of services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-13\">Canadian Bank also challenges the Board\u2019s finding that in the market for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1495\">*1495</page-number>banking services there was likelihood of confusion between the two marks. The Board pointed out that although the marks were \u201cnot identical, they are strikingly similar in appearance, sound and in the commercial impression engendered.\u201d It concluded that \u201csince the marks are used in connection with identical banking services which are presumed to be banking services rendered to all ordinary bank customers ... source confusion is likely.\u201d We have no basis for reversing that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-3\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-4\">The decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
