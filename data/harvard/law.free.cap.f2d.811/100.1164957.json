California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Approximately 25 <em>Anders </em>briefs have been filed annually in this Circuit for the past two years. Over one-half of the briefs were submitted by private attorneys assigned to represent indigent defendants under the Criminal Justice Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A (CJA). A significant number of these briefs fall below the standards set by the Supreme Court. We believe it necessary therefore to state again the <em>Anders </em>requirements for the benefit of those members of the private bar who undertake CJA assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">This appeal is from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Sifton, J.) denying appellant Gary Nell\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus sought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Assigned counsel seeks to be relieved from representation and has filed an <em>Anders </em>brief. The Assistant Attorney General of New York moves for summary affirmance of the district court\u2019s order. For reasons to be explained shortly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to be relieved and also grant appellant Nell\u2019s motion for assignment of new counsel. The State\u2019s motion for summary affirmance of the judgment of conviction is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">In May 1984, after Nell pled guilty to several counts of burglary and attempted burglary in the second degree, he was sentenced to 5 to 10 years as a second violent felony offender under N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 70.04. At sentencing, Nell was asked by the court whether he wished to controvert a 1979 felony conviction which was the predicate offense for an enhanced sentence as a violent-felony offender. Although informed that silence would be considered an admission, Nell requested that he be allowed to \u201cstand mute\u201d. His attorney failed to controvert the 1979 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"Apg\">Nell subsequently moved <em>pro se </em>to vacate that conviction pursuant to N.Y. CPL \u00a7 440.10 alleging that he had not received effective assistance of counsel in the 1979 proceedings. The motion was denied and leave to appeal was denied by the Appellate Division, Second Department, in February, 1985. Nell then filed the present petition in federal district court seeking habeas relief. In his petition, appellant attacks his 1979 conviction claiming that his counsel failed to present evidence which would have established his standing to challenge a search that implicated him in a robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">Nell had already challenged the 1979 robbery conviction in a prior habeas petition filed in 1981, the denial of which we affirmed by summary order. <em>Nell v. Dunham, </em>722 F.2d 728 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 836, 104 S.Ct. 124, 78 L.Ed.2d 121 (1983). In his 1981 petition, insofar as here pertinent, appellant urged that the state had not provided an opportunity for full and fair litigation of his Fourth Amendment claim and that the identification testimony gained as a result of a search of his girlfriend\u2019s apartment should have been suppressed because he was also living in the apartment and therefore had standing to challenge the evidence seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">The Fourth Amendment claim is based upon the following facts. Local police officers entered an apartment \u2014 where Nell lived with his girlfriend \u2014 looking for one Patrick Nolan; the police wanted to arrest Nolan for a parole violation in connection with an unrelated crime. Nolan, Nell and Nell\u2019s girlfriend were all in the apartment. While there, one of the officers obtained a miniature detective shield. Nell says that the detective obtained the shield by an unlawful search, but the State claims that Nell\u2019s girlfriend gave the shield to the officer. In any event, the shield was traced to the victim of a robbery that had occurred several days previously, and the victim identified Nell\u2019s photograph which resulted in his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Following a <em>Wade </em>hearing, the State court denied Nell\u2019s motion to suppress the identification testimony. Nell\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>then moved for the same relief on the ground that the shield had been seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment and that the identification of Nell as the accused followed directly from the illegal search and seizure. But counsel\u2019s written affirmation in support of the motion stated that, at the time the police were searching for drugs and weapons in connection with Nolan\u2019s arrest, Nell had been present in \u201cthe apartment of his girlfriend\u201d. The affirmation failed to allege that Nell lived in the apartment. The motion to suppress was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">In May 1979 Nell pled guilty to a reduced charge of attempted robbery in the second degree. His later motion to vacate the judgment on the ground that his identification had come about from the illegal seizure of the miniature shield was denied. The Appellate Division, Second Department, affirmed his conviction, and the Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">In rejecting Nell\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim in the earlier 1981 habeas proceedings, Judge Sifton concluded that Nell\u2019s allegation of standing to challenge the search as presented to the State court was insufficient as a matter of law, since he had not asserted a property or possessory interest in the apartment. The district court further noted that though Nell now contended that he had been living with his girlfriend for a number of years and thus had a protectible privacy interest, it rejected this argument because Nell had not made this claim in the State court and had shown no cause for the failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">B. <em>Instant Habeas Proceeding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">In the present habeas petition \u2014 filed in March 1985 \u2014 petitioner asserts that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in the 1979 proceedings because his attorney failed to present evidence establishing that he lived in his girlfriend\u2019s apartment. Nell asserts that the district court\u2019s denial of his 1981 habeas petition lends support to his ineffective assistance claim because the district court stated that the State suppression motion was insufficient as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">The district court denied Nell\u2019s current habeas petition on January 23, 1986, finding the petition to be an abuse of the writ. The court held that appellant had failed to raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the 1981 petition, though the facts underlying the claim were known to Nell at that time. The district court found unconvincing Nell\u2019s argument that he had not discovered that his counsel had been ineffective until reading the court\u2019s decision denying his 1981 petition. Moreover, the district judge concluded that the ineffectiveness claim was without merit since Nell had not alleged that he had provided facts which would have put counsel on notice as to the alleged privacy interest. Nonetheless, on February 18, 1986 the district court granted a certificate of probable cause to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">A. Anders <em>Brief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">In <em>Anders, </em>the Supreme Court set forth several rules that govern counsel\u2019s role as an advocate in an appeal which counsel believes to be wholly frivolous, and from which counsel therefore seeks permission to withdraw. The rules also establish an appellate court\u2019s responsibility upon receiving such an application. The request to the court must: \u201cbe accompanied by a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal\u201d; a \u201ccopy of counsel\u2019s brief should be furnished [to] the indigent\u201d in a manner timely enough to permit him to raise <em>pro se </em>any points that he wishes. Upon receiving the application, the court \u2014 not counsel \u2014 decides \u201cwhether the case is wholly frivolous\u201d; the court may then grant the motion to be relieved or \u201cif it finds any of the legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous),\u201d the indigent must be given the assistance of counsel to argue his appeal. 386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. at 1400.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>The purpose of the <em>Anders </em>brief is to assist an appellate court with ready record references and legal authorities in its review of a motion to affirm summarily a district court order or judgment. <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 745, 87 S.Ct. at 1400. Preparing an <em>Anders </em>brief is an important responsibility, one that requires counsel to search the record with care, and then to explain to an appellate court why there are no non-frivolous issues present. The task is not discharged by counsel either employing a too-fertile imagination in an effort to \u201cdream up\u201d new, untested legal theories or by a sophomoric type of report hurriedly prepared a day before the filing deadline. What is required is a good, thorough, lawyer-like piece of work that reveals counsel's conscientious examination, <em>id. </em>at 744, 87 S.Ct. at 1400, of the facts and law involved in appellant\u2019s case. This standard was not met in the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The brief that was filed does not reflect the required \u201cconscientious examination\u201d of Nell\u2019s case. In fact, it does little more than reiterate Judge Sifton\u2019s conclusions in a one and one-half page discussion of possible issues on appeal. In addition, the brief merely paraphrases or quotes \u2014 without acknowledgment \u2014 the district court\u2019s memorandum and order denying the petition, and contains no indication of an independent examination of the record. Thus, the brief that was filed fails to discharge assigned counsel\u2019s responsibilities under <em>Anders v. </em>California.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, Nell alleges in his motion papers that counsel failed to timely provide him with a copy of the brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">B. <em>Dismissal of Habeas Petition for Abuse of the Writ</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">We are not persuaded that this appeal is wholly frivolous. Before reaching what we consider to be a potentially meritorious argument, we first consider the district court\u2019s dismissal of the petition for an abuse of the writ. Rule 9(b) of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases provides that the district court \u201cmay\u201d dismiss a \u201csecond or successive petition\u201d asserting new and different grounds if \u201cthe judge finds that the failure of the petitioner to assert those grounds in a prior petition constituted an abuse of the writ.\u201d 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">In <em>Sanders v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963), the Supreme Court held that a district court, in the exercise of its discretion, could dismiss habeas petitions raising claims determined adversely to the petitioner in a prior petition if \u201cthe ends of justice would not be served by reaching the merits of the subsequent application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15, 16-17, 83 S.Ct. at 1077, 1078. With regard to petitions presenting a new ground for relief not stated in earlier ones, the Court continued, if a petitioner \u201cdeliberately withholds one of two grounds for federal collateral relief at the time of filing his first application\u201d or \u201cdeliberately abandons one of his grounds\u201d at a hearing on the first petition, he will not be entitled to relief. <em>Id. </em>at 18, 83 S.Ct. at 1078. Further, it noted that \u201c[njothing in the traditions of habeas corpus requires the federal courts to tolerate needless piecemeal litigation, or to entertain collateral proceedings whose only purpose is to vex, harass, or delay.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">Other circuits have held that when a petition raises new claims not included in a prior petition it should not be dismissed as an abuse of the writ, unless the failure to include the claims previously is due to inexcusable neglect or to the intentional withholding of the claims. <em>In Re Shriner, </em>735 F.2d 1236, 1240 (11th Cir.1984); <em>McLaughlin v. Gabriel, </em>726 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir.1984); <em>Paprskar v. Estelle, </em>612 F.2d 1003, 1006 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 885, 101 S.Ct. 239, 66 L.Ed.2d 111 (1980). Yet, because the purpose of the great writ is to prevent unlawful imprisonment, it would be unreasonable to deny a prisoner\u2019s attempt to obtain judicial relief where he is unaware of relevant facts affecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>merits of his petition. <em>See Price v. Johnston, </em>334 U.S. 266, 291, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 1062, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948). The writ is not abused therefore when a habeas petitioner is excused for lack of knowledge of the facts, or, if he knows them, his failure to appreciate their legal significance is justifiable. <em>Vaughan v. Estelle, </em>671 F.2d 152, 153 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">There is no indication here that Nell\u2019s failure to raise the ineffective assistance claim in his 1981 petition was the result of deliberate withholding or inexcusable neglect. Although he can be charged with knowing what counsel said about his presence in his girlfriend\u2019s apartment, we think it justifiable that Nell failed to grasp the legal import of not contending that he lived there for the purpose of determining whether he had standing to advance the search and seizure claim. This nuance in Fourth Amendment law is significant to skilled criminal law practitioners, but not to laymen. Nell has met his burden of showing that he has not abused the writ by explaining that he did not understand that he might have an ineffectiveness claim until he read the district court\u2019s opinion denying his 1981 petition. As noted, that decision stated that appellant\u2019s motion in the State court to suppress was as a matter of law insufficient to warrant a hearing where facts might have been more fully developed. It is not unreasonable, for purposes of assessing whether Nell abused the writ, to assume that he may not have grasped the significance of his trial counsel\u2019s failure to assert his residency in the apartment before reading the district court\u2019s decision. Examination of the record on Nell\u2019s appeal before the Appellate Division reveals that Nell's attorney did not argue any of the underlying facts supporting a claim of residency and, therefore, standing. Instead, Nell\u2019s counsel made bland, unsupported assertions that the search occurred in Nell\u2019s house. Thus, we do not assume that Nell compared the two arguments \u2014 the one made at the suppression hearing and the one made on appeal \u2014 and concluded that his trial counsel was deficient in not arguing those facts at the suppression hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Nell\u2019s failure to understand the legal significance of the facts known to him \u2014 that is to say, counsel had not advanced Nell\u2019s residency in the apartment as grounds for standing to challenge the search \u2014 is a credible explanation for his failure to present the claim earlier, especially in light of Nell\u2019s <em>pro se </em>status. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 595, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (per curiam) (allegations in <em>pro se </em>complaint held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by counsel). Thus, the ineffectiveness claim is addressed to specific acts and omissions by counsel and is not merely a disguised attempt to relitigate a Fourth Amendment claim. Moreover, the 1985 petition is only the second filed by Nell. Consequently, the district court erred in dismissing the petition for abuse of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">C. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">We turn now to the claimed violation of Nell\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. The Supreme Court recently affirmed that habeas relief is available for ineffective assistance claims based primarily upon incompetent handling of Fourth Amendment issues. <em>Kimmelman v. Morrison, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 - \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 2582-87, 91 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986). The Court also articulated what a petitioner must establish: \u201cWhere defense counsel\u2019s failure to litigate a Fourth Amendment claim competently is the principal allegation of ineffectiveness, the [petitioner] must also prove that his Fourth Amendment claim is meritorious and that there is a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different absent the excludable evidence in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>demonstrate actual prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2583. Hence, Nell must establish, first, that counsel\u2019s representation was unreasonable under prevailing professional norms and that the challenged action was not sound strategy, <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688-90, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2065-66, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), second, that he had a meritorious Fourth Amendment claim, and, finally, that there is a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different had the objectionable evidence not been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">We turn to a discussion of the first two things that Nell must establish in order to succeed on his petition. We discuss them to make clear why summary disposition of Nell\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is inappropriate. Because Nell\u2019s various allegations present at least a color-able claim and are therefore non-frivolous, we must remand to the district court. We, of course, intimate no view concerning the disposition of Nell\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Nell alleges that counsel did not consult with him concerning the facts of the search prior to moving for suppression of the identification testimony and failed to investigate those facts. Nell\u2019s trial counsel, on the other hand, stated that he had consulted with Nell before the suppression hearing. Nell\u2019s allegation, if true, is relevant because in <em>Strickland, </em>the Court stated that \u201creasonable\u201d representation requires counsel to \u201cmake reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066. Although particular decisions not to investigate \u201cmust be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments\u201d, <em>id., </em>counsel\u2019s alleged failure to investigate the question of Nell\u2019s standing to challenge the search would be unreasonable in light of the critical importance of that issue to the effort to suppress the evidence which led to the identification testimony. Moreover, consultation with Nell would seem to represent a minimal level of investigative effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Even if Nell\u2019s trial counsel had consulted with him before the hearing, Nell still presents a colorable claim of ineffective assistance for his counsel\u2019s failure to <em>assert </em>Nell\u2019s residency during the suppression hearing. Of course, on remand, Nell bears the burden of showing that any failure to assert Nell\u2019s residency in the apartment as grounds for challenging the search was unreasonable and that counsel\u2019s performance was contrary to prevailing professional norms, <em>id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Further, an evidentiary hearing is necessary to determine whether Nell has a Fourth Amendment claim sufficiently meritorious to support a finding of prejudice for counsel\u2019s failure to raise it. The State alleges that Nell\u2019s girlfriend voluntarily surrendered the miniature detective shield to the police, while Nell contends that this evidence was obtained by an illegal search. The question of Nell\u2019s ability to establish prejudice, <em>see Kimmelman, </em>106 S.Ct. at 2583, therefore presents a non-frivolous issue on appeal. Having found the above issues arguable on their merits, it follows that Nell must be given the assistance of counsel to conduct further proceedings in his behalf. <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. at 1400.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Ill CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Accordingly, assigned counsel\u2019s motion to be relieved of representation is granted and the State\u2019s motion for summary affirmance of the order denying habeas relief is denied. Nell\u2019s motion for assignment of new counsel is granted, and the matter is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">Circuit Judge ALTIMARI concurs in part and dissents in part in a separate opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-7\">. In light of that failure, the voucher submitted by assigned counsel for his services has been reduced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-5\">. The dissent acknowledges that standing is an elusive concept for laymen to grasp. But rather than requiring Nell\u2019s lawyer to inquire into the <em>facts </em>underlying his client\u2019s statement \u2014 which any lawyer worth his or her salt should do \u2014 the dissent says that the lawyer should accept the statement at face value. Thus, contrary to its acknowledgement, Nell is made responsible for understanding standing\u2019s nuances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b192-11\">ALTIMARI, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aod\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">I agree wholeheartedly with my colleagues\u2019 concern about the inadequacy of the all-too-typical <em>Anders </em>brief filed in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>case, and thus I concur in Part II-A of the majority opinion. I disagree, however, with the reversal on the merits, and therefore dissent respectfully from Parts II-B and II-C of their decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Judge Sifton rested his denial of Nell\u2019s habeas petition on two grounds. First, he found that the facts underlying Nell\u2019s current ineffective assistance of counsel claim were known to him when he first petitioned for habeas relief, thus rendering his current petition an abuse of the writ. He further concluded that, in any event, Nell failed to allege in this petition that he had advised his trial counsel of his purported residency in the searched apartment, so that trial counsel\u2019s failure to identify the apartment as Nell\u2019s residence could not be considered unreasonable under prevailing norms. Neither conclusion, in my view, can be disturbed without muddying the waters of the law on habeas corpus procedure and on ineffective assistance of counsel claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The majority\u2019s reversal on the first ground rests on its rejection of Judge Sifton\u2019s finding that Nell knew about the basis for the denial of his trial court suppression motion. The state court record, however, demonstrates that the prosecutor opposed that motion on standing grounds, pointing to the fact that it was Nell\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s apartment that was searched. The record also shows that on direct appeal to the Appellate Division, Nell\u2019s argument shifted: appellate counsel identified the apartment as Nell\u2019s own residence in his appellate brief. The state\u2019s brief on appeal, on the other hand, again focused on Nell\u2019s failure to assert either a proprietary or possessory interest in his girlfriend\u2019s apartment. The shift in Nell\u2019s presentation of the facts underlying his fourth amendment claim, and the prosecutor\u2019s insistence that Nell did not reside in the searched premises, show that even during his state appeal, Nell had to be aware that trial counsel\u2019s purported failure to assert Nell\u2019s residency in the apartment had led to the denial of the suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Unlike the majority, I see no possible basis for crediting Nell\u2019s assertion that he became aware of the legal significance of trial counsel\u2019s conduct only upon reading Judge Sifton\u2019s opinion denying his first habeas petition. I fail to see how Judge Sifton\u2019s indication that the suppression motion was insufficient as a matter of law could suddenly highlight the alleged inadequacy of trial counsel\u2019s performance, when the supposedly inaccurate version of the facts presented by trial counsel had been the focal point of the proceedings in the state courts. Thus, although I agree with the majority that the nuances surrounding standing to raise fourth amendment claims are difficult for laymen to understand, I cannot agree that, on this record, Nell\u2019s delay in arguing the constitutional inadequacy of trial counsel\u2019s performance is excusable. Eather, I am convinced that the course of litigation in state court more than adequately supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Nell knew or reasonably should have known, at the time he filed his first petition, that the question of his residency in the searched apartment was a crucial factor in the state courts\u2019 rejection of his fourth amendment claim. His failure to raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim at that time, therefore, is inexcusable.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">The majority\u2019s treatment of the merits of Nell\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, in my view, goes beyond the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that defense counsel must \u201cmake reasonable investigation\u201d into potentially relevant facts. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The majority, in my view, ignores reality and stands the attorney-client relationship on its head when it holds that counsel was obligated to inquire about whether the apartment identified as Nell\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s could instead be represented as Nell\u2019s own residence. The state court record demonstrates that counsel did consult with his client prior to filing the motion to suppress. In fact, trial counsel affirmed, \u201c[b]ased on conversations [he had] with the defendant,\u201d that the arresting officers unlawfully \u201cen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>tered the apartment of [Nell\u2019s] girlfriend.\u201d The attorney\u2019s affirmation indicates that Nell himself identified the apartment as his girlfriend\u2019s home. Counsel, acting reasonably and professionally, would and should accept his client\u2019s word as to where he resided at the time of the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The majority\u2019s conclusion that trial counsel\u2019s alleged conduct was unreasonable in effect imposes on defense attorneys the obligation to explore the possibility of exaggerating their clients\u2019 interest in searched premises. The <em>Strickland </em>Court\u2019s reaffirmation of counsel\u2019s duty to make reasonable inquiries, <em>see </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, does not mandate that counsel initiate such a discussion. Judge Sifton\u2019s treatment of this issue\u2014 placing on Nell the burden to show that he somehow suggested to trial counsel the possibility of claiming a resident\u2019s interest in his girlfriend\u2019s apartment \u2014 more accurately reflects both the reality of attorney-client relationships and the role that defense counsel should fulfill as advocates in criminal proceedings. Applying the guidelines set out in <em>Strickland v. Washington, supra, </em>I would agree with the district court\u2019s determination that at the time of trial, counsel had no reason to represent the apartment as Nell\u2019s own residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">For these reasons, I concur in the majority\u2019s discussion of the inadequacy of counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief, but I would affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Nell\u2019s second habeas petition. More specifically, I agree with the lower court both that this second petition is an abuse of the writ and that Nell has not alleged a sufficient factual basis to support his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
