Under the Act, the states receive federal funds to provide special education services. Procedures and standards for school districts to use in providing the special education services required under the Act are established by the states.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-11\">Born in 1968, Gregory K. entered kindergarten in the Longview public schools in the fall of 1973. He repeated kindergarten during the school year 1974-75. In October 1974, Gregory was referred to the District\u2019s Special Education Department for evaluation, including an IQ test on which he scored 85.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that time, students were eligible for special education only with IQ scores below 75, so Gregory remained in a regular classroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-12\">In January 1976, while Gregory was in first grade, the District again assessed him for special education. He was found eligible, scoring 70 on an IQ test. The District developed an \u201cindividual education plan\u201d for Gregory that recommended placing him in an \u201ceducable handicapped classroom,\u201d a program for mildly retarded students. Gregory\u2019s parents consented to placing him in this class. In June 1976, the District reevaluated his special education placement. Based on an IQ test score of 69 and his school performance, the District recommended that Gregory continue in the special education class. According to his parents, however, Gregory was unhappy and not learning in the class, so they chose to have him repeat first grade in a regular class during the 1976-77 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-15\">During 1977-78 and 1978-79, Gregory was in regular second and third grade classes. He had great difficulties, and in May 1979 the District again assessed Gregory. His IQ was 69 and his academic performance was less than half the expected grade level. The parents had Gregory tested by Dr. Loveland, a clinical psychologist. The results of his testing were consistent with those of the District\u2019s testing, but he advised the parents against placing Gregory in a special education class for mildly retarded children. The parents again refused the District\u2019s placement. For the next two school years, 1979-80 and 1980-81, the parents placed Gregory in regular classrooms in a private school.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-16\">In the summer of 1981, Lois Lewis, an employee of the District\u2019s Indian Education Program, began tutoring Gregory. The parents believed that under her tutoring Gregory\u2019s learning progress increased. When they re-enrolled Gregory in the District in the fall of 1981, they asked that the tutoring continue. The principal of Gregory\u2019s school agreed, but advised the parents that the District could offer a special education program more appropriate for Gregory than the tutoring alone. In the summer of 1982, Dr. Levinson, a neurologist, examined Gregory. Although he did not use an IQ test, he concluded that Gregory was dyslexic, not mildly retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-17\">The Indian Education Program in which Lois Lewis worked as a tutor was reorganized in 1982-83, and she resigned. In February 1983, the District told the parents that a new tutor would begin working with Gregory. The parents alleged that this change constituted a change of placement in violation of the Act\u2019s \u201cstatus quo\u201d provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>sion. They alleged that the proposed new tutor was not qualified as a special education teacher and that he would not be giving Gregory as much individual tutoring as he had received from Mrs. Lewis. The parents requested a hearing and removed Gregory from school for three hours each day to be tutored privately by Lois Lewis. They paid for this tutoring themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-4\">The District again offered to assess Gregory for special education. After a dispute over testing was resolved, Gregory\u2019s IQ was found to be 66 and his academic performance in all areas was less than three-fourths the expected grade level. The parents disputed the District\u2019s conclusion that these results satisfied the state\u2019s criteria for \u201cmildly mentally retarded.\u201d They believed that Gregory had not been properly tested for learning disabilities. The parents rejected the District\u2019s \u201cindividual education program\u201d for Gregory based on this assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-5\">In August of 1983, a hearing was held on this dispute. The parents and the District agreed to an interim schedule for Gregory. The schedule followed the District\u2019s 1983 IEP and included a mix of regular and special education classes, plus an hour of private tutoring each school day. The parents refused to accept any District tutors, however, and again removed Gregory from school for three hours of tutoring by Lois Lewis every day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-6\">On December 7,1983, the hearing officer issued findings of fact and conclusions of law, affirming all the District's actions. He ruled that an appropriate schedule for Gregory was four periods of regular education classes and two hours of special education classes per day. The state Superintendent of Public Instruction upheld these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-7\">The parents appealed to federal district court. After a bench trial on August 23, 1985, the court ruled: (1) that Gregory K. was not \u201cmildly mentally retarded,\u201d but had a learning disability; (2) that the District\u2019s proposed placement was inappropriate; (3) that the tutoring arrangement begun in 1981 was \u201cspecial education\u201d under an appropriate \u201cindividual education program\u201d; and (4) that the District violated the Act by improperly changing the tutoring program in 1983. The trial court ordered the District to grant Gregory academic credit for the tutoring and to reimburse Gregory\u2019s parents for the tutoring they had paid for themselves. The court denied the District\u2019s post-trial motions to dismiss damage claims and to require a three-year reassessment of Gregory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-11\">The Court of Appeals reviews the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>Burlington Northern, Inc. v. Weyerhaeuser Co., </em>719 F.2d 304, 307 (9th Cir.1983). \u201cA finding of fact is deemed clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even where, as here, the district court relies on a written record of administrative proceedings, the clearly erroneous standard applies to findings of fact. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1396-12\">The Court of Appeals reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Id. </em>Unless a mixed question of fact and law is primarily factual, we review mixed questions <em>de novo. United States v. McConney, </em>728 F.2d 1195, 1199-1204 (9th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 824, 105 S.Ct. 101, 83 L.Ed.2d 46 (1984). For example, whether the school district\u2019s proposed IEP was a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d as required by the Education for All Handicapped Children Act is a mixed question that we review <em>de novo. Wilson v. Marana Unified School District, </em>735 F.2d 1178, 1181 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Department of Education, State of Hawaii v. Katherine D., </em>727 F.2d 809, 814 n. 2 (9th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1117, 105 S.Ct. 2360, 86 L.Ed.2d 260 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-13\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-14\">DEFERENCE TO STATE ADMINISTRATIVE FINDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-15\">The District contends that the trial court failed to give proper weight to the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>administrative findings in this dispute. Because the key issues are matters that we review <em>de novo, </em>we need not consider how much weight the trial court gave or ought to have given to the administrative findings. Instead, we address this issue to determine how much weight we are to give the administrative findings on those matters that we review <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1397-5\">As the Supreme Court has held, courts must give \u201cdue weight\u201d to judgments of education policy when they review state hearings under 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e). <em>Hendrick Hudson Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Rowley, </em>458 U.S. 176, 206, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 3050, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982). Citing <em>Rowley, </em>we have held that \u201ccourts should not substitute their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities which they review.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Marana Unified School Dist., </em>735 F.2d 1178, 1183 (9th Cir.1984). How <em>much </em>deference to give state educational agencies, however, is a matter for the discretion of the courts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1397-6\">The traditional test of findings being binding on the court if supported by substantial evidence, or even a preponderance of the evidence, does not apply. This does not mean, however, that the findings can be ignored. The court, in recognition of the expertise of the administrative agency, must consider the findings carefully and endeavor to respond to the hearing officer\u2019s resolution of each material issue. After such consideration, the court is free to accept or reject the findings in part or in whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1397-7\"><em>Town of Burlington v. Dept. of Ed., </em>736 F.2d 773, 792 (1st Cir.1984), <em>aff'd, </em>471 U.S. 359, 105 S.Ct. 1996, 85 L.Ed.2d 385 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-9\">ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-10\">The District challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling that \u201cGregory K. has a learning disability\u201d and \u201cis not mentally retarded.\u201d This is a mixed question of law and fact. The undisputed facts are the results of much testing Gregory received over the years from the District and from experts consulted by his parents. We apply to these facts the state regulations for determining eligibility for special education under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-12\">Students are eligible for special education under the Act if they have any of several handicaps as defined by state regulations. Washington regulations define a \u201cspecific learning disability\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0t\">a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or using spoken or written language resulting from perceptual-motor handicaps____ The presence of a specific learning disability is indicated by near average, average, or above average intellectual ability, but nonetheless, the student demonstrates significant performance deficits in one or more ... academic achievement areas____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1397-16\"><em>Provided, </em>That such a performance deficit cannot be explained by ... mental retardation____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1397-17\">A specific learning disability includes conditions described as ... dyslexia ...: <em>Provided, </em>That the student meets the eligibility criteria set forth in WAC 392-171-411 and 392-171-416.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1397-18\">WAC 392-171-406 (1983) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-19\">Turning to the \u201celigibility criteria,\u201d we find a threshold requirement of \u201ca standardized individual test designed to measure intellectual functioning,\u201d an IQ test of the sort Gregory was given many times. WAC 392-171-411. This is the same threshold requirement for determining mental retardation. <em>See </em>WAC 392-171-421(l)(a). What distinguishes the eligibility criteria for a learning disability from those for mental retardation is that the \u201cmeasured level of intellectual functioning\u201d of a student suspected of having a learning disability \u201cmust be near normal or above.\u201d WAC 392-171-411. Thus, Dr. Levinson\u2019s diagnosis of dyslexia, even if accurate, is not by itself enough to meet the criteria for a learning disability. The \u201celigibility criteria\u201d for mild mental retardation are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>Intellectual functioning (IQ) range from approximately 51 through 75 and the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1398-4\">(i) Academic functioning equal to three-fourths or less of chronological age/grade; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1398-5\">(ii) Adaptive behavior equal to three-fourths or less chronological age/grade.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1398-6\">WAC 392-171-421(2)(a) (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-7\">The record provides no support for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Gregory had a learning disability, not mild retardation, as defined in the above regulations. None of Gregory\u2019s IQ scores is in the \u201cnear average, average, or above average\u201d range. Only the first of Gregory\u2019s IQ tests resulted in a score above 75.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That score was deemed less reliable by school psychologists because Gregory was only six at the time. In Gregory\u2019s subsequent testing, the resulting IQ scores are consistent: IQ of 70 in 1975; 69 in 1976; 69 in 1979; 69 in 1982; and 66 in 1983.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> All of these scores are within the mildly retarded range.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-8\">The 1979 testing by Dr. Loveland, the parents' witness, is consistent with the District\u2019s evidence as to Gregory\u2019s intellectual functioning. Dr. Loveland\u2019s report at the time stated that \u201cthe total results of the evaluation are indicative of a generally low potential across most areas assessed rather than it being indicative of any serious or specific learning disability as such.\u201d Dr. Loveland\u2019s <em>subjective </em>conclusion was that Gregory would not benefit from placement in a special education class. But the state regulations require classification on the basis of objective data.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-9\">In addition to an IQ in the 51-75 range, the eligibility criteria for the mildly retarded classification include deficient academic and adaptive behavior. Th\u00e9 District offered evidence that Gregory was at or below three-fourths of grade level in all areas. The parents did not challenge the District\u2019s evidence as to Gregory\u2019s academic performance. The 1983 testing by Dr. Loveland, their witness, showed academic performance in all areas at or below three-fourths of grade level. The parents also did not dispute that Gregory\u2019s adaptive behavior met the criteria for mild retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-13\">The trial court offers no factual or legal explanation for its ruling that Gregory K. is learning disabled rather than mildly mentally retarded. We are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction\u201d that the trial court erred in its weighing of the evidence regarding Gregory\u2019s IQ testing. The only test result above 75 was an early, less reliable test. Dr. Levinson, the expert witness who testified that Gregory was dyslexic and not mildly retarded, did not give Gregory an IQ test. The objective testing done by the family\u2019s other expert witness, Dr. Loveland, corroborated the District\u2019s testing results. These facts fail to support the threshold eligibility criterion for a ruling that Gregory is learning disabled. Applying the state\u2019s regulations to these facts as we must, we hold that Gregory\u2019s eligibility for special education was correctly based on mild mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-14\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-15\">THE EXISTENCE OF AN INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PROGRAM</p>\n<p id=\"AkB\">Gregory K. was eligible for special education under the Act. The District does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>not dispute this. He was first found eligible in 1976 and will remain eligible until he graduates from high school, turns 21, or no longer needs special education. <em>See </em>WAC 392-171-331(1). The parents\u2019 rejection of certain special education classes does not determine whether Lois Lewis\u2019s tutoring was \u201cspecial education\u201d as defined by the Act. On the other hand, Gregory\u2019s eligibility for special education under the Act does not mean that whatever services he received from the District were automatically \u201cspecial education\u201d entitled to protection under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-4\">The key question is whether Gregory\u2019s education in the District at the time of this dispute was being provided under \u201can individualized education program.\u201d \u201cFree appropriate public education\u201d as mandated by the Act is properly defined by state regulation to mean \u201cspecial education and required services which ... [a]re provided in conformity with an individualized education program which meet [sic] the requirements of WAC 392-171-461.\u201d WAC 392-171-310(l)(c). The trial court ruled that such an IEP \u201cwas in place for Gregory K. from September 1981, through February 1983.\u201d This was the period during which Gregory was enrolled in the District, attending regular non-academic classes and being tutored in all academic subjects by Lois Lewis. The existence of an IEP was necessary to the trial court\u2019s further determinations that this program was an \u201cappropriate\u201d placement for Gregory, that the District acted improperly in changing this placement in February 1983, and that the parents were entitled to reimbursement for their expenses in maintaining the placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-5\">Although denominated a finding of fact, the court\u2019s ruling on this issue involves a mixed question of law and fact. The law we must apply to the facts of the ease is the regulatory prescription for an IEP:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjsL\">(1) Each handicapped student\u2019s individualized education program shall be developed on the basis of assessment analysis and parent input, where it is provided, and shall include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1399-6\">(a) A statement of the student\u2019s present levels of educational performance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1399-7\">(b) A statement of specific annual goals including short-term instructional objectives .. .;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1399-8\">(c) A statement of the specific special education and related services needed by the student, and the extent to which the student will be able to participate in the regular educational program ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1399-9\">(d) The projected dates for the initiation of services and the anticipated duration of the services; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1399-10\">(e) Appropriate objective criteria and evaluation procedures and schedules for determining, on at least an annual basis, whether the short-term instructional objectives are being met.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1399-11\">WAC 392-171-461.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-12\">The trial court gave no factual or legal basis for its ruling that an IEP was in place from September 1981 through February 1983. The parents argue that several documents in the record contained the functional elements of an IEP. One of these is a letter from the school counselor to the parents acknowledging their request that Lois Lewis continue tutoring Gregory. The other is a memo from Lewis to the parents summarizing her goals for Gregory. Lewis\u2019s memo cited no \u201cassessment analysis\u201d as the basis for her work with Gregory; none of the District\u2019s special education personnel familiar with past assessments of Gregory were involved in preparing the memo. Moreover, there was no statement of the extent to which Gregory could participate in regular classes, or what those regular classes should be. There was no statement as to the anticipated duration of the tutoring. There was no statement as to the objective criteria and procedures for determining whether Lewis\u2019s goals for Gregory were being met. In short, the memo upon which the parents relied failed to meet the comprehensive requirements of an IEP.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-13\">The parents also argue that even if these documents are inadequate for an IEP, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>District should be estopped from denying the existence of an IEP because it permitted the parents to believe that Gregory was receiving special education. The parents cite some \u201cIEP\u201d forms from the fall of 1982, but those were only for speech therapy, not for a full assessment. There is no evidence that the District believed or led the parents to believe that Lewis\u2019s tutoring was a special education placement pursuant to an IEP.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-4\">At oral argument, the parents contended that an IEP from January 1976 applied to the tutoring Gregory was receiving from Lois Lewis. We understand but reject this contention. That IEP prescribed no tutoring such as Lois Lewis provided. Instead it recommended placing Gregory in an \u201ceducable handicapped classroom.\u201d Gregory was placed in such a class for awhile, but his parents eventually asked that he be returned to a regular classroom. The 1976 IEP establishes that Gregory was \u2014 and still is \u2014 eligible for special education. It does not, however, provide protection under the Act for the tutoring Gregory received from Lois Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-5\">The program of non-academic classes and academic tutoring that Gregory received from September 1981 through February 1983 was not under an \u201cindividualized education program\u201d as prescribed by the Act and by state regulation. Because Gregory\u2019s tutoring program was not special education pursuant to an IEP, we need not decide whether the District\u2019s actions in February 1983 constituted a change of placement. The \u201cstatus quo\u201d provisions of the Act apply only to special education received pursuant to an IEP. <em>See Zvi D. v. Ambach, </em>694 F.2d 904, 906 (2d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-7\">AN APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-8\">Although we have held that the District did not improperly change Gregory\u2019s placement in February 1983, we must also decide whether the placement proposed by the District later that year was \u201cappropriate.\u201d The trial court ruled that the placement was not appropriate. The trial court gave no factual or legal basis for its ruling on this issue. This issue more than most others in the case involves educational policy. The \u201cdue weight\u201d that courts must give to the state education agency\u2019s findings on matters of educational policy should prompt courts in the future to provide a more thorough explanation when reversing an agency\u2019s ruling on the appropriateness of a special education placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the appropriateness of a special education placement. <em>Wilson v. Marana Unified School District, </em>735 F.2d 1178, 1181 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Department of Education, State of Hawaii v. Katherine D., </em>727 F.2d 809, 814 n. 2 (9th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1117, 105 S.Ct. 2360, 86 L.Ed.2d 260 (1985). An \u201cappropriate\u201d public education does not mean the absolutely best or \u201cpotential-maximizing\u201d education for the individual child. <em>See Hendrick Hudson Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Rowley, </em>458 U.S. 176, 197 n. 21, 200, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 3046 n. 21, 3047, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982). The states are obliged to provide \u201ca basic floor of opportunity\u201d through a program \u201cindividually designed to provide educational benefit to the handicapped child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201, 102 S.Ct. at 3048. Gregory\u2019s parents believe emphatically that Lois Lewis\u2019s tutoring has helped him learn. Our <em>de novo </em>review, however, must focus primarily on the District\u2019s proposed placement, not on the alternative that the family preferred. Even if the tutoring were better for Gregory than the District\u2019s proposed placement, that would not necessarily mean that the placement was inappropriate. We must uphold the appropriateness of the District\u2019s placement if it was reasonably calculated to provide Gregory with educational benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-11\">We have already held that the District correctly assessed Gregory as mildly mentally retarded, as that handicap is defined by state regulation. We therefore must reject the parents\u2019 blanket contention that any placement based on that assessment had to be inappropriate. Evidence in the record demonstrates that the District\u2019s pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>posed placement was designed to match the strengths and weaknesses that emerged from testing of Gregory\u2019s achievement. The District\u2019s April 1983 assessment recommended that Gregory be placed in regular non-academic classes, such as physical education, and in special education classes where he could work at his achievement levels in various academic subjects. Because his math computation abilities were near average, the report stated that a \u201cmainstream basic math course\u201d might be more appropriate than a special education program in math. The IEP based on this assessment set forth specific, realistic goals in all subjects based on his varied achievement levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-5\">The District\u2019s IEP reflects the Act\u2019s preference for the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d program for handicapped students. <em>See </em>WAC 392-171-471. The District\u2019s assessment and IEP, corroborated by Dr. Loveland\u2019s 1983 testing, also support the District\u2019s longstanding concern that in Lewis\u2019s individual tutoring, which emphasized rote learning, the more mechanical aspects of Gregory\u2019s language and math skills were developing. But other, more complex intellectual skills were not developing. His ability to recognize and spell individual words, for example, was considerably greater than his general reading comprehension and writing ability. The District\u2019s placement included classes, albeit small special education classes, where he could develop intellectual skills requiring synthesis, especially verbal reasoning and comprehension in both speaking and writing. This record establishes that the District\u2019s proposed placement was reasonably calculated to provide educational benefits for Gregory and was therefore an \u201cappropriate\u201d public education under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-7\">REIMBURSEMENT, COSTS, AND ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-8\">Where a school district improperly changes a special education placement or proposes an inappropriate placement, courts may order the district to reimburse parents who pay to maintain an appropriate placement. <em>Burlington School Committee v. Department of Education, </em>471 U.S. 359, 105 S.Ct. 1996, 2003, 85 L.Ed.2d 385 (1985). We have held that the District\u2019s proposed placement was \u201cappropriate\u201d and that the private tutoring Gregory\u2019s parents paid for was not special education pursuant to an IEP. We therefore reverse the trial court\u2019s order that the District reimburse Gregory K.\u2019s parents for their tutoring expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-10\">The parents are no longer the prevailing party under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d), so we also reverse the trial court\u2019s grant of costs. Not having prevailed, the parents are not eligible for attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See </em>Handicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act of 1986, Pub.L. 99-372 \u00a7 2, 100 Stat. 796 (1986) (to be codified at 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e)(4)(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-11\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-12\">MANDATORY REASSESSMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-13\">The trial court denied the District\u2019s post-trial motion to compel testing of Gregory. The District argues that it must reassess Gregory \u201cat least once every three years.\u201d WAC 392-171-516. If the parents want Gregory to receive special education under the Act, they are obliged to permit such testing. <em>See DuBois v. Connecticut State Bd. of Ed., </em>727 F.2d 44, 48 (2d Cir.1984); <em>Carroll v. Capalbo, </em>563 F.Supp. 1053, 1058 (D.R.I.1983). If the parents wish to maintain Gregory in his current private tutoring program, however, the District cannot require a reassessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-14\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-15\">CREDIT FOR TUTORING</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-16\">In its order of May 16, 1986, the trial court ordered the District to \u201cissue and record full scholastic credit for all work completed by Gregory K. under the tutelage of Lois Lewis after February 11,1983, to the present day.\u201d The District, not the court, decides this question, unless the court can determine from the record that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>the District has varied from its usual standards in denying such credit. Nothing in the record supports such a finding. We therefore reverse the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-4\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1395-13\">. The correct scaled score for this test may have been 80 rather than 85. See notes 2 and 3 below for a more complete discussion of evidence in the record concerning Gregory\u2019s IQ testing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1398-10\">. This was also the only time Gregory was given the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test. It was given in 1974, when Gregory was six. The school psychologist evaluating the results noted at the time that they were \"well within the Low Average ranges of ability.\" The \"derived score\u201d computed from the results was 85. Unrebutted testimony by one of the District\u2019s psychologists indicated that out-of-date norms had been used in computing the score. Using the correct norms would have produced a derived score of 80.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1398-11\">. Subsequent IQ testing of Gregory was done chiefly by using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), though somewhat different versions were used at different times. In 1975, Gregory was given a full WISC, resulting in a scaled score of 70. In 1976, he was given a partial WISC, resulting in a prorated score of 69. In 1979, he was given a full WISC (revised format), resulting in a scaled score of 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-17\">In 1982, Gregory was given the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Abilities, which produces, among other results, a \u201ccognitive skills index\u201d that is comparable to scaled IQ scores. His CSI was 69. In 1983, Gregory was again given a full WISC (revised format), resulting in a scaled score of 66.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
