Under the FSIA, a district court may entertain a civil action against a foreign state only if the foreign state lacks immunity under the Act\u2019s prescriptions, <em>i.e., </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1605-1607, or under an international agreement. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sovereign immunity under the FSIA is thus a gateway issue, not simply a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1545\">*1545</page-number>plea in defense to a claim: if the foreign state is entitled to immunity with respect to the claim asserted, then the district court lacks both subject matter and personal jurisdiction, and must dismiss the case. <em>Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, </em>461 U.S. 480, 493 n. 20, 103 S.Ct. 1962, 1971 n. 20, 76 L.Ed.2d 81 (1983); <em>De Sanchez v. Banco Central de Nicaragua, </em>770 F.2d 1385, 1389-90 (5th Cir.1985); <em>MOL, Inc. v. Peoples Republic of Bangladesh, </em>736 F.2d 1326, 1328 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1037, 105 S.Ct. 513, 83 L.Ed.2d 403 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1631-4\">The parties to the instant lawsuit are plaintiff-appellant Practical Concepts, Inc. (PCI), a private enterprise organized and operating in the United States, and defendant-appellee Republic of Bolivia (Bolivia). PCI alleged Bolivia\u2019s breach of a technical assistance and consulting services contract. Signed in August 1979, the contract-in-suit called for PCI\u2019s services in designing and implementing a comprehensive program for development of Bolivia\u2019s rural areas. The contract was to continue for a period of three years; while PCI and Bolivia were the sole contracting parties, funding for the venture came from the United States Agency for International Development (AID). In May 1981, Bolivia received notice that AID would no longer fund the contract. That same month, Bolivia terminated the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1631-5\">On December 30, 1982, PCI filed a complaint in the district court charging Bolivia with unlawful termination of the contract. Bolivia, by telegram addressed to PCI\u2019s counsel, acknowledged receipt of process, but did not otherwise respond to PCI\u2019s complaint. On July 28, 1983, the district court entered a default judgment against Bolivia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1631-6\">Over a year later, PCI commenced execution proceedings. Bolivia then moved, under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for relief from the judgment. Among several asserted grounds for relief, Bolivia claimed immunity, as a foreign sovereign, from suit in any court in the United States. The district court granted the motion, vacated the default judgment, and dismissed the action on the ground that the governing FSIA provisions, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1604-1605, shielded Bolivia from PCI\u2019s lawsuit. <em>Practical Concepts, Inc. v. Republic of Bolivia, </em>613 F.Supp. 863, <em>recon. denied, </em>615 F.Supp. 92 (D.D.C.1985). Having ruled dispositively on the threshold jurisdictional issue, the district court did not reach Bolivia\u2019s alternate pleas, including, <em>inter alia, </em>the argument that the court should abstain from entertaining PCI\u2019s complaint in deference to the arbitration clause in the contract. 613 F.Supp. at 865 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1631-9\">On appeal, PCI initially contends that the default judgment should have remained closed. We find this contention insubstantial and hold that the district court, in view of Rule 60(b)(4) and (6), properly allowed full consideration of Bolivia\u2019s jurisdictional objection. More prominently, PCI maintains that this case fits within the \u201ccommercial activity\u201d exception to the rule according foreign sovereigns immunity from suit, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(2) (set out <em>infra </em>pp. 1548-1549). We conclude that the district court improperly rejected application of that exception. Nonetheless, we do not instruct immediate reinstatement of the default judgment. Instead, we remand the case so that the district judge may consider Bolivia\u2019s alternate pleas, particularly Bolivia\u2019s defense based on the arbitration clause of the contract between PCI and Bolivia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1631-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1631-11\">PCI urges two reasons why the district court should not have entertained Bolivia\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1546\">*1546</page-number>motion for relief from the judgment entered July 28, 1983 upon Bolivia\u2019s default. First, in a telegram addressed to PCI\u2019s counsel, Bolivia acknowledged receipt of the complaint and notice of suit; PCI regards the telegram as \u201cthe functional equivalent of an appearance.\u201d Brief of Appellant at 9. Second, PCI asserts that Bolivia should not be allowed to mount a collateral attack on the judgment because Bolivia deliberately bypassed \u201cnumerous opportunities to challenge the ... facts upon which the court\u2019s jurisdiction depended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Neither reason supplies cause for ruling the 60(b) motion out of order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1632-4\">The telegram PCI features was dispatched from Bolivia on February 24, 1983 by a Bolivian engineer, subsecretary at Bolivia\u2019s Ministry of Planning and Coordination. The addressee, who received the telegram the next day, is the attorney whose signature appears on PCI\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The message, running less than five lines, acknowledges receipt of pleadings and refers to the governance of the laws of Bolivia, as stated in \u201cGeneral Provisions\u201d appended to the contract between Bolivia and PCI.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1632-13\">The telegram, we note, does not appear to have been composed or translated by individuals conversant with the dissimilar legal systems of Bolivia and the United States. Overlooking the perils of converting the legal terms and concepts of one system into those of another,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> PCI insists that the telegram not only shows \u201cBolivia\u2019s consent to the court\u2019s jurisdiction to decide the jurisdictional issues,\u201d Brief of Appellant at 22, it even \u201crequests] a trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9, 17, 21; Reply Brief of Appellant at 2, 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1632-14\">Nothing in or between the lines of the telegram sustains PCI\u2019s imaginative rendition. The district judge properly comprehended the telegram as simply an \u201cacknowledgement of receipt of service,\u201d not, as PCI pretended, \u201ca general appearance.\u201d <em>Practical Concepts, Inc., </em>613 F.Supp. at 867 n. 6.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1547\">*1547</page-number>Turning to PCI\u2019s second position, that Bolivia cannot now challenge the district court\u2019s jurisdiction because it passed up \u201cnumerous opportunities\u201d to do so, we again uphold the ruling of the district judge. A defendant who knows of an action but believes the court lacks jurisdiction over his person or over the subject matter generally has an election. He may appear, raise the jurisdictional objection, and ultimately pursue it on direct appeal. If he so elects, he may not renew the jurisdictional objection in a collateral attack. <em>See, e.g., Durfee v. Duke, </em>375 U.S. 106, 84 S.Ct. 242, 11 L.Ed.2d 186 (1963); <em>Baldwin v. Iowa State Traveling Men\u2019s Ass\u2019n, </em>283 U.S. 522, 51 S.Ct. 517, 75 L.Ed. 1244 (1931). Should he proceed this way, he may defend on the merits in the district court without losing his right to press on direct review the jurisdictional objection, along with objections on the merits. <em>See, e.g., Baldwin, </em>283 U.S. at 525, 51 S.Ct. at 518; <em>Hassler, Inc. v. Shaw, </em>271 U.S. 195, 200, 46 S.Ct. 479, 480, 70 L.Ed. 900 (1926); <em>Vilter Mfg. Co. v. Rolaff, </em>110 F.2d 491, 495 (8th Cir.1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-4\">Alternatively, the defendant may refrain from appearing, thereby exposing himself to the risk of a default judgment. When enforcement of the default judgment is attempted, however, he may assert his jurisdictional objection. If he prevails on the objection, the default judgment will be vacated. If he loses on the jurisdictional issue, on the other hand, his day in court is normally over; as a consequence of deferring the jurisdictional challenge, he ordinarily forfeits his right to defend on the merits. As set out in Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 65 comment b (1982): \u201cWhen [a] person [named as a defendant] kn[o]w[s] about the action but perceive[s] that the court lack[s] territorial or subject matter jurisdiction, he is given a right to ignore the proceeding at his own risk but to suffer no detriment if his assessment proves correct.\u201d <em>See also Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, </em>456 U.S. 694, 706, 102 S.Ct. 2099, 2106, 72 L.Ed.2d 492 (1982) (\u201cA defendant is always free to ignore the judicial proceedings, risk a default judgment, and then challenge that judgment on jurisdictional grounds in a collateral proceeding.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-9\">In sum, PCI has recited inapposite precedent,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but not a single decision that casts genuine doubt on the district court\u2019s determination: Bolivia could \u201cwait [ ] until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1548\">*1548</page-number>after execution of the judgment was under way to raise its jurisdictional point,\u201d so long as it bore \u201cthe risks associated with that tactic.\u201d <em>Practical Concepts, Inc., </em>613 F.Supp. at 866. Bolivia undertook the risks \u2014\u201cthe inconvenience of having [its] assets subjected to judicial process\u201d following the entry of the default judgment, and the prospect that it might \u201clos[e] [its] chance to argue the merits of the suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 866 n. 4. Having concluded that the district court correctly entertained Bolivia\u2019s post-judgment jurisdictional objection, we turn to the question whether that court correctly upheld the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1634-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1634-5\">The district court, after it vacated the default judgment against Bolivia, ordered PCI\u2019s case \u201cdismissed for lack of subject matter and personal jurisdiction with prejudice.\u201d <em>Practical Concepts, Inc., </em>613 F.Supp. at 873. For the activity in question, the district court held, Bolivia was \u201centitled to sovereign immunity under the FSIA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 867, 869-72.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Immunity applied, the district court reasoned, because the contract between Bolivia and PCI included \u201cnumerous terms which only a sovereign state could perform, and which no private firm or individual going into the market place could ever offer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 869. Denying PCI\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the district court stated: \u201cWhere, as here, a state exempts a private party from taxation, grants preferential bureaucratic treatment, and diplomatic privileges, it is acting in a sovereign [as distinguished from a commercial] capacity.\u201d <em>Practical Concepts, Inc., </em>615 F.Supp. at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b1634-11\">We think the district court misperceived the legislature\u2019s intention when the court focused on auxiliary provisions rather than on the agreement\u2019s core to classify the contract at issue as \u201cgovernmental\u201d rather than \u201ccommercial.\u201d It is more sensible, and faithful to the probable intent of Congress, we believe, generally to center on the basic exchange <em>{e.g., </em>the sale of goods or services), not on the facilitating features <em>{e.g., </em>expediting entrance of personnel and supplies), in determining whether an obligation qualifies as a \u201ccommercial activity\u201d for FSIA purposes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1634-12\">Although we conclude that the PCI-Bolivia contract does fall within the \u201ccommercial activity\u201d category, we also find compelling reasons to relieve Bolivia from the ordinary operation of the default judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6). We therefore remand the case to the district court for consideration of the defenses raised by Bolivia which the district court did not reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1634-13\">The FSIA provides that foreign states shall be immune from suit in federal and state courts except in specified circumstances. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If an exception to the main rule of sovereign immunity applies, then the FSIA confers subject matter jurisdiction on the district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The prime exception to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1549\">*1549</page-number>the main rule appears in \u00a7 1605(a)(2); this exception concerns \u201ccommercial activity\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj-4\">(a) A foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the United States or of the States in any case\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1635-4\">(2) in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state; or upon an act performed in the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere; or upon an act outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the United States[.]<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxY\">When a plaintiff invokes the exception, the court confronts a classification question: Is the activity upon which the action is based properly typed \u201ccommercial\u201d rather than \u201cgovernmental\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b1635-5\">Congress, in an FSIA definition section, \u00a7 1603(d), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1635-6\">A \u201ccommercial activity\u201d means either a regular course of commercial conduct or a particular commercial transaction or act. The commercial character of an activity shall be determined by reference to the nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act, rather than by reference to its purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1635-7\">Congress did not further say what it meant by the word \u201ccommercial.\u201d Instead, it \u201cdeliberately left the meaning open and ... \u2018put [its] faith in the U.S. courts to work out progressively, on a case-by-case basis ... the distinction between commercial and governmental.\u2019 \u201d <em>Texas Trading &amp; Milling Corp. v. Federal Republic of Nigeria, </em>647 F.2d 300, 308-09 (2d Cir.1981) (quoting <em>Hearings on H.R. 11315 before the Sub-comm. on Administrative Law and Governmental Relations of the House Comm, on the Judiciary, </em>94th Cong., 2d Sess. 53 (1976) (hereafter <em>Hearings) </em>(testimony of Monroe Leigh, Legal Adviser, Department of State)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1635-10\">The district court, in the case at hand, recognized that a contract between a foreign state and a private party for the purchase of goods or services \u201cmay presumptively be,\u201d but is not inevitably, \u201ccommercial activity.\u201d <em>Practical Concepts, Inc., </em>615 F.Supp. at 94 (order denying reconsideration); <em>see id., </em>613 F.Supp. at 869 (rejecting <em>per se </em>categorization and citing instances of sales and service contracts held not within FSIA\u2019s commercial activity exception). Thus far, we are in accord with the district court. Nor do we question the \u201crule of thumb,\u201d crystallized by Second Circuit Judge Kaufman, which the district court quoted: \u201c \u2018[I]f the activity is one in which a private person could engage, it is not entitled to immunity.\u2019 \u201d 613 F.Supp. at 869 (quoting <em>Texas Trading, </em>647 F.2d at 309). We part company with the district court, however, in the turn it gave to the <em>Texas Trading </em>rule of thumb.</p>\n<p id=\"b1635-11\">The district court crystallized its own analysis by asking: \u201cIs the activity contemplated by [the PCI-Bolivia] contract activity \u2018in which a private person could engage\u2019?\u201d 613 F.Supp. at 869. Not in all respects, the district judge pointed out, for the contract included terms only a government could perform. <em>Id. </em>Those terms, PCI asserts and we agree, were \u201cincidental\u201d or auxiliary; they do not denote the essential character of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1635-12\">The terms that the district court found dispositive were these. First, Bolivia exempted PCI employees dispatched to work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1550\">*1550</page-number>on the contract in Bolivia from certain taxes. Record Excerpts (hereafter R.E.) N-10. Bolivia also undertook to expedite bureaucratic processes for entering and leaving the country. R.E. N-10 (clearance of supplies through customs, provision of travel documents and exchange permits). In addition, Bolivia promised not to object if the United States chose to grant PCI personnel diplomatic privileges. R.E. N-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1636-4\">Congress did indeed contemplate that courts would regard as key the question whether the foreign sovereign\u2019s contract at issue is \u201cof the same character as a contract which might be made by a private person.\u201d H.Rep. No. 1487, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 16 (1976), <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 6604, 6615.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But the legislature, so far as we can tell, did not intend that the \u201ccharacter\u201d of a contract would turn on its subsidiary rather than its central prescriptions. The essence of the Bolivia-PCI contract plainly was the exchange of money for advice on the development of rural areas. Prompt provision of documents to facilitate entry of material and personnel and tax exemptions to simplify PCI\u2019s receipt of payments from Bolivia,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> just as plainly, were auxiliary to the basic exchange.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1636-5\">A foreign state, Congress anticipated, would be answerable in court, just as a private party is, when it acts in an essentially private rather than sovereign capacity. <em>Transamerican Steamship Corp. v. Somali Democratic Republic, </em>767 F.2d 998, 1002 (D.C.Cir.1985); <em>see Hearings, supra </em>pp. 12-13, at 24, 30 (testimony of Monroe Leigh, Legal Adviser, Department of State and Bruno A.

The PCI-Bolivia contract is of the latter type, although it \u201cappears to be an amalgam of provisions normally found in both types of AID-financed contracts.\u201d Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae at 8. PCI\u2019s technical assistance and consulting services have not been described to us as in any way uncommon or uncommercial, and the contract at issue, we are informed, \u201cis not unusual.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1637-5\">Having rejected the district court\u2019s reasons for holding the contract \u201cgovernmental,\u201d and finding no substantial basis to categorize the activity in question as something other than \u201ccommercial,\u201d we are unable to sustain the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing the action. <em>Cf.

In arriving at this disposition, we have been aided by a brief amicus curiae filed by the United States on January 7, 1987.

PCI filed a Supplemental Brief in response on January 28, 1987.

In urging that the telegram constituted an \"appearance\u201d of the sort that forecloses a post-judgment jurisdictional challenge, PCI cites decisions construing the Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(b)(2) specification that notice of an application for a default judgment must be given to a defendant who has \"appeared in the action.\" PCI highlights <em>H.F. Livermore Corp. </em>v. <em>Aktiengesellschaft Gebruder Loepfe, </em>432 F.2d 689 (D.C.Cir.1970), as holding that two letters between counsel plus a telephone call amounted to an appearance within the meaning of Rule 55(b)(2). Were the question here whether the telegram sufficed to require notice to Bolivia prior to the entry of a default judgment against it, we might well agree that for that particular purpose \u2014 notice entitlement \u2014 Bolivia indeed had \"appeared.\u201d It does not follow, however, that an appearance must exist for all purposes or for none. <em>See </em>Cook, <em>\"Substance\" and \"Procedure\" in the Conflict of Laws, </em>42 Yale L.J. 333, 337 (1933) (\"The tendency to assume that a word which appears in two or more legal rules, and so in connection with more than one purpose, has and should have precisely the same scope in all of them, runs all through legal discussions. It has all the tenacity of original sin and must constantly be guarded against.\"). As to the purpose at hand, we think it evident that Bolivia did not appear, <em>i.e., </em>Bolivia did not \"waive[ ] its immunity either explicitly or by implication.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1633-5\">. In particular, PCI identifies <em>Honneus v. Donovan, </em>691 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1982), as \u201ca remarkably similar case.\" Brief of Appellant at 13. We find the two cases notably different.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-6\"><em>Honneus </em>invoked the diversity jurisdiction of the Massachusetts federal district court. Plaintiff Honneus sued his then brother-in-law, Donovan, for legal malpractice. Donovan, a member of the Massachusetts bar, filed an appearance but was thereafter silent. Eventually, the court entered a default judgment against him. Several months later, Donovan moved for relief from the judgment, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b); he asserted that diversity jurisdiction never existed because Honneus was not a Florida resident as the complaint had alleged but was in fact a resident of Massachusetts, as was Donovan. The First Circuit upheld the district court\u2019s refusal to set aside the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-7\">Had Honneus sued Donovan in a Massachusetts state court, there would have been no occasion, post-judgment, to intone any jurisdictional objection. Essentially, lawyer Donovan was contending that, despite his full awareness of, and recorded appearance in, his brother-in-law\u2019s suit, he could sit it out and then, in the event of an adverse federal court judgment, spring the plea that he should have been summoned instead to a local (state) courthouse. Both common sense and venerable precedent, <em>Des Moines Navigation and Railroad Co. v. Iowa Homestead Co., </em>123 U.S. 552, 8 S.Ct. 217, 31 L.Ed. 202 (1887), supported the First Circuit\u2019s judgment that absence of diversity is not a ground upon which collateral attack on a judgment can be mounted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-11\">In the instant case, we observe en passant, there was no recorded appearance \u2014 the telegram from the Bolivian engineer to plaintiffs counsel is surely not the equivalent of the docket sheet entry showing that lawyer Donovan had filed an unqualified appearance on his own behalf. More fundamentally, the identity or diversity of United States citizenship matter raised in <em>Honneus </em>is hardly comparable to the plea Bolivia presents here \u2014 that, because of its status as a foreign sovereign and the nature of the contract at issue, no court in the United States \u2014 federal or state \u2014 has authority to adjudicate PCI\u2019s claim. <em>Cf. United States v. Kember, </em>648 F.2d 1354, 1358-59 (D.C.Cir.1980) (question whether case should have been tried in the federal district court or in the local District of Columbia court across the street described as entailing \"at most jurisdiction writ small\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1634-6\">. The district court rejected PCI's contention that Bolivia had implicitly waived its sovereign immunity under \u00a7 1605(a)(1). <em>Practical Concepts, Inc., </em>613 F.Supp. at 871-72 (agreement to arbitrate a dispute does not deprive a foreign sovereign of immunity from court suit <em>on the merits </em>of the dispute). PCI has not pursued that issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1634-7\">. This case does not present the issue whether a foreign state would be entitled to sovereign immunity in an action <em>based on </em>an incidental (performance-facilitating) contract term that only a government could offer and perform. That issue would arise, for example, if a foreign nation were sued for failing to grant a tax exemption it had promised in a contract for the sale of goods. We express no opinion on such a case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1634-14\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1634-15\">Immunity of a foreign state from jurisdiction Subject to existing international agreements to which the United States is a party at the time of enactment of this Act a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the States except as provided in sections 1605 to 1607 of this chapter.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1634-16\">. <em>See supra </em>note 1.

However, a transaction to obtain goods or services from private parties would not lose its otherwise commercial character because it was entered into in connection with an AID program.
