He argues that (1) the Board incorrectly calculated the amount of his widower\u2019s annuity and (2) that the doctrine of equitable estoppel should be invoked against the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-22\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-23\">Wallace Crown, and his wife Deloris, were both railroad employees for over thirty years. In February 1982, Deloris Crown died. Shortly after his wife's death, Crown made contact with the Indianapolis branch of the Railroad Retirement Board to inquire about his eligibility for survivor benefits as the widower of a railroad employee and about his own benefits upon retirement. According to Crown, an employee at the Indianapolis branch informed him that he would be eligible for a widower\u2019s annuity when he attained the age of 60. He was also advised that he could elect to receive the widower\u2019s annuity as either a lump-sum settlement of approximately $10,930.18 or a monthly payment estimated at $650. On March 18, 1983, the district manager of the Indianapolis branch confirmed this information in a letter which estimated Crown\u2019s retirement annuity at $1,062 a month and his widower\u2019s annuity at $650 a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-24\">Relying on this letter and other conversations with employees at the Indianapolis branch, Crown retired in July 1983, at the age of 60. On July 5, 1983, he applied for retirement annuity benefits. Thereafter, he was awarded a retirement annuity of $1,208.52 with an effective date of July 1, 1983. On July 5, 1983, Crown also applied for widower\u2019s annuity benefits based upon his deceased spouse\u2019s earnings. Five months later, he received a letter informing him that he had been awarded a widower\u2019s annuity of $150.40 a month with an effective date of July 1, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-25\">Surprised at the difference between the amount his widower\u2019s annuity was estimated to be and the amount he was awarded, Crown wrote a letter to the Bureau of Retirement Claims. He requested an explanation for the reduction in his widower's annuity and reconsideration of the amount awarded. Crown informed the Bureau that several Board employees had estimated his widower\u2019s annuity to be approximately $500 a month more than he had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>awarded. Crown stated that he had passed up the lump-sum settlement and retired in reliance upon the higher estimate. The Bureau declined to reconsider their computation of his widower\u2019s annuity. On administrative appeal, the appeals referee affirmed the decision. The referee explained that Crown\u2019s widower\u2019s annuity had been reduced because of the retirement benefits Crown was also receiving.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">Ultimately, the Board affirmed the referee\u2019s decision. But the Board also sent Crown a letter stating that because he had been misinformed about the amount of his widower\u2019s annuity when he decided to fore-go the lump-sum settlement, he would be allowed 90 days to file an election to receive the lump-sum settlement in lieu of future monthly widower\u2019s annuity benefits. Crown took no action on the offer. Instead, he petitioned this court for review of the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">II. THE AMOUNT OF CROWN\u2019S WIDOWER\u2019S ANNUITY</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">The first issue raised on appeal is whether the Board correctly determined that the amount of Crown\u2019s widower\u2019s annuity must be reduced by the amount of his retirement annuity. In deciding this issue, our review is limited to determining whether the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and has a reasonable basis in law. <em>Schafer v. Railroad Retirement Board, </em>217 F.2d 874, 875 (7th Cir. 1954). In this case, the essential facts are not in dispute, thus, the question is whether the Board\u2019s determination has a reasonable basis in law. Because Congress has entrusted to the Board the primary responsibility for administering the Railroad Retirement Act, the Board\u2019s interpretation of the Act is entitled to deference. <em>See Environmental Protection Agency v. National Crushed Stone Association, </em>449 U.S. 64, 83, 101 S.Ct. 295, 306, 66 L.Ed.2d 268 (1980); <em>E.I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co. v. Collins, </em>432 U.S. 46, 54-55, 97 S.Ct. 2229, 2234, 53 L.Ed.2d 100 (1977); <em>Itel Corp. v. United States Railroad Retirement Board, </em>710 F.2d 1243, 1245 (7th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-9\">45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(d)(l)(i) of the Railroad Retirement Act entitles widowers of qualified deceased railroad employees to annuity benefits if the widower has not remarried and has attained the age of 60. Section 231a(d)(l) directs the Board to refer to \u00a7 231c to determine the amount of the annuity payment. A widower's annuity under \u00a7 231c consists of two tiers. The first tier is computed in accordance with \u00a7 231c(f)(l), which provides that the amount of the widower\u2019s annuity \u201cshall be in an amount equal to the amount ... of the widower\u2019s insurance benefits ... to which he or she would have been entitled under the Social Security Act ... if the deceased employee\u2019s service as an employee after December 31, 1936, had been included in the term \u2018employment\u2019 as defined in that Act____\u201d Thus, this first tier is the amount of the widower\u2019s benefit payable under the Social Security Act based upon the same earnings\u2019 period. The Social Security Act has its own distinct entitlements section, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(f)(3)(A). This section entitles a person in Crown\u2019s situation to an annuity \u201cequal to the primary insurance amount ... of his deceased wife.\u201d In this case, the Board computed Deloris Crown\u2019s primary insurance amount, after an age reduction, to be $487.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-12\">The first tier annuity amount may be reduced, however, under a provision of the Railroad Retirement Act, \u00a7 231c(i)(2), which provides that the widower\u2019s annuity must be reduced by the amount of the retirement benefits the widower is receiving. In this case, Crown\u2019s own primary insurance amount was $659. This amount exceeds the amount of Deloris Crown\u2019s primary insurance amount. Accordingly, the Board determined that under the Social Security portion of the computation (tier I), Crown was not entitled to any benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-13\">The second tier of the widower\u2019s annuity is computed in accordance with \u00a7 231c(g) which provides for certain increases in the annuity amount derived from the first tier calculation. Section 231c(g) provides that a widower is entitled to an additional annuity amount which is 50% of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>the deceased railroad worker\u2019s tier II amount. The Board found Deloris Crown\u2019s tier II amount, reduced by 50%, to be $181.42. After the age reduction required in the statute, the Board concluded that Crown was entitled to $150.40 under the tier II calculation. This is the amount Crown was awarded by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">Crown does not point to any of the above computations as incorrect. Instead, he refers us to Railroad Retirement Board Booklet IB-2 (1982), entitled Railroad Retirement Survivors Benefits for Railroad Workers and Families. This booklet, in a section entitled, Widows or Widowers Also Receiving Railroad Retirement Employee Annuities, states \u201c[i]f a ... widower is qualified for a railroad retirement employee annuity as well as a survivor annuity, a special guarantee applies if either the deceased employee or the survivor annuitant completed 120 months of railroad service before 1975. In effect, the ... widower would receive both an employee annuity and a survivor annuity, without a full dual benefit reduction.\u201d Although Crown contends that both he and the Board\u2019s employees relied upon this section in estimating the amount of his annuity, he does not indicate how this language was applied incorrectly in his case. The Board takes the position that the phrase \u201cwithout a full dual benefit reduction\u201d means only that a widower\u2019s annuity will not be completely eliminated as is done in the case of dual social security benefits. Since Crown does not offer any other interpretation of the phrase and the Board has conceded that Crown received erroneous information from Board employees, we do not see how Crown\u2019s reliance upon this language aids his argument that the Board erroneously determined the amount of his widower\u2019s annuity benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">Crown also argues that he is entitled to the \u201crestored amount\u201d provided by \u00a7 231c(g)(4). Section 231c(g)(4) states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1106-6\">If a ... widower of a deceased employee is entitled to an annuity under section 231a(a)(l) of this title and if either such ... widower or deceased employee will have completed 10 years of service prior to January 1, 1975, the amount of the annuity of such ... widower ... shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which (A) the ... widower\u2019s insurance annuity to which such ... widower would have been entitled, upon attaining age 65, under section 5(a) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. \u00a7 228e(a)], as in effect on December 31,1974 ... exceeds (B) the total of the annuity amounts to which such ... widower was entitled (after any reductions pursuant to subsection (i)(2) of this section but before any deduction on account of work) under the preceding provisions of this subsection, subsection (f) of this section____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1106-10\">The Board asserts that the only widowers entitled to this \u201crestored amount\u201d are widowers who would have been entitled to an annuity under \u00a7 5(a) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 as it was in effect and being administered on December 31, 1974. Under \u00a7 5(a) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 (the 1937 Act), as it was being administered on December 31, 1974, Crown could not have qualified for a widower\u2019s annuity because he was a nondependent male.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-11\">The legislative history of \u00a7 231c(g)(4) indicates that Congress believed the Board\u2019s interpretation to be correct. The Committee report accompanying \u00a7 231c(g)(4) indicates that the amendment was technical. Its purpose was merely to eliminate certain unforeseen inequities that the Board had encountered in interpreting the 1974 Act. H.R. 1465, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 17-19, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News, 5601, 5617-19. The amendment provides for an increase in the tier II amount of a widow\u2019s or widower\u2019s annuity in a case where the 1937 Act would have provided a larger widow\u2019s or widower\u2019s annuity based on the deceased employee\u2019s service before 1975, than does the 1974 Act\u2019s formula after the tier I is reduced due to the widow\u2019s or widower\u2019s receipt of a railroad retirement employee\u2019s annuity. The increased amount is equal to the difference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>between what the widow or widower would have received under the 1937 Act and the amount payable to the widow or widower under the 1974 Act, after tier I is reduced due to the widow\u2019s, or widower\u2019s receipt of a railroad retirement employee\u2019s annuity. Section 231c(g)(4) does not increase Crown\u2019s widower\u2019s annuity because he was a nondependent male and under the 1937 Act was not entitled to any annuity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">III. EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">Crown also contends that the Board should be equitably estopped from denying him full benefits because he took an early retirement based on Board employees\u2019 incorrect estimates as to the amount of his widower\u2019s annuity. The general rule is that reliance on misinformation provided by a government employee does not provide a basis for an estoppel. <em>Cheers v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, </em>610 F.2d 463, 469 (7th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 898, 101 S.Ct. 266, 66 L.Ed.2d 128 (1980); <em>Gressley v. Califano, </em>609 F.2d 1265, 1267 (7th Cir.1979) (citing cases). But the doctrine of estoppel has been applied to the federal government in certain narrow circumstances. <em>See Azar v. United States Postal Service, </em>777 F.2d 1265 (7th Cir.1985) (estoppel may be applied when the Postal Service\u2019s express mail is involved); <em>Portmann v. United States, </em>674 F.2d 1155 (7th Cir.1982) (same); <em>United States v. Fox Lake State Bank, </em>366 F.2d 962 (7th Cir.1966) (FHA estopped to recover statutory forfeitures and statutory double damages under the Civil False Claims Act when it specifically encouraged a mistake of which it then took advantage). This case, however, does not fall within the above narrow circumstances. \u201cA congressional mandate to pay statutory benefits only to those so entitled presents a different case. Congress leaves no discretion in the agencies and courts but to limit the payment of benefits to those statutorily entitled to them. * * * Were we to estop the government in the present case, we would be interfering with the duty of administrative agencies and courts to follow the mandate of Congress and limit the payment to those whom our elected representatives have deemed eligible.\u201d <em>Gressley, </em>609 F.2d at 1268. In <em>Gressley, </em>this court found that no estoppel would lie against the government to require it to pay social security benefits to a claimant not entitled to them under the statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1107-9\">The government could scarcely function if it were bound by its employees\u2019 unauthorized representations. Where a party claims entitlement to benefits under federal statutes and lawfully promulgated regulations, that party must satisfy the requirements imposed by Congress. Even detrimental reliance on misinformation obtained from a seemingly authorized government agent will not excuse a failure to qualify for benefits under the relevant statutes and regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADq\"><em>Gressley, </em>609 F.2d at 1267, quoting <em>Goldberg v. Weinberger, </em>546 F.2d 477, 481 (2d Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 937, 97 S.Ct. 2648, 53 L.Ed.2d 255 (1977). The reasons for not allowing estoppel in social security benefit cases likewise apply in railroad retirement benefit cases. In this case, like <em>Gressley, </em>the petitioner seeks to estop the government from denying him benefits that he is not statutorily entitled to. The Supreme Court has stressed that federal courts have a duty \u201cto observe the condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>tions defined by Congress for charging the public treasury.\u201d <em>Federal Crop Insurance Corp. v. Merrill, </em>332 U.S. 380, 385, 68 S.Ct. 1, 3, 92 L.Ed. 10 (1947). With this duty in mind, we decline to estop the government from denying Crown full dual benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">The Petition For Review Is Denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">. Crown does not argue that limiting the increased annuity to persons \"entitled to an annuity under \u00a7 5(a) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 as in effect on December 31, 1974\u201d improperly insulates the dependency requirements found unconstitutional in <em>Califano v. Goldfarb, </em>430 U.S. 199, 97 S.Ct. 1021, 51 L.Ed.2d 270 (1977). For cases dealing with constitutional attacks on similar statutory provisions see <em>Frock v. United States Railroad Retirement Board, </em>685 F.2d 1041 (7th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1201, 103 S.Ct. 1185, 75 L.Ed.2d 432 (1983) ; <em>Givens v. United States Railroad Retirement Board, </em>720 F.2d 196 (DC Cir.1983), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>469 U.S. 870, 105 S.Ct. 219, 469 U.S. 870 (1984) ; <em>Steiger v. United States Railroad Retirement Board, </em>761 F.2d 1428 (9th Cir.1985). Crown does argue, however, that he did not have an opportunity to rebut the Board\u2019s determination that he was a nondependent widower. Given Crown\u2019s employment as a railroad worker for over thirty years, we do not believe that such an opportunity to rebut would have helped Crown\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
