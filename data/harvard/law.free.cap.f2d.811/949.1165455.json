We agree with the United States that Rasmussen did not satisfy the mitigation provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and the statute of limitations therefore bars his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-15\">On October 23, 1984, Hans Rasmussen, as sole shareholder and liquidator of Canal Marine Repairs, Inc. (\u201cCanal\u201d), filed this action to recover $84,235 in corporate income taxes paid by Canal for its taxable year ended April 30, 1978. Canal sold all its assets and adopted a plan of liquidation in May 1977, and received a certificate of liquidation from the State of Louisiana in December 1977. On July 10, 1978, Canal filed its federal income tax return for its taxable year ended April 30,1978. On that return, it reported the sale of the assets and paid $84,504 in tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-16\">Rasmussen did not report any gain or loss from the liquidation of Canal on his individual return. As the result of an audit, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cService\u201d) alleged that Rasmussen, individually, owed capital gains tax on Canal\u2019s liquidation because he had actually or constructively received the proceeds of the liquidation. In November 1981, Rasmussen consented to the adjustments to his tax liability and paid the additional individual income tax due.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-17\">On October 13, 1982, Rasmussen filed a claim for refund on behalf of Canal seeking to recover the corporate income tax paid on the sale of Canal\u2019s assets. Rasmussen argued that because the Service had determined that Canal had distributed the proceeds of the liquidation to him, I.R.C. \u00a7 337 applied to the liquidation. Under I.R.C. \u00a7 337, Canal did not owe tax on the liquidation and therefore, it overpaid its federal income tax for the taxable year ended April 30, 1978. The Service denied the claim because Rasmussen filed it more than three years after he had filed the return for Canal\u2019s taxable year ended April 30, 1978. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6511(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-18\">On October 23, 1984, Rasmussen filed suit in the U.S. District Court to recover the tax that Canal paid on its liquidation. The complaint alleged that his claim for refund fell within the mitigation provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>of the Code. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311-1314. The complaint also alleged that I.R.C. \u00a7 337 applied to Canal\u2019s liquidation and that as a result, Canal had overpaid its corporate income tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">The government moved to dismiss the complaint because Rasmussen\u2019s claim was not timely and therefore did not confer jurisdiction on the district court. The government contended that the mitigation provisions were inapplicable because Rasmussen did not satisfy the specific statutory requirements. The district court denied the government\u2019s motion to dismiss and held that I.R.C. \u00a7 337 applied to the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">No taxpayer may sue the United States for a refund of federal income taxes paid until \u201ca claim for refund ... has been duly filed with the Secretary, according to the provisions of law in that regard____\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 7422(a). Generally a taxpayer must file a claim for refund within three years from the time the return was filed or two years from the time the tax was paid, whichever is later. I.R.C. \u00a7 6511(a). Rasmussen stipulated that he filed his claim for refund more than three years after he filed the return and paid the tax for Canal\u2019s taxable year ended April 30, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">In certain narrowly tailored situations the mitigation provisions of the Internal Revenue Code provide relief from the application of the general three-year statute of limitations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-10\">(a) GENERAL RULE. \u2014 If a determination (as defined in section 1313) is described in one or more of the paragraphs of section 1312 and, on the date of the determination, correction of the effect of the error referred to in the applicable paragraph of section 1312 is prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law, other than this part and other than section 7122 (relating to compromises), then the effect of the error shall be corrected by an adjustment made in the amount and in the manner specified in section 1314.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1037-11\">I.R.C. \u00a7 1311. The government argues that \u00a7 1311 does not apply to Rasmussen\u2019s claim for three reasons: (1) Rasmussen never received a \u201cdetermination\u201d within the meaning of I.R.C. \u00a7 1313; (2) Rasmussen\u2019s claim satisfied none of the \u201ccircumstances of adjustment\u201d as defined in I.R.C. \u00a7 1312; and (3) the Service did not maintain an inconsistent position within the meaning of I.R.C. \u00a7 1311(b). We agree with the government that Rasmussen never received a \u201cdetermination\u201d within the meaning of I.R.C. \u00a7 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-13\">Section 1313 defines the word \u201cdetermination\u201d to include four things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-14\">(1) a decision by the Tax Court or a judgment, decree, or other order by any court of competent jurisdiction, which has become final;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-15\">(2) a closing agreement made under section 7121;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-16\">(3) a final disposition by the Secretary of a claim for refund____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-18\">(4) under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, an agreement for purposes of this part, signed by the Secretary and by a person, relating to the liability of such person (or the person for whom he acts) in respect of a tax under this subtitle for any taxable period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1037-19\">I.R.C. \u00a7 1313(a). Rasmussen argues that, \u201cForm 870, evidencing [his] personal tax liability, and his subsequent payment of the deficiency, constituted a final determination by the Commissioner. In making this final determination as to Rasmussen\u2019s personal tax liability based on the corporation\u2019s liquidation status, the Government made a final determination respecting the corporation\u2019s tax liability as well.\u201d The district court accepted Rasmussen\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-20\">Both Rasmussen and the district court ignore the statutory definition of \u201cdetermination\u201d in I.R.C. \u00a7 1313. Rasmussen stipulated that there was neither a Tax Court decision, nor a judgment of any other court, nor a closing agreement, nor a final disposition of a refund claim, nor an agreement between Rasmussen and the Secretary as defined in \u00a7 1313(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-21\">Rasmussen cites cases for the proposition that the mitigation provisions are re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>medial in nature and should be construed to do equity. The government cites cases for the proposition that the provisions should be strictly construed. In any case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aug\">[t]his Circuit has held that when applying the mitigation statutes the facts of each case must fit \u201cinto the concrete, detailed requirements set out in the statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Rachal, </em>312 F.2d 376, 383 (5th Cir.1962). Moreover, taxpayer has the burden of proving that the mitigation statutes apply. <em>United States v. Rushlight, </em>291 F.2d 508, 514 (9th Cir.1961).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\"><em>Cocchiara v. United States, </em>779 F.2d 1108, 1112 (5th Cir.1986). Because neither the district court nor Rasmussen can fit the facts of this case into the statutory definition of \u201cdetermination,\u201d we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Rasmussen and remand the case with instructions to dismiss. We do not reach the government\u2019s alternative arguments because the lack of a \u201cdetermination\u201d disposes of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
