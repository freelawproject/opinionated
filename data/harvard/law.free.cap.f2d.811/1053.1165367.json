It assessed damages of $250,000, which the defendants have paid. Kuba\u2019s estate wants the damages trebled, on the authority of Ind.Code \u00a7 34-4-30-1, which provides that \u201c[i]f a person suffers a pecuniary loss as a result of a violation of IC 35-43, he may bring a civil action against the person who caused the loss for: (1) an amount not to exceed three (3) times his actual damages\u201d plus attorneys\u2019 fees. \u201cIC 35-43\u201d designates a portion of the Code dealing with criminal damage to property. Section 35-43-1-2, on which the estate relies, is entitled \u201ccriminal mischief\u201d and provides in part (a) that: \u201cA person who: (1) [rjecklessly, knowingly, or intentionally damages property of another person without his consent\u201d commits a misdemeanor. Sheban was legally intoxicated at the time of the accident, which destroyed at least some of Kuba\u2019s property (his truck). <em>Obremski v. Henderson, </em>497 N.E.2d 909 (Ind.1986), holds that reckless driving while intoxicated may violate \u00a7 35-43-l-2(a)(l). The court stated that \u201ca drunk driver who crosses the center lane and strikes another car could well be found by a jury to have acted \u2018in plain, conscious, and unjustifiable disregard of harm that might result\u2019 \u201d, <em>id. </em>at 910-11, the definition of \u201crecklessness\u201d in Indiana. This case involves the crossing of the center line, producing a collision, and therefore it seems to create a jury question under <em>Obremski. </em>The estate concludes that it is entitled to treble damages under \u00a7 34-4-30-1. The district court disagreed and declined to ask the jury to determine whether Sheban caused the collision recklessly or intentionally. In a post-trial opinion, the judge explained that the law of Indiana does not permit the award of punitive or other multiplied damages in a wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-16\">The appellees devote most of their brief to persuading us that we should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>not decide the question the estate presents. Their lead argument is that, having accepted the $250,000, the estate may not persevere in trying to collect another $500,000. But the estate has not signed a release or any other formal document of settlement. (A release clause was printed on the back of the $250,000 check, but appellees sent the check to the clerk of the district court, who cashed the instrument and allowed the estate to draw on the resulting fund. The estate neither saw nor signed this language.) The $250,000 is no longer in dispute, so neither payment nor acceptance of the money necessarily implies settlement. Appellees do not offer any reason why the price of an appeal on the disputed sum must be appellees\u2019 retention of money that, by virtue of the judgment, belongs to the estate. A party may accept what is securely his and appeal seeking more. <em>United States v. Hougham, </em>364 U.S. 310, 312, 81 S.Ct. 13, 16, 5 L.Ed.2d 8 (1960); <em>Embry v. Palmer, </em>107 U.S. (Otto) 3, 8, 2 S.Ct. 25, 29, 27 L.Ed. 346 (1882); <em>United States v. F.D. Rich Co., </em>525 F.2d 760, 763-65 (7th Cir.1975). The parties are free to agree by contract on a different approach; nothing prevented them from compromising their entire dispute. They did not do this, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">Appellees also maintain that the estate\u2019s invocation of \u00a7 34-4-30-1 is untimely. The collision occurred on July 11, 1983. The estate filed the suit within the two years provided by Indiana law but did not add a claim based on \u00a7 34-4-30-1 until March 1986. It is untimely for two reasons, according to appellees: it post-dates the adoption of the pretrial order, which fixes the issues in the case; and it comes after the two-year period of limitations. The observation that the claim under \u00a7 34-4-30-1 is not in the pretrial order would have been sufficient justification for the district court to decline to entertain it. <em>Erff v. Markhon Industries, Inc., </em>781 F.2d 613, 618 (7th Cir.1986). It does not compel the judge to disregard the claim, however. <em>Janke Construction Co. v. Vulcan Materials Co., </em>527 F.2d 772 (7th Cir.1976); cf. Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(e). The district judge allowed the claim to be raised and addressed it on the merits, holding in an extensive opinion that the estate\u2019s claim is unavailing. Claims explicitly addressed by the parties and court are treated as added automatically to the pleadings and other necessary documents. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(b). The district judge having addressed the merits, we may too.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-7\">As for the statute of limitations, Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c) states that whenever a new claim \u201carose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading.\u201d Trial Rule 15 of the Indiana Rules of Civil Procedure is identical, making it unnecessary to decide whether <em>Erie </em>requires the application of state law. Cf. <em>Schiavone v. Fortune, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 2379, 91 L.Ed.2d 18 (1986); <em>Davis v. Piper Aircraft Corp., </em>615 F.2d 606, 609-11 (4th Cir.1980). The claim based on \u00a7 34-4-30-1 unquestionably arose out of the same conduct as the estate\u2019s negligence action. Principles of claim preclusion (res judicata) would forbid the prosecution of a negligence suit and a suit based on \u00a7 34-4-30-1 in separate actions. Ours is exactly the sort of claim that Rule 15(c) allows to relate back. Appellees make much of the fact that <em>Obremski </em>was not decided until after the two years had run, but that is irrelevant. Section 34-4-30-1 predates the collision; there is no retroactivity problem in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-10\">We arrive at the merits and encounter difficulty. The district court relied principally on its conclusion that Indiana does not allow the recovery of punitive damages in wrongful death actions. See also <em>Scully v. Armstrong, </em>646 F.Supp. 213, 216 (N.D.Ind.1986) (identical conclusion by a different district judge). In 1979 our court predicted that Indiana would take this position about punitive damages. <em>Huff v. White Motor Corp., </em>609 F.2d 286, 297 (7th Cir.1979). In 1986 one district of the court of appeals of Indiana did so. <em>Andis v. Hawkins, </em>489 N.E.2d 78 (1st Dist.1986). <em>Andis </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>recognized that the states are divided on the question, and that a refusal to allow the recovery of punitive damages in wrongful death actions means that it is cheaper to kill a person than to wound him \u2014 an outcome that undermines the principal function of punitive damages, deterrence. The Supreme Court of Indiana has not addressed the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">The effect of the silence of the highest court of Indiana about a question that could go either way (and has, in other states) is compounded by the potential difference between punitive damages under the common law and damages that are augmented by virtue of a statute. <em>Andis </em>stressed that the wrongful death action is a creature of statute and that the damages therefore should be only those allowed by the legislature. 489 N.E.2d at 81. This rationale does not necessarily carry over to augmentation under \u00a7 34-4-30-1, a subject on which the legislature has spoken. The Supreme Court stated in <em>Obremski </em>that \u201c[a] recovery of treble damages under [\u00a7 34-4-30-1] is regarded as distinct from recovery of common law punitive damages.\u201d 497 N.E.2d at 911. On the other hand, as Judge Moody emphasized in <em>Scully, </em>646 F.Supp. at 216, Indiana\u2019s survivor-ship statute, Ind.Code \u00a7 34-1-1-1, cuts off all recoveries other than through the wrongful death statute, \u00a7 34-1-1-2, for wrongful acts that produce death. Thus the statute construed in <em>Andis </em>is an essential basis of the estate\u2019s recovery, and the statute does not suggest any difference between common law and statutory bases for the augmentation of damages. (It also did not suggest any foundation for the difference between actual and punitive damages, however.) The court of appeals emphasized in <em>Andis </em>that the wrongful death statute strictly limits recoveries to actual damages. The parties inform us that no case in Indiana discusses whether there is a difference, for purposes of wrongful death actions, between common law and statutory sources of authority to increase a party\u2019s recoveries. We therefore have almost complete silence in Indiana on a question at the heart of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">Because <em>Obremski </em>is such a recent case, the courts of Indiana also are silent on the measure of recovery under \u00a7 34-4-30-1. The appellees insist that because \u00a7 35-43-l-2(a)(l) makes reckless damage to \u201cproperty\u201d the misdemeanor, only the value of the destroyed property may be trebled. The value of Kuba\u2019s truck, and nothing more, is at issue on appellees\u2019 view. The estate points out that under Ind.Code \u00a7 35-41-l-23(a) property \u201cmeans anything of value\u201d including any \u201cgain or advantage\u201d and \u201clabor, and services\u201d. This must mean, according to the estate, that the value of Kuba\u2019s forgone earnings are \u201cproperty\u201d covered by the treble damages clause. There is still another potential reading. Even if \u00a7 35-43-l-2(a)(l) refers only to tangible property, as appellees believe, \u00a7 34-4-30-1(1) allows the trebling of the injured party\u2019s \u201cactual damages\u201d. It may be, therefore, that so long as tangible property has been destroyed recklessly or intentionally \u2014 and \u00a7 35-43-l-2(a)(l) has been violated \u2014 all consequential damages may be trebled under \u00a7 34-4-30-1. The statutes allow any of these approaches as a purely linguistic matter, and we have no guidance from the courts of Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-7\">This is therefore a suitable case in which to seek the views of the Supreme Court of Indiana directly under Ind.R. App.P. 15(0). We respectfully request the Supreme Court of Indiana to answer the following questions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-8\">1. Whether treble damages under \u00a7 34-4-30-1 are available in wrongful death actions in Indiana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-9\">2. If so, whether the trebling is limited to the value of the physical property destroyed by the conduct that violates \u00a7 35-43 and supports the invocation of \u00a7 34-4-30-1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1142-10\">The clerk of this court will transmit to the Supreme Court of Indiana a certified copy of this opinion, a copy of the briefs and appendix submitted to this court, and if requested the record in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-11\">Questions Certified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
