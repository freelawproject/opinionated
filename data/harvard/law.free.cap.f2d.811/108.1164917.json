Leisure, J., refusing to require plaintiff, Rev. Brendan Gilmore, to submit to arbitration his common law claims against Shearson for alleged \u201cchurning\u201d of his margin account. Judge Leisure held that Shearson\u2019s express withdrawal of an earlier motion to compel arbitration waived any contractual right it might have had to compel arbitration of those claims. In this appeal, Shearson argues that Gilmore\u2019s submission of an amended complaint revived Shearson\u2019s right to move to compel arbitration. For the reasons given below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-23\">In December 1984, Gilmore commenced this action against Stuart Travis, his former investment executive at Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, a brokerage firm, and against Shearson, the successor by merger to that firm. Gilmore had maintained a margin account with Shearson from January 1976 through April 1980. He charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>that he had lost most of his life\u2019s savings because of defendants\u2019 churning \u2014 excessive trading for the primary purpose of generating commissions \u2014 in his account in violation of section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j, and Rules 10b-3 and 10b-5. The complaint alleges th\u00e1t in this 52-month period, Gilmore\u2019s average investment (market value of securities less any margin debt) was approximately $60,000, but the total of commissions and other charges to his account exceeded $116,000. Gilmore also asserted claims for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract and common law fraud. Gilmore claimed actual losses of at least $143,000 and punitive damages of $3,000,-000, and sought costs and disbursements including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees. In its answer, Shearson claimed that the action should be stayed pending arbitration, pursuant to an agreement between the parties. Thereafter, Shearson moved in March 1985 to stay the district court proceedings and to compel arbitration of Gilmore\u2019s federal securities and common law claims. In May 1985, however, Shearson explicitly withdrew that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">In July 1985, Gilmore moved for leave to amend his complaint to assert a cause of action under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968. That motion followed the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., </em>473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3281-84, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985), where the Court held in part that civil causes of action based on RICO do not have to allege a prior criminal conviction on the part of the defendant. The amended complaint sought treble damages \u2014 $477,-000 in actual damages and $10,000,000 in punitive damages. In response, Shearson filed a cross-motion opposing Gilmore\u2019s motion to amend and reasserting its claim of a contractual right to stay the litigation and to compel arbitration of the entire suit if leave to amend was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The district court referred Gilmore\u2019s motion and Shearson\u2019s cross-motion to Magistrate Leonard Bernikow. In February 1986, the magistrate submitted his report to Judge Leisure, recommending that Gilmore be permitted to amend his complaint and that the action be stayed pending arbitration of the RICO claim. The magistrate also recommended that the remainder of Shearson\u2019s cross-motion be denied, finding that the federal securities claims were not arbitrable and that Shearson had waived any right it might have had to arbitrate the common law claims by withdrawing its earlier motion to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">In an order entered in May 1986, Judge Leisure accepted most of the magistrate\u2019s recommendations, but refused to stay the action pending arbitration of the RICO claim, finding that this court\u2019s intervening decision in <em>McMahon v. Shearson/American Express Inc., </em>788 F.2d 94 (2d Cir.), cert. granted, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 107 S.Ct. 60, 93 L.Ed.2d 20 (1986), had rendered the RICO claim non-arbitrable. This appeal by Shearson followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">As a preliminary matter, Gilmore argues that Judge Leisure\u2019s order denying Shear-son\u2019s cross-motion to stay proceedings pending arbitration is not an appealable order. Gilmore questions the continued viability of the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>rule, on which Shearson relies for its right to appeal at this stage of the litigation. The line of authority that began with the cases that first announced that rule, <em>Ettelson v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>317 U.S. 188, 191, 63 S.Ct. 163, 164, 87 L.Ed. 176 (1942); <em>Enelow v. New York Life Insurance Co., </em>293 U.S. 379, 383, 55 S.Ct. 310, 311, 79 L.Ed. 440 (1935), provides that \u201c[a]n order refusing to stay proceedings in federal district court pending arbitration is ... an appealable interlocutory order refusing an injunction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), if the action in which the order was made is an action which, before the fusion of law and equity, was by its nature an action at law.\u201d <em>Poriss v. Aaacon Auto Transport, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>685 F.2d 56, 59 (2d Cir.1982). Gilmore describes this rule as \u201cobsolete\u201d and \u201canachronistic\u201d and urges that it be overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">The <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>rule has been severely criticized in recent years, see <em>Matterhorn, Inc. v. NCR Corp., </em>763 F.2d 866, 870-71 (7th Cir.1985); <em>H.C. Lawton, Jr., Inc. v. Truck Drivers, Chauffeurs and Helpers Local Union No. 384, </em>755 F.2d 324, 327 n. 2 (3d Cir.1985); <em>Mar-Len of Louisiana, Inc. v. Parsons-Gilbane, </em>732 F.2d 444, 445-47 (5th Cir.1984) (Rubin J., dissenting); <em>Langley v. Colonial Leasing Co. of New England, </em>707 F.2d 1, 2 &amp; n. 2 (1st Cir.1983), and is an awkward standard not always easy to apply. See <em>Standard Chlorine of Delaware, Inc. v. Leonard, </em>384 F.2d 304, 308 (2d Cir.1967). Nevertheless, this court has adhered to the rule and has recently applied it to review an order denying a motion to compel arbitration. See <em>McMahon, </em>788 F.2d at 99 n. 5. Further, the Supreme Court has explicitly declined the opportunity to overturn the rule, \u201cconclud[ing] that it is better judicial practice to follow the precedents which limit appealability of interlocutory orders, leaving Congress to make such amendments as it may find proper.\u201d <em>Baltimore Contractors, Inc. v. Bodinger, </em>348 U.S. 176, 185, 75 S.Ct. 249, 254, 99 L.Ed. 233 (1955). Despite our difficulties with the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>rule, we find unpersuasive Gilmore\u2019s suggestion that Congress silently effected such an amendment in 1958 by enacting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), which allows a district court to certify an interlocutory appeal to a court of appeals. While we believe the rule should be changed, we feel bound by precedent to follow it until directed otherwise by higher authority or by Congress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Alternatively, Gilmore argues that the underlying action here is essentially equitable, rather than legal, and that the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>exception to the rule of finality is therefore not applicable. Again, Gilmore\u2019s claim is unpersuasive. The amended complaint seeks monetary damages for violations of section 10(b) and RICO, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract and common law fraud and is clearly legal in nature. Recently, in <em>McMahon, </em>where these same arguments were raised in an action based on similar claims, this court upheld the appealability of the district court\u2019s interlocutory order denying arbitration. See 788 F.2d at 99 n. 5. Gilmore\u2019s attempt in this appeal to describe his action in equitable terms, by claiming that he seeks not only the return of his lost investment, but also an \u201caccounting\u201d and the disgorgement of profits, cannot mask the legal character of his complaint. Any equitable elements of Gilmore\u2019s action are \u201cmerely incidental\u201d and are not sufficient to exclude it from the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>rule. See <em>Poriss, </em>685 F.2d at 59. Judge Leisure\u2019s denial of Shearson\u2019s cross-motion to stay proceedings pending arbitration is therefore an appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Before leaving this point, we note that Shearson has moved, pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for an award of sanctions against Gilmore\u2019s attorney for arguing that the district court order should not be appealable. By raising this argument Gilmore has prudently preserved his position, which would enable him to seek Supreme Court review on this issue. Although we find that we are constrained to follow the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>rule, as our previous discussion makes clear, Gilmore\u2019s attack on the rule is far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>from frivolous. Accordingly, Shearson\u2019s motion for Rule 11 sanctions is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">We next consider the merits of Shear-son\u2019s appeal. In its brief, Shearson expressly limits its appeal to that portion of the district court\u2019s order that denied its cross-motion to compel arbitration of the common law claims in Gilmore\u2019s amended complaint. Accordingly, Judge Leisure\u2019s rulings that Gilmore\u2019s federal securities and RICO claims are not arbitrable are not contested in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Moreover, at oral argument, counsel for Shearson conceded that Shearson would not have been entitled to move to compel arbitration of the common law claims if Gilmore had not amended his complaint. Shearson therefore does not argue that its withdrawal of its first motion to compel was not a waiver. Instead, Shearson argues that Gilmore\u2019s amended complaint vitiated the effect of Shearson\u2019s response to the original complaint and permitted it to assert the same motions and defenses that were initially available. Under this analysis, Shearson\u2019s explicit waiver of arbitration by withdrawing its motion to compel it is expunged by the amended complaint, and, under the guidelines set out in <em>Rush v. Oppenheimer &amp; Co., </em>779 F.2d 885 (2d Cir. 1985), Shearson is not precluded from moving to compel arbitration of the common law claims in the amended complaint because, it claims, Gilmore has not been prejudiced by his participation in the litigation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Whether filing an amended complaint affects a defendant\u2019s ability to assert again a motion to compel arbitration, which it had voluntarily abandoned with respect to the original complaint, is apparently a question of first impression in this circuit. Although an amended complaint ordinarily supercedes the original pleading, <em>International Controls Corp. v. Vesco, </em>556 F.2d 665, 668-69 (2d Cir.1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1014, 98 S.Ct. 730, 54 L.Ed.2d 758 (1978), it does not automatically revive all of the defenses and objections that a defendant has waived in response to the original complaint. For example, even though Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not expressly limit the defenses that can be alleged in response to an amended pleading, district courts in this circuit have determined that the Rule 12 defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, insufficiency of process and insufficiency of service, if waived by defendant\u2019s failure to raise those objections in response to the original complaint, may not be resurrected merely because a plaintiff has amended the complaint. <em>Ross v. United States, </em>574 F.Supp. 536, 539 (S.D.N.Y.1983); <em>Brohan v. Volkswagen Manufacturing Corp. of America, </em>97 F.R.D. 46, 48 (E.D.N.Y.1983). Accord <em>Rowley v. McMillan, </em>502 F.2d 1326, 1332-33 (4th Cir. 1974). As with the objections listed above, a motion to compel arbitration of a claim involves the core issue of a party\u2019s willingness to submit a dispute to judicial resolution and, if waived, is not automatically revived by the submission of an amended complaint. See <em>Weight Watchers of Quebec, Ltd. v. Weight Watchers International, Inc., </em>398 F.Supp. 1057, 1061-62 (E.D.N.Y.1975). Accordingly, we hold that Shear-son\u2019s explicit waiver of the motion to compel arbitration in response to the original complaint precludes it from starting fresh in its response to the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">It is true that in the just-cited cases, waiver flowed from mere failure to move within a specified time, and such inaction without more would not ordinarily result in waiver of the right to arbitrate. <em>Carcich v. Rederi A/B Nordie, </em>389 F.2d 692, 696 (2d Cir.1968). We do not regard this as significant since the issue thus raised is what is necessary, in an ambiguous situation, to establish waiver of the right to arbitrate. In such a case, <em>Rush v. Oppenheimer &amp; Co. </em>applies, and Gilmore would have to show that he has suffered prejudice from Shearson\u2019s late assertion of the motion to compel arbitration. But here, no ambiguity exists because there was an express waiver. As noted above, Shearson concedes that it waived its right to move to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>compel arbitration with respect to the original complaint. Accordingly, we reject Shearson\u2019s suggestion that the relevant inquiry in determining whether it may move to compel arbitration in response to the amended complaint is the waiver analysis discussed in <em>Rush.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Ordinarily, a party may not freely take inconsistent positions in a law suit and simply ignore the effect of a prior filed document. See generally IB Moore\u2019s Federal Practice II 0.405[8] (2d ed. 1984). This policy against permitting a party to play \u201cfast and loose\u201d with the courts, <em>Selected Risks Insurance Co. v. Kobelinski, </em>421 F.Supp. 431, 434 (E.D.Pa.1976), seems particularly applicable here, where Gilmore makes the far from frivolous charge that Shearson\u2019s change in position is not merely the product of honest error, but is a tactic in a war of attrition designed to make the litigation too expensive for plaintiff, an elderly clergyman, to continue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The magistrate described Shearson\u2019s \u201cunequivocal withdrawal\u201d of its motion to compel arbitration as \u201cthe result of Shearson\u2019s careful evaluation of business considerations.\u201d Under the circumstances, to change course and revive its right to move to compel arbitration, Shearson must show that the amended complaint contains charges that, in fairness, should nullify its earlier waiver and allow it to reassess its strategy, for example, that the amended complaint changed the scope or theory of Gilmore\u2019s claims in a manner that is relevant to the issues presented by Shearson in the district court. Cf. <em>Brown v. E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., Inc., </em>610 F.Supp. 76, 78 (S.D.Fla.1985). For the reasons that follow, we find that Shearson has failed to make such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Shearson\u2019s principal argument is that Gilmore\u2019s addition of a claim based on RICO substantively changed the nature of the lawsuit by subjecting Shearson to the possibility of an award of treble damages, costs and the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees, and should permit it to reassess its decision not to arbitrate the common law claims. Gilmore\u2019s addition of the RICO claim, however, does not amend the common law claims \u2014 the only claims that Shearson now seeks to arbitrate. In addition, we have held that the RICO claim is not arbitrable; therefore, it will be litigated in the district court regardless of the outcome of the motion to compel arbitration. <em>McMahon, </em>788 F.2d at 98-99. The addition of this unrelated, non-arbitrable claim to the lawsuit is not an amendment that justifies Shear-son\u2019s change of position with respect to arbitrating the common law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">Shearson also argues that the breach of fiduciary duty and common law fraud portions of the complaint were amended to allege violations of \u201capplicable law,\u201d rather than specifying violations of \u201cthe law of the State of New York.\u201d Shearson also notes that the amended complaint enlarges Gilmore\u2019s claim of actual damages with respect to the common law claims from $143,000 to $159,000 and increases the claim for punitive damages from $3,000,000 to $10,000,000. However, in December 1985, Shearson stipulated to permit Gilmore to submit an amended complaint that contained these changes. Later, in its arguments before the magistrate, and in its arguments before Judge Leisure concerning the magistrate\u2019s report that issued two months after the stipulation was signed, Shearson never mentioned these changes and never relied upon them as a basis for reviving its right to move to compel arbitration. Shearson may not raise these changes as a basis for relief for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">The only change in the amended complaint relied upon by Shearson in this appeal that was not subject to the stipulation is found in paragraph 13, where instead of alleging that Travis persuaded Gilmore to open a margin account with Shear-son, Gilmore alleges that Travis changed his cash account into a margin account. This change, even though not part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>proposed amended complaint, only corrects a minor factual allegation and does not alter the scope or theory of Gilmore\u2019s claims. It does not warrant the revival of Shearson\u2019s motion to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court, refusing to compel arbitration of the common law claims .asserted in Gilmore\u2019s amended complaint, is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-12\">. Travis has not appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b197-5\">. We note that the Judicial Conference of the United States expressed its support for a bill in the 99th Congress that would clarify this area to a great extent. The Report of the Proceedings of the Judicial Conference of the United States, held September 18-19, 1986, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN\">ARBITRATION APPEALS H.R. 4975, 99th Congress would amend the United States Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. 1 <em>et. seq </em>) (1) to clarify the appeals doctrine in this area, which is confused and irrational; and (2) to respond to the needs of arbitration as a system of dispute resolution by generally denying immediate appeals from orders giving arbitration precedence over litigation and permitting immediate appeals from orders giving litigation precedence over arbitration. The Conference considered this a sensible approach and voted to support the legislation.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b199-7\">. The record in the district court on various discovery motions, including sanctions against Shearson, is extensive. Gilmore's brief states that the cost to him of proceedings to date exceeds $217,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
