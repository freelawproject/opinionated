New York State, by its Commissioner of Social Services, Cesar A. Perales, petitions for review of a decision of the Health Care Financing Administration (the HCFA) of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, disapproving New York State Medicaid Plan Amendment 83-12 (the Amendment), concerning a proposed allocation of the cost of psychiatric outpatient care. Because we find that the Secretary\u2019s decision was within the scope of his authority, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">The Medicaid program was enacted to provide federal assistance to states that reimburse health care providers for the costs of medical treatment of needy individuals. <em>Harris v. McRae, </em>448 U.S. 297, 301, 100 S.Ct. 2671, 2680, 65 L.Ed.2d 784 (1980). A state that chooses to participate in the Medicaid program must submit a plan describing the types of care the program will cover and the rates at which health care providers will be reimbursed for their services. If the Secretary of Health and Human Services approves the plan, the state becomes eligible for federal funds. <em>Florence Nightingale Nursing Home v. Perales, </em>782 F.2d 26, 27 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 107 S.Ct. 68, 93 L.Ed.2d 26 (1986). A state\u2019s plan may provide coverage for numerous types of care, such as inpatient and outpatient hospital services, X-rays, dental services, physical therapy and prescription drugs and devices, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(a)(l)-(18). The state must establish a reimbursement rate for each service provided, in accordance with federal guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-15\">On June 30, 1983 the State submitted a revised rate-setting method for its psychiatric hospitals \u2014 the Amendment \u2014 to the HCFA. The Amendment provided that the unreimbursed costs incurred by the hospitals in furnishing outpatient care to former psychiatric inpatients would be included in the Medicaid reimbursement rate for inpatient services. On August 12, 1983, an associate regional administrator of the HCFA advised the State that his office would recommend that the Amendment be disapproved. On October 3, 1983, the HCFA officially rejected the Amendment. The State filed a timely request for review, and on July 3, 1986, the HCFA administrator affirmed the disapproval of the Amendment. The July 3 determination was the final decision of the Secretary, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-16\">Both sides to the dispute concede that the Amendment\u2019s validity depends on construction of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A), which sets the standards for state Medicaid plans covering inpatient costs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The crux <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>of the dispute is whether that provision allows a State plan for medical assistance, in setting the rate of reimbursement for inpatient care, to include outpatient costs that are a likely consequence of the inpatient treatment. In defending the Amendment, the State relies on the statutory requirement that its rate-setting methodology \u201ctake into account the situation of hospitals which serve a disproportionate number of low income patients,\u201d \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A). Having determined that all of its psychiatric hospitals serve a \u201cdisproportionate number of low income patients,\u201d the State contends that outpatient care, for which low income patients will be unable to pay, will inevitably be required following inpatient psychiatric treatment and, indeed, seems to prevent further, more expensive inpatient treatment. Therefore, it argues, to \u201ctake into account the situation\u201d of these hospitals, the costs of the outpatient care should be included in calculating the repayment rate for the inpatient care.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">As a preliminary matter, we note that \u201ccourts must exhibit particular deference to the Secretary\u2019s position with respect to legislation as intricate as [the Medicaid statute].\u201d <em>DeJesus v. Perales, </em>770 F.2d 316, 327 (2d Cir.1985) (Friendly, J.) (citing <em>Connecticut Dep\u2019t of Income Maintenance v. Heckler, </em>471 U.S. 524, 532, 105 S.Ct. 2210, 2215, 85 L.Ed.2d 577 (1985)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 3301, 92 L.Ed.2d 715 (1986). As the Supreme Court recently held, \u201c[T]he court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress. If, however ... the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-82, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) (footnotes omitted). The Secretary\u2019s view that only inpatient costs may be reimbursed under section 1396a(a)(13)(A) is demonstrated not only by the agency\u2019s decision in this case, but also by the guiding federal regulations for that section, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 447.250-447.256, that repeatedly refer to payment for \u201cinpatient hospital services.\u201d E.g., 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.-253(b)(l)(i). Thus, the court in <em>Michigan Hosp. Ass\u2019n v. Department of Social Services, </em>555 F.Supp. 675, 677 (E.D.Mich.1983), adopted the Secretary\u2019s position that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A) does not cover outpatient services. See also, <em>Kean v. Heckler, </em>799 F.2d 895, 899-902 (3d Cir.1986). We must follow the Secretary\u2019s construction of section 1396a(a)(13)(A) unless we find that it conflicts with unambiguous Congressional intent or is not \u201ca permissible construction of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">The legislative history of the statute supports the Secretary\u2019s view that outpatient costs may not be included in calculating inpatient reimbursement rates under section 1396a(a)(13)(A). The forerunner to section 1396a(a)(13)(A) allowed reimbursement for the \u201creasonable cost of inpatient hospital services,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(D) (repealed 1981), clearly excluding outpatient costs. Section 1396a(a)(13)(A) instead permits reimbursement of \u201ccosts which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated\u201d hospitals but also retains a specific reference to inpatient services: the rates must be sufficient \u201cto provide care and services ... to assure that individuals eligible for medical assistance have reasonable access ... to inpatient hospital services of adequate quality.\u201d Thus, while section 1396a(a)(13)(A) may employ more ambiguous language than its predecessor, it still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>discusses coverage of inpatient services without mention of outpatient services.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Similarly, the conference committee report on section 1396a(a)(13)(A) shows no intention by Congress to add outpatient costs to the reimbursement of inpatient costs. The conference committee report explains that section 1396a(a)(13)(A) \u201crequires that State <em>payments for inpatient hospital services </em>be \u2018reasonable and adequate/ \u201d H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 208, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 962, reprinted in 1981 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1010, 1324 (emphasis added). The legislative history is silent on adding the costs of outpatient services to the calculation. One could certainly conclude from examining the statute and the legislative history that Congress merely intended to change the standard for reimbursement for inpatient care from \u201creasonable costs\u201d to costs \u201cincurred by an efficiently and economically operated facility,\u201d and that the subject of the reimbursement \u2014 inpatient services \u2014 remained unchanged. See S. Rep. No. 139, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 478, reprinted in 1981 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 396, 744. Considering that \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A) was part of a legislative effort to reduce Medicaid costs, creatively viewing it to include outpatient costs that were formerly excluded would be a strained interpretation. See S. Rep. No. 139, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 474, reprinted in 1981 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 396, 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">The structure of the statute provides further support for the Secretary\u2019s position. Reimbursement for outpatient services is covered elsewhere in the statute by a general provision requiring reimbursement at rates \u201cconsistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(30). The Secretary\u2019s regulations implementing section 1396a(a)(30), 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 447.300-447.334, explicitly refer to outpatient services and, indeed, set a ceiling on reimbursement for outpatient services. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.321. Allowing the State to reimburse outpatient costs through section 1396a(a)(13)(A) would circumvent section 1396a(a)(30): Since the Amendment would include <em>unreimbursed </em>outpatient costs in setting inpatient rates, the ceiling on outpatient costs would be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">Thus, we cannot say that the statute unambiguously supports the State or that the Secretary\u2019s construction is impermissible. Therefore, we must defer to the Secretary\u2019s view that outpatient costs may not be included in calculating reimbursement rates under section 1396a(a)(13)(A). See <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc., </em>467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. at 2781-82. Of course, the advisability of reimbursing hospitals for followup outpatient care of psychiatric patients, and whether the State can have the outpatient reimbursement rate for such patients increased, are not issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">The State\u2019s other contentions require little discussion. The former section of the statute setting inpatient rates required that the plan \u201cbe developed by the State and reviewed and approved by the Secretary.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(D). The new section requires rates \u201cwhich the State finds, and makes assurances satisfactory to the Secretary,\u201d meet statutory levels. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A). The State contends that this change limits the scope of the Secretary\u2019s review to the actual rates, rather than the underlying rate-setting methodology. The language of section 1396a(a)(13)(A) does not support such a narrow view of the Secretary\u2019s authority. Moreover, a broader view of the Secretary\u2019s role is clearly supported by the federal regulations, which require that the state plan \u201cspecify comprehensively the methods and standards used by the agency,\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.252, and that the state make assurances satisfactory to the HCFA each time it changes its \u201cmethods and standards,\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.253.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">Finally, the State suggests that the Amendment should be \u201cdeemed accepted\u201d because the Secretary did not reject it within 60 days of its submission. Although the statute allows the Secretary 90 days to reject a plan, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1316(a)(1), 1396n(f), a temporary federal regulation, in effect at the time the Amendment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>submitted, required that assurances supporting a state Medicaid plan be accepted or rejected within 60 days. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.256(a) (1983), 46 Fed.Reg. 47964, 47972 (1981). The Amendment was submitted on July 5, 1983 and officially rejected on October 3, 1983, a span of 90 days. On August 12, 1983, however, the HCFA notified the State that its Amendment, and the assurances supporting it, faced disapproval since \u201cthe addition of outpatient services costs as allowable costs in the determination of inpatient hospital rates does not comply with the requirements [of section 1396a(a)(13)(A) ] because the costs do not constitute costs relative to the provision of the inpatient hospital care and services.\u201d Thus, the State was on notice within 60 days that its plan would be rejected. Even if this notice was not in strict compliance with the regulation, it constituted actual notice sufficient to render the error harmless. See <em>Small Refiner Lead Phase-Down Task Force v. United States Envtl. Protection Agency, </em>705 F.2d 506, 549 (D.C.Cir.1983); cf. <em>Whelan v. Brinegar, </em>538 F.2d 924, 927 (2d Cir.1976) (per curiam). Moreover, a separate federal regulation vests the Secretary with continuing authority to determine the approvability of a State plan. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.3(c). See <em>Minnesota v. Heckler, </em>779 F.2d 1335, 1338-39 (8th Cir.1985). Therefore, even if the Amendment were \u201cdeemed approved,\u201d the October 3 decision served to revoke that approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the determination of the Secretary is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-10\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-11\">A State plan for medical assistance must\u2014 ...
