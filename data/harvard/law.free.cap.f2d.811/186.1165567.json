The district court ruled that the SBA possesses a valid lien on the proceeds of Prudential Insurance Company Policy No. 25 905 442 which survived the Lellocks\u2019 bankruptcy proceedings. The Estate contends that there was no \u201clien\u201d on the policy within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(31) (Supp.III 1985) and that even if there was a lien, there was no \u201cproperty\u201d in existence at the time of the filing of the bankruptcy petition or within 180 days thereafter to which the alleged lien could attach. We find the Estate\u2019s contentions without merit, and thus we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">In August, 1980, Roger Lellock applied for a loan with the National Bank of the Commonwealth (National Bank). The National Bank asked the SBA to guarantee 90% of the $250,000 loan that the Bank was willing to make to Lellock and Lellock Motor Sales. The SBA agreed on the condition that Lellock provide, as collateral for the loan guarantee, an \u201c[assignment of life insurance on Roger A. Lellock in the amount of $165,000.00 which shall be decreasing term unless SBA approved an existing permanent type insurance.\u201d SBA Loan Authorization and Agreement at 2. The SBA approved as collateral a life insurance policy (No. 25 905 442) on Roger Lellock by Prudential Insurance Company of America which had previously been issued in March, 1980. Thereafter, in October, 1980 the National Bank made the loan to Lellock and he, in turn, assigned the proceeds of the insurance policy to the National Bank. Leah Lellock, Roger\u2019s wife and the named beneficiary of the policy also signed the assignment. The assignment was absolute and transferred to the National Bank \u201call rights, benefits, and advantages to be had or derived therefrom including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the right at any time to exercise the loan provisions thereof or to surrender the same for its cash value even though the assignment may be for collateral security only.\u201d Policy Assignment to National Bank at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Lellock later defaulted on the loan and thus, in June, 1982, the National Bank requested the SBA to honor its loan guarantee. On July 12, 1982, the SBA paid $210,-464.74 to the National Bank, thereby purchasing the loan. This amount constituted 90% of the unpaid balance of the principal plus interest due the National Bank on the SBA-insured loan to Roger Lellock, trading as Lellock Motor Sales. Consequently, on October 5, 1982 the National Bank assigned the proceeds of the Prudential policy on Lellock to the SBA, transferring \u201call of its right, title and interest\u201d in the loan and the insurance policy. Policy Assignment to SBA at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">On February 14, 1983, Roger and Leah Lellock filed a Petition for Relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and listed the loan by the National Bank as a debt for $308,976.20. The Prudential Life Insurance policy on Lellock\u2019s life, however, was not listed in the debtors' petition, either as security or as property, nor was the SBA named as one of their creditors. On August 19, 1983, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania granted a discharge of the Lellocks\u2019 debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The life insurance policy on Lellock\u2019s life remained in effect with Lellock paying the annual policy premiums until his death on February 2, 1985. No other assignment of the policy was ever made. Upon Lellock\u2019s death, both his widow, Leah and the SBA claimed the proceeds of the policy No. 25 905 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Thereafter, on May 1, 1985 the Estate of Roger Lellock brought this action against the Prudential Insurance Company of America, and the United States of America, the SBA, in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, claiming the proceeds of the insurance policy on Roger Lellock\u2019s life. Upon the government\u2019s motion, on May 23, 1985 the case was removed to the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. On September 10, 1985 the district court dismissed the complaint as to Prudential upon its payment of the policy proceeds to the Clerk of the Court. On May 8, 1986 the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the United States of America, the SBA. It held that although the underlying debt that the assignment of the policy secured was discharged, the lien against it survived the Lellocks\u2019 bankruptcy discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">On appeal, the Estate\u2019s contentions are twofold: 1) there was no \u201clien\u201d against the life insurance policy within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(31); and 2) even if there was a lien, there was no \u201cproperty\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>which the alleged lien could attach because the insurance policy proceeds did not come into existence until Lellock\u2019s death which was not within 180 days of the filing of the bankruptcy petition. Thus, the Estate seemingly argues that the assignment of the insurance policy to the SBA was extinguished when the underlying debt was extinguished at the bankruptcy discharge. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The Bankruptcy Code defines a lien as a \u201ccharge against or interest in property to secure payment of a debt or performance of an obligation.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(31) (Supp.III 1985). The Estate urges that because the underlying debt was extinguished, Lellock was no longer obligated to make any payment to the National Bank or to the SBA and thus, there was no lien against the Prudential insurance policy. This argument, however, ignores the line of bankruptcy cases which hold that although an underlying debt is discharged in bankruptcy, the lien created before bankruptcy against property to secure that debt survives. <em>See United Presidential Life Ins. Co. v. Barker, </em>31 B.R. 145 (N.D.Tex. 1983) and the cases cited therein. We agree with the district court\u2019s analysis in <em>Estate of Roger Lellock v. Prudential Insurance Company of America, </em>No. 85-1242 (W.D.Pa. May 8, 1986) on this point. Section 506(d) controls and states:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">(d) To the extent that a lien secures a claim against the debtor that is not an allowed secured claim, such lien is void, unless\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">(1) such claim was disallowed only under section 502(b)(5) or 502(e) of this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">(2) such claim is not an allowed secured claim due only to the failure of any entity to file a proof of such claim under section 501 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(d) (Supp.III 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">Additionally, the legislative history of the original section 506(d) specifically states that \u201csubsection (d) permits liens to pass through the bankruptcy case unaffected.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 357 (1977), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, 5963, 6313. Similarly, section 522 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-13\">(c) Unless the case is dismissed, property exempted under this section is not liable during or after the case for any debt of the debtor that arose, ... before the commencement of the case, except\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-14\">(2) a lien that is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-15\">(A) not avoided under section 544, 545, 547, 548, 549, or 724(a) of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-16\">(B) not voided under section 506(d) of this title;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-17\">Also, the legislative history of section 522 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-18\">The bankruptcy discharge will not prevent enforcement of valid liens ... on nonexempt property as well as on exempt property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-19\">H.R.Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 361 (1977), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, 5963, 6317; <em>see also </em>S.Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 76, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, 5787, 5862.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-20\">It is undisputed that in the instant case, the Lellocks did not list the proceeds of the life insurance policy as part of their estate in bankruptcy. <em>United Presidential </em>is directly in point.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, as in <em>United Presi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number><em>dential, </em>the debtor assigned a life insurance policy to a bank as security for a debt. Thereafter, the debtor filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 and his debts were discharged. Upon the debtor\u2019s death both his widow and the bank claimed the proceeds of the life insurance policy. The <em>United Presidential </em>court held that because neither the debtors nor the bank requested allowance or disallowance of the bank\u2019s lien, it \u201cpassed through bankruptcy unaffected.\u201d <em>United Presidential, </em>31 B.R. at 147. While a minority of opinions have held that prefiling liens of secured creditors which are not disallowed or avoided in bankruptcy proceedings do not survive a bankruptcy discharge of the underlying debt <em>(see In re Ray, </em>26 B.R. 534 (Bankr.D. Kan.1983); <em>In re Williams, </em>9 B.R. 228 (Bankr.D.Kan.1981)) we decline to follow this line of reasoning as it is clearly repugnant to bankruptcy policy. <em>See </em>3 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00a7 524.01, n. 176 (15th ed. 1983). We instead follow the majority of courts which hold that the Bankruptcy Code and its legislative history plainly establish the better rule of law \u2014 that valid liens that have not been disallowed or avoided survive the bankruptcy discharge of the underlying debt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., In re Landmark, </em>48 B.R. 626 (Bankr.D.Minn.1985); <em>In re Atoka Agricultural Systems, Inc., </em>39 B.R. 474 (Bankr.E.D.Va.1984); <em>United Presidential Life Ins. Co. v. Barker, </em>31 B.R. 145 (N.D.Tex.1983); <em>In re Weathers, </em>15 B.R. 945 (Bankr.D.Kan.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Further, the Estate argues that neither as of the date of the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy discharge, nor as of 180 days of the filing of the bankruptcy petition, did any property exist to which the lien could attach. In essence, the Estate contends that because the proceeds of a life insurance policy are not payable until death, the property interest in those proceeds does not exist until then. Consequently, the real issue is whether an unmatured life insurance policy constitutes property within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code. We hold that an insurance policy is property of the estate within 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(1) (1982 &amp; Supp.III 1985) \u201ceven though the policy has not matured, has no cash surrender value and is otherwise contingent.\u201d <em>In re McCulloch &amp; Son, Inc., </em>30 B.R. 7, 8 (Bankr.D.Or.1983); <em>accord In re Hettling, </em>175 F. 65, 66 (2d Cir.1909); <em>Mutual Trust Life Ins. Co. v. Wemyss, </em>309 F.Supp. 1221, 1228 (D.Me.1970); <em>see also Bank of Minden v. Clement, </em>256 U.S. 126, 128, 41 S.Ct. 408, 65 L.Ed. 857 (1921); <em>Lincoln Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co. v. Scales, </em>62 F.2d 582, 584-85 (5th Cir.1933). Thus, a lien could certainly attach to the unmatured policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Similarly, the Estate\u2019s argument that the Lellocks did not have a property interest in the life insurance policy within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(5)(C) but rather acquired it after 180 days of the filing of the petition, thereby triggering 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a), is without merit. Section 541(a)(5)(C) of the Bankruptcy Code states that, <em>inter alia, </em>the following is property of an estate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>(5) An interest in property that would have been property of the estate if such interest had been an interest of the debt- or on the date of the filing of the petition, and that the debtor acquires or becomes entitled to acquire within 180 days after such date\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">(C) as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy or of a death benefit plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(5)(C) (1982 &amp; Supp.III 1985). Obviously, this section does not create an interest on the part of the debtor but rather includes as part of the estate a debtor\u2019s contingent interests \u2014 as beneficiary \u2014 which mature within 180 days of the filing of the petition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The absolute assignment of the life insurance policy to National Bank on October 81, 1980 transferred all of the Lellocks\u2019 right, title and interest in the policy. Thus, the SBA had title to the policy which most certainly constitutes an \u201cinterest\u201d in the property. Indeed the fact that the policy is the property of the SBA <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> obviates the need for the policy to pass through the Lellocks\u2019 bankruptcy at all. <em>See Lincoln Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co. v. Scales, </em>62 F.2d 582, 583-84 (5th Cir.1933); <em>In re Cooper\u2019s Estate, </em>28 F.2d 438, 439-40 (D.Md.1928); 4A Collier on Bankruptcy \u00a7 70.23[5] (14th ed. 1978). Consequently, we find that as of the date of the filing of the petition and throughout the 180 days thereafter, the Lellocks had no interest \u2014 contingent or otherwise \u2014 in the life insurance policy. Because the policy was never reassigned to them, they never reacquired an interest in it.</p>\n<p id=\"A0Y\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">We conclude that the lien on the life insurance policy (No. 25 905 442) survived the Lellocks\u2019 bankruptcy discharge and thus the SBA was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. The judgment will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\">. Section 506(d) was amended by the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-353, 98 Stat. 333. Before the 1984 amendments, section 506(d) read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">To the extent that a lien secures a claim against a debtor that is not an allowed secured claim, such lien is void, unless</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq7\">(1) a party in interest has not requested that the court determine and allow or disallow such claim under section 502 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(d)(l)(1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-21\">The instant case is governed by the 1984 version that is effective as to cases filed 90 days after the date of enactment, July 10, 1984. <em>See </em>section 553(a) of Pub.L. No. 98-353, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 note (Supp.III 1985). The changes in \u00a7 506(d), however, were not substantive in nature <em>(see In re Everett, </em>48 B.R. 618 (Bankr.E.D. Pa. 1985)) and thus, the result in the present case would be the same under either version.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-22\">. The Estate attempts to distinguish <em>United Presidential </em>by pointing to the fact that there, unlike in the present case, the discharged creditor con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>tinued to pay the premiums on the life insurance policy at issue. We see no relevancy to this distinction. The Lellocks might arguably be entitled to reimbursement for the premiums paid but not to the proceeds that they assigned away. <em>See, e.g., In re Fount-Wip Distributors, Inc., 4 </em>B.R. 424, 425, 428 (Bankr.D.N.J.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The Estate also distinguishes the cases cited in <em>United Presidential </em>as dealing with liens against tangible, \"existing\u201d property of the debtor\u2019s estate. <em>See </em>Estate\u2019s Brief at 11-12. As we demonstrate <em>infra, </em>we conclude that an interest in a nonmatured life insurance policy is an \u201cinterest\u201d cognizable under the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\">. Equity also dictates this result. The SBA paid $210,464.74 to the National Bank upon the Lellocks\u2019 default on their loan. If the debtors had listed the life insurance policy as collateral for the loan or as an asset of their estate in bankruptcy, the policy would not have been considered exempt property <em>(see </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(d)(7) (1982 &amp; Supp.III 1985); 42 Pa.Cons. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 8124(c) (Purdon 1982 &amp; Supp. 1986)). Further, the Lellocks did not pursue the appropriate remedy in bankruptcy. They failed to seek a disallowance of the SBA\u2019s claim to the policy during their bankruptcy proceeding. To rule that the Estate is now entitled to the proceeds of the insurance policy would allow the Lellocks to achieve by omission what they failed to pursue in bankruptcy \u2014 the conversion of the non-exempt policy to themselves.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b276-8\">.
