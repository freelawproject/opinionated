In a medical malpractice suit, plaintiff-appellant Peter Ricciardi attempted to introduce into evidence on various grounds a note entered into his medical chart stating that an unscheduled event occurred while he was undergoing surgery. The physician who made the entry did not have personal knowledge of the event and could not recall the source of the information. Ricciardi appeals the district court\u2019s rulings that the note was inadmissible hearsay and that his expert witness would not be allowed to rely on the note in forming an opinion as to the cause of Ricciardi\u2019s injuries. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">On July 11, 1979, Ricciardi underwent surgery at the Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center (the Hospital) in Boston, Massachusetts, for the replacement of his aortic valve. He suffered neurological difficulties after the operation because, according to him, someone was negligent during his operation. He brought a malpractice suit against the Hospital, surgeons William Norwood and Rosalyn Sterling, and the anesthesiologist, \u201cJohn Doe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Ricciardi\u2019s only proof of negligence was a note dated July 13, 1979, two days after the operation, entered into his medical chart by Dr. Krishna Nirmel, a neurology resident at the Hospital. The note, contained in a three-page handwritten consultant\u2019s report, said: \u201cduring surg. episode of aortic cannula accidently out x 40-60 secs.\u201d An aortic cannula provides a means of circulating blood from the heart-lung machine back into the body when the heart is being bypassed for surgery. The note was the basis for Ricciardi\u2019s theory that a cannula being used during his operation came out because of someone\u2019s negligence and an air embolus was introduced into his blood stream. Dr. Nirmel, however, did not have personal knowledge of the alleged event and did not know where he obtained the information he recorded in the note. He said he usually spoke with the nurses and staff attending to the patient before, during, and after surgery, but in this instance he could not recall speaking with any members of the surgical team. He assumed that he obtained the information from \u201cprofessional people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">At pretrial the case was defined as involving only two issues: (1) whether the cannula came out; and if so, (2) whether this caused Ricciardi\u2019s injuries. The note, therefore, was crucial to Ricciardi\u2019s case. The district court rejected his various attempts to introduce the note at trial. The court ruled that the note was hearsay not within any exceptions and that it did not become an adoptive admission of party-opponent Dr. Norwood when he heard of it. The court also refused to allow Ricciardi\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Harold Kay, to rely on the note in forming his opinion about the cause of Ricciardi\u2019s injuries. Because there was no other evidence of negligence, the court directed a verdict for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">II. THE EVIDENTIARY RULINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b106-14\">Dr. Nirmel\u2019s note clearly is hearsay. It is a statement made by someone other than the declarant offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The note, therefore, is not admissible evidence unless it comes within an exception to the general rule excluding hearsay. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 802. Ricciardi argues that the note is admissible on five grounds: (1) under the hearsay exception provided in the Massachusetts hospital records statute, Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 233, \u00a7 79 (West 1986); (2) as a record of a regularly conducted activity under Fed.R.Evid. 803(6); (3) as a recorded recollection under Fed.R. Evid. 803(5); (4) as a statement not specifically covered by other exceptions under Fed.R.Evid. 803(24); and (5) as an adoptive admission by party-opponent Dr. Norwood under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(B). Ricciardi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>also contends that the court erred when it refused to allow his expert witness to rely on the note in forming an expert opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\n<em>A. The Massachusetts Statute and Federal Rule 803(6)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 233, \u00a7 79, provides a hearsay exception for certain hospital records required to be kept by law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties agreed that this statute had \u201cat least something to do with the admissibility of this particular note.\u201d The court then considered whether the note fit within the state exception and concluded that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The correlative Federal Rule governing the admissibility of hospital records is Rule 803(6), the hearsay exception for records of a regularly conducted activity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In general, the Federal Rules apply to all cases in the district courts, including diversity actions. <em>McInnis v. A.M.F., Inc., </em>765 F.2d 240, 245 (1st Cir.1985); Fed.R.Evid. 1101(b). Congress\u2019 power to promulgate rules of evidence for use in federal court, even though they may differ from state rules, has been established since <em>Hanna v. Plumer, </em>380 U.S. 460, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 14 L.Ed.2d 8 (1965). \u201cOf course, federal courts and Congress are constitutionally precluded from displacing state substantive law with federal substantive rules in diversity actions.\u201d <em>McInnis v. A.M.F., Inc., </em>765 F.2d at 244. The question here, then, is whether application of the federal business records exception impinges on some substantive state policy embodied in the state rule. We do not see how applying the federal rule in this case would be such an intrusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, in construing its statute, said that \u201c[apparently the legislation making this hearsay evidence admissible was enacted primarily to relieve the physicians and nurses of public hospitals from the hardship and inconvenience of attending court as witnesses to facts which ordinarily would be found recorded in the hospital books.\u201d <em>Leonard v. Boston Elevated Ry., </em>234 Mass. 480, 482, 125 N.E. 593, 593 (1920). Arguably, all hearsay exceptions are premised on a conclusion that the utility and reliability of certain kinds of hearsay outweigh the difficulties and burdens of obtaining the declarant\u2019s testimony. Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>though the federal rule is not specifically aimed at hospital records, it provides a hearsay exception for records kept in the course of <em>any </em>regularly conducted business activity, which would include publicly supported hospitals. The federal rule, therefore, is consistent with the state legislature\u2019s concern about the undue burden of requiring medical personnel in publicly supported hospitals to testify despite the availability and usual reliability of regularly kept records.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Moreover, the statute functionally is evidentiary in nature. The Supreme Judicial Court described it \u201cin effect\u201d as an exception to the hearsay rule that \u201callows admission of the substantive content of hospital records because of the presumption of reliability which attaches to statements relating to treatment and medical history in these records.\u201d <em>Bouchie v. Murray, </em>376 Mass. 524, 527-28, 381 N.E.2d 1295, 1298 (1978). The federal rule does the same thing. <em>See </em>4 J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, <em>Weinstein\u2019s Evidence </em>\u00b6 803(6)[01], at 803-175 (1985); <em>Bouchie v. Murray, </em>376 Mass, at 528, 381 N.E.2d at 1295 (Supreme Judicial Court cited to federal cases and commentary concerning Rule 803(6) in construing the purpose of the state hospital records exception). In fact, these two rules are very similar in application. In this case, the note is inadmissible under both rules. Therefore, even if we could discern some substantive policy at stake in the state hospital records exception, there would be no conflict with that policy in applying the federal rule here.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The Supreme Judicial Court has recommended a four-part analysis for determining the admissibility of hospital records under the state rule. <em>Bouchie v. Murray, </em>376 Mass, at 531, 381 N.E.2d at 1300. \u201cFirst, the document must be the type of record contemplated by [Mass.Gen.Laws ch.] 233, \u00a7 79.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There is no dispute that Dr. Nirmel\u2019s consultation report, ip which the note was contained, was such a document. \u201cSecond, the information must be germane to the patient\u2019s treatment or medical history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court concluded that the note would be germane to Ricciardi\u2019s care and treatment plan because it would be of some help in identifying the cause of his problem. We agree. \u201cThird, the information must be recorded from the personal knowledge of the entrant or from a compilation of the personal knowledge of those who are under a medical obligation to transmit such information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court correctly ruled that this requirement was not met because Dr. Nirmel did not have personal knowledge of the event he recorded, nor had it been shown that he obtained his information from someone with an obligation to supply it. A transcribed note of unknown origins does not \u201cpossess the characteristics justifying the presumption of reliability\u201d normally accorded hospital records. <em>Id. </em>at 528, 381 N.E.2d at 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Under the fourth part of the analysis, the Supreme Judicial Court instructed that if the information was not recorded from personal knowledge, but instead was volunteered by a third person, the statements \u201care not admissible unless they are offered for reasons other than to prove the truth of the matter contained therein or, if offered for their truth, come within another exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531, 381 N.E.2d at 1300. Simply stated, such information is only admissible if it would come in on some other basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The same result is reached under the business records exception in the Federal Rules. To be admissible under Rule 803(6), the entry in the record must be the opinion or diagnosis of the physician who made it or of some other \u201cperson with knowledge.\u201d In <em>Petrocelli v. Gallison, </em>679 F.2d 286 (1st Cir.1982), this court considered the admissibility of parts of a hospital record describing an event during an operation the patient underwent several months earlier and containing the patient\u2019s description of the cause of his pain. It was unclear whether the information originated from the reporting doctors or from the patient or his wife. <em>Id. </em>at 290. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">Given the impossibility of determining from the records themselves whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>these reports reflected medical judgments, and the lack of any corroborative evidence or testimony offered by the plaintiffs to assure the court that these were professional opinions, the district court could reasonably determine that the notations were simply too inscrutable to be admitted, bearing in mind that, if admitted under Rule 803(6), they would be admitted for their truth without any opportunity to cross-examine the physicians who made them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 291. Although Dr. Nirmel\u2019s entry did not concern an event occurring before the alleged malpractice, and there is no indication that the patient himself provided the information, the note suffers from the same critical deficiency as the entries in <em>Petrocelli: </em>the source of the information is unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Furthermore, a record is not admissible under the federal rule if \u201cthe source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 803(6). An unknown source is hardly trustworthy. <em>See Meder v. Everest &amp; Jennings, Inc., </em>637 F.2d 1182, 1187 (8th Cir.1981). Therefore, there is no conflict between the state and federal rules. The note is not admissible under either.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\n<em>B. Federal Rule 803(5)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Dr. Nirmel\u2019s inability to recall the source of the information he entered into Ricciardi\u2019s chart also is fatal to admissibility under the recorded recollections exception provided in Federal Rule 803(5).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The record must be of \u201ca matter about which a witness once had knowledge\u201d to be admissible as a recorded recollection. Fed.R. Evid. 803(5). Dr. Nirmel did not personally observe the surgery and later make a record of it. He obtained the information from someone else who may or may not have had personal knowledge of the events in the operating room. If the recorder wrote down hearsay, the hearsay itself must come within an exception to be admissible. <em>Weinstein\u2019s Evidence </em>11803(5)[01], at 803-162 to -163.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This cannot be established if the source of the information is unknown. The note, therefore, is not admissible as a recorded recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">\n<em>C. Federal Rule 803(24)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Neither is the note admissible under the residual exception provided in Federal Rule 803(24).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ricciardi argues that the district court erred by giving only \u201csuperficial and inadequate\u201d consideration to the admissibility of the note under this exception. The court\u2019s decision not to allow the note in under Rule 803(24) may have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>summary, but little explanation was needed after its extensive analysis into the trustworthiness of the note in relation to the other exceptions. Rule 803(24) applies only to statements not specifically covered by other hearsay exceptions \u201cbut having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 803(24). The note did not have such guarantees and was, therefore, not admissible under the residual exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\n<em>D. Adoptive Admission</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AnK\">Under the Federal Rules, \u201c[a] statement is not hearsay if ... [tjhe statement is offered against a party and is ... a statement of which he has manifested his adoption or belief in its truth.\u201d Fed.R. Evid. 801(d). Ricciardi contends that the note became an adoptive admission of party-opponent Dr. Norwood. According to Ricciardi, Dr. Norwood must have read the note around the time it was written, and by not objecting to it, he impliedly manifested his belief in its truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Ricciardi did not make any showing to the district court, however, of circumstances under which Dr. Norwood \u201cmanifested his adoption or belief\u201d in the note\u2019s truth. He points only to Dr. Norwood\u2019s deposition testimony, which was not before the district court and is not entitled to be considered here. <em>Thompson v. Chrysler Motors Corp., </em>755 F.2d 1162, 1174 (5th Cir. 1985) (per curiam) (on petition for a rehearing); <em>Fleming v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>547 F.2d 908, 911 (10th Cir.1977).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No other witness said anything about Dr. Norwood seeing the note or his reaction to it. Thus, there is not a sufficient basis to conclude that Dr. Norwood read the note and under the cir-</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">cumstances would have objected to it if he did not think it were true. <em>Weinstein\u2019s Evidence </em>\u00b6 801(d)(2)(B)[01], at 801-202 n. 15 (\u201cIn all cases ... the burden is on the proponent to convince the judge that in the circumstances of the case a failure to respond is so unnatural that it supports the inference that the party acquiesced in the statement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">\n<em>E. Basis for Expert Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">As an alternative basis for introducing Dr. Nirmel\u2019s note to prove that the cannula came out during surgery, Ricciardi sought to have an expert witness, Dr. Kay, rely on the statement to form an opinion that this occurred. Dr. Kay testified that there were numerous ways a potentially injurious embolus could have occurred in Ricciardi\u2019s situation. The most common way, he said, was if residual air were trapped in the chambers of the heart or in the aorta. He said it also could occur if air were introduced into the heart through a monitoring line, or through the aortic cannula when it was initially inserted, if it leaked or became disconnected, or if it came out during surgery. Dr. Kay told the court that if he could rely on Dr. Nirmel\u2019s note, it would be his opinion that the cause of the embolus was that the cannula came out. Otherwise, he would have to conclude, based on probabilities, that the cause was residual air being trapped. The court ruled that the note was too unreliable to be used as the basis of Dr. Kay\u2019s opinion and, therefore, Dr. Kay was unable to support Ricciardi\u2019s theory of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">Under the Federal Rules, an expert is not confined to admissible evidence in forming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>an opinion. Rule 703 provides that an expert may base an opinion on inadmissible facts or data if \u201cof a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject.\u201d \u201c[T]his part of the rule is designed to prevent enlarging the category of permissible data to break down the rules of exclusion unduly.\u201d <em>Almonte v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>787 F.2d 763, 770 (1st Cir.1986). It is especially important when the facts or data on which the expert seeks to rely have obvious characteristics of unreliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The \u201cfact\u201d or \u201cdatum\u201d on which Dr. Kay offered to base his opinion was not one medical experts frequently encounter. Dr. Kay said that never before had he seen such a statement in a hospital chart. Although neurological consultation reports may well be the \u201ctype\u201d of records upon which an expert would reasonably rely, there has been absolutely no showing here that unattributed material usually comprises a part of such consultative reports, or that experts in the field would rely on this kind of a statement. The evidence Ricciardi claims meets this requirement falls far short. Dr. Kay\u2019s testimony certainly does not establish that experts in the field would rely on such a note. Indeed, his characterization of the note as \u201cbizarre\u201d suggests the contrary. Ricciardi also refers to the testimony of Dr. Michael Bresnan, a pediatric neurologist at the Hospital, who said that when he examined Ricciardi he read Dr. Nirmel\u2019s report. Dr. Bresnan said he did not have any doubt about what was written in the chart and that he accepted what Dr. Nirmel wrote \u201cto be the truth as he has reported it to be.\u201d Dr. Bresnan was not asked, however, whether he accepted the note about the cannula in particular, or whether he would rely on this type of note in forming an expert opinion. Dr. Bresnan\u2019s only specific reference to the contents of Dr. Nirmel\u2019s report concerned a description of Ricciardi\u2019s difficulties and a differential diagnosis of three possible causes of them. This does not establish that experts reasonably would rely on the note about the cannula. Therefore, we hold that it was within the district court\u2019s discretion not to allow Dr. Kay to rely on the note in forming his expert opinion. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>798 F.2d 509, 517 (1st Cir.1986) (\u201cUnder Rule 703, the admission of expert testimony is a matter reserved to the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Ricciardi also argues that, in ruling that Dr. Kay could not rely on the note, the district court erroneously took into consideration that his opinion would embrace the ultimate issue in the case. Rule 704 provides that except for testimony as to the mental health or condition of a criminal defendant, \u201ctestimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d According to Ricciardi, at the end of the trial the court implied that it might have ruled differently if the opinion were not being used to prove the decisive fact in the case: that the cannula came out. We disagree. When it considered the basis for Dr. Kay\u2019s proffered opinion, the court clearly decided not to allow him to rely on the note because of its unknown origin and consequent unreliability, and we have concluded that this was within the district court\u2019s discretion. The discussion to which Ricciardi points was made in the context of the court\u2019s decision to direct a verdict for defendant. The court said that given the way the issues had been defined, the cannula coming out was \u201cthe decisive fact that determines negligence, if there was any.\u201d The court was not saying that Dr. Kay could not rely on the note to form an opinion embracing the decisive fact, but that because the note was the only evidence that did embrace the ultimate issue, and it was not admissible as evidence or properly the basis for an expert opinion, a directed verdict was in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Ricciardi\u2019s medical malpractice claim was based on a single bit of hearsay evidence: a handwritten comment from an unknown source buried in a three-page consultation report made two days after the operation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>The note did not have the circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness to justify an exception to the general rule of excluding hearsay; there was an insufficient basis to conclude that defendant Dr. Norwood manifested an adoption or belief that it was true to qualify it as an adoptive admission; and it was not established that it was the kind of information upon which an expert would reasonably rely in forming an opinion. Therefore, the note was not admissible evidence and not properly the basis for an expert opinion. We affirm the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and the directed verdict for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-8\">.

Apparently, the deposition was filed but neither offered in evidence nor brought to the district court's attention. Even if the district court had been presented with this testimony, however, we think it still would have been proper not to allow the note into evidence as an adoptive admission. During his deposition, Dr. Norwood related only vague recollections of \u201cprobably\" having read or heard about the note while on the staff at the Hospital. He said his only memory of having a reaction to it was that he was curious, but he could not remember any specific measures taken to track the information to clarify the situation. A failure to object to the information would not necessarily manifest a belief in the note\u2019s truth. A physician\u2019s first response to information suggesting a problem during surgery may be to research the matter. In this case, there were other physicians, anesthesiologists, nurses, and technicians in the operating room. Therefore, when Dr. Norwood first learned of the note, he might not have had sufficient knowledge to assess its verity and affirm or deny it. <em>See Weinstein's Evidence </em>\u00b6 801(d)(2)(B)[01], at 801-203.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
