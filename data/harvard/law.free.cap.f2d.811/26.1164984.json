Bean, Inc., was neither flattered nor amused when <em>High Society </em>magazine published a prurient parody of Bean\u2019s famous catalog. Defendant-appellant Drake Publishers, Inc., owns <em>High Society, </em>a monthly periodical featuring adult erotic entertainment. Its October 1984 issue contained a two-page article entitled \u201cL.L. Beam\u2019s Back-To-School-Sex-Catalog.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The article was labelled on the magazine\u2019s contents page as \u201chumor\u201d and \u201cparody.\" The article displayed a facsimile of Bean\u2019s trademark and featured pictures of nude models in sexually explicit positions using \u201cproducts\u201d that were described in a crudely humorous fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">L.L. Bean sought a temporary restraining order to remove the October 1984 issue from circulation. The complaint alleged trademark infringement, unfair competition, trademark dilution, deceptive trade practices, interference with prospective business advantage and trade libel. The United States District Court for the District of Maine denied Bean\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order. Thereafter, both parties sought summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Drake on the claims for trade libel and interference with prospective business advantage. It denied summary judgment to both parties on Bean\u2019s claims for trademark infringement, unfair competition and deceptive trade practices, leaving the factual question of \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d for resolution at trial. <em>L.L. Bean, Inc. v. Drake Publishers, Inc., </em>625 F.Supp. 1531 (D.Me.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-14\">The district court did, however, grant Bean summary judgment with respect to the trademark dilution claim raised under Maine law. Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 10, \u00a7 1530 (1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It ruled that the article had tarnished Bean\u2019s trademark by undermining the goodwill and reputation associated with the mark. Relying on two affidavits presented by appellee, the district court found that Bean had suffered harm from the publication of the article. The court rejected Drake\u2019s claim that the Maine statute did not encompass allegations of tarnishment caused by parody. The court also held that enjoining the publication of a parody to prevent trademark dilution did not offend the first amendment. An injunction issued prohibiting further publication or distribution of the \u201cL.L. Beam Sex Catalog.\u201d <em>L.L. Bean v. Drake Publishers, </em>625 F.Supp. at 1530. After its motion for reconsideration was denied, Drake appealed the order enjoining further publication of the Sex Catalog.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-15\">Since there are no Maine cases delineating the scope of the Maine anti-dilution statute, we do not, at this time, review the district court\u2019s ruling on the reach of the statute. Because we think it would be inappropriate for us to construe the statute in the first instance, we shall confine our review to whether the injunction offends the first amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-16\">In reviewing an appeal from an entry of summary judgment, the record must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>King v. Williams Industries, Inc., </em>724 F.2d 240, 241 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>466 U.S. 980, 104 S.Ct. 2363, 80 L.Ed.2d 835 (1984); <em>Hahn v. Sargent, </em>523 F.2d 461, 464 (1st Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 904, 96 S.Ct. 1495, 47 L.Ed.2d 754 (1976). Where, as here, both parties have moved for summary judgment, a court separately evaluates the two motions, in each instance drawing factual inferences most favorable to the opposing party. 10A C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M.K. Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2720, at 23-24 (2d ed. 1983). Since the district court rejected defendant\u2019s position that a trademark parody constituted a defense to a claim based on the anti-dilution statute, we assume, as we must for purposes of this appeal, that the article is a trademark parody.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Parody is a humorous form of social commentary and literary criticism that dates back as far as Greek antiquity. \u201cThe rhapsodists who strolled from town to town to chant the poems of Homer,\u201d wrote Issac D'Israeli, \u201cwere immediately followed by another set of strollers \u2014 buffoons who made the audiences merry by the burlesque turn which they gave to the solemn strains.\u201d I. D\u2019Israeli, <em>Curiosities of Literature, quoted in </em>D. MacDonald, <em>Parodies: An Anthology from Chaucer to Beerbohm </em>\u2014 and <em>After </em>562 (1960). The Oxford English Dictionary defines parody as \u201c[a] composition in which the characteristic turns of thought and phrase of an author are mimicked to appear ridiculous, especially by applying them to ludicrously inappropriate subjects.\u201d Chaucer, Shakespeare, Pope, Voltaire, Fielding, Hemingway and Faulkner are among the myriad of authors who have written parodies. Since parody seeks to ridicule sacred verities and prevailing mores, it inevitably offends others, as evinced by the shock which Chaucer\u2019s <em>Canterbury Tales </em>and Voltaire\u2019s <em>Candide </em>provoked among their contemporaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">A trademark is a word, name or symbol adopted and used by a manufacturer or merchant to identify goods and distinguish them from those manufactured by others. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127 (1985 Supp.). One need only open a magazine or turn on television to witness the pervasive influence of trademarks in advertising and commerce. Designer labels appear on goods ranging from handbags to chocolates to every possible form of clothing. Commercial advertising slogans, which can be registered as trademarks, have become part of national political campaigns. \u201cThus, trademarks have become a natural target of satirists who seek to comment on this integral part of the national culture.\u201d Dorsen, <em>Satiric Appropriation and the Law of Libel, Trademark and Copyright: Remedies Without Wrongs, </em>65 B.U.L.Rev. 923, 939 (1986); Note, <em>Trademark Parody: A Fair Use and First Amendment Analysis, </em>72 Va.L. Rev. 1079 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The ridicule conveyed by parody inevitably conflicts with one of the underlying purposes of the Maine anti-dilution statute, which is to protect against the tamishment of the goodwill and reputation associated with a particular trademark. <em>Pignons, S.A. de Mecanique de Precision v. Polaroid Corp., </em>657 F.2d 482, 494-95 (1st Cir. 1981). The court below invoked this purpose as the basis for its decision to issue an injunction. The issue before us is whether enjoining the publication of appellant\u2019s parody violates the first amendment guarantees of freedom of expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">The district court disposed of the first amendment concerns raised in this matter by relying on the approach taken in <em>Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc. v. Pussycat Cinema, Ltd., </em>604 F.2d 200 (2d Cir.1979). In rejecting Drake\u2019s claim that the first amendment protects the unauthorized use of another\u2019s trademark in the process of conveying a message, the district court cited the following language from <em>Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\u201cPlaintiffs trademark is in the nature of a property right, ... and as such it need not \u2018yield to the exercise of First Amendment rights under circumstances where adequate alternative avenues of communication exist.\u2019 <em>Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, </em>407 U.S. 551 [92 S.Ct. 2219, 33 L.Ed.2d 131] (1972).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-5\"><em>L.L. Bean v. Drake, </em>625 F.Supp. at 1537 (quoting <em>Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, </em>604 F.2d at 206).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">We do not believe that the first amendment concerns raised here can be resolved as easily as was done in <em>Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. Cf. </em>Dorsen, <em>Satiric Appropriation, </em>65 B.U.L.Rev. at 951; Denicola, <em>Trademarks As Speech: Constitutional Implications of the Emerging Rationales for the Protection of Trade Symbols, </em>1982 Wis.L.Rev. 158, 206 (\u201cthe sweeping rejection of the defendant\u2019s first amendment claim in <em>Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders </em>is dangerously simplistic.\u201d). Aside from our doubts about whether there are alternative means of parodying plaintiff\u2019s catalog, we do not think the court fully assessed the nature of a trademark owner\u2019s property rights. A trademark is a form of intellectual property; the Supreme Court case, <em>Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, </em>407 U.S. 551, 92 S.Ct. 2219, 33 L.Ed.2d 131 (1972), relied upon by the <em>Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders </em>court involved a shopping center. The first amendment issues involved in this case cannot be disposed of by equating the rights of a trademark owner with the rights of an owner of real property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\"><em>[TJrademark is not property in the ordinary sense </em>but only a word or symbol indicating the origin of a commercial product. The owner of the mark acquires the right to prevent the goods to which the mark is applied from being confused with those of others and to prevent his own trade from being diverted to competitors through their use of misleading marks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-8\"><em>Power Test Petroleum Distributors v. Calcu Gas, </em>754 F.2d 91, 97 (2d Cir.1985) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Industrial Rayon Corp. v. Dutchess Underwear Corp., </em>92 F.2d 33, 35 (2d Cir.1937), <em>cert. denied, </em>303 U.S. 640, 58 S.Ct. 610, 82 L.Ed. 1100 (1938)). <em>Accord Dresser Industries, Inc. v. Heraeus Engelhard Vacuum, Inc., </em>395 F.2d 457 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 934, 89 S.Ct. 293, 21 L.Ed.2d 270 (1968); <em>Lucasfilm Ltd. v. High Frontier, </em>622 F.Supp. 931 (D.D.C.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">The limits on the scope of a trademark owner\u2019s property rights was considered recently in <em>Lucasfilm Ltd. v. High Frontier, supra. </em>In that case, the owners of the trademark \u201cStar Wars\u201d alleged injury from public interest groups that used the term in commercial advertisements presenting their views on President Reagan\u2019s Strategic Defense Initiative. Judge Gesell stressed that the sweep of a trademark owner\u2019s rights extends only to injurious, unauthorized <em>commercial uses </em>of the mark by another. 622 F.Supp. at 933-35. Trademark rights do not entitle the owner to quash an unauthorized use of the mark by another who is communicating ideas or expressing points of view. <em>Id. </em>As Justice Holmes observed while sitting on the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, \u201cWhen the common law developed the doctrine of trademarks and trade-names, it was not creating a property in advertisements more absolute than it would have allowed the author of <em>Paradise Lost.\u201d Chadwick v. Covell, </em>151 Mass. 190, 193, 23 N.E. 1068, 1069 (1890).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">The, limits imposed on a trademark owner\u2019s property rights demonstrate that the constitutional issue raised here cannot be dispensed with by simply asserting that Bean\u2019s property right need not yield to the exercise of first amendment rights. <em>L.L. Bean v. Drake, </em>625 F.Supp. at 1537. We turn now to an examination of whether the Constitution prohibits the application of Maine\u2019s anti-dilution statute as construed by the district court to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">The concept of trademark dilution originated in England when a British court protected the trademark \u201cKodak\u201d from being used on bicycles. Derenberg, <em>The Problem </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number><em>of Trademark Dilution and Anti-Dilution Statutes, </em>44 Calif.L.Rev. 439 (1956). Anti-dilution statutes have developed to fill a void left by the failure of trademark infringement law to curb the unauthorized use of marks where there is no likelihood of confusion between the original use and the infringing use. The law of trademark dilution aims to protect the distinctive quality of a trademark from deterioration caused by its use on dissimilar products. <em>Pro-phy-lac-tic Brush Co. v. Jordan Marsh, </em>165 F.2d 549, 553 (1st Cir.1948); <em>Community Federal Sav. and Loan Ass\u2019n v. Orondorff, </em>678 F.2d 1034 (11th Cir.1982); <em>BiRite Enterprises, Inc. v. Button Master, </em>555 F.Supp. 1188, 1196 (S.D.N.Y.1983); 2 J.T. McCarthy, <em>Trademarks and Unfair Competition </em>\u00a7 24.13 (1973). The dilution injury \u201cis the gradual whittling away or dispersion of the identity and hold upon the public mind of the mark or name by its use on non-competing goods.\u201d Schechter, <em>The Rational Basis of Trademark Protection, </em>40 Harv.L.Rev. 813, 825 (1927). The overriding purpose of anti-dilution statutes is to prohibit a merchant of noncompetitive goods from selling its products by trading on the goodwill and reputation of another\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">A trademark owner may obtain relief under an anti-dilution statute if his mark is distinctive and there is a likelihood of dilution due to (1) injury to the value of the mark caused by actual or potential confusion, (2) diminution in the uniqueness and individuality of the mark, or (3) injury re-suiting from use of the mark in a manner that tarnishes or appropriates the goodwill and reputation associated with plaintiff's mark. <em>Astra Pharmaceutical Prod. v. Beckman Instruments, </em>718 F.2d 1201, 1209 (1st Cir.1983); <em>Pignons, S.A. de Mecanique de Precision v. Polaroid Corp., </em>657 F.2d at 494-95. There is no dispute that Bean\u2019s mark is distinctive. The basis for the district court\u2019s injunction was that Bean\u2019s trademark had been tarnished by the parody in defendant\u2019s magazine. We think this was a constitutionally impermissible application of the anti-dilution statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">The district court believed that if a noncommercial parody \u201cwould result in images of impurity in the minds of [consumers] ... [s]uch connotations would obviously tarnish the affirmative associations the mark had come to convey.\u201d <em>L.L. Bean v. Drake Publishers, </em>625 F.Supp. at 1536. It thus read the anti-dilution statute as granting a trademark owner the unfettered right to suppress the use of its name in any context, commercial or noncommercial, found to be offensive, negative or unwholesome.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As one commentator has pointed out, there are serious first amendment implications involved in applying anti-dilution statutes to cover noncommercial uses of a trademark;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">Famous trademarks offer a particularly powerful means of conjuring up the image of their owners, and thus become an important, perhaps at times indispensable, part of the public vocabulary. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Rules restricting the use of well-known trademarks may therefore restrict the communication of ideas____ If the defendant\u2019s speech is particularly unflattering, it is also possible to argue that the trademark has been tarnished by the defendant\u2019s use. The constitutional implications of extending the misappropriation or tamishment rationales to such cases, however, may often be intolerable. Since a trademark may frequently be the most effective means of focusing attention on the trademark owner or its product, the recognition of exclusive rights encompassing such use would permit the stifling of unwelcome discussion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap\">Denicola, <em>Trademarks </em>As <em>Speech, </em>1982 Wis.L.Rev. at 195-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The district court\u2019s opinion suggests that tamishment may be found when a trademark is used without authorization in a context which diminishes the positive associations with the mark. Neither the strictures of the first amendment nor the history and theory of anti-dilution law permit a finding of tamishment based solely on the presence of an unwholesome or negative context in which a trademark is used without authorization. Such a reading of the anti-dilution statute unhinges it from its origins in the marketplace. A trademark is tarnished when consumer capacity to associate it with the appropriate products or services has been diminished. The threat of tamishment arises when the goodwill and reputation of a plaintiff\u2019s trademark is linked to products which are of shoddy quality or which conjure associations that clash with the associations generated by the owner\u2019s lawful use of the mark:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">[T]he risk may be that of detracting from the plaintiff\u2019s good will by the possibility that a defendant\u2019s use of plaintiffs unique mark will tarnish plaintiff's trade name by reason of public dissatisfaction with defendant\u2019s <em>product </em>and a resultant holding of this dissatisfaction against plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">An alternative to this ... risk is the danger of public identification of plaintiff\u2019s trade name or mark with a <em>product or service </em>of a type incompatible with the quality and prestige previously attached by the public to the plaintiff\u2019s product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-10\"><em>Tiffany &amp; Co. v. Boston Club, Inc., </em>231 F.Supp. 836, 844 (D.Mass.1964) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">As indicated by Judge Caffrey in <em>Tiffany, </em>the dilution injury stems from an unauthorized effort to market incompatible products or services by trading on another\u2019s trademark. The Constitution is not offended when the anti-dilution statute is applied to prevent a defendant from using a trademark without permission in order to merchandise dissimilar products or services. Any residual effect on first amendment freedoms should be balanced against the need to fulfill the legitimate purpose of the anti-dilution statute. <em>See Friedman v. Rogers, </em>440 U.S. 1, 15-16, 99 S.Ct. 887, 896-97, 59 L.Ed.2d 100 (1979). The law of trademark dilution has developed to combat an unauthorized and harmful appropriation of a trademark by another for the purpose of identifying, manufacturing, merchandising or promoting dissimilar products or services. The harm occurs when a trademark\u2019s identity and integrity \u2014 its capacity to command respect in the market \u2014 is undermined due to its inappropriate and unauthorized use by other market actors. When presented with such circumstances, courts have found that trademark owners have suffered harm despite the fact that redressing such harm entailed some residual impact on the rights of expression of commercial actors. <em>See, e.g., Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders v. Pussycat Cinema, Ltd., </em>604 F.2d 200 (plaintiff\u2019s mark damaged by unauthorized use in content and promotion of a pornographic film); <em>Chemical Corp. of America v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., </em>306 F.2d 433 (5th Cir.1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>372 U.S. 965, 83 S.Ct. 1089, 10 L.Ed.2d 129 (1963) (floor wax and insecticide maker\u2019s slogan, \u201cWhere there\u2019s life, there\u2019s bugs,\u201d harmed strength of defendant\u2019s slogan, \u201cWhere there\u2019s life, there\u2019s Bud.\u201d); <em>Original Appalachian Artworks, Inc. v. Topps Chewing Gum, </em>642 F.Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>1031 (N.D.Ga.1986) (merchandiser of \u201cGarbage Pail Kids\u201d stickers and products injured owner of Cabbage Patch Kids mark); <em>D.C. Comics, Inc. v. Unlimited Monkey Business, </em>598 F.Supp. 110 (N.D.Ga.1984) (holder of Superman and Wonder Woman trademarks damaged by unauthorized use of marks by singing telegram franchisor); <em>General Electric Co. v. Alumpa Coal Co., </em>205 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 1036 (D.Mass.1979) (\u201cGenital Electric\u201d monogram on underpants and T-shirts harmful to plaintiffs trademark); <em>Gucci Shops, Inc. v. R.H. Macy &amp; Co., </em>446 F.Supp. 838 (S.D.N.Y. 1977) (defendant\u2019s diaper bag labelled \u201cGucchi Goo\u201d held to injure Gucci's mark); <em>Coca-Cola Co. v. Gemini Rising, Inc., </em>346 F.Supp. 1183 (E.D.N.Y.1972) (enjoining the merchandise of \u201cEnjoy Cocaine\u201d posters bearing logo similar to plaintiff\u2019s mark).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">While the cases cited above might appear at first glance to be factually analogous to the instant one, they are distinguishable for two reasons. First, they all involved unauthorized commercial uses of another\u2019s trademark. Second, none of those cases involved a defendant using a plaintiff\u2019s trademark as a vehicle for an editorial or artistic parody. In contrast to the cases cited, the instant defendant used plaintiff\u2019s mark solely for noncommercial purposes. Appellant\u2019s parody constitutes an editorial or artistic, rather than a commercial, use of plaintiff\u2019s mark. The article was labelled as \u201chumor\u201d and \u201cparody\u201d in the magazine\u2019s table of contents section; it took up two pages in a one-hundred-page issue; neither the article nor appellant\u2019s trademark was featured on the front or back cover of the magazine. Drake did not use Bean\u2019s mark to identify or promote goods or services to consumers; it never intended to market the \u201cproducts\u201d displayed in the parody.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">We think the Constitution tolerates an incidental impact on rights of expression of commercial actors in order to prevent a defendant from unauthorizedly merchandising his products with another\u2019s trademark.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In such circumstances, application of the anti-dilution statute constitutes a legitimate regulation of commercial speech, which the Supreme Court has defined as \u201cexpression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.\u201d <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>447 U.S. 557, 561, 100 S.Ct. 2343, 2348, 65 L.Ed.2d 341 (1980). It offends the Constitution, however, to invoke the anti-dilution statute as a basis for enjoining the noncommercial use of a trademark by a defendant engaged in a protected form of expression:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-9\">[T]he failure to distinguish between commercial and non-commercial speech <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\u201ccould invite dilution, simply by a leveling process, of the force of the\u201d First \u201cAmendment\u2019s guarantee with respect to the latter kind of speech.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 563 n. 5, 100 S.Ct. at 2350 n. 5 (quoting <em>Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>436 U.S. 447, 456, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 1918, 56 L.Ed.2d 444 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">If the anti-dilution statute were construed as permitting a trademark owner to enjoin the use of his mark in a noncommercial context found to be negative or offensive, then a corporation could shield itself from criticism by forbidding the use of its name in commentaries critical of its conduct. The legitimate aim of the anti-dilution statute is to prohibit the unauthorized use of another\u2019s trademark in order to market incompatible products or services. The Constitution does not, however, permit the range of the anti-dilution statute to encompass the unauthorized use of a trademark in a noncommercial setting such as an editorial or artistic context.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The district court\u2019s application of the Maine anti-dilution statute to appellant\u2019s noncommercial parody cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny. Drake has not used Bean\u2019s mark to identify or market goods or services; it has used the mark solely to identify Bean as the object of its parody. The reading of the anti-dilution provision advanced by the district court would improperly 'expand the scope of the anti-dilution statute far beyond the frontiers of commerce and deep into the realm of expression. \u201cCourts obviously cannot regulate the type of descriptive, non-trade use involved here without becoming the monitors of the spoken or written English language.\u201d <em>Lucasfilm Ltd. v. High Frontier, </em>622 F.Supp. at 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Our reluctance to apply the anti-dilution statute to the instant case also stems from a recognition of the vital importance of parody. Although, as we have noted, parody is often offensive, it is nevertheless \u201cdeserving of substantial freedom \u2014 both as entertainment and as a form of social and literary criticism.\u201d <em>Berlin v. E.C. Publications, Inc., </em>329 F.2d 541 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 822, 85 S.Ct. 46, 13 L.Ed.2d 33 (1964). <em>Accord Fisher v. Dees, </em>794 F.2d 432, 437-38 (9th Cir.1986) (\u201c \u2018Destructive\u2019 parodies play an important role in social and literary criticism and thus merit protection even though they may discourage or discredit an original author.\u201d); <em>Pring v. Penthouse International, Ltd., </em>695 F.2d 438 (10th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>462 U.S. 1132, 103 S.Ct. 3112, 77 L.Ed.2d 1367 (1983) (defendants\u2019 bawdy \u201cspoof\u201d and \u201cridicule\u201d of Miss America pageant entitled to full range of first amendment protection); <em>Groucho Marx Productions v. Day and Night Co., </em>689 F.2d 317, 319 n. 2 (2d Cir.1982) (noting \u201cthe broad scope permitted parody in first First Amendment law.\u201d); <em>Elsmere Music v. National Broadcasting Co., </em>623 F.2d 252, 253 (2d Cir.1980) (\u201cin today\u2019s world of unrelieved solemnity, copyright law should be hospitable to the humor of parody____\u201d). It would be anomalous to diminish the protection afforded parody solely because a parodist chooses a famous trade name, rather than a famous personality, author or creative work, as its object.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">The district court\u2019s injunction falls not only because it trammels upon a protected form of expression, but also because it depends upon an untoward judicial evalua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>tion of the offensiveness or unwholesomeness of the appellant\u2019s materials. The Supreme Court has recognized the threat to free speech inherent in sanctioning such evaluations. <em>Cohen v. California, </em>403 U.S. 15, 25, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 1788, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971). Nevertheless, the district court was swayed by evidence suggesting that the \u201ccoarseness and baseness\u201d of <em>High Society </em>would ineluctably damage Bean\u2019s mark. <em>L.L. Bean v. Drake, </em>625 F.Supp. at 1536-37. The first amendment, however, does not warrant inquiry into \u201cmeasures of distress or offensiveness, depending on the reader, listener or viewer.\u201d <em>United States v. Guarino, </em>729 F.2d 864, 867 (1st Cir.1984) (en banc). While appellant\u2019s article is coarse and vulgar, \u201csexually explicit but nonobscene materials,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> however distasteful, are entitled to no less protection than other forms of expression.\u201d <em>Fantasy Book Shop, Inc. v. City of Boston, </em>652 F.2d 1115, 1126 (1st Cir.1981). <em>Accord Winters v. New York, </em>333 U.S. 507, 518, 68 S.Ct. 665, 671, 92 L.Ed. 840 (1948); <em>Lerman v. Flynt Distributing Co., </em>745 F.2d 123, 138 (2d Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1054, 105 S.Ct. 2114, 85 L.Ed.2d 479 (1985); <em>Pring v. Penthouse International, Ltd., </em>695 F.2d at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Finally, we reject Bean\u2019s argument that enjoining the publication of appellant\u2019s parody does not violate the first amendment because \u201cthere are innumerable alternative ways that Drake could have made a satiric statement concerning \u2018sex in the outdoors\u2019 or \u2018sex and camping gear\u2019 without using plaintiff\u2019s name and mark.\u201d This argument fails to recognize that appellant is parodying L.L. Bean\u2019s catalog, not \u201csex in the outdoors.\u201d The central role which trademarks occupy in public discourse (a role eagerly encouraged by trademark owners), makes them a natural target of parodists. Trademark parodies, even when offensive, do convey a message. The message may be simply that business and product images need not always be taken too seriously; a trademark parody reminds us that we are free to laugh at the images and associations linked with the mark. The message also may be a simple form of entertainment conveyed by juxtaposing the irreverent representation of the trademark with the idealized image created by the mark\u2019s owner. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Trademark Parody, </em>72 Va.L.Rev. at 1109. While such a message lacks explicit political content, that is no reason to afford it less protection under the first amendment. <em>Schad v. Mount Ephraim, </em>452 U.S. 61, 65-66, 101 S.Ct. 2176, 2180-81, 68 L.Ed.2d 671 (1981). Denying parodists the opportunity to poke fun at symbols and names which have become woven into the fabric of our daily life, would constitute a serious curtailment of a protected form of expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-11\">. Maine\u2019s anti-dilution statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au\">Likelihood of injury to business reputation or of dilution of a mark registered under this chapter ... shall be a ground for injunctive relief notwithstanding the absence of competition between the parties or the absence of confusion as to the source of the goods or services.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b116-5\">. The enforcement of such a right would entail state action. Note, <em>Trademark Parody, </em>72 Va.L. Rev. at 1110; Denicola, <em>Trademarks As Speech, </em>1982 Wis.L.Rev. at 190 n. 146; <em>but see Reddy Communications, Inc. v. Environmental Action Foundation, </em>199 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 630, 633-34 (D.D.C.1977). When judicial enforcement of private personal rights touching forms of communication restricts freedom of speech, state action is implicated. <em>New York Times v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 265, 84 S.Ct. 710, 718, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964). Nor does the state action doctrine limit the application of the first amendment when enforcement of intangible property rights would curtail communicative freedoms. <em>Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting, </em>433 U.S. 562, 97 S.Ct. 2849, 53 L.Ed.2d 965 (1977). In <em>Zacchini, </em>the performer of a \"human cannonball\u201d act claimed that his right of publicity had been appropriated by a media defendant that had broadcast his entire fifteen-second performance. The Court characterized plaintiffs right of publicity as \"professional property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569, 97 S.Ct. at 2854. Although the Court held that defendant was not privileged to broadcast plaintiffs <em>entire </em>act, it recognized that private enforcement of intangible property rights implicates first amendment concerns: \"Wherever the line in particular situations is to be drawn between media reports that are protected and those that are not, we are quite sure that the First and Fourteenth Amendments do not immunize the media when they broadcast a performer\u2019s entire act without his consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574-75, 97 S.Ct. at 2856-57.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b118-5\">. The issue of whether consumers were likely to believe that the \"products\" would be marketed is a factual issue that is not relevant to this appeal. The trial court denied summary judgment on all claims that depend upon the resolution of the issue of \"likelihood of confusion\u201d and our holding does not encompass that issue. We note that a parody which engenders consumer confusion would be entitled to less protection than is granted by our decision today. <em>See, </em>Note <em>Trademark Parody, </em>72 Va.L.Rev. at 1112. A parody which causes confusion in the marketplace implicates the legitimate commercial and consumer protection objectives of trademark law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b118-6\">. We have no occasion to consider the constitutional limits which might be imposed on the application of anti-dilution statutes to unauthorized uses of trademarks on products whose principal purpose is to convey a message. <em>Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co. v. Novak, </em>775 F.2d 247 (8th Cir.1985) (plaintiff entitled to preliminary injunction against peace activist protesting nuclear weapons proliferation by marketing \"Mutant of Omaha\u201d T-shirts). Such a situation undoubtedly would require a balancing of the harm suffered by the trademark owner against the benefit derived by the parodist and the public from the unauthorized use of a trademark on a product designed to convey a message. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Trademark Parody,. </em>72 Va.L.Rev. at 1112-16. Courts that have declined to enjoin unauthorized uses of trademarks that expressly employ parody have engaged in such balancing. <em>See Tetley, Inc. v. Topps Chewing Gum, Inc., </em>556 F.Supp. 785 (E.D.N.Y.1983) (defendant\u2019s marketing of stickers parodying various products did not dilute plaintiffs mark); <em>Girl Scouts of U.S.A. v. Personality Posters Mfg. Co., </em>304 F.Supp. 1228 (S.D.N.Y.1969) (rejecting plaintiffs claim of dilution caused by defendant\u2019s distribution of posters depicting a pregnant girl in a Girl Scout uniform along with a caption bearing the Girl Scout motto, \u201cBe Prepared\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b119-7\">. We recognize that the plaintiffs in <em>Pillsbury Co. v. Milky Way Productions, Inc., </em>215 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 124 (N.D.Ga.1981), obtained injunctive relief against <em>Screw </em>magazine, which had published pictures of facsimiles of Finsbury\u2019s trade characters, \"Poppin Fresh\u201d and \"Poppie Fresh,\u201d engaged in sexual intercourse and fellatio. The pictorial also featured plaintiffs trademark and the refrain of its jingle, \"The Pillsbury Baking Song.\u201d While the district court granted relief under Georgia\u2019s anti-dilution statute, 215 U.S. P.Q. at 135, it did so only after specifically declining to consider whether defendants\u2019 presentation constituted a parody. <em>Id. </em>at 129-30. The defendants in <em>Pillsbury </em>had tried to proffer parody as a defense to plaintiffs copyright infringement claim; they did not assert it as a defense to the dilution claim. <em>Pillsbury, </em>therefore, does not stand for the proposition that the publication of a parody properly may be enjoined under an anti-dilution statute, since the court never considered whether defendants had presented a parody, and defendants never asserted parody as a defense to the dilution claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b120-5\">. The question of the obscenity of the article or the entire magazine has not been raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b120-8\">LEVIN H. CAMPBELL, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Aj\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">I think it is premature to pass on the constitutionality of the Maine trademark dilution statute, Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 10, \u00a7 1530 (1981), without a determination whether, under Maine law, a pornographic parody of this kind would violate that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Normally, we would ourselves make this determination, and, of course, we have jurisdiction to do so. There is, however, no realistic way for this court to predict how the Maine courts would apply the dilution statute in these circumstances. No Maine court has decided the question, and there appears to be no relevant precedent from other states having similar \u201cdilution\u201d statutes. Hence any decision of ours on whether, under Maine law, the Maine dilution statute proscribes defendant\u2019s conduct would tend to be guesswork. My colleagues do not attempt this, and I do not suggest anything would be gained by doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">But we have an avenue to secure a meaningful determination of whether or not defendant's conduct violated the Maine law. We, or better, the district court on remand, could certify the question to the Maine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Supreme Judicial Court. I recognize there is an obstacle to certification at this stage in the case. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court has expressed an unwillingness, as a matter of policy, to accept a certified question that will not be dispositive of a federal case. <em>See </em>Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 4, \u00a7 57 (Supp.1986); Me.R.Civ.P. 76B(a); <em>White v. Edgar, </em>320 A.2d 668, 677 (Me.1974); <em>In re all Maine Asbestos Litigation, </em>772 F.2d 1023, 1026 n. 4 (1st Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 106 S.Ct. 1994, 90 L.Ed.2d 675 (1986). The court might believe that situation was present here, as the case still awaits trial of the likelihood of confusion issue. If plaintiff proves likelihood of confusion, it might obtain on other grounds all the relief it requested, in effect mooting the dilution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">But while the Maine court might decline certification at this juncture, we could remand with directions to the district court to certify at a later time, whenever the proceedings below have reached a stage that certification is in order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Certification would permit the state court to decide whether or not a pornographic parody of this type constitutes trademark dilution under the Maine statute. For some of the same reasons suggested in Judge Bownes\u2019s opinion, it may not \u2014 in which case there would be no need for us to address the constitutional issue at all. If, on the other hand, the state court were to hold that the dilution statute was offended by defendant\u2019s conduct, we would have the benefit of the Maine court\u2019s reasoning \u2014 which might give rise to somewhat different First Amendment issues depending, for example, on whether it rested solely on the special offensiveness of a pornographic parody, or whether it found the statute reached <em>any </em>parody.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">It would, in any event, be more in keeping with the canons of constitutional adjudication and with the proper division of responsibilities between state and federal courts to ask the state court to determine the coverage of the trademark dilution statute in regard to conduct such as existed here. <em>See Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>297 U.S. 288, 347, 56 S.Ct. 466, 483, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (\u201c[t]he Court will not pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record, if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of____ Thus, if a case can be decided on either of two grounds, one involving a constitutional question, the other a question of statutory construction or general law, the Court will decide only the latter\u201d) <em>(citing Light v. United States, </em>220 U.S. 523, 538, 31 S.Ct. 485, 488, 55 L.Ed. 570 (1911); <em>Siler v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co., </em>213 U.S. 175, 191, 29 S.Ct. 451, 454, 53 L.Ed. 753 (1909)); <em>see also Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, </em>331 U.S. 549, 568-72, 67 S.Ct. 1409, 1419-21, 91 L.Ed. 1666 (1947) (explaining why courts should avoid unnecessary constitutional adjudication).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">I can understand why, with immediate certification probably unavailable, my colleagues do not care to delay. But there is no reason why the likelihood of confusion issue cannot be speedily resolved, after which, assuming the controversy continues, certification can take place. And I do not find the constitutional issue either easy or obvious, nor in such need of instant resolution that it cannot await a more deliberate process.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">I would, therefore, remand without deciding the constitutional issue, directing the district court to certify to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, at an appropriate later stage in the proceeding, the question whether Maine\u2019s dilution statute covers this type of conduct. Until we have the answer to this question, I would not consider the constitutional question. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b121-9\">. Were plaintiff to prove likelihood of confusion, controversy over the dilution claim might, of course, cease, making it unnecessary to decide that claim in this case. If so, that would simply be one more example of the fact that courts exist to decide live controversies, not abstract questions. Such a result should cause no alarm.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
