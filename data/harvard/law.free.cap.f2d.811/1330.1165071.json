In April 1983 he brought suit in state court against United Fire Insurance Co. (United), which had issued him five health insurance policies. He alleged that United had wrongfully denied him benefits for stays in medical facilities in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. United, a New York corporation with its principal place of business in Illinois, removed the case to federal court. United filed its answer to the complaint in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>June 1983. Neither side demanded a jury-trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-5\">The first district judge to whom the case was assigned issued a pretrial order in November 1983 in which he set a preliminary date for a jury trial. By October 1984, however, the case was transferred to another judge who set the case for a bench trial in her final pretrial order. Trial began in June 1985 and the first witness was Mr. Magyar. His testimony was marred from the start by nonresponsive and argumentative answers. On the second day of testimony, United began its cross-examination and Mr. Magyar\u2019s testimony became even more nonresponsive. The district court finally warned Mr. Magyar that, if his answers continued to be nonresponsive, she would strike his testimony altogether. Mr. Magyar said he understood, but his very next answer was nonresponsive. <em>See </em>p. 4 n. 2 <em>infra. </em>True to her word, the district judge struck Mr. Magyar\u2019s testimony in its entirety. She then invited the Magyars\u2019 lawyer to proceed with the balance of plaintiffs\u2019 case. The lawyer stated she had no more witnesses to call. The court thereupon dismissed the action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-7\">The Magyars focus their attack on the court\u2019s decisions to strike Mr. Magyar\u2019s testimony and to dismiss the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Examining first the district court\u2019s decision to strike testimony, we note that accommodating conflicts between a party\u2019s desire to testify and \u201cthe need to insure truth through cross-examination is one of the trial judge\u2019s most important functions.\u201d <em>United States v. Panza, </em>612 F.2d 432, 438 (9th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>447 U.S. 925, 100 S.Ct. 3019, 65 L.Ed.2d 1118 (1980). In performing that function, a trial judge must necessarily have the discretion to order a witness to answer a question; and, if the order is disobeyed, to invoke appropriate sanctions. As we held in <em>Panza, </em>our review of a district judge\u2019s exercise of this discretion is narrow; it reflects our realization that trial judges must give instantaneous rulings on close questions. <em>Id. </em>at 439; <em>see also United States v. Cardillo, </em>316 F.2d 606, 613 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 822, 84 S.Ct. 60, 11 L.Ed.2d 55 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-10\">There are two limitations on the trial judge\u2019s authority to strike a witness\u2019 testimony. The first applies when the non-responsive testimony is collateral to the key issues in the case. Under these circumstances, the right of cross-examination might be left sufficiently unimpeded that striking all of the witness\u2019 testimony could be an abuse of discretion. <em>See Panza, </em>612 F.2d at 439; <em>see also Cardillo, </em>316 F.2d at 613; 5 <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7 1391 n. 2 (Chadbourn ed. 1974). The second is that the judge must give fair warning to the witness before striking his testimony. <em>Panza, </em>612 F.2d at 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-11\">The district court stayed well within these limitations and did not otherwise abuse her discretion. Although some of Mr. Magyar\u2019s nonresponsive answers did not concern issues central to his case, the incidents of nonresponsiveness and evasion were so frequent that they came to infect his entire testimony. Moreover, the transcript shows that the number of nonre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>sponsive answers increased significantly as cross-examination wore on. The court first tried to deal with the problem by directing Mr. Magyar to answer responsively and by striking individual nonresponsive answers. When this did not work, she gave him clear warning that she would strike his entire testimony if he did not reform.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1418-4\">We are satisfied, on reviewing the record, that the district judge took into account that Mr. Magyar\u2019s ability to testify was affected by his age, and by the fact that English was not his native tongue. The record shows that she exercised considerable patience before even warning him. After two days of direct observation, however, she certainly had seen and heard enough to decide whether Mr. Magyar\u2019s answers were unresponsive because of inability or unwillingness. Her conclusion that he was simply being stubborn or evasive is supported by the record. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-5\">The district court\u2019s decision to dismiss the case followed quickly. It came without warning and, if the dismissal had been a sanction for failure to comply with a court order, might have amounted to an abuse of discretion. <em>See Industrial Bldg. Materials, Inc. v. Interchemical Corp., </em>487 F.2d 1336, 1338-39 (9th Cir.1970) (rule 41(b) dismissal for failure to comply with court order should be accompanied by consideration of less drastic alternatives). However, the record shows that plaintiffs were scheduled to present at least one other witness after Mr. Magyar. In striking Mr. Magyar\u2019s testimony, the district court therefore had a reasonable expectation that there would be more evidence forthcoming. When plaintiffs\u2019 counsel declined to produce it, the record was left devoid of evidence supporting the Magyars\u2019 case. Cases like <em>Industrial Building, </em>which involve rule 41(b) dismissals as direct sanctions for failure to obey court orders, are therefore off point. Here, the district court\u2019s dismissal was premised on the second sentence in 41(b), which allows dismissal \u201con the ground that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.\u201d With nothing in the record to support plaintiffs\u2019 case, United was clearly entitled to a dismissal. As required by rule 41(b), the district court\u2019s dismissal order was supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law. <em>See Industrial Bldg., </em>437 F.2d at 1339.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-6\">The judgment of the district court dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 case is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1417-8\">. They also raise two other issues. The first is a supposed lack of complete diversity, based on United\u2019s removal petition which stated that \"plaintiff is\u201d a California resident instead of \"plaintiffs are\u201d California residents. The Magyars later stipulated that there was diversity. They are unable to show anywhere in the record (or outside it) that either Mr. or Mrs. Magyar is a resident of any state other than California, much less that one of them is a resident of Illinois or New York. The district court\u2019s finding that diversity of citizenship existed is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-12\">The Magyars also complain that they were unfairly denied a jury trial. But, by waiting until 18 months after United served its answer to raise the issue, the Magyars failed to comply with Rule 38(b)\u2019s requirement that a jury demand be made in writing within ten days of the final pleading served. By the terms of that rule this was a waiver. We see no merit in appellants\u2019 claim that the first pretrial order, in predicting a jury trial of seven to ten days, relieved them of their default. The fact remains that they did not comply with Rule 38(b) and the district judge was well within her discretion in conducting a bench trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1418-6\"><em>. </em>THE COURT: Do you decline to answer the attorney\u2019s question, Mr. Magyar?</p>\n<p id=\"APqk\">THE WITNESS: I am \u2014 I not denying anything.
