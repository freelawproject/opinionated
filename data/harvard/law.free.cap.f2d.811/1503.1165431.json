They have a sandy textured exterior surface and a smooth, glossy interior surface. These articles are up to 36 inches in diameter, 94 inches in height, and have wall thicknesses from % to % inches. At trial, the judge saw a sample of one of the articles having an 11-inch diameter, and a 20-inch height, and a %-inch wall thickness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-20\">The judge held that Heraeus did not overcome the presumption that the government\u2019s classification is correct by showing that the imported merchandise is more specifically provided for as tubes under item 548.01 than as tubes, \u201cOther\u201d in item 548.-05. We <em>affirm </em>on the basis of Judge Car-man\u2019s thorough March 26, 1986, opinion. Like the court below, we do not find the cases cited by appellant to be controlling or persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
