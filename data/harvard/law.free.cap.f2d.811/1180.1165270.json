We reverse the district court\u2019s order on Count I of Continental\u2019s complaint, affirm its dismissal of the State of Missouri\u2019s counterclaim, and hold that state and federal governments suffer \u201cproperty damage\u201d at the time hazardous wastes are improperly \u201creleased\u201d into their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>environment and that cleanup costs are a recoverable measure of damages for this environmental property damage. We also affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of Count II of Continental Insurance Company\u2019s complaint relating to coverage for private individuals\u2019 personal and property damage due to improper hazardous waste disposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">I. FACTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">From 1970 to 1972, the Northeastern Pharmaceutical and Chemical Company (NEPACCO) produced hexachlorophene at a chemical plant in Verona, Missouri. The process produced a variety of wastes, among which was dioxin, a highly toxic chemical. In July, 1971, NEPACCO made arrangements to dispose of at least eighty-five fifty-five-gallon drums of these wastes in a trench on a farm near Verona, Missouri (the \u201cDenny farm\u201d site). When the deteriorated drums were dumped in the trench in July, 1971, a \u201cstrong odor\u201d shortly emerged, persisting for several months. <em>United States v. Northeastern Pharm. &amp; Chem. Co., </em>579 F.Supp. 823, 828-30 (W.D. Mo.1984). Later in 1971 or 1972, NEPACCO hired Independent Petrochemical Corporation (IPC) which, in turn, hired Russell Bliss to dispose of more dioxin-contaminated wastes. In 1971, 1972, and 1973, Bliss allegedly spread thousands of gallons of these wastes on the premises of the Bubbling Springs Stables in Fenton, Missouri, and on the roads of Times Beach, Missouri.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Later, in 1974, a Mr. Minker purchased twenty truckloads of contaminated dirt from the Bubbling Springs Ranch and used it as landfill on his property at West Rock Creek Road, Missouri (the \u201cMinker/Stout/Romaine Creek\u201d site).</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-11\">During the two-year period from 1970 to 1972 that NEPACCO was in business, it was insured under a Comprehensive General Liability Policy (CGL),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> issued by Continental. Three somewhat different policies were in effect from August 5, 1970, to August 5, 1971; August 5, 1971, to August 5, 1972; and August 5, 1972, to November 5, 1972.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Each policy requires Continental to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of A. bodily injury or B. property damage <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to which this insurance applies caused by an occurrence,[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] and the Company shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such bodily injury or property damage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">All three provide that: \u201c[tjhis insurance applies only to bodily injury or property damage which occurs during the policy period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">In 1980, the EPA investigated the Denny farm site and found that the NEPACCO wastes in the trench and underlying soil contained \u201calarming[ly] high concentrations of dioxin.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 831. It cleaned up the site, and then sought to recover its costs through a lawsuit against NEPACCO and others. <em>United States v. Northeastern Pharm. &amp; Chem. Co., </em>579 F.Supp. 823 (the <em>\u201cEPA \u201d </em>suit). The district court found NEPACCO and the other defendants jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for the cost of the cleanup.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A separate appeal in that action is now pending before another panel of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-13\">On March 7, 1983, a number of former residents of Times Beach and Imperial, Missouri, filed an action against NEPACCO and others which seeks recovery for personal injuries and property damage allegedly caused by the dumping of NEPACCO\u2019s wastes at the Minker/Stout/Romaine Creek site and on the streets of Times Beach. <em>Capstick v. Independent Petrochemical Corp., </em>No. 832-0453 (Cir.Ct., City of St. Louis, Mo. filed Mar. 7, 1983) (the <em>\u201cCapstick \u201d </em>suit).</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-14\">To protect against potential liability arising out of its status as insurance carrier for NEPACCO during the time NEPACCO\u2019s hazardous wastes were improperly disposed of, Continental filed this action against NEPACCO and its former officers and directors. Count I seeks a declaration that Continental is under no duty to defend or indemnify NEPACCO for liability arising out of the EPA<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> suit. Count II seeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>the same declaration with respect to the <em>Capstick </em>suit. On November 14, 1984, Continental moved for summary judgment. NEPACCO and the other defendants failed to enter an appearance or file an answer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1270-4\">The State of Missouri was then granted leave to intervene to protect its interests arising out of claims that it had made against NEPACCO and the other defendants in a third hazardous-waste lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. <em>Missouri v. Independent Petrochemical Corp., </em>No. 83-3670 (E.D.Mo. filed Nov. 23, 1983) (the <em>\u201cIPC </em>\u201d suit). The complaint in <em>IPC </em>alleges that NEPACCO, its officers, and others are liable under CERCLA for costs incurred by the state in excavating and removing dioxin-contaminated soil from the Mink-er/Stout/Romaine Creek site. The state filed an answer to Continental\u2019s complaint and a counterclaim alleging that Continental is obligated to indemnify the state for the amount of any judgment imposed on NEPACCO in the underlying <em>IPC </em>lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-5\">On June 25, 1985, the district court granted summary judgment to Continental on Count I of its complaint (no insurance coverage for the <em>EPA </em>claims), and against the state on its counterclaim (no coverage for the <em>IPC </em>claims). The court reasoned that the cleanup costs sought by the United States and the state in the <em>EPA </em>and <em>IPC </em>suits are not \u201cproperty damage\u201d as that term is defined in the CGL policies and that \u201cno * * * damages were incurred by the government entities during the policies\u2019 effective dates\u201d because the policies were only in effect from 1970 to 1972, and the cleanup costs were incurred later. The court also granted Continental\u2019s motion to dismiss without prejudice Count II of its complaint (the <em>Capstick </em>claims), stating that \u201cmore specific findings of bodily injury and property damage\u201d were needed first. The State of Missouri appeals.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1270-12\">II. DISCUSSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-13\">A. <em>EPA and IPC Claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1270-14\">The first issue is whether the district court erred in holding that cleanup costs under CERCLA are not \u201cproperty damage\u201d as defined in the CGL policies.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although the district court cited no case and gave no explanation for its holding, Continental and amicus AIA advance two arguments in support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-15\">Continental argues that only the actual owners of the land on which hazardous wastes are improperly disposed of sustain \u201cproperty damage,\u201d and that any injury suffered by governmental entities from the improper disposal is merely an economic injury.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>The Supreme Court of the United States has held that state and federal governments suffer injury to their \u201cquasi-sovereign\u201d interests when pollutants are released into the soil, water, and air within their jurisdiction. <em>See Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., </em>206 U.S. 230, 237, 27 S.Ct. 618, 619, 51 L.Ed.2d 1038, 1044 (1907) (state); <em>cf. Illinois v. City of Milwaukee, </em>406 U.S. 91, 101-07, 92 S.Ct. 1385, 1391-94, 31 L.Ed.2d 712, 722-26 (1972) (federal). The question here is whether this injury to governmental \u201cquasi-sovereign\u201d interests constitutes \u201cproperty damage\u201d within the meaning of an insurance policy. Although the Supreme Court has not squarely confronted the issue, two thoughts expressed in cases decided by the Court lead us to reject Continental\u2019s argument. First, it has implied that an injury to a government\u2019s quasi-sovereign interest in natural resources is a form of property damage. Second, it has held that the government has power, in its quasi-sovereign capacity, to seek redress for the environmental property damage suffered by the actual owners of the land affected by pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-4\">In <em>Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., </em>206 U.S. 230, 27 S.Ct. 618, 51 L.Ed. 1038, for example, the State of Georgia brought suit against certain Tennessee copper companies to enjoin the discharge of noxious gases over its territory. In holding that it had jurisdiction and that Georgia was entitled to an injunction, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-5\">The state owns very little of the territory alleged to be affected, and the damage to it capable of estimate in money, possibly, at least, is small. This is a suit by a state for an injury to it in its capacity of quasi-sovereign. In that capacity the state has an interest independent of and behind the titles of its citizens, in all the earth and air within its domain. It has the last word as to whether its mountains shall be stripped of their forests and its inhabitants shall breathe pure air. It might have to pay individuals before it could utter that word, but with it remains the final power. The alleged damage to the state as a private owner is merely a make-weight, and we may lay on one side the dispute as to whether the destruction of forests has led to the gullying of its roads.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1271-8\">206 U.S. at 237, 27 S.Ct. at 619, 51 L.Ed. at 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-9\">The Court\u2019s discussion of a governmental interest in \u201ctitle\u201d to all the soil, water, and air within its jurisdiction suggests that the government has a property interest in natural resources. A similar implication arises from <em>Missouri v. Illinois, </em>180 U.S. 208, 21 S.Ct. 331, 45 L.Ed. 497 (1901), where the Court held that Missouri was permitted to sue as <em>parens patriae </em>to enjoin the discharge of sewage from Chicago, Illinois, into the Illinois and Mississippi rivers: \u201cimpairment of the health and prosperity of the towns and cities of the state situated on the Mississippi river * * * would injuriously affect the entire state.\u201d 180 U.S. at 241, 21 S.Ct. at 844, 45 L.Ed. at 512. The Court suggested that although a dispute between states over interstate waters may not involve \u201cdirect property rights\u201d of a state, the injury to the state\u2019s \u201cquasi-sovereign\u201d rights is akin to an injury to state property rights.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the Court stressed that in environmental damage suits, a state has the power to seek redress in court for the property damage caused to the general public. <em>Id.; see also Maryland v. Louisiana, </em>451 U.S. 725, 766, 101 S.Ct. 2114, 2139, 68 L.Ed.2d 576, 608 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting on other grounds) (pointing out that when a state sues to advance its quasi-sovereign interests, it is not suing simply to protect the economic interests of its citizens). Similarly, in <em>Toomer v. Witsell, </em>334 U.S. 385, 408, 68 S.Ct. 1156, 1168, 92 L.Ed. 1460 (1948), Mr. Justice Frankfurter, joined by Mr. Justice Jackson, concurring, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-10\">A state may care for its own in utilizing the bounties of nature within her borders because it has technical ownership of such bounties or, when ownership is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>no one, because the state may for the common good exercise all the authority that technical ownership ordinarily confers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">This conclusion is supported by statements in a wide array of cases and statutes that state and federal governments have property interests in wildlife,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> inter- and intrastate waters,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and natural resources in general.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, state and federal governments have \u201cdirect property interests\u201d in public land holdings which may be damaged by environmental contamination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">In light of these extensive statements of governmental property interests in environmental resources, it does not seem unreasonable to assume that an insurance company, providing liability coverage for a chemical producer, would contemplate environmental damage as a form of covered \u201cproperty damage for which governments may seek recovery.\u201d <em>See Lansco, Inc. v. Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>138 N.J. Super. 275, 350 A.2d 520, 524-25 (1975), <em>aff'd, </em>145 N.J.Super. 433, 368 A.2d 363 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>73 N.J. 57, 372 A.2d 322 (1977). The policies\u2019 definition of \u201cproperty damage\u201d as damage to \u201ctangible property\u201d or \u201cphysical injury\u201d seems to contemplate damage to tangible property such as land, trees, air, and water. Supportive of this is the inclusion in the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>two of the three policies at issue of clauses generally excluding environmental damage from coverage for property damage. <em>See Port of Portland v. Water Quality Ins. Syndicate, </em>549 F.Supp. 233, 235 (D.Ore.1982) (The pollution exclusion clause \u201citself states that \u2018property damage\u2019 may result from the discharge of pollutants.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">Finally, all of the cases which have squarely considered Continental\u2019s argument have rejected it.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In <em>Mraz v. American Universal Ins. Co., </em>616 F.Supp. 1173 (D.Md.1985), for example, the court rejected as \u201cuntenable\u201d the insuror\u2019s claim that state and federal governments do not sustain \u201cproperty damage\u201d for insurance policy purposes when hazardous wastes are improperly disposed of and ultimately cleaned up by the government. A similar conclusion was reached in <em>Lansco, </em>350 A.2d at 524-25, and <em>Kutsher\u2019s Country Club Corp. v. Lincoln Ins. Co., </em>119 Misc.2d 889, 465 N.Y.S.2d 136, 139 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1983).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-6\">In sum, we agree with the position taken in <em>Mraz, Lansco, </em>and <em>Kutsher\u2019s </em>that the improper release of toxic wastes may cause \u201cproperty damage\u201d not only to the actual owner of the land, water, or air, but also to state and federal governments because of their \u201cinterest independent of and behind the titles of its citizens in all the earth and air within [their] domain.\u201d <em>Tennessee Copper Co., </em>206 U.S. at 237, 27 S.Ct. at 619, 51 L.Ed.2d at 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-9\">Amicus AIA assumes, at least for purposes of argument, that environmental contamination may cause \u201cproperty damage\u201d for which state and federal governments may seek relief. However, it argues that while the governments might be able to recover for the diminution in value of environmental resources, cleanup costs themselves are not recoverable. It bases this argument on the language of section 107 of CERCLA which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1273-10\">(4) any person who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities or site selected by such person, from which there is a release, or a threatened release which causes the incurrence of response costs, of a hazardous substance, shall be liable for\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1273-11\">(A) all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States Government or a State not inconsistent with the national contingency plan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1273-12\">(B) any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1273-13\">(C) damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources, including the reasonable costs of assessing such injury, destruction, or loss resulting from such a release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1273-14\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-15\">A close reading of this section fails to support AIA\u2019s argument that only an action under the last subsection, section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>9607(a)(4)(C), is an action for \u201cproperty-damage.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It seems clear to us that, although subsection (C) directly provides for recovery for damage to natural resources, subsections (A) and (B) are also measures of the damages which governmental entities may recoup for hazardous waste damage to natural resources. This conclusion is supported by all of the on-point cases cited by the parties or revealed by our independent research.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Askew v. American Waterways Operators, </em>411 U.S. 325, 331, 93 S.Ct. 1590, 1595, 36 L.Ed.2d 280, 286 (1973) (In discussing the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 91, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1161 <em>et seq. </em>(1972), and a similar Florida Act, the Court stated, \u201cWhile the Federal Act determines damages measured by the cost to the United States for cleaning up oil spills, the damages specified in the Florida Act relate in part to the cost to the State of Florida in cleaning up the spillage.\u201d); <em>Riehl v.

Peerless Ins.

Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>350 A.2d at 525 (Measure of damages for pollution discharge in river is \u201cthe cost of eliminating the harmful substance from the waters of the state.\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>But cf.

Oct. 11, 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-10\">Finally, the language of the CGL policies at issue supports the view that cleanup costs are a measure of recoverable damages for injury to environmental resources. The language of the policies specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>require Continental to \u201cpay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages * * * because of property damage.\u201d This language suggests that once there is property damage \u2014 here, environmental contamination \u2014 then the damages that flow from that property damage\u2014 here, cleanup costs \u2014 are recoverable.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">In sum, the cases, the CGL policy language, the common meaning of \u201cproperty damage,\u201d and section 107 of CERCLA .all support the governments\u2019 argument that cleanup costs under CERCLA are compensatory damages for \u201cproperty damage\u201d within the meaning of the CGL policies. Accordingly, we adopt this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-6\">The remaining issue is whether the district court erred in holding that the governments did not suffer an \u201coccurrence\u201d of property damage <em>during the policy period </em>because, although the improper waste disposal occurred during the policy period, the cleanup costs were not incurred until long after the policies expired.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We hold that it did and adopt the majority view that environmental damage occurs at the moment that hazardous wastes are improperly released<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> into the environment and that a liability policy in effect at the time this damage is caused provides coverage for the subsequently incurred costs of cleaning up the wastes.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In <em>Mraz, </em>616 F.Supp. at 1179, for example, the court rejected the same argument made by the insurer here and held that further fact findings were called for on an allegation that \u201cenvironmental damage began to take place immediately in 1969 upon dumping at the Leslie site creating the potential for liability within the scope of the 1969 policy.\u201d A similar conclusion has been reached in numerous other cases. <em>See, e.g. Payne, </em>625 F.Supp. at 1103 (Implicitly finding that improper disposal of hazardous wastes during policy period is an \u201coccurrence\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>\u201cproperty damage\u201d at the time of release into the environment.); <em>Mercury Refining Co. v.

(BNA) at 1546, <em>rev\u2019d and remanded on other grounds for further findings, </em>772 F.2d 19 (3d Cir.1985) (same); <em>Buckeye Union Ins. Co., </em>477 N.E.2d at 1233 (Insurer during the time period when hazardous wastes were \u201creleased\u201d into surrounding soil and groundwater has duty to defend CERCLA cleanup suit under CGL policy.); <em>CPS Chem. Co., </em>489 A.2d at 1269 (\u201cTime of discovery of the accident does not determine when [damage] took place. The complaint alleges damages commencing with the date of dumpings.\u201d).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">Quite similar to this line of decisions are cases involving insurance coverage for \u201cprogressive diseases\u201d where exposure to a harmful substance occurred during the policy period but the disease or illness developed later after the policy expired. The majority of federal cases on this issue have found coverage by adopting the \u201cexposure,\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> or the \u201ccontinuous exposure,\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> theory of when injury occurs. These decisions rest on the view that exposure to the dangerous substance at issue during the policy period caused immediate, albeit undetectable, physical harm which ultimately led to disease or physical impairment after the expiration of the policy period. For example, in <em>Forty-Eight Insulations, </em>633 F.2d at 1223, the Court, in finding coverage for a progressive disease which manifested itself after the policy period, stated, \u201cWe see nothing in the policy which requires that the underlying cause of action accrue within the policy period. There exists a clear distinction between when bodily injury occurs and when the bodily injury that has occurred becomes compensable.\u201d <em>Accord Porter v. American Optical Corp., </em>641 F.2d 1128, 1145 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1109, 102 S.Ct. 686, 70 L.Ed.2d 878 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-10\">These cases are distinguishable from cases where a negligent act was committed during the policy period but an accident or injury did not occur until after the policy expired.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> For example, if one negligently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>fails to shovel snow off his sidewalk during the policy period, there is no compensable accident until and if someone slips and injures himself during the policy period. This distinction was discussed in <em>Mueller Fuel Oil Co. v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em>95 N.J.Super. 564, 232 A.2d 168, 175 (N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div.1967), a case involving insurance coverage for a claim of malicious prosecution, where the court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-5\">The tort of negligence is not committed unless and until some damage is done. Therefore, the important time factor in determining insurance coverage where the basis of the claim is <em>negligence, </em>is the time when the damage has been suffered. In a claim based on malicious prosecution the damage begins to flow from the very commencement of the tortious conduct \u2014 the making of the criminal complaint. The wrong and damage are practically contemporaneous * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AspW\">It seems to us that in the case of improper hazardous waste disposal, the wrong and the resulting damage may also be practically contemporaneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-6\">The decision in <em>Kissel v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>380 S.W.2d 497 (Mo.Ct.App.1964), is particularly relevant on the crucial question of how the Missouri courts would likely rule on the question of when property damage occurs for purposes of insurance coverage. In <em>Kissel, </em>a building contractor hired to build a school employed a subcontractor to dig the foundation and to do landscaping work. During the excavation work in 1952, a series of pressure cracks developed in the ground around the school. The cracks were filled in with dirt and the school construction and landscaping were completed in 1953. The contractor carried a comprehensive general liability policy which covered property damage done by itself and its subcontractors in the course of their construction work. The CGL policy expired in late 1952. In 1957, the cracks reappeared and spread to several pieces of property adjoining the school. Five owners of these pieces of property brought suit, and the construction company instituted suit seeking a declaration that the CGL policy in effect in 1952 covered the damage which occurred in 1957. The insurance carrier argued \u201cthat the accident in question occurred in 1957, and not during the policy period, which was November 1951 to November 1952. Under those circumstances, * * * it cannot be held responsible for the damages shown in evidence.\u201d 380 S.W.2d at 507. The court rejected this contention, noting that there was not merely an act of negligent excavation during the policy period, but that this negligence also caused immediate property damage during the policy period which, by 1957, after the policy period, spread to adjoining property. \u201cWe agree <em>* * * </em>that the accident mentioned in the policy may be a process and the evidence in the instant case is sufficient to show that the process started during the term of the policy and progressed until the filing of the lawsuits. We rule this point against defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509. We find that the <em>Kissel </em>case clearly indicates that Missouri would follow the majority view of the courts which have ruled that \u201cproperty damage,\u201d within the meaning of a CGL policy, generally occurs at the time hazardous wastes are improperly disposed of and that the insurer at that time may be held liable for cleanup costs incurred after the policy expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-9\">Applying these principles, it is clear that the \u201cproperty damage\u201d proved in the <em>EPA </em>case, 579 F.Supp. at 830, first occurred in July, 1971, during the period of time when the first insurance policy issued by Continental to NEPACCO was in effect. <em>EPA, </em>579 F.Supp. at 830 (noting that NEP<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>ACCO\u2019s agents dumped leaking, deteriorated barrels into the trench at the Denny Farm site and that, upon dumping of the wastes, a \u201cstrong odor emitted\u201d and \u201ccontinued for several months, maybe years.\u201d).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Under <em>Kissel, </em>it is also clear that Continental may additionally be liable for the continuing spread of the \u201cproperty damage\u201d at and around the Denny farm site, which first began in July, 1971. <em>Kissel, </em>380 S.W.2d at 509. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s order with respect to Count I of Continental\u2019s complaint and remand for resolution of the remaining issues<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> which must be resolved before it can be determined whether Continental must indemnify NEPACCO for the damages awarded in the <em>EPA </em>suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">It also follows, however, from our holding on the question of the time of the relevant \u201cproperty damage\u201d \u201coccurrence,\u201d that Continental is not liable to defend or indemnify NEPACCO for liability arising from the <em>IPC </em>suit. The complaint in <em>IPC </em>alleges that in 1971 or 1972, Russell Bliss, pursuant to an agreement with IPC and NEPACCO, transported dioxin-contaminated waste oil from the NEPACCO plant in Verona, Missouri, and spread the contaminated oil on the premises of the Bubbling Springs Stable in Fenton, Missouri. This would be the relevant time of the \u201cproperty damage\u201d \u201coccurrence\u201d for purposes of cleaning up the Bubbling Springs Stable. However, the <em>IPC </em>complaint does not seek to recover costs for cleaning up the Bubbling Springs Ranch, nor does it seek recovery for the diminution in the value of resources at or around the Bubbling Springs Ranch and its watershed. Instead, the state seeks to recover the costs of cleaning up the Minker/Stout/Romaine Creek site which was contaminated when twenty loads of contaminated fill dirt from the Bubbling Springs Ranch were deposited there in 1974, after the CGL policies had expired. Because the damage at the Minker/Stout/Romaine Creek site first occurred after the last CGL policy\u2019s effective date, we find that it would be beyond the reach of the reasoning in <em>Kissel </em>to hold Continental liable for this damage which began after the policy lapsed. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding on the state\u2019s counterclaim that Continental has no duty to defend or indemnify NEPACCO for potential liability in the pending <em>IPC </em>suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>B. <em>Capstick Claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">The State of Missouri contends that the district court erred in dismissing, without prejudice, Count II of Continental\u2019s complaint which seeks a declaration of no duty to defend or indemnify NEPACCO in the <em>Capstick </em>lawsuit. The <em>Capstick </em>suit differs in several respects from the <em>EPA </em>and <em>IPC </em>suits. The latter involve governmental cleanup cost recoveries under CERCLA; the former involves claims by private individuals for personal and property damage arising out of improper disposal of NEPACCO\u2019s hazardous wastes. We agree with the trial court that resolution of the insurance coverage issues in <em>Capstick </em>requires additional fact finding and analysis, <em>see Independent Petrochemical Corp. v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co., </em>Civ. No. 83-3347, (D.D.C., filed Feb. 4, 1986), which may be pursued most effectively in a different proceeding. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision granting Continental\u2019s motion to voluntarily dismiss Count II without prejudice is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">. Times Beach was a town of approximately 2,200 people located twenty-five miles southwest of St. Louis. Soil samples taken there by the EPA in the early 1980\u2019s revealed soil dioxin levels in excess of one hundred times the Center for Disease Control\u2019s recommended maximum soil dioxin level for residential areas. In February, 1983, the EPA announced that the government would purchase the entire town of Times Beach using $33.7 million from the federal Superfund.

The Missouri Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jfthat Mis</em>souri would follow this majority view.

Because the hazardous waste contamination alleged in the <em>EPA </em>and <em>IPC </em>suits spread widely from the originally contaminated property to other property and the groundwater of the state, it seems clear that the cost of cleaning up the contamination would be the lesser measure of damage. Moreover, although the Missouri courts have not squarely confronted the issue, the appropriate measure of damages in a case involving improper disposal of hazardous wastes may include both the cost of cleanup and the damages measured by the remaining diminution in the value of natural resources.

The case which the district court relied on, <em>Kirkham and Michael &amp; Assoc., Inc. v. Travelers Indem.

In <em>Kirkham, </em>an engineering corporation contracted with the City of Rapid City, South Dakota, to design, oversee the construction of, and to make a final inspection of a waste treatment plant for the city. Once the plant wets finally inspected, turned over to the city, and set in operation, the city learned that the plant was \"deficient\" in several respects. The city sued the engineering firm and the firm's insurance carrier brought an action seeking a declaration that its policy during the construction period (later policies contained an exclusion for damages arising from professional malpractice/negligence suits) did not provide coverage. The insurer\u2019s argument was that, although the negligent construction and supervision occurred during the policy period, the city did not suffer damage until the plant was turned over to it and operation of the plant revealed its deficiencies. The district court agreed and held that there was no coverage and, thus, no duty to defend the firm in the city\u2019s suit. 361 F.Supp. at 193-94. This Court affirmed on the basis of the district court\u2019s opinion. 493 F.2d at 475. <em>Kirkham </em>is distinguishable from the present case in many respects. First of all, the factual situation is inapposite. Second, it is an example of a negligence case where the negligence was not accompanied by immediate damage or injury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>as was the case in the above-cited hazardous waste and progressive disease cases. <em>See also Kissel v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>380 S.W.2d 497 (Mo.Ct.App.1964) (Finding insurance coverage for damage manifested after policy lapsed because the act of negligence during the policy period was accompanied by immediate physical damage or injury.). Third, the city in <em>Kirkham </em>had no ownership interest in the sewage plant until it was turned over to it. It was only at that time, after the relevant policy lapsed, that the city was injured by learning that the plant did not work as projected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1278-5\">. We hold that in a cleanup cost recovery case, the date of the insured \u201coccurrence\u201d is the date on which the hazardous wastes were improperly disposed of. In other words, we adopt the \"exposure\" view of coverage. Accordingly, only the first CGL policy at issue provides coverage for the damages proved in the <em>EPA </em>case. <em>See, e.g., Hancock Laboratories, Inc., </em>777 F.2d at 524-25. A recent Harvard Law Review comment argues that the appropriate standard for property damage caused by hazardous waste should be the \"continuous trigger\u201d rule which provides that the property damage occurrence is continuous, extending from disposal to manifestation of the damage. <em>Developments in the Law, Toxic Waste Litigation, 99 </em>Harv.L.Rev. 1458, 1581-83 (1986). <em>See also, </em>Note, <em>The Applicability of General Liability Insurance to Hazardous Waste Disposal, </em>57 S.Cal.L.Rev. 745, 758-59 (1984). Perhaps most supportive of the continuous trigger theory is the presumption of maximum coverage. <em>See American Home Prods. Corp., </em>565 F.Supp. at 1491-92. Additionally, hazardous waste damage is a continuous process, which suggests that the time of the property damage occurrence extends from the time of improper disposal to the time the damage is manifested. However, the <em>Kissel </em>case suggests that, under Missouri law, the continuing damage would be covered under the policy in effect when the damage first occurred, 380 S.W.2d at 509, at least where, as here, this can be readily determined. As the Harvard Law Review article suggests, the continuous trigger theory might have merit in fact situations different from that posed here, such as where it is impossible to determine when the improper release occurred. In this situation, it may be reasonable to view the time of the occurrence as the time the accident or release is first discovered. We are not faced with such a situation here, however, and we are not persuaded that the continuous trigger theory has merit in a cleanup cost recovery case such as this one where the date of the first property damage occurrence is clear and where the cleanup efforts have been pinpointed at the site of this damage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1278-8\">. <em>See supra </em>note 5, on the \"occurrence\" question. There is no remaining issue on the \"pollution exclusion\" clause, however, because the property damage proved in the EPA case occurred during the first CGL policy which does not contain a pollution exclusion clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1279-6\">McMILLIAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AKP\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-7\">For the reasons discussed below, I would affirm the order of the district court, although for reasons different than those set forth in its memorandum order. This appeal presents difficult issues the resolution of which will have a substantial effect upon liability insurance cases involving hazardous waste disposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-8\">I agree with much of the analysis set forth in the majority opinion. Specifically, I agree that Missouri law applies to these insurance policies. Missouri is the state that has the most significant relationship with the comprehensive general liability (CGL) insurance policies at issue. Maj. op. at 1184, note 10. I also agree with the majority that environmental damage is \u201cdamage to property\u201d and that the release into the environment of hazardous wastes may cause property damage not only to the actual owners of land, water and air, but also to the quasi-sovereign interests of governmental entities. Maj. op. at 1184-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-9\">I also agree with the majority, op. at 1184-93, that under Missouri law \u201cthe issue of liability under a policy insuring against \u2018loss\u2019 or \u2018damage\u2019 occurring during the policy period is determined by the time when the loss or damage occurs and not by the time of the negligent [or wrongful] act.\u201d <em>Hawkeye-Security Insurance Co. v. Iowa National Mutual Insurance Co., </em>567 S.W.2d 719, 720 (Mo.Ct.App.1978), <em>citing Kirchner v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>440 S.W.2d 751 (Mo.Ct.App.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-10\">Given the specific facts in the present case, I further agree that property damage \u201coccurred\u201d in mid-July 1971, at a time within the policy period of the first CGL policy. Maj. op. at 1191. Here, the crucial events \u2014 the wrongful act, the release of hazardous wastes into the environment (\u201cproperty damage\u201d) and the \u201coccurrence\u201d \u2014all happened virtually simultaneously. In some hazardous waste disposal cases, the act of disposal may cause the release of hazardous wastes into the environment at some point in the future. For example, the initial disposal may not result in a release of hazardous wastes within the policy period but much later after the policy has lapsed. In the present case, however, the disposal of the hazardous wastes immediately resulted in their release into the environment and, because by definition hazardous wastes are extremely harmful, there was clearly an \u201coccurrence\u201d of \u201cproperty damage\u201d within the policy period. Here, the geological and hydrological characteristics of the site made it unsuitable for the disposal of hazardous wastes; the hazardous wastes had been stored in drums that at the time of disposal were in a deteriorated condition; the drums were simply buried in an excavated trench; a strong odor emerged shortly thereafter and persisted for several months. Thus, the \u201coccurrence\u201d issue is something of a false issue on these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-11\">I do not agree, however, with the majority that \u201ccleanup costs under CERCLA are compensatory <em>damages </em>for \u2018property damage\u2019 within the meaning of the CGL policies.\u201d Maj. op. at 1189 (emphasis added). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>I would hold that under these CGL policies the insurer has no obligation to pay cleanup costs because cleanup costs constitute equitable monetary relief but not legal damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">\u201cAn insuring obligation is a contract, and coverage exists only if assumed by the terms of the policy.\u201d <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Hanna, </em>224 F.2d 499, 503 (5th Cir.1955).

Armco, Inc., </em>643 F.Supp. at 434. Here, the federal government in the <em>EPA </em>lawsuit and the state of Missouri in the <em>IPC </em>lawsuit seek recovery of cleanup or response costs pursuant to CERCLA \u00a7 107(a)(4)(A), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a)(4)(A). These actions are essentially <em>equitable </em>actions for monetary relief in the form of restitution or reimbursement of costs. <em>See United States v. Northeastern Pharmaceutical &amp; Chemical Co., </em>810 F.2d 726, at (8th Cir.1986). The federal and state governments do not seek recovery of <em>\u201cdamages </em>for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources,\u201d pursuant to CERCLA \u00a7 107(a)(4)(C) (emphasis added), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a)(4)(C) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-9\">In short, I cannot agree that cleanup costs are the equivalent of \u201cdamages,\u201d <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Armco, Inc., </em>643 F.Supp. at 435. CERCLA defendants are liable for both cleanup costs under CERCLA \u00a7 107(a)(4)(A), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a)(4)(A), and for damages to natural resources under CERCLA \u00a7 107(a)(4)(C), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a)(4)(C); in a particular case, the <em>measure </em>of liability for cleanup costs and for damages to natural resources may be the same. Maj. op. at 1187-1190 &amp; note 20, <em>citing Jack L. Baker Cos. v. Pasley Manufacturing &amp; Distributing Co., </em>413 S.W.2d 268, 273-74 (Mo.1967). Merely because \u201cno practical difference exists between the sums which the <em>insured </em>[, that is, the CERCLA defendant,] must pay the court under some equitable remedy as opposed to sums payable for damages,\u201d <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Armco, Inc., </em>643 F.Supp. at 435 (emphasis added), does not mean that the sums constitute equivalent obligations to pay on the part of the <em>insurer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-11\">In <em>United States Aviex Co. v. Travelers Insurance Co., </em>336 N.W.2d at 843, the court described as \u201cmerely fortuitous\u201d from the standpoint of either plaintiff [insured] or defendant [insurer] whether the state chooses to pursue an equitable remedy rather than to sue to recover damages, because \u201cthe damage to the natural resources is simply measured in the cost to restore the [environment] to its original state.\u201d In my view, that analysis must be limited to the liability of the insured and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>the measurement of that liability under environmental laws like CERCLA. The liability of the insurer is a distinct issue, and I would argue that, at least with respect to the liability of the insurer under the CGL policies, whether the federal and state governments choose to pursue equitable remedies or to recover damages is not \u201cmerely fortuitous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">I also agree that the insurer has no duty to defend the <em>IPC </em>lawsuit because the property damage occurred in 1974 after the policies lapsed, maj. op. at 1192-1193 <em>and </em>because, as discussed above, cleanup costs are not \u201cdamages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">I also agree that the issues in the <em>Capstick </em>lawsuit require additional factfinding and analysis and are therefore unsuitable for summary disposition. Maj. op. at 1193. Because the private individuals in <em>Capstick </em>are seeking damages for personal injury and property damage due to the improper disposal of hazardous wastes and <em>not </em>cleanup costs consistent with the national contingency plan pursuant to CERCLA \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a)(4)(B), I would hold the insurer cannot refuse to defend the <em>Capstick </em>lawsuit for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-7\">Accordingly, I would affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
