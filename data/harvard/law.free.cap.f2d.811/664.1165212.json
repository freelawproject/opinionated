Orange Park challenges the denial of its application as arbitrary and capricious and the award to Clay as contradictory of Commission regulations. We conclude that the Commission reasonably found Orange Park unqualified for comparative consideration and therefore affirm that portion of the FCC\u2019s decision. We also hold, however, that the FCC erred in the course of granting Clay\u2019s application and therefore remand that matter to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b752-17\">The chain of events leading to this appeal began in November 1980, when Clay Television filed an application with the FCC to construct a television station to broadcast over UHF channel 25 in Orange Park, Florida. <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 308, 309 (1982 &amp; Supp. Ill 1985).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Orange Park filed a competing application for channel 25 shortly thereafter. After a hearing, an administrative law judge determined that neither application satisfied the Commission\u2019s threshold requirements and therefore made no award.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-18\">The AU found Orange Park \u201cbasically unqualified\u201d under 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.610(c)(1) (1983).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That provision sets forth minimum spacing requirements for TV broadcast antennas, and specifically requires UHF television antennas to be 55 miles apart.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>ange Park ran afoul of the 55-mile rule by proposing an antenna site 52.36 miles from that already proposed in an application for a different channel. Thus, in the parlance of broadcast regulation, Orange Park\u2019s proposed site was \u201cshort-spaced\u201d by 2.64 miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The AU went on to deny Orange Park\u2019s request for a waiver of the minimum spacing requirements. Orange Park\u2019s primary argument in this respect was that broadcasting from a short-spaced site with the proposed 1,000-foot antenna and contemplated signal strength would create no more interference than would be occasioned by broadcasting from a fully-spaced site with a maximum height antenna and a maximum-strength signal permitted under the Commission\u2019s regulations. The AU rejected this \u201cequivalent protection\u201d rationale, holding that that notion, under settled Commission precedent, was inapplicable to UHF broadcasting. <em>Initial Decision, supra, </em>note 2, 95 F.C.C.2d at 1198, J.A. at 12. As an independent reason, the AU found that Orange Park had failed to demonstrate that no fully-spaced sites were available, a showing that waiver applicants had to satisfy as a threshold matter. <em>Id. </em>The Commission\u2019s Review Board and the full Commission did not disturb this aspect of the AU\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">Clay\u2019s application for a construction permit fared no better than Orange Park\u2019s in the AU\u2019s initial decision, for Clay was found in violation of another Commission regulation, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.3572(b) (1983). That rule removes an application from consideration when it is amended to effect a major transfer of ownership from the ownership structure proposed in the original application.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Of especial significance in this case, Clay had carried out a 50% ownership change in two filings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The first shift, amending Clay\u2019s application to reflect a 26% change in ownership, occurred on the so-called \u201cA cut-off\u201d date. That is the final date for filing applications for a channel. <em>See </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.3572(c) (1983); <em>see also Revised Procedures for the Processing of Contested Broadcast Applications, </em>72 F.C.C.2d 202, 207-08, 210-11 (1979). Clay\u2019s second filing changed the originally proposed ownership structure by an additional 24% and took place on the \u201cB cutoff\u201d date. The latter date is the last day for those opposing any application to file a petition to deny. <em>See </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.3584 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Clay did not dispute that its two amendments, if considered together, effected a major change in ownership under the Commission\u2019s rules. Instead, it argued before the AU that for purposes of the ownership-change provision only amendments filed <em>after </em>the A cut-off should be counted. To buttress its interpretation, Clay pointed out that it could have withdrawn its original application and filed a new one altogether prior to the A cut-off date without being removed from consideration; therefore, Clay reasoned, a mere amendment of the original application before that date should not be the basis for dismissing an otherwise proper application. The AU nonetheless rejected Clay\u2019s interpretation, concluding that the plain language of the regulation and longstanding Commission precedent required considering <em>all </em>amendments affecting ownership, whenever filed. <em>Initial Decision, supra </em>note 2, 95 F.C.C.2d at 1199, J.A. at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Unlike Orange Park, however, Clay enjoyed success in seeking review of the AU\u2019s determination. In interlocutory review of the AU\u2019s ruling on the ownership transfer issue, the full Commission concurred with the AU\u2019s determination that both the language of section 73.3572 and Commission precedent brought Clay within the strictures of that rule and would normally necessitate dismissal of its application.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Commission determined, however, that under the circumstances presented, Clay should be permitted to cure its violation rather than suffer the Draconian sanction of dismissal. The basis for its decision was that the FCC staff responsible for processing construction permit applications (then known as the \u201cBroadcast Bureau,\u201d now as the \u201cMass Media Bureau\u201d) had, since the use of A and B cut-off dates was adopted in 1979, interpreted section 73.3572 as had Clay, namely to require consideration only of ownership amendments filed after the A cut-off date.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In light of the confusion sown by the staff\u2019s interpretive practices, the Commission concluded that the rule should not be applied to Clay under the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, the FCC remanded the case to the AU, who subsequently found Clay otherwise qualified and, as the sole surviving applicant, entitled to the construction permit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">After exhausting its administrative remedies, Orange Park brought this appeal pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(b)(1), (6). Clay has intervened.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">On appeal, Orange Park mounts a two-pronged attack on the Commission\u2019s decision. First, it challenges the FCC\u2019s denial of its request for a waiver of the Commission\u2019s minimum spacing rules as an arbitrary and capricious departure from precedent. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1982); <em>see also Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 50, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 2870, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983); <em>Airmark Corp. v. FAA, </em>758 F.2d 685, 692 (D.C.Cir.1985). Second, Orange Park attacks the Commission\u2019s decision allowing Clay to cure its violation of the ownership-change provision as violative of that rule and, accordingly, as offensive to the fundamental principle that an agency is bound by its rules. <em>See Reuters Limited v. FCC, </em>781 F.2d 946 (D.C.Cir.1986). Clay, of course, supports the Commission\u2019s orders in all respects. In addition, it argues that were we to decide that Orange Park was properly disqualified because of its failure to comply with the minimum spacing rules, then we are obliged to conclude that Or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>ange Park lacks standing to contest the award to Clay.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Orange Park\u2019s objections to the Commission\u2019s determination that it was unqualified to obtain \u00e1 construction permit need not long detain us. Its violation of the minimum spacing rules is clear and undisputed. That being so, Orange Park\u2019s only hope lay in the possibility of a Commission-granted waiver from its rules. But it is elementary that the judiciary may disturb a Commission refusal to waive its rules only in the event of an abuse of discretion. <em>See North Texas Media, Inc, v. FCC, </em>778 F.2d 28, 32 (D.C.Cir.1985); <em>City of Angels Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, </em>745 F.2d 656, 665 (D.C.Cir.1984); <em>see also Basic Media, Ltd. v. FCC, </em>559 F.2d 830, 833-34 (D.C.Cir.1977) (applicant for waiver of agency\u2019s rule carries a heavy burden). Measured under that generous standard, the Commission\u2019s decision in this instance easily withstands attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">In essence, Orange Park argues that in two respects the FCC departed without justification from prior precedent addressing the showing necessary to obtain a waiver: <em>first, </em>by requiring it to prove as a threshold matter that no fully-spaced sites were available; and <em>second, </em>by rejecting the \u201cequivalent protection\u201d rationale upon which Orange Park relied to prove that its operations from a short-spaced site would not cause significant interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">Commission precedent makes clear that an applicant seeking waiver of the minimum spacing rules must, as an initial matter, establish the nonavailability of fully-spaced sites. <em>See Townsend Broadcasting Corp., </em>62 F.C.C.2d 511, 512 (Comm\u2019n 1976). This court has expressly recognized and upheld the reasonableness of this threshold requirement. <em>See North Texas Media, </em>778 F.2d at 32. Thus, the ALJ need not even have considered Orange Park\u2019s assertion that its signal from a short-spaced site would produce only insignificant interference; Orange Park\u2019s waiver request died, as it were, at the starting gate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">Nonetheless, if we assume <em>arguendo, </em>as did the ALJ, that Orange Park\u2019s request left the gate, we find reasonable and consistent with Commission precedent the determination that it was hobbled at the first turn. As already mentioned, Orange Park set forth no evidence of how much interference its station would cause, choosing instead to rely solely on the \u201cequivalent protection\u201d rationale. It did so in the face of unequivocal Commission precedent that the Commission considered \u201cequivalent protection\u201d analysis inapplicable to UHF broadcasting because of the unique nature of UHF signal propagation. <em>See Pappas Telecasting, Inc., </em>49 Rad.Reg.2d (P &amp; F) 1688, 1690 (Comm\u2019n 1981); <em>Carolina Christian Broadcasting, Inc., </em>48 Rad. Reg.2d (P &amp; F) 355, 358 (Broadcast Bur. 1980); <em>see also Carolina Broadcasting Co., </em>16 Rad.Reg.2d (P &amp; F) 801, 803-04 (Comm\u2019n 1969). We find it unnecessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>judge the propriety of the FCC\u2019s determination that \u201cequivalent protection\u201d does not apply to UHF broadcasting, since Orange Park does not in fact dispute this judgment, but instead complains that the Commission provided insufficient guidance on how it could demonstrate that its proposed operations would not cause significant interference. We conclude that Orange Park\u2019s belated objection is unavailing, for it sought no guidance from the Commission on this issue,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and nonetheless relied exclusively on the \u201cequivalent protection\u201d rationale in the face of clear precedent that its approach was doomed to fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">In sum, the FCC\u2019s denial of Orange Park\u2019s waiver request was fully consistent with agency precedent. Since Orange Park has not shown, or indeed even attempted to demonstrate, that this precedent is unreasonable or contrary to law, we affirm the Commission\u2019s decision in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Having upheld the Commission\u2019s decision to disqualify Orange Park, we must next address Clay\u2019s and the Commission\u2019s contention that Orange Park lacks standing to appeal the award to Clay. Their argument is that Orange Park was ineligible for the construction permit in any case and so was not injured by the award to Clay. Since in their view Orange Park suffered no injury because of the award, it satisfied neither the statutory requirement that parties appealing Commission decisions be \u201caggrieved\u201d or \u201cadversely affected\u201d by such decisions<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> nor the constitutional requirement of standing that a litigant plead \u201cinjury in fact\u201d fairly traceable to the conduct complained of and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">For the statutory leg of their argument, Clay and the FCC rely primarily, and belatedly, on this court\u2019s decision a generation ago in <em>Simmons v. FCC, </em>145 F.2d 578 (D.C.Cir.1944).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In that case, the court reviewed a Commission order denying Sim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>mons\u2019 application for a construction permit to rebuild a radio station and granting a competing application. 145 F.2d at 578-79. The court affirmed the denial of Simmons\u2019s application, concluding that it was supported by substantial evidence that the applicant\u2019s operations would obstruct air navigation. <em>Id. </em>at 579. Based on this conclusion, the court held that Simmons lacked standing to challenge the Commission\u2019s grant to a competing applicant. The court\u2019s reasoning is set out in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">Since appellant\u2019s application was rightly denied he has no ground for complaint. He does not contend that he is worse off than he would have been if intervenor\u2019s application, as well as his own, had been denied. Accordingly, he is not \u201caggrieved\u201d or \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the granting of intervenor\u2019s application and has no . standing to appeal from it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 579 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Despite the brevity of this explanation, we are persuaded, upon reflection, that <em>Simmons </em>does not apply to the present case. In contrast to <em>Simmons, </em>Orange Park vigorously asserts that it is worse off by virtue of the Commission\u2019s award to Clay. Had the Commission dismissed Clay\u2019s application, Orange Park points out, channel 25 would have remained available and Orange Park could have filed a new (and presumably conforming) application. In further contrast to <em>Simmons, </em>where it was uncertain whether the disqualified candidate was able to cure the defect in its application (or was willing to do so), here Orange Park specifically alleges that dismissing Clay's application would have made it easier for Orange Park to amend its application to specify a fully-spaced site;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that fully-spaced sites were available; and that Orange Park was willing to make such an amendment had Clay\u2019s application been dismissed. Supplemental Brief of Appellant at 6. It would thus appear that an improper award of the construction permit to Clay constituted more than harmless error as to Orange Park.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">At the same time, we cannot fail to recognize that, aside from the facts that Simmons did not allege that he was worse off by virtue of the FCC\u2019s allegedly erroneous award to the competing applicant and that, if given the opportunity he could and would reapply for the permit, there is substantial similarity between the facts of <em>Simmons </em>and those of this case. In particular, the disqualifying features of Simmons\u2019 application were, it appears, readily curable through amendments; thus, it would appear that Simmons, like Orange Park, was deprived by award to a competitor of the opportunity to cure the remediable defect in his initial application. <em>Cf. Teleprompter, </em>543 F.2d at 1384-87 (agency has discretion to decide that disqualification on grounds of corruption or bribery may not be immediately cured).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">Nonetheless, while the factual setting of <em>Simmons </em>bears a resemblance to that of the present case, we also cannot fail to observe that the doctrine of standing prevailing at that time has changed significantly in the intervening decades. Of particular importance is the abandonment of the \u201clegal right\u201d requirement that governed when <em>Simmons </em>was decided. Under that requirement, to establish standing a litigant had to demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s conduct infringed a legal right enjoyed by the litigant. Thus, in a situation analogous to the one before us, the Supreme Court held that a disappointed bidder for a government contract lacked standing to contest the award to a successful bidder, because the procurement laws under which such contracts were made conferred no legal rights on bidders; they were intended solely to protect the Government. <em>See Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>310 U.S. 113, 127-32, 60 S.Ct. 869, 876-79, 84 L.Ed. 1108 (1940). More recently, however, the Court jettisoned the \u201clegal right\u201d requirement. <em>See Association of Data Processing Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 153, 90 S.Ct. 827, 830, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). And this court has, of course, long recognized that disappointed bidders have standing to challenge government awards. <em>See, e.g., Scanwell Laboratories, Inc. v. Shaffer, </em>424 F.2d 859 (D.C. Cir.1970). The basis for this recognition is that a wrongful award of a government contract constitutes a discrete economic injury to unsuccessful bidders, who therefore have an incentive to vindicate the public interest as well as their own by insisting on the integrity of the procurement process. <em>See id. </em>at 864; <em>see also CACI, Inc. </em>\u2014 Feder<em>al v. United States, </em>719 F.2d 1567, 1572-75 (Fed.Cir.1983). We believe, on reflection, that these principles point strongly in the direction of granting standing to Orange Park to challenge the award to Clay.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">The Commission does not dispute that by awarding a construction permit to Clay instead of dismissing Clay\u2019s application, the Commission deprived Orange Park of a second chance to apply for channel 25. Nor does it take issue with Orange Park\u2019s assertion that it readily could have cured the disqualifying feature in its original application by specifying a fully-spaced site. Instead, the Commission characterizes Orange Park\u2019s injury as its failure to secure a permit in the proceedings below. This injury, the Commission\u2019s argument runs, was solely Orange Park\u2019s fault; it cannot be traced to the FCC\u2019s award to Clay. While the Commission\u2019s argument is correct as far as it goes, it does not meet the assertion of an injury that is separate and distinct from Orange Park\u2019s initial failure to secure a permit, namely, the opportunity to try again were Clay to lose. <em>Cf. Delta Data Systems Corp. v. Webster, </em>744 F.2d 197, 206 (D.C.Cir.1984) (granting relief to disappointed bidder for government contract who, through agency error, was deprived of <em>\u201copportunity </em>to obtain an award\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Moving beyond <em>Simmons </em>itself, we turn to the bedrock constitutional requirements arising under Article III. In our view, Orange Park\u2019s allegations clearly satisfy the requirement that a litigant plead injury in fact fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s allegedly illegal conduct and likely to be redressed by the relief requested. <em>See, e.g., Allen v. Wright, </em>468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 3325, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984); <em>Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State, </em>454 U.S. 464, 472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 758, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982); <em>American Legal Foundation v. FCC, </em>808 F.2d 84, 88 (D.C. Cir.1987). First, the Commission\u2019s deprivation of Orange Park\u2019s opportunity to reapply for channel 25 clearly constitutes a cognizable economic injury. Without belaboring the obvious, suffice it to say that Orange Park spent time and money formulating a specific proposal for broadcast operations, which the award to Clay rendered for naught. <em>See Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., </em>429 U.S. 252, 262, 97 S.Ct. 555, 561, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977). Second, Orange Park\u2019s injury resulted directly from the FCC\u2019s award to Clay. But for that award, it would still be open season for Orange Park in the effort to secure rights to channel 25. Such a direct causal link between the FCC\u2019s conduct and Orange Park\u2019s injury amply meets the \u201ctraceability\u201d requirement of standing. <em>See Von Aulock v. Smith, </em>720 F.2d 176, 181 (D.C.Cir. 1983). Finally, vacating the award to Clay will redress Orange Park\u2019s injury by affording it the opportunity to reapply for the construction permit, which Orange Park has indicated it stands ready, willing and able to do. <em>See Village of Arlington Heights, </em>429 U.S. at 261-62, 97 S.Ct. at 561; <em>see also Von Aulock, </em>720 F.2d at 180.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>3</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">We are likewise convinced that Orange Park\u2019s allegations satisfy statutory and prudential standing requirements. Section 402(b)(6) of title 47 in relevant part extends standing to any person \u201cwho is aggrieved or whose interests are adversely affected\u201d by a Commission order granting a construction permit. Again, Orange Park has specified a concrete, economic interest that has been perceptibly damaged by the Commission\u2019s award. These allegations amply qualify Orange Park as an \u201caggrieved\u201d party within the meaning of \u00a7 402(b)(6). <em>See FCC v. Sanders Brothers Radio Station, </em>309 U.S. 470, 476-77, 60 S.Ct. 693, 698, 84 L.Ed. 869 (1940); <em>cf. Office of Consumers Counsel v. FERC, </em>808 F.2d 125, 128-29 (D.C.Cir.1987) (interpreting \u00a7 19(b) of Natural Gas Act, granting standing to \u201caggrieved\u201d parties, to require proof of \u201cconcrete perceptible harm of a real, non-speculative nature\u201d). Moreover, the statute leaves no doubt that disappointed applicants like Orange Park are within the \u201czone of interests\u201d protected by the statute. <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(b)(1), (6); <em>see also FAIC Securities, Inc. v.

That rule, Orange Park argues, requires elimination of an application from consideration with competing applications when amendments to the application, whenever filed, effect a 50% change in ownership of the proposed facilities. The Commission does not dispute Orange Park\u2019s interpretation of the rule, nor its contention that the rule applied to the amendments Clay filed on the A and B cut-off dates. The FCC nonetheless main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>tains that allowing Clay to avoid dismissal was justified because of the confusion caused by the old Broadcast Bureau\u2019s practice of counting only amendments filed after the A cut-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Orange Park relies primarily on <em>Reuters, </em>781 F.2d 946, for the proposition that the FCC has impermissibly strayed from its own rules. <em>See generally Vitarelli v. Seaton, </em>359 U.S. 535, 79 S.Ct. 968, 3 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1959); <em>Service v. Dulles, </em>354 U.S. 363, 77 S.Ct. 1152, 1 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1957). In <em>Reuters, </em>the FCC rescinded Reuters\u2019 newly awarded licenses for microwave radio stations in order to allow a second applicant, Associated Information Services, whose applications had been filed late, to be considered for the awards along with Reuters. Although expressly finding that the licenses had been properly granted, the Commission divested Reuters of them upon finding that Associated had misread an ambiguous FCC report as controlling the filing deadlines in that situation. <em>Id. </em>at 949-50. We reversed the FCC for the \u201csimple but emphatic\u201d reason that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8P\">the Commission properly granted licenses to Reuters pursuant to the express provisions of its rules. Moreover, neither the [Commission staff] nor the Commission itself embraced the proposition that the [report on which Associated relied] was intended to alter the FCC\u2019s long-standing rules governing applications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 950. In sum, we determined that the Commission could not justify a departure from its rules in light of (1) the deprivation visited upon Reuters, which had faithfully abided by the rules and held licenses in hand, and (2) the tenuous basis for Associated\u2019s ill-timed application. <em>Reuters </em>did not hold, as Orange Park would have it, that an agency may never grant exceptions to its rules. Indeed, we could not have held so broadly without upsetting precedent recognizing that \u201c[a]ny rule of general applicability will involve particular cases of hardship, for which an agency would be empowered to make individual dispensations.\u201d <em>Basic Media, </em>559 F.2d at 833; <em>see also WAIT Radio v. FCC, </em>418 F.2d 1153, 1157 (D.C.Cir.1969) (\u201cThe agency\u2019s discretion to proceed in difficult areas through general rules is intimately tied to the existence of a safety valve procedure for consideration of an application for exemption based on special circumstances.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Contrary to Orange Park\u2019s assertions, the facts before us differ in vital respects from those in <em>Reuters. </em>For one thing, the FCC\u2019s action in this case works no deprivation of a vested property interest. As we expressly recognized in <em>Reuters, </em>\u201csuch a vested interest must be given due weight in any consideration of fundamental fairness.\u201d 781 F.2d at 950 n. 5; <em>see also Teleprompter Cable Systems v. FCC, </em>543 F.2d 1379, 1384-87 (D.C.Cir.1976) (reversal of Commission\u2019s refusal to grant necessary certificate to cable television company to which local authority had granted franchise).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Furthermore, in <em>Reuters </em>the beneficiary of the Commission\u2019s departure from its rules fell into error by virtue of its own misreading of a Commission report which, though ambiguous, did not specifically address the filing of the applications at issue and which was by its express terms subject to the longstanding rules which <em>did </em>govern such filings. There was thus no <em>reasonable </em>reliance in <em>Reuters </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>on Commission rulings or staff representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Here, on the contrary, it appears that the source of confusion over the filing dates was the Commission\u2019s own staff. <em>Cf. New York State Energy Research &amp; Development Authority v. FERC, </em>746 F.2d 64, 65-66, 68 (D.C.Cir.1984) (agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in applying new filing rules to party that followed old rules, in reliance on agency manual and agency officials). In further contrast to <em>Reuters, </em>it was the staff\u2019s practice which, though incorrect, specifically addressed the issue of how to determine whether a major transfer of control had taken place; the full Commission had never squarely resolved the issue. <em>See Bamford v. FCC, </em>535 F.2d at 82 (\u201c[A]n applicant should not be placed in the position of going forward with an application without knowledge of the requirements established by the Commission, and elementary fairness requires clarity of standards sufficient to apprise an applicant of what is expected.\u201d). Under these circumstances, we conclude that, upon finding that Clay had reasonably relied on the Bureau\u2019s interpretation of section 73.3572 and its method of processing applications, the Commission could reasonably have permitted Clay to cure its violation of that rule.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">But a problem remains. As we have stated in the clearest terms, \u201c[w]hen an agency decides to make an exception to the general rule, it is ... required to have stated the reasons for the exception clearly on the record.\u201d <em>Basic Media, </em>559 F.2d at 833. In our judgment, the Commission\u2019s elliptical remark that its action was justified by \u201cthe confusion caused by the Bureau\u2019s processing practice,\u201d <em>see supra </em>note 10, fails to satisfy this standard. Beyond finding that the staff practice was a potential source of confusion, the FCC made no findings that Clay had in fact relied on the practice or that such reliance was, under the circumstances, reasonable. Although we hold that the Commission was not precluded in law from granting an exception to its rules, we cannot affirm its doing so without adequate findings of reasonable reliance on the asserted Bureau practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">We therefore vacate that portion of the Commission\u2019s decision permitting Clay to cure its violation of section 73.3572 and remand to the agency for the purpose of determining whether Clay in fact reasonably relied upon the Bureau\u2019s interpretation. If Clay fails to satisfy the requirement of reasonable reliance, then the Commission must reassess the entire set of circumstances, including considering the possibility of affording both parties the opportunity to submit applications conforming with the Commission\u2019s rules. For the reasons already stated, we affirm the remainder of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-11\">.

On appeal of the ALJ\u2019s decision to the Commission's Review Board, Orange Park maintained, as it had before the ALJ, that it satisfied this threshold requirement by showing that because of their proximity to an airport, none of the available fully-spaced sites could accommodate the 1,000-foot antenna it proposed to erect. <em>See Decision of Review Board, supra </em>note 5, 95 F.C.C.2d at 1171, J.A. at 31; Orange Park Hearing Exhibit 8, J.A. at 88; Hearing Transcript at 390, 414-15, 423-24, 448-51, J.A. at 131-39. As support for its view that availability of fully-spaced sites must be determined by reference to the specific operations proposed by the applicant seeking the waiver, Orange Park cites <em>WSET, Inc., </em>80 F.C.C.2d 233 (1980), in which the Commission granted a waiver of Section 73.610 based on proof that although fully-spaced sites existed, none would accommodate the service proposed by the licensee that sought the waiver. <em>WSET, </em>however, concerned a request by an <em>existing </em>licensee that wished to move its transmitter from an existing short-spaced site to a site that was less short-spaced. The Review Board determined that the particular circumstances surrounding the waiver request in <em>WSET </em>sufficiently distinguished that decision to render it inapplicable to Orange Park\u2019s waiver request. 95 F.C.C.2d at 1171-72, J.A. at 31-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">We accept the Commission\u2019s explanation that <em>WSET </em>does not apply.

From those portions of the hearing transcript supplied in the parties\u2019 submissions, it appears that Orange Park\u2019s engineering expert formulated his \u201cequivalent protection\u201d rationale with scant attention to Commission regulation. <em>See </em>Hearing Transcript at 266-69, J.A. at 104-07. It further appears that the expert decided to rely exclusively on the rationale because none of the FCC staff raised any questions about Orange Park\u2019s submission \u2014 concerning, for example, estimates of the geographic area and number of persons affected by interference from Orange Park's proposed operations. <em>See id. </em>at 292, J.A. at 111.

At oral argument, this court drew attention to the decisions of this circuit relevant to the issue and ordered further briefing.

[and] the right to refile an application for the Channel 25 facility.\u201d Supplemental Brief of Appellant at 7. That contingencies may arise which cause Orange Park to decide not to reapply or which defeat its application does not point to a lack of redressability. <em>See Village of Arlington Heights, </em>429 U.S. at 261-62, 97 S.Ct. at 561; <em>cf.

We can discern no \"absolute barriers\u201d to Orange Park\u2019s competing for channel 25 were the award to Clay overturned by the Commission. <em>See Greater Tampa, </em>627 F.2d at 264-65. In particular, redress of the injury alleged by Orange Park does not depend on the actions of third parties not before the court, as have most of the instances in which the Supreme Court and this court have found a lack of redressability. <em>See, e.g., Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org., </em>426 U.S. 26, 42-46, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1926-28, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976); <em>Greater Tampa, </em>627 F.2d at 263-65; <em>cf.

Having determined that Orange Park has devised plans sufficiently detailed to enable it to compete for the facility, we are not required further \"to engage in undue speculation as a predicate for finding that [Orange Park] has the requisite personal stake in the controversy.\u201d <em>Village of Arlington Heights, </em>429 U.S. at 262, 97 S.Ct. at 561; <em>cf.

In fact, predicting the likelihood that Orange Park could be found qualified to compete for a permit, and would receive it, is particularly inappropriate for a reviewing court, since Congress has left these determinations in the first instance to the Commission, not the courts. <em>See infra </em>section III-C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b760-6\">. As counsel for the Commission correctly pointed out at oral argument, a licensee\u2019s interest in a broadcast license (or a construction permit, <em>see supra </em>note 1) is not a full-fledged, indefeasible property interest, since it is limited in duration, and held only so long as the licensee operates in the public interest. <em>See Sanders Brothers Radio Station, </em>309 U.S. at 475, 60 S.Ct. at 697. But neither is it a non-protected interest, defeasible at will. Indeed, to suggest as much would, among other things, throw considerable doubt on the Commission\u2019s well-known recognition of a renewal expectancy that leads applicants to vie for licenses which, if awarded, will require a significant expenditure of resources. <em>See, e.g., Committee for Community Access v. FCC, </em>737 F.2d 74, 77-78 (D.C.Cir.1984).
