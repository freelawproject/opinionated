The panel, with the support of one-half of the active members of this court, has rejected both the petition for rehearing filed on behalf of the Ridge-wood Kiwanis Club, which will now have its license agreement with Kiwanis International terminated because it accepted Julie Fletcher as a member, and the arguments contained in the brief filed by the State of New Jersey as amicus curiae, which cogently and thoroughly explains why the panel\u2019s interpretation of the New Jersey statute is flawed. In reaching its result, the panel ignored the statutory interpretation of the Division on Civil Rights of the State of New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety, the New Jersey agency charged with administering the statute, and failed to mention, much less discuss, the most relevant opinion of the Supreme Court of New Jersey. Because of the studied refusal of the panel to consider applicable New Jersey judicial and agency interpretation, I dissent from the denial of the petition for rehearing in banc. I take this unusual step only because the panel opinion was filed without any dissent, and there is no other way to air what I believe are the serious shortcomings in the panel\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">This action was initiated by Kiwanis International which sought an injunction under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051 <em>et seq., </em>to prevent Kiwanis Ridgewood from using Kiwanis International\u2019s federally registered collective service marks because Ridgewood had admitted a female member. Ridgewood and Fletcher filed a New Jersey action seeking to enjoin Kiwanis International from terminating Ridgewood\u2019s license. Kiwanis International removed the state court action to the district court where it was consolidated with the pending Lanham Act action. The district court determined that New Jersey law should be applied to fill in the interstices in the Lanham Act which gives no direction as to interpretation of a trademark licensing agreement. 627 F.Supp. 1381, 1393-94 (D.N.J.1986). Thus, in ruling on Kiwanis International\u2019s federal action, the district court looked to the applicable state law, and held that \u201cthe New Jersey Law Against Discrimination prohibits the discriminatory policies on which the licensing agreement is conditioned, and indeed on which the revocation is based.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1394-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">The panel of this court reversed. In essence, the panel holds that Kiwanis International, an association of hundreds of thousands of members, may discriminate on the basis of sex by denying membership to women and may force its unwilling New Jersey licensed clubs to do the same. The panel reaches this conclusion notwithstanding the New Jersey legislature's 1970 Amendment to its Law Against Discrimination to add a prohibition against sex discrimination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That Act now reads, in relevant part: \u201cThe legislature finds and declares that practices of discrimination against any of its inhabitants, because of ... sex ... are a matter of concern to the government of the State, and that such discrimination threatens not only the rights and proper privileges of the inhabitants of the State but menaces the institutions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>foundation of a free democratic State.\u201d N.J.S.A. 10:5-3. Furthermore, the panel gives the statutory language of the Law Against Discrimination a niggardly interpretation despite the New Jersey Superior Court\u2019s earlier comment that \u201c[t]he law is remedial and should be read with an approach sympathetic to its objectives.\u201d <em>National Organization for Women, Essex County Chapter v. Little League Baseball, Inc., </em>127 N.J.Super. 522, 530, 318 A.2d 33, 37, <em>aff'd, </em>67 N.J. 320, 338 A.2d 198 (1974) (hereafter <em>Little League).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The panel\u2019s decision hinges on its finding that the Kiwanis Ridgewood Club is not a \u201cplace of public accommodation\u201d and hence is not covered by the provision of the Law Against Discrimination that prohibits a \u201cplace of public accommodation\u201d from denying its advantages or privileges on the basis of, <em>inter alia, </em>sex. <em>See </em>N.J.S.A. 10:5-12(f). The panel acknowledges that a Kiwanis Club is a \u201cplace\u201d. Such a construction, however awkward literally, is mandated by the New Jersey Superior Court\u2019s statement in <em>Little League </em>that, \u201cThe statutory noun \u2018place\u2019 (of public accommodation) is a term of convenience, not of limitation.\u201d 127 N.J.Super. at 531, 318 A.2d at 37. A Kiwanis Club is no less a \u201cplace\u201d for purposes of the statute than is a baseball league.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Instead, the panel holds that the Kiwanis Ridgewood Club is not a place of \u201cpublic accommodation\u201d because the \u201cevidence of membership practices and policy does not reflect an open and unrestricted invitation to the community at large to join Kiwanis Ridgewood.\u201d 806 F.2d 468, 475 (3d Cir. 1986). It reads the <em>Little League </em>case, in which the New Jersey Superior Court rejected Little League\u2019s contention that it was not a place of public accommodation, as limited by the fact that the Little League \u201copenly invites all children in the community, with no restriction except sex, to join.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In holding that \u201cthe test of \u2018place of public accommodation\u2019 is unselectivity, unrestrictedness, and open invitation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 476, the panel misinterprets <em>Little League, </em>fails to account for the contrary construction by the New Jersey Division of Civil Rights in two litigated cases, overlooks the statutory language which conclusively demonstrates that it has misread \u201cpublic accommodation,\u201d and, perhaps most astonishing of all, fails to cite the only relevant New Jersey Supreme Court decision that ineluctably leads to a different result. Moreover, the majority of the panel failed to focus on the relevant entity, the parent organization, Kiwanis International, in making its factual decisions as to \u201cselectivity\u201d, an issue on which the district court never ruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">The panel\u2019s opinion is dependent upon its understanding that when the Superior Court of New Jersey stated that \u201cLittle League is a <em>public </em>accommodation because the invitation is open to the children in the community at large, with no restriction (other than sex) whatsoever,\u201d <em>Little League, </em>127 N.J.Super. at 531, 318 A.2d at 37-38, quoted at Slip op. at 12, this meant that all groups or associations which are not open to unrestricted membership are not \u201cpublic\u201d. Nothing in <em>Little League </em>so states or suggests. In fact, the opinion makes clear that even the Little League had some restrictions, which the New Jersey Superior Court alluded to, i.e. age, apparently open only to those between 8 and 12 years old, 127 N.J.Super. at 526, 318 A.2d at 35, and geography, open only to boys in communities having local leagues. <em>Id. </em>at 530, 318 A.2d at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">The panel, as a federal court interpreting state law, failed to give the decisions of the state agency charged with administering the statute the same deference accorded them by the New Jersey courts. <em>See National Surety Corp. v. Midland Bank, </em>551 F.2d 21, 26 (3d Cir.1977) (this court\u2019s decision is controlled by the New Jersey court\u2019s construction of its own legislation). <em>See also Peper v. Princeton University Board of Trustees, </em>77 N.J. 55, 69-70, 389 A.2d 465, 472 (1978) (court must give deference to agency\u2019s determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">Decisions of New Jersey\u2019s Division on Civil Rights establish that the mere fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>that there is some selectivity in acceptance of members is not incompatible with status as a \u201cpublic accommodation\u201d. In <em>Hinden v. United States Power Squadrons, </em>Division on Civil Rights, Docket No. PO2S-105 (Dec. 21, <em>1973), aff'd </em>Docket No. A-3104-73 (App.Div.1975), <em>cert. den., </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>382, 354 A.2d 310 (1975), <em>cert. den., </em>426 U.S. 943, 96 5. Ct. 3160, 49 L.Ed.2d 1180 (1976), AG App. at 15, the Division held that the denial of Marilyn Hinden\u2019s application for membership in the United States Power Squadrons was an act of proscribed sex discrimination in violation of the public accommodation provision of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, notwithstanding the fact that the Power Squadrons, a national boating organization which had local squadrons in New Jersey, did not have an \u201cunrestricted\u201d membership policy. On the contrary, an essential prerequisite for membership invitation was the successful completion of a basic pilot course.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Similarly, and even closer factually, is the decision of the New Jersey Administrative Law Judge that the discriminatory practices of excluding women from certain of the \u201cselective\u201d eating clubs of Princeton University violated the Law Against Discrimination. <em>See Frank v. Trustees of Princeton University, </em>Office of Administrative Law, Docket No. CRT 5042-85 (June 16, 1986). The AU based his decision on the opinion of the Director of the Division on Civil Rights which <em>rejected </em>Princeton\u2019s claim that because the eating clubs were \u201cin their nature distinctly private,\u201d and hence not places of public accommodation, the clubs were exempt from the provisions of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination. <em>See Frank v. Ivy Club, </em>Division on Civil Rights, Docket Nos. PL 05-1678, PL 05-1679, PL 05-1680 (Feb. 6, 1986), AG App. at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">These opinions make it evident that the panel\u2019s belief that \u201c[i]t is this standard of open invitation to all that defines the content of a \u2018public accommodation,\u2019 and establishes the essential character of those organizations which are subject to the statute\u2019s proscriptions and those that are not,\u201d 806 F.2d at 473, is patently erroneous. It is significant that one of the underlying findings in the <em>Frank </em>case was that, \u201cthe general public is not invited to join [the three Princeton eating clubs that were respondents].\u201d <em>Frank v. Ivy Club, </em>Division on Civil Rights, Docket Nos. PL 05-1678, PL 05-1679, PL 05-1680 (May 14, 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">The panel even failed to recognize that its focus only on \u201cselectivity\u201d as the basis for its finding that Kiwanis Ridgewood is not a \u201cpublic accommodation\u201d is contrary to the statutory definition of that phrase. The statute defines a \u201cplace of public accommodation\u201d to include, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cany ... academy, college and university,\u201d N.J. S.A. 10:5-5(Z), and it is common knowledge that entrance to such institutions is neither unselective nor unrestricted. It is therefore evident that the New Jersey legislature did not intend that \u201cpublic accommodation\u201d would embrace only unselective and unrestricted entities, as the panel holds. The New Jersey Supreme Court has expressly recognized that Princeton University, in its role as educator, \u201cconstitute[s] a public accommodation under N.J. S.A. 10:5 \u2014 5(Z)\u201d <em>Peper v. Princeton University Board of Trustees, </em>77 N.J. at 67-71, 389 A.2d at 471-73. The panel decides that because Kiwanis Ridgewood has not opened its membership rolls to the \u201ccommunity at large\u201d the Law Against Discrimination is inapplicable to it, even though Princeton University, which also has not done so, has been conclusively determined to be bound by that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">The panel recognizes that the statutory exclusion from \u201cplaces of public accommodation\u201d for any \u201cbona fide club ... which is in its nature distinctly private,\u201d N.J.S.A. 15:5-5(l), \u201crepresents the other side of the \u2018public accommodation\u2019 coin.\u201d 806 F.2d at 476. In other words, a club that is not \u201cdistinctly private\u201d is, by definition, a place of public accommodation. However, in applying its rule of \u201cselectivity\u201d as the key to the statutory definition, the panel overlooks the ruling of the Supreme Court of New Jersey that a private swim club which accepted members only on the unanimous recommendation of a membership commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>tee, and after a personal interview, was not \u201cdistinctly private\u201d. <em>Clover Hill Swimming Club v. Goldsboro, </em>47 N.J. 25, 28-32, 219 A.2d 161, 163-64 (1966). The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the club, which in its sign and in its promotional literature consistently referred to itself as a \u201cprivate\u201d facility, was not \u201cdistinctly private\u201d because it \u201csought to attract new members from the public at large\u201d and because it \u201cdoes not owe its existence to the associational preferences of its members but to the coincidence of their interest in the facilities offered by the owners.\u201d 47 N.J. at 33, 34, 219 A.2d at 165, 166. Therefore, the Court held that the club\u2019s discrimination against blacks for membership was violative of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">I find it astonishing that the panel did not even attempt to distinguish <em>Clover Hill, </em>the only relevant New Jersey Supreme Court case. Nor did it denominate as clearly erroneous the district court\u2019s finding that \u201ctestimony established repeatedly that the primary function of [the Kiwanis] is not to promote camaraderie among its members, but rather to perform charitable service to the community.\u201d 627 F.Supp. at 1388. The panel merely ignores Judge Sarokin\u2019s finding. Although the Kiwanis may have some membership prerequisites, such as the International\u2019s requirement that members belong to a recognized trade or profession, or Ridgewood\u2019s requirement that members be willing to pray and say the pledge of allegiance, these do not negate the essential fact that the Kiwanis is a service organization rather than a social club.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Roberts v. United States Jaycees, </em>468 U.S. 609, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984), also focused on the lack of intimacy in association among members of the Jaycees in holding that a state statute that prevented the Jaycees from discriminating against women did not violate the male members\u2019 associational rights. The panel cavalierly dismisses the <em>Roberts </em>decision as inapplicable here, because the panel\u2019s holding pretermitted its consideration of the Kiwanis members\u2019 associational rights. 806 F.2d at 473-74 n, 10. The panel overlooks that at the heart of the <em>Roberts </em>decision was the Court\u2019s consideration of the pertinent record factors, including size, purpose, policies, selectivity etc., of the Jaycees organization. <em>See </em>468 U.S. at 620-21, 104 S.Ct. at 3250-51. The <em>Roberts </em>decision depended on the Court\u2019s conclusion that the local chapters of the Jaycees are \u201cneither small nor selective\u201d and that \u201cmuch of the activities central to the formation and maintenance of the association involves the participation of strangers to that relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 621, 104 S.Ct. at 3251.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Just as these factors led the Supreme Court of Minnesota to rule that the Jaycees was a \u201cplace of public accommodation\u201d within the meaning of its statute, <em>United States Jaycees v. McClure, </em>305 N.W.2d 764 (Minn.1981), there are comparable factors as to the Kiwanis which mandate a similar holding in this case. Kiwanis International, like the Jaycees, is an educational and charitable organization which is large and essentially unselective, except insofar as its seeks to exclude women. It has 8,200 local chapters, and 313,000 individual members. 627 F.Supp. at 1383. Both groups have women at their meetings and encourage women to participate in their activities, short of membership and voting. <em>See Roberts, </em>468 U.S. at 621, 104 S.Ct. at 3251; <em>Kiwanis, </em>627 F.Supp. at 1384. The Kiwanis have formalized women\u2019s participation through \u201cKiwanianne\u201d clubs, mostly but not exclusively for wives and widows of Kiwanis members. 627 F.Supp. at 1384. Although the Supreme Court of Minnesota apparently believed Kiwanis membership was more restrictive than the Jaycees, <em>see Jaycees v. McClure, </em>305 N.W. at 771, the record fails to support any finding of the kind of selectivity that would justify denominating the Kiwanis clubs as \u201cdistinctly private\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">The brief of the State of New Jersey in support of the petition for rehearing succinctly summarizes the record evidence with respect to Kiwanis International as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>[Kiwanis International] directs its publicity and services to the public at large and not solely to its members, which is an indicia of a place of public accommodation rather than a private club. Its constitution sets minimum rather than maximum membership levels for local clubs (JA 463), and despite its claims of selectivity, it clearly promotes membership recruitment through large-scale round-ups, at which everyone who comes to the round-up is offered membership (2T43). Kiwanis literature also indicates that the International has offered awards for members who recruit large numbers of new applicants (JA 158-159). Testimony at trial also indicated that the Kiwanis spent a quarter of a million dollars on public relations efforts to promote the Kiwanis name to the public (1T176) and that the organization seeks to continually recruit members (1T179) to carry on the service activities of the organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Brief of the State of New Jersey as Amicus Curiae at 11 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Surprisingly, only Judge Adams in his concurring opinion considered the facts with regard to Kiwanis International. Kiwanis Ridgewood is not an independent entity, since it is licensed by Kiwanis International, and its goals and membership criteria are controlled by the constitution and by-laws of Kiwanis International. Thus, the panel\u2019s failure to scrutinize the activities of Kiwanis International is inexplicable. In the <em>Frank </em>case, the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights looked to the activities of Princeton University, whose interdependent relationship to the eating clubs was analogous to that of Kiwanis International to Kiwanis Ridgewood. <em>Frank v. Ivy Club, </em>Division on Civil Rights (Feb. 6, 1986), AG App. at 6. In <em>Hinden, </em>it focused on the activity of the United States Power Squadrons, rather than the local affiliate. <em>Hinden v. United States Power Squadrons, </em>Division on Civil Rights (Dec. 21, 1973), AG App. at 16. Consideration of the record facts as to Kiwanis International makes it apparent that it could not be considered to be distinctly private.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Even were the focus only on the Kiwanis Ridgewood Club, the record does not support the \u201cdistinctly private\u201d finding made by the panel. Ordinarily, the burden is on the party seeking exemption from the statute, <em>see Andersen v. Exxon Co., </em>89 N.J. 483, 493, 446 A.2d 486, 491 (1982) (employment discrimination); <em>see also Matter of United States Power Squadrons v. State Human Rights Appeal Board, </em>59 N.Y.2d 401, 465 N.Y.S.2d 871, 452 N.E.2d 1199, 1204 (1983). The panel points to no evidence that members have joined Kiwanis Ridgewood because of their social interest in each other. For its finding of \u201cselectivity\u201d, the panel relies on the facts that the Ridgewood Club is small, consisting of only twenty-eight members, and that its turnover is low, since no more than twenty members have been admitted in the last decade. 806 F.2d at 475. With due respect to the panel, these facts fail to suggest, much less prove, that the club is \u201cdistinctly private\u201d. Although there may have been a sponsorship requirement, the requirement of sponsorship or recommendation for applicants to the Clover Hill Swimming Club did not prevent the New Jersey Supreme Court from rejecting the claim that it was \u201cdistinctly private\u201d. <em>See Clover Hill, </em>47 N.J. at 28-32, 219 A.2d at 163-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The panel points to no evidence that the Ridgewood Club purposely sought to limit its membership. In fact, the evidence was to the contrary since Ridgewood conducted a membership drive in which it sent out letters to fifty businesses seeking members, and was \u201ccontinually\u201d on the lookout for new members. <em>See </em>806 F.2d at 475. The panel points to no evidence of \u201cselectivity\u201d. In fact, the only relevant evidence was that no proposed member had been rejected. In sum, even were \u201cselectivity\u201d the only basis for determining whether an association is a \u201cplace of public accommodation\u201d, the panel points to no evidence that membership in Kiwanis Ridgewood could not be readily acquired, even by one without strong social ties to the members.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">It is inconceivable to me that if Kiwanis International required its New Jersey member clubs to discriminate on the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>of color or ethnicity, this court would give such an opprobrious policy the same judicial sanction that it gives to Kiwanis International\u2019s sex discrimination. The \u201cstigmatizing injury\u201d of discrimination \u201cis surely felt as strongly by persons suffering discrimination on the basis of their sex as by those treated differently because of their race.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>468 U.S. at 625, 104 S.Ct. at 3253. New Jersey has declared that the \u201ccancer of discrimination\u201d, <em>Jackson v. Concord Co., </em>54 N.J. 113, 124, 253 A.2d 793 (1969), applies equally to sex discrimination as to race discrimination. The panel\u2019s decision sends out a message to the contrary. It is unreasonable and unpersuasive for the panel to have placed the Kiwanis, a highly visible active organization whose purpose is \u201cservice to Youth and the Elderly, to Community and Nation,\u201d App. at 455, in the same class as the outmoded \u201cdistinctly private\u201d mens\u2019 clubs whose members recline in overstuffed chairs with understuffed social consciences.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Could there really be any more \u201carchaic and overbroad assumption[ ] about the relative needs and capacities of the sexes,\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>468 U.S. at 625, 104 S.Ct. at 3253, than the testimony of the secretary of Kiwanis International that the prime function of the Kiwanis, which is to engage in service activities, would be adversely affected by admitting women members but not by having \u201cthree women members ... cooking pancakes\u201d at a \u201cpancake sale\u201d? App. at 383-84. I am confident that the panel members do not share these stereotypical notions of a woman\u2019s place in modem society. Nonetheless, the panel opinion vouchsafes the insulting Kiwanis membership policy in the face of New Jersey\u2019s statute to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">There is some solace in the fact that this court\u2019s interpretation of New Jersey\u2019s Law Against Discrimination is not the last word. Someone soon may bring a similar matter before the Division on Civil Rights, where it cannot be removed to a federal court bound by the panel\u2019s precedent and where what I believe to be the New Jersey legislature\u2019s intent can be vindicated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-5\">.
