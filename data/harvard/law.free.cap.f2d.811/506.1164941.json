App.P. 34(a); Tenth Cir.R. 34.1.8. The cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-34\">Laura J. Dixon appeals from a district court judgment affirming the denial of her application for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. After the state agency in Oklahoma and the Social Security Administration denied her application initially and on reconsideration, Dixon requested a hearing de novo before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). The ALJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>convened a hearing at which Dixon appeared without counsel, accompanied only by her sister. The AU subsequently issued a decision denying Dixon\u2019s claim for benefits, which became the Secretary\u2019s final administrative decision when the Appeals Council denied Dixon\u2019s request for review. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma affirmed the Secretary\u2019s denial of benefits, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">On appeal Dixon asserts that the district court erred in affirming the Secretary\u2019s finding that Dixon was not disabled. Specifically, Dixon asserts that there was not substantial evidence to support the AU\u2019s findings that her medical impairment did not meet or equal a listed impairment, that she could perform light work, and that her nonexertional limitations did not preclude reference to the medical-vocational guidelines. Finally, Dixon asserts that the AU erred in categorizing her as literate under the grids.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">In reviewing such findings of fact, we are not asked to reweigh the evidence or try the issues de novo, but only to determine whether there was substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the finding. <em>Tillery v. Schweiker, </em>713 F.2d 601, 603 (10th Cir.1983). Substantial evidence is more than a \u201cmere scintilla,\u201d but less than a preponderance, and \u201cmeans such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (quoting <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 216, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The record provides substantial evidence to support the AU\u2019s determinations that Dixon\u2019s diagnosed impairments did not meet or equal a listed impairment, and that the Medical Vocational Guidelines relevant to a residual functional capacity for light work were applicable to her. Dixon claimed impairments including myasthenia gravis, carpal tunnel syndrome, hyperthyroidism, high blood pressure, arthritis, and heart disease. Medical examinations and tests indicate that the effects of these conditions were mild, and well-controlled by low dosages of medication without negative side effects. Although Dixon and her sister testified to her disabling pain, dizziness and muscle weakness, the medical reports provided little corroboration or support for her contention that her condition precluded light work. Dixon was able to perform to near-normal levels in cardiovascular exercise tests; other tests revealed only minor muscle weakness and nerve impairment. Examination reports over time did not indicate progressive deterioration of Dixon\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">On this medical record, we cannot reverse the AU\u2019s finding that Dixon was capable of performing a full range of light work, not significantly compromised by her nonexertional limitations or by restrictions against heights and working around dangerous moving machinery, and his consequent recourse to the Secretary\u2019s Medical Vocational Guidelines, the \u201cgrids.\u201d The crucial question on appeal is whether the AU erred in categorizing Dixon as literate under the grids. As we explain below, that finding is necessary to the AU\u2019s conclusion, adopted by the Secretary, that Dixon was not disabled. We reverse because there is no substantial evidence in the record to support the AU\u2019s finding that Dixon is literate.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">The Medical Vocational Guidelines, the \u201cgrids,\u201d are a classification scheme directing a finding of \u201cdisabled\u201d or \u201cnot disabled\u201d based on a claimant\u2019s age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity to perform work (e.g., sedentary, light, medium, or heavy work). It is not contested that, for purposes of the grids, Dixon at age fifty-one was closely approaching advanced age and had no previous work experience. As we note above, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the AU\u2019s finding that Dixon could perform a full range of light work. Accordingly, the grid classifications at issue are Rules 202.09 and 202.10:</p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">20 C.P.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2, Table 2.</p>\n<p id=\"ABz\">Under this pair of rules, a finding of literacy was necessary to the AU\u2019s determination that Dixon was not disabled. If Dixon is illiterate, then Rule 202.09 is applicable, directing the conclusion that Dixon is disabled. The AU found that Dixon had a \"marginal education\u201d and that Rule 202.10 \u201cwould direct a conclusion of \u2018not disabled.\u2019\u201d R. II, 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Although the issue of Dixon\u2019s literacy was raised in her petition for district court review and on appeal to this court, her educational level appears at no time to have been the focus of more than pro for-ma inquiry. The record of the administrative hearing includes this colloquy between Dixon and the AU:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">\u201cQ And you completed 6 grades in school and learned to read and write through basic calculations in arithmetic, adding, subtracting and that sort of thing? Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">A Not very well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">Q But some of it\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-11\">A Some of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-12\">Q Ok. Can you read a newspaper if you want to? Read the articles and understand them pretty well?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-13\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-14\">Q What sort of things do you read from time to time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-15\">A I can \u2014 there\u2019s so many words that I can\u2019t pronounce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-16\">Q Ok.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-17\">A That I don\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-18\">Q Do you read letters and write letters?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWl\">A I can\u2019t write. I can\u2019t spell INAUDIBLE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-19\">Q Well, do you write letters sometimes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-u\">A No, I can\u2019t spell enough words to write a letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-20\">Q Oh, so you don\u2019t even try?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-21\">A Well, I try \u2014 I write my name and write when I have to write\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-22\">Q Well, what \u2014 what kind of things do you have to write? Like grocery lists?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD9q\">A Yes, I get the name off\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-23\">Q So you can read a little bit and write a little bit? Is that what you\u2019re saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP5\">A I can read a little bit and write a little bit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-24\">Q Ok. Ok....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-25\">R. II, 38-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-26\">Dixon\u2019s sister also testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-27\">\u201cA ... she says, will you come by and \u2014 and take the \u2014 list for me and pick me up groceries or I do it in that way and it helps her out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-28\">Q She makes out the list and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-29\">A Un, hun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-30\">Q \u2014hands it to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>A Well, she doesn\u2019t. Her husband writes it out. As she told you, she can\u2019t spell well enough to INAUDIBLE easy spelling words or INAUDIBLE.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">R. II, 55. The only other evidence in the record, apart from several references to Dixon\u2019s years of formal schooling, is a passing comment in an October 1982 medical history and evaluation that Dixon \u201cis unable to spell but can read.\u201d R. II, 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">This record does not provide substantial evidence of Dixon\u2019s literacy. For purposes of applying the grids, illiteracy \u201cmeans the inability to read or write. We consider someone illiterate if the person cannot read or write a simple message such as instructions or inventory lists even though the person can sign his or her name. Generally, an illiterate person has had little or no formal schooling.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1564(b)(1). This definition makes explicit that literacy turns upon the ability to write as well as to read. <em>Cf. Zayas v. Heckler, </em>577 F.Supp. 121, 127 (S.D.N.Y.1983) (regulations require ability to read and write in English).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">The ALJ\u2019s apparent reliance on Dixon\u2019s \u201cmarginal education\u201d to establish her literacy is misplaced. Although Dixon reported six or possibly seven years of formal schooling, the Secretary\u2019s regulation provides for use of numerical grade level to determine educational abilities only if there is no other evidence to contradict it. Especially when many years have passed since completion of formal education, as in Dixon\u2019s case, \u201cthe numerical grade level ... completed in school may not represent ... actual educational abilities.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.964(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">There was evidence that Dixon could read, albeit with difficulty. Both Dixon and her sister, however, testified that she could not write. The 1982 medical history report that Dixon cannot spell is, if anything, independent evidence of her inability to write. Although the Secretary on appeal alleges that Dixon testified that she could \u201cread a little bit and write a little bit,\u201d a closer examination of the record reveals that statement to be the result of the AU\u2019s cross-examination of Dixon, a repetition by her of the AU\u2019s unfounded conclusion rather than reliable testimony to her alleged literacy. The AU drew negative inferences for which we can find no basis in the record (\u201c... so you don\u2019t even try?\u201d) and cut off Dixon\u2019s attempts to respond to those inferences. On this record, there is simply no indication that Dixon could \u201cwrite a simple message such as instructions or inventory lists,\u201d as required by the Secretary\u2019s own regulations for a finding of literacy. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1564(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">It is clear that, under the Social Security Act, the claimant has the burden of proving a disability. <em>Channel v. Heckler, </em>747 F.2d 577, 579 (10th Cir.1984). But it is equally clear that a Social Security disability hearing is a nonadversarial proceeding, in which the AU has a basic duty of inquiry, \u201cto inform himself about facts relevant to his decision and to learn the claimant\u2019s own version of those facts.\u201d <em>Heckler v. Campbell, </em>461 U.S. 458, 471, 471 n. 1, 103 S.Ct. 1952, 1959, 1959 n. 1, 76 L.Ed.2d 66 (1983) (Brennan, J., concurring). The duty of inquiry also extends to the district court in its review of the AU\u2019s determination. <em>See Hill v. Morton, </em>525 F.2d 327, 328 (10th Cir.1975) (placing \u201can affirmative duty upon a district court reviewing administrative action to engage in substantial inquiry of the relevant facts as developed in the administrative record and then to define, specifically, those facts which it deems supportive of the agency\u2019s decision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">The duty of inquiry takes on special urgency when the claimant has little education and is unrepresented by counsel. <em>Campbell, </em>461 U.S. at 471, 103 S.Ct. at 1959; <em>see also Kane v. Heckler, </em>731 F.2d 1216, 1219 (5th Cir.1984); <em>cf. Tillery, </em>713 F.2d at 602. That special urgency is evident in the instant case, where Dixon had no attorney at the hearing before the AU, and was accompanied only by her sister, who had no formal schooling whatsoever. R. II, 56. Neither the AU\u2019s colloquy with Dixon nor the district court\u2019s opinion evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>dences the specific and nonadversarial inquiry the law requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">We are aware of and sympathetic to the enormous caseload borne by the ALJs in the disability decision system of the Social Security Administration. <em>See Richardson, </em>402 U.S. at 399, 91 S.Ct. at 1426 (Social Security system\u2019s structures and procedures \u201care of a size and extent difficult to comprehend\u201d). The system must be run efficiently and expeditiously, but neither the AU nor the reviewing court is \u201cappointed to process cases on an administrative assembly line.\u201d <em>Kane, </em>731 F.2d at 1219. The present case illustrates that inefficiency and delay in rendering final decisions is the consequence of a breakdown in the nonadversarial inquiry process.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">In reversing the Secretary\u2019s determination, it is within our discretion to remand to the Secretary for a further hearing or direct the district court to award benefits. <em>See, e.g., Podedworny v. Harris, </em>745 F.2d 210, 221 (3d Cir.1984). There is evidence of Dixon\u2019s illiteracy in the record before us, despite the sparseness of that record. Moreover, at this point in the disability determination, the Secretary has the burden of showing that the claimant is not disabled. The ALJ accepted Dixon\u2019s initial showing of impairment, and found that she could not perform past relevant work. R. II, 19, 23. Once a showing is made of disability preventing the claimant from engaging in prior work activity, the burden shifts to the Secretary to show \u201cthat the claimant retains the capacity to perform an alternative work activity____\u201d <em>Channel, </em>747 F.2d at 579; <em>accord Kane, </em>731 F.2d at 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Given that the burden is on the Secretary to show Dixon\u2019s literacy at this point, we believe that further administrative proceedings would only further delay the appropriate determination and award of benefits. <em>See Podedworny, </em>745 F.2d at 222 (production by Secretary of additional evidence to support finding of no disability doubtful when Secretary has burden of proof in already lengthy proceeding); <em>see also Broadbent v. Harris, </em>698 F.2d 407, 414 (10th Cir.1983) (reversal with order to grant benefits when prima facie case of disability not sufficiently rebutted by Secretary). Accordingly, we REVERSE and REMAND with the direction that SSI disability benefits be awarded to Dixon from April 23, 1983.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
