The district court dismissed the suit with prejudice on the ground that the Secretary refused to comply with its order to \u201clist all persons who have given information concerning On Shore Quality Control to the Department of Labor.\u201d We agree with the Secretary\u2019s assertion that he need not comply because he is entitled to the protection of the informer\u2019s privilege, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">On Shore\u2019s defense to this lawsuit is that its employees are exempt from the Act\u2019s overtime provisions as administrative employees under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(1). In 1981 a Department of Labor investigation of On Shore concluded that its employees were indeed exempt under this provision, but in 1983 a second investigation came to the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">On Shore filed several interrogatories with which the Secretary refused to comply, in each instance arguing that the government was protected from responding by the informer\u2019s privilege. In April of 1985 the district court ordered that plaintiff respond, and in July it issued a second order to this effect, ruling that the informer\u2019s privilege did not apply. When the Secretary still failed to comply, the court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">In <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 59, 77 S.Ct. 623, 627, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957), the Court stated that \u201c[w]hat is usually referred to as the informer\u2019s privilege is in reality the Government\u2019s privilege to withhold from disclosure the identity of persons who furnish information of violations of law to officers charged with enforcement of that law.\u201d Although <em>Roviaro </em>was a criminal case, the privilege uniformly has been applied in civil cases as well. We have held that the Secretary of Labor is entitled to invoke the informer\u2019s privilege in a number of prior Fair Labor Standards Act cases. <em>Hodgson v. Charles Martin Inspectors of Petroleum, </em>459 F.2d 303 (5th Cir.1972); <em>Wirtz v. Robinson &amp; Stephens, Inc., </em>368 F.2d 114 (5th Cir.1966); <em>Wirtz v. McDade, </em>330 F.2d 610 (5th Cir.1964); <em>Wirtz v. Continental Finance &amp; Loan Co. of West End, </em>326 F.2d 561 (5th Cir.1964).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\"><em>Roviaro </em>established a \u201cbalancing of interests\u201d test for determining when the informer\u2019s privilege attaches. In <em>Charles Martin, </em>which involved a suit under the Fair Labor Standards Act similar to the case at bar, we articulated the balancing test: \u201cthe interests to be balanced here are the public\u2019s interest in efficient enforcement of the Act, the informer\u2019s right to be protected against possible retaliation, and the defendant\u2019s need to prepare for trial.\u201d 459 F.2d at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">The district court in the instant case reasoned that the defendant\u2019s need to prepare for trial outweighed the public\u2019s interest in enforcement of the Act and the informer\u2019s right to be protected against retaliation. We find no peculiar problem of the employer\u2019s preparation of this case. In <em>Charles Martin, </em>for instance, the Secretary of Labor brought suit for violation of the minimum wage, overtime and record keeping provisions of the Act. The district court dismissed the cas\u00e9 when the Secretary refused to respond to interrogatories asking for copies of statements made to the Secretary by defendant\u2019s employees. In that case, like this one, the defendant had urged \u201ca clear and convincing need for adequate preparation of its defense because ... the cost of taking the depositions of all the individuals involved would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>virtually prohibitive.\u201d <em>Charles Martin, </em>459 F.2d at 306. Nevertheless, this court held that \u201cthe Secretary was entitled to assert the informer\u2019s privilege,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 304, and that \u201cthe district court\u2019s order must be reversed because compliance with the order ... would disclose those individuals who might be the subject of retaliation for their cooperation with the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306. The same result, for the same reasons, was reached in <em>Robinson &amp; Stephens, McDade, Continental Finance, </em>and <em>Stephenson Enterprises.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">On Shore advances the view accepted by the district court that this case is distinguishable from the prior cases because of the 1981 Department of Labor investigation that reported no Labor Act violations. Defendant fails to explain, however, <em>why </em>the 1981 investigation makes this case so different from our precedents. The record makes clear that in 1981 the compliance officer talked with only one On Shore employee, by long-distance telephone. This could be reason enough to conduct a second investigation, and, in any event, we conceive of no reason why the fact that this \u2019is a second investigation should lead to an abrogation of the informer\u2019s privilege. Discovery of what changed the Department\u2019s opinion might satisfy the employer's curiosity but we do not consider that to be a material issue to the defense of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Defendant next argues that the interrogatory at issue does not ask for the names of informers, but, rather, for \u201cnames of those who have knowledge of the new facts and changed conditions that brought about the attempted change in exemption status.\u201d But the district court\u2019s order makes clear that the interrogatory asked for a list of persons who have given information to the Department of Labor. Apparently On Shore thinks that \u201cperson who gives information\u201d is significantly different from \u201cinformer\u201d because the latter but not the former refers only to those who give negative or complaining information. This distinction is not supported by our cases, however. In <em>Robinson &amp; Stephens </em>we reversed a district court order that \u201cthe Secretary designate which [trial] witnesses had given written statements to the Secretary.\u201d 368 F.2d at 115. This order \u201cwas based on the theory that the fact of giving a statement did not necessarily indicate that the statement maker was an informer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court thought that \u201cthe order tends toward disclosure of informers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The same interests that militate against divulging the names of \u201cinformers\u201d militate equally against divulging the names of \u201cthose who have given information,\u201d and leaving to the employer the identification of displeasing informants. As Judge Tuttle observed for the court in <em>Continental Finance, </em>\u201c[t]he purpose for allowing the informers privilege ... is to make retaliation impossible.\u201d 326 F.2d at 564. This purpose remains intact even where a list of informers is included within a somewhat larger list containing some persons who spoke with the authorities but who did not complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The Secretary submitted to the defendant a document entitled \u201cSummary of Back Wages,\u201d containing the name of each employee found due back wages, his or her address, the times of the violations, and the amount due each employee. The issue to be tried in this case concerns the nature of the duties performed by these individuals, and whether the duties are, as claimed, administrative. The list of \u201call persons who have given information to the Department of Labor\u201d is \u201cutterly irrelevant to the issues to be tried by the trial court.\u201d <em>Continental Finance, </em>326 F.2d at 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-14\">. <em>See also Stephenson Enterprises v.
