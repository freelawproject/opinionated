ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b738-23\">The National Pension Fund maintained by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO (IAM), cancelled all past service credits for covered employees of the Central Tool Company after it discontinued its contributions to the Fund. The company now challenges this action as violative of Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>302(c)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled that the cancellation was arbitrary and capricious, and for that reason contravened Section 302(c)(5), insofar as it materially affects Fund determinations on satisfaction of vesting requirements by Central Tool employees, but not to the extent that it decreases their accrued benefits under the governing plan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In our view, the case is controlled by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>UMWA Health &amp; Retirement Funds v. </em>Robinson,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the central teaching of which constrains us to hold that the termination of past service credits does not impinge upon Section 302(c)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The Fund is a multi-employer,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> open-ended,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> defined benefit<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> trust created in 1960 pursuant to an agreement and declaration of trust between the union and employers of employees represented by affiliated locals of the union.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Fund is administered by an equal number of union-designated and employer-selected trustees,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and is financed by employers\u2019 contributions made in accordance with collective bargaining agreements with union affiliates.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-16\">Central Tool inaugurated its relations with the Fund by contributions effective July 1, 1970, pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement with lAM\u2019s Local Lodge 147, the representative of some of Central Tool\u2019s employees.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The participation agreement between Central Tool and the local, which was expressly incorporated into the collective bargaining agreement, listed the payments that Central Tool would be required to make to the Fund \u201cunder the Agreement and Declaration of Trust dated May 1, 1960, as amended, which has been signed by the Employer and I.A.M. Lodge in the place provided at the end of such Agreement attached hereto.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The terms of the pension plan agreement thus appear to have been incor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>porated by reference in the collective bargaining contract. The pension plan agreement provided for determination of the accrued benefits and the vesting status of each covered employee on the basis of how much \u201cservice credit\u201d the employee possessed. Service credits were to be ascertained in accordance with Benefit Plan A, which contained rules governing the collection, investment, and distribution of the contributions of participating employers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Benefit Plan A granted two types of service credit to covered employees. One was future service credit for the period during which they worked for an employer then contributing to the Fund on their behalf;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the other was past service credit for any period prior thereto during which they worked for the same employer if the service continued up to the point at which the employer\u2019s obligation to contribute to the Fund commenced.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">At the time Central Tool joined the plan,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Benefit Plan A featured a rule, adopted by the Fund\u2019s board of trustees pursuant to the original trust agreement, governing the amount of service credit to be retained by covered employees of employers who terminate their participation in the plan while continuing in the same or a similar line of business.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Section 4 of Article IX of the plan provided then, as it does now, that such employees would keep all accrued future service credits but would forfeit all accrued past service credits.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-14\">In 1978, Central Tool withdrew from the plan in accordance with a new collective bargaining agreement which provided that Central Tool would establish its own pension fund for covered employees and would guarantee benefits accrued by them under Benefit Plan A.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Upon notification of Central Tool\u2019s withdrawal, the Fund invoked the rule cancelling past service credits.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Since Central Tool had undertaken in the 1978 collective bargaining agreement to act as guarantor against any loss of those benefits, the cancellation increased its liability under its own pension plan. Central Tool then brought this action against the Fund and its trustees assailing the plan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>forfeiture provision, primarily under Section 302(c)(5).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">The District Court applied the principle, then extant in this circuit, that an eligibility rule of a Section 302(c)(5) trust fund, or its application adversely to a covered employee or group of employees, is invalid if it is arbitrary or capricious.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Recognizing the strong interest of Central Tool employees in retaining pension benefits they could reasonably have believed to be vested,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the court struck down the plan\u2019s forfeiture provision insofar as it deprived employees of their status as vested beneficiaries under the plan.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The court grounded this action upon the Fund\u2019s failure to demonstrate that forfeitures of vested status either served an \u201coverriding purpose\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> or were \u201cactuarially necessary\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> to prevent employers from undermining the Fund by dumping unfunded liability \u2014 through early withdrawals from the plan \u2014 after their employees had acquired substantial past service credits. At the same time, the court upheld the cancellation of past service credits for purposes of accrual benefits,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> reasoning that any injury to Central Tool employees resulting from an incremental reduction in benefits was outweighed by the Fund\u2019s legitimate interest in preserving its financial integrity and the desirability of minimizing judicial alterations of a plan agreed upon through collective bargaining.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Both sides now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">At the outset, we must determine whether Central Tool has standing to challenge the plan\u2019s forfeiture rule under Section 302 of the Labor Management Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">The District Court derived its jurisdiction from Section 302(e), which in general terms authorizes federal district courts to \u201crestrain violations\u201d of Section 302.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> There is no provision, however, indicating who may sue or be sued thereunder. Filling this interstice, courts have construed Section 302(e) to permit a contributing employer to bring suit when it has suffered or will incur injury from enforcement of plan rules or administration of the trust.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>In the case before us, a collective bargaining agreement has required Central Tool to establish a new pension plan preserving the accrued benefit entitlements of its employees under Benefit Plan A.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Application of the plan\u2019s forfeiture provision increases Central Tool\u2019s liability under its plan, and thus produces an injury we think sufficient to allow Central Tool to maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Section 302 prohibits an employer from paying anything of value to a union or other representative of employees unless the payment falls within one of the exceptions set forth therein.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Section 302(c)(5) validates employer-financed employee trust funds, such as Benefit Plan A, if, among other things, they operate \u201cfor the sole and exclusive benefit of the employees of [the contributing] employer and their families and dependents____\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Central Tool asserts that the forfeiture provision in Benefit Plan A is arbitrary and capricious, and thus does not inure to the \u201csole and exclusive benefit\u201d of those designated in Section 302(c)(5).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">The statutory requirement embodied in this language was addressed by the Supreme Court in <em>UMWA Health &amp; Retirement Funds v. Robinson.</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Resolution of Central Tool\u2019s claim, of course, must square with that decision. Moreover, since the holding in <em>Robinson </em>was framed on the basis of and by explicit reference to the substantial caselaw that Section 302(c)(5) had previously generated, a survey of that body of jurisprudence is essential to sound application of <em>Robinson </em>to the contentions Central Tool now presses.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-14\">Before <em>Robinson, </em>federal courts often encountered challenges to eligibility rules, or the application of such rules, promulgated for Section 302(c)(5) trust funds. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>With but few exceptions,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> these courts refused to interpret Sections 302(c)(5) and 302(e) as conferring general equity jurisdiction to enforce fiduciary duties of trustees with respect to these funds, or otherwise to supervise the Funds\u2019 day-to-day administration.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> This limitation on the role of the judiciary reflected a number of considerations: fear of overextending judicial resources in an area traditionally governed by state law;<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> concern about the absence of an explicit basis for such jurisdiction in the language or legislative history of Section 302;<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and apprehension that a criminal statute might be construed too broadly.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Moreover, the legislative history of Section 302 provided some indication that Congress did not intend its enactment of this provision to establish comprehensive federal oversight of trust fund administration.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>The provisions of this section shall not be applicable ... with respect to money or other thing of value paid to a trust fund established by such representative, for the sole and exclusive benefit of the employees of such employer, and their families and dependents (or of such employees, families, and dependents jointly with the employees of other employers making similar payments, and their families and dependents): <em>Provided, </em>That (A) such payments are held in trust for the purpose of paying, either from principal or income or both, for the benefit of employees, their families and dependents, for medical or hospital care, pensions on retirement or death of employees, compensation for injuries or illness resulting from occupational activity or insurance to provide any of the foregoing, or unemployment benefits or life insurance, disability and sickness insurance, or accident insurance; (B) the detailed basis on which such payments are to be made is specified in a written agreement with the employer, and employees and employers are equally represented in the administration of such fund, together with such neutral persons as the representatives of the employers and the representatives of employees may agree upon and in the event the employer and employee groups deadlock on the administration of such fund and there are no neutral persons empowered to break such deadlock, such agreement provides that the two groups shall agree on an impartial umpire to decide such dispute, or in the event of their failure to agree within a reasonable length of time, an impartial umpire to decide such dispute shall, on petition of either group, be appointed by the district court of the United States for the district where the trust fund has its principal office, and shall also contain provisions for an annual audit of the trust fund, a statement of the results of which shall be available for inspection by interested persons at the principal office of the trust fund and at such other places as may be designated in such written agreement; and (C) such payments as are intended to be used for the purpose of providing pensions or annuities for employees are made to a separate trust which provides that the funds held therein cannot be used for any purpose other than paying such pensions or annuities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>Despite this reluctance to exercise jurisdiction under Section 302(e) broadly, the overwhelming majority of courts infused Section 302(c)(5) with a demand that trust fund administration not be arbitrary or capricious.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Although some early cases did so without reference to particular statutory language,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> subsequent decisions identified Section 302(c)(5)\u2019s command that qualifying trust funds must operate for the \u201csole and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>exclusive benefit\u201d of covered employees as the source of the requirement.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Courts often justified the availability of judicial review for arbitrariness as necessary to protect the \u201cstructure\u201d of trust funds under Section 302(c)(5), but frequently failed to articulate a consistent standard governing the scope or rigor of the analysis.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> While some courts limited review to challenges to eligibility rules on their face,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> others focused on the putative beneficiaries affected by the trustee action complained of, and denied review unless a size-able number faced injury.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Still others expanded the scope of review to include lawsuits disputing the application of an otherwise valid requirement to a single employee,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> and courts occasionally utilized the arbitrary-or-capricious test to review trustee action alleged to be procedurally unfair.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Although courts normally disturbed eligibility rules or trustee actions only if they lacked a rational relationship to distribution of benefits to covered employees or to protection of the long-run financial viability of the trust fund,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> some appeared to engage in a higher level of scrutiny to measure the validity of such rules or actions,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> thereby blurring even more the contours of the arbitrary-or-capricious standard.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">In sum, courts construed Section 302(e) not to authorize federal enforcement of trustees\u2019 fiduciary obligations with respect to Section 302(c)(5) trust funds. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>same time, however, they interpreted the \u201csole and exclusive benefit\u201d language in the latter section to prohibit arbitrary or capricious action by fund trustees. Because of the inherently mercurial nature of this standard and judicial indecision as to its scope and rigor, courts ultimately proved unable entirely to avoid overseeing the day-to-day administration of employee trust funds.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Close scrutiny of the caselaw just chronicled underlay the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Robinson. </em>The plaintiffs challenged a trust fund eligibility rule, established in a collective bargaining agreement between the United Mine Workers of America and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> as arbitrary and capricious and therefore violative of Section 302(c)(5).<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Reversing the judgment of this court in favor of the plaintiffs,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> the Supreme Court held that the Section 302(c)(5) directive at issue \u2014 that the trust fund must operate for the \u201csole and exclusive benefit</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">of employees of [the contributing] employer, and their families and dependents\u201d\u2014 does not establish a reasonableness requirement applicable to eligibility rules or benefit levels fixed by collective bargaining.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The Court construed this provision to mean simply that employer contributions to the trust fund must inure solely to the benefit of protected employees and their families, and that the arbitrariness of the distribution scheme in general or of eligibility rules in particular was not a matter of judicial concern.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">Although the <em>Robinson </em>decision had the potential altogether to eviscerate the arbitrary-or-capricious standard vis-a-vis Section 302(c)(5), the Court carefully refrained from so broad a holding. Distinguishing prior cases in this circuit, the Court held that eligibility rules adopted through collective bargaining, rather than by trustees in their discretion, are not subject to a reasonableness requirement under Section 302(c)(5).<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> It follows, of course, that if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>rule involved in the instant case was a product of collective bargaining, it is immune to invalidation under a reasonableness test. We turn, then, to an analysis of <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>impact on this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The origin of the forfeiture provision protested by Central Tool effectively precludes a simple or mechanical application of <em>Robinson. </em>Section 4 of Article IX was adopted by the fund trustees, under authority conferred by the original trust agreement, prior to Central Tool's participation in the plan.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The provision, however, straddles the distinction drawn by the <em>Robinson </em>Court; it was approved, if only implicitly, through collective bargaining with subscribing employers, including Central Tool. For three reasons we think a proper interpretation of <em>Robinson </em>dictates that the forfeiture provision here, like the eligibility rule upheld in <em>Robinson, </em>not answer to any reasonableness requirement under Section 302(c)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">First, we can discern no relevant difference, from the perspective of either contributing employers or covered employees, between (a) an eligibility rule established initially by a collective bargaining agreement and (b) a rule promulgated by fund trustees, as authorized in the original trust agreement, prior to the time an employer becomes a plan member pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. In each case, the employer\u2019s entry into the plan results from collective bargaining, and the rule is part and parcel thereof. Since <em>Robinson </em>makes clear that Section 302 does not authorize federal courts to use a reasonableness standard to test the substantive content of an agreement reached through collective bargaining,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> the forfeiture provision challenged by Central Tool merits no greater scrutiny on these fact than the eligibility rule upheld in <em>Robinson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">Second, the <em>Robinson </em>Court limited the scope of its holding by distinguishing the two prior decisions of this circuit.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Examination of these cases suggests that the only question left undecided in <em>Robinson </em>was whether federal courts have jurisdiction under Section 302(e) to entertain challenges by a contributing employer or a covered employee to discretionary trustee actions taken unilaterally after, not before, commencement of the employer\u2019s contributory obligation.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>In one of these cases, <em>Kosty v. Lewis,</em><footnotemark><em>63</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a miner challenged a resolution, adopted by pension fund trustees after his employer assumed its funding obligation,<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> which deprived him of benefits accrued under the superseded eligibility rules.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Reviewing the procedural \u201creasonableness of the [lack of] opportunity afforded to [those persons with accrued benefits] under current standards\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> to consider retirement before the effective date of the new standards, this court found it arbitrary and capricious to expect individuals to \u201cwork ... at their peril in terms of the possibility that pension eligibility might be wiped out ... by the sudden action of the Trustees in changing the requirements.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The Supreme Court\u2019s express reference to Kosty<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> militates, we think, for a construction of <em>Robinson </em>that recognizes the propriety of judicial review only of independent trustee revisions to a plan made after an employer signs on.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>The second decision that <em>Robinson </em>distinguished, <em>Pete v. UMWA Welfare &amp; Retirement Fund,</em><footnotemark><em>70</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is consistent with this articulation of the scope of judicial review under Section 302(e). <em>Pete </em>involved a challenge by miners to a resolution by the trustees of the same UMWA trust fund, adopted after their employers had become participants in the plan, that deprived the miners of benefits they otherwise would have received.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Although the court did not expressly limit its inquiry as in <em>Kosty, </em>the similarity of the trustees\u2019 action in the two cases offers further support for our decision to utilize the rationale explicated in <em>Kosty </em>to inform our interpretation of <em>Robinson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The lack of explicit reference by this court in <em>Pete </em>or by the Supreme Court in <em>Robinson </em>to the rationale espoused in <em>Kosty </em>does not vitiate an interpretation of <em>Robinson </em>based thereon. The <em>Robinson </em>Court construed Section 302(c)(5) more restrietively than prior caselaw, and the cases chosen to illustrate the limits of the new interpretation could not have delineated the intended distinction with absolute precision or exhaustive prescience. We recognize the shortcomings inherent in any attempt to extract an understanding of <em>Robinson </em>from the cases limiting its holding, but we cannot ignore the deliberate selection of those cases as an indication of the Court\u2019s intent to temper its decision. We thus take the narrow focus of both <em>Kosty </em>and <em>Pete </em>as support for the proposition that <em>Robinson </em>did not leave undecided, but instead repudiated, the jurisdiction of federal courts under Section 302(e) to adjudicate challenges to trustee action by contributing employers who became plan members pursuant to collective bargaining agreements after the disputed action occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">The third reason for our holding arises from the absence of any statutory contemplation of a reasonableness requirement as a means of protecting Central Tool\u2019s employees from eligibility rules such as the forfeiture provision in issue here. The legislative history reveals that Section 302 was enacted, at least in part,<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> to protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>covered employees from improper management of employee trust funds.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> This legislative objective may well have promoted the emergence of the arbitrary-or-capricious test under Section 302(c)(5) as the best, if not the only, means by which covered employees might be shielded from arbitrary trustee actions. In cases such as this one, however, this type of review is not necessary adequately to safeguard the interests of covered employees. The eligibility rule in question already was part of Benefit Plan A when IAM and Central Tool negotiated for the company\u2019s participation in the plan. The company might have taken steps to counteract any perceived unfairness in its terms, and the union had the opportunity to shelter its members therefrom. Section 302(c)(5)(B) required the plan to be in writing and that it specify eligibility rules in detail,<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> thus ensuring that both the company and the union had sufficient knowledge of the provision to act responsively at the time they entered into their collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">We conclude, then, that whatever protection employees may need under Section 302(c)(5) against arbitrary trustee actions occurring after their employer has become a plan participant is afforded by union representation, as facilitated by the requirements of Section 302(c)(5)(B),<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> and obviates the need for judicial review of such challenges.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> In light additionally of <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>observation that neither the statutory text nor the legislative history of Section 302(c)(5) warrants judicial scrutiny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>of eligibility requirements fixed by collective bargaining under an arbitrary-or-capricious standard, we are persuaded that a forfeiture rule embedded in a benefit plan when an employer negotiates plan membership by collective bargaining \u2014 like eligibility rules fixed initially by collective bargaining \u2014 is not subject to a reasonableness requirement under Section 302(c)(5).<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">For these reasons, we hold that the forfeiture provision challenged by Central Tool falls within the ambit of <em>Robinson </em>and outside our proper authority to review. Accordingly, we need not reach the question whether the forfeiture provision in suit is arbitrary or capricious. We affirm the judgment of the District Court that the forfeiture provision is valid for benefit-accrual purposes, and reverse the judgment that the provision is invalid under Section 302(c)(5) insofar as it deprives any Central Tool employee of vested status under Benefit Plan A.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-6\">.

In <em>Norton </em>v. <em>International Ass\u2019n of Machinists Nat'l Pension Fund, supra </em>note 42, for example, this circuit considered the same cancellation provision that is found in Article IX, \u00a7 4 of Benefit Plan A and is at issue in the case at bar. The court stated that even if the provision was otherwise valid \u2014 and, implicitly, even if the provision on the whole bore a rational relationship to the Fund\u2019s purposes \u2014 it was nevertheless invalid on the facts of that case because it would be \"manifestly unfair\u201d to deprive an employee of pension benefits solely because his fellow employees changed their union affiliation. 180 U.S.App.D.C. at 182, 553 F.2d at 1358.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b744-16\">. The cases exemplify the vagaries inherent in judicial review under the arbitrary-or-capricious standard. Since trustees have no a priori principles by which to fashion particular requirements to govern distribution of benefits, eligibility rules inevitably will seem to be arbitrary in some sense, and judicial review of such rules under that standard thus tend to be somewhat uneven. Compare, e.g., <em>Robinson v. UMWA Health &amp; Retirement Funds, supra </em>note 41, 205 U.S.App.D.C. at 337, 640 F.2d at 423 (holding that financial savings alone cannot justify challenged eligibility rule) with <em>Gaydosh v.

Even when applying the arbitrary-or-capricious standard courts have not been overly enthusiastic about its consistency. See, e.g., <em>Riley v. MEBA Pension Trust, supra </em>note 41, 570 F.2d at 412. They have recognized that it is an-' alytically unstable, see <em>Johnson v. Botica, supra </em>note 37, 537 F.2d at 934, and might spawn litigation over some claims of breach of fiduciary duty, see <em>Giordani v. Hoffmann, </em>295 F.Supp. 463, 471-472 (E.D.Pa.1969).

In the present case, no Central Tool employee was adversely affected by the forfeiture provision when it was adopted, and the company has not represented that the Fund improperly processed any applications. We thus find Central Tool's position in this regard lacking in merit and, in light of this disposition, it is unnecessary to decide whether Central Tool employees received adequate notice of the oncoming forfeiture provision or whether the company\u2019s claim of procedural unfairness is even cognizable under \u00a7\u00a7 302(c)(5) and 302(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"70\">\n<p id=\"b748-6\">. <em>Supra </em>note 42.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"71\">\n<p id=\"b748-7\">. Similarly, other cases in this circuit, e.g., <em>Norton v. International Ass\u2019n of Machinists Nat'l Pension Fund, supra </em>note 42; <em>Gaydosh v. Lewis, supra </em>note 42; and <em>Danti v. Lewis, supra </em>note 42, have involved attacks by covered employees on alterations in eligibility requirements made by fund trustees after contributions began on behalf of employees that deprived them of benefits they would have received absent the new rules. Whether all decisions of this circuit have embraced the <em>Kosty </em>rationale, however, is not entirely clear. The <em>Pete </em>decision, for example, came after <em>Roark v. Boyle, </em>141 U.S. App.D.C.390, 439 F.2d 497 (1970) <em>(Roark II), </em>and <em>Roark v.

As did <em>Pete </em>and <em>Kosty, Roark I </em>and <em>Roark II </em>involved a challenge to a resolution by fund trustees apparently adopted after contributions had been made on behalf of the plaintiffs. It cannot be determined from <em>Roark I or Roark II, </em>however, whether the rule in fact had been effected only after plaintiffs had worked for a contributing employer, as the rule apparently embodied fund policy that predated adoption of the formal resolution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"72\">\n<p id=\"b748-11\">.

There has been no suggestion here, however, that this forfeiture provision, or similar provisions in general, inure or have inured to the advantage of the union or its leaders rather than to the benefit of covered employees and their dependents.

Full knowledge of Benefit Plan A\u2019s forfeiture provision may be attributed to the union by analogy to the common law of trusts, which excuses a trustee from liability to a fully informed trust beneficiary for breach of duty if, absent fraudulent inducement, by conduct or statement the beneficiary has affirmed or ratified the trustee\u2019s actions. A. Scott, The Law of Trust \u00a7 218 (3d ed. 1967 &amp; Supp.1985); G. Bogert, The Law of Trusts and Trustees \u00a7 688 (rev.2d ed. 1982).

We note, furthermore, that the disputed forfeiture provision in Benefit Plan A by its own terms operates only when a contributing employer terminates its participation in the plan. Because withdrawal presumably will occur only pursuant to a new collective bargaining agreement, it would seem that a union has two opportunities to protect its members from any anticipated unfairness in the forfeiture clause, once when the employer\u2019s participation in the plan is first agreed upon through collective bargaining and again when the employer\u2019s termination is similarly determined by negotiations between the parties. This underscores our conclusion that the arbitrary-or-capricious standard is not necessary to safeguard covered employees\u2019 interests in the Fund. Indeed, it would seem that IAM in this case has taken full advantage of its capability of protecting its members from any undesirable consequences of Central Tool\u2019s withdrawal from the plan, for it acted through collective bargaining to procure Central Tool's agreement to guarantee the accrued benefits of the members under Benefit Plan A, thereby leaving Central Tool as the sole party interested in contesting the provision in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"77\">\n<p id=\"b750-6\"><em>. </em>Although the forfeiture provision is shielded from review under the arbitrary-or-capricious standard, it may of course be overturned under \u00a7 302(e) if it fails to comply with any of the specific standards of \u00a7 302(c)(5). <em>UMWA Health &amp; Retirement Funds v.

In this case, one might conceivably argue that the forfeiture provision in Benefit Plan A violates the requirement of \u00a7 302(c)(5) that contributions must operate for \"the sole and exclusive benefit of the employees of [the contributing] employer,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(c)(5) (1982), because the Fund may use some of Central Tool\u2019s contributions to pay benefits to employees of other employers. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(c)(5)(C) (1982). We believe, however, that \u00a7 302(c)(5)\u2019s explicit authorization of multi-employer trust funds, see, e.g., <em>Huge v.

Robinson, supra </em>note 3, 455 U.S. at 572, 102 S.Ct. at 1232, 71 L.Ed.2d at 428, conclusively demonstrate that eligibility rules are valid under this provision so long as they result in distribution of benefits only to employees on whose behalf contributions to the fund have been made.
