The district court dismissed on the ground that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction or, alternatively, that it had discretion to defer to pending state court litigation. Transamerica appeals. We hold that there was federal jurisdiction but affirm on the alternative ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-19\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-20\">An employee of the Bank of America died of heat stroke. The bank\u2019s employee welfare plan included a life insurance policy worth some $50,000, with double indemnity in the event of death by \u201cexternal, violent, and accidental means.\u201d Transamerica, the insurer, paid the decedent\u2019s estate single coverage, denying that the double indemnity clause applied to heat stroke. Defendant, the decedent\u2019s daughter and successor to the estate, threatened to sue; Transamerica responded by seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>a declaratory judgment in federal district court. About one month later, defendant filed suit in state court. Her complaint raised exclusively state law claims, including an action for bad faith. She then successfully moved in the district court to dismiss Transamerica\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-5\">\n<em>SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-6\">This is not a simple case. That this is so is a tribute to the intricate interplay of federal and state laws, including those fixing the jurisdiction of federal and state courts. What ought to be a fairly simple problem of interpreting an insurance policy turns out to be a complex case requiring the analysis of complicated statutes and the subtle distinctions that might be drawn between numerous judicial opinions. Reflection prompts this thought. Federalism within the United States is passing from the realm of common understanding to that of lawyers and judges, and even our grip on its meaning may be slipping. No one is to blame; it is just happening.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-7\">a. <em>Section 502(a)(3).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1337-8\">Transamerica bases its claim to a federal forum on section 502(a)(3) of ERISA,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which permits an ERISA fiduciary to bring a civil action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-9\">(A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) <em>to obtain other appropriate equitable relief </em>(i) to redress such violations or (ii) <em>to enforce </em>any provisions of this subchapter or <em>the terms of the plan.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1337-12\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3) (emphasis added). The parties have been helpful and have stipulated that the bank\u2019s welfare plan is an ERISA plan, and that Transamerica is a fiduciary thereof. Transamerica argues that its action seeks \u201cequitable relief ... to enforce\u201d the terms of this plan, which entitles it to be in federal court. Transamerica points to the settled law that section 502(a)(3)(B) can be the jurisdictional basis for some declaratory judgment actions. <em>See Franchise Tax Bd. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, </em>463 U.S. 1, 26-27, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 2855, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983). The issue, however, is whether Transamerica\u2019s suit is an action either to obtain \u201cequitable\u201d relief or to \u201cenforce\u201d the terms of the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-13\">A declaratory judgment does not necessarily constitute a form of \u201cequitable\u201d relief. \u201c[Djeclaratory relief is neither strictly equitable nor legal____\u201d E. Borchard, <em>Declaratory Judgments </em>399 (2d ed. 1941); <em>e.g., Hartford Fin. Sys. v. Florida Software Servs., </em>712 F.2d 724, 727 &amp; cases cited (1st Cir.1983); <em>see </em>10A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2769, at 758 (1983) [hereinafter <em>Wright &amp; Miller </em>]. A particular declaratory judgment draws its equitable or legal substance from the nature of the underlying controversy. <em>Pacific Indem. Co. v. McDonald, </em>107 F.2d 446, 448 (9th Cir.1939); <em>see Wallace v. Norman Indus., </em>467 F.2d 824, 827 (5th Cir.1972). Defendant\u2019s contractual claim to benefits, the source of Transamerica\u2019s case, is clearly a legal one.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Had Transamerica\u2019s suit gone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>to trial, defendant could have demanded a jury. <em>See, e.g., Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Herrald, </em>483 F.2d 425, 426 (9th Cir.1973) (per curiam). Not so, generally speaking, were it an equitable action. Transamerica\u2019s suit essentially presents a legal claim, albeit an inverted one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-4\">Moreover, even if all declaratory judgments were considered \u201cequitable\u201d in nature, at least for the purposes of section 502(a)(3), we would still hold that Transamerica is not seeking to \u201cenforce\u201d the terms of its plan. A declaratory judgment may be said to \u201cenforce\u201d ERISA or the terms of an ERISA plan where it seeks to establish the primacy of an ERISA obligation over some independent, potentially conflicting federal or state law duty. Thus in <em>Franchise Tax Board, </em>the Court stated that section 502(a)(3)(B) authorized \u201ca declaratory judgment action in federal court to determine whether the plan\u2019s trustees may comply with a state levy on funds held in trust.\u201d 463 U.S. at 27, 103 S.Ct. at 2855; <em>see also United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Trust v. Pacyga, </em>801 F.2d 1157 (9th Cir.1986) (jurisdiction assumed without discussion; declaration sought by fiduciary that state anti-subrogation law did not apply to ERISA insurance plan specifically calling for subrogation in some circumstances). A declaratory judgment might also be sought to \u201cenforce\u201d an ERISA term by establishing that the party against whom it is brought is charged with carrying out an ERISA duty which that party is allegedly disregarding. <em>See, e.g., Pacyga, </em>801 F.2d at 1159 (beneficiary allegedly had obligation under plan that she sought to avoid). The instant case fits neither of these categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-6\">The truth of the matter is that Transamerica seeks a federal forum to interpret its contract. It seeks to clarify its obligations as an insurer, not to uphold its ERISA obligations in the face of a competing, independent duty. Nor does the defendant, the beneficiary, have ERISA obligations that this suit seeks to have her fulfill. We are not the first court to draw a distinction between an insurer\u2019s suit to interpret its policy and an action \u201cto enforce\u201d an ERISA term within the special authorization of section 502(a)(3)(B). <em>See Northeast Dep\u2019t ILGWU Health &amp; Welfare Fund v. Teamsters Local Union No. 229 Welfare Fund, </em>764 F.2d 147, 153-54 (3d Cir.1985) (holding that an ERISA insurer\u2019s declaratory suit seeking a favorable interpretation of a standard policy clause, against a party having no obligations under the plan, was not an action to \u201cenforce\u201d the plan terms).</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-7\">The statutory language preceding section 502(a)(3) fortifies our conclusion. In subsection (a)(1), Congress authorizes an ERISA participant or beneficiary, <em>but not a fiduciary, </em>to bring suit</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1338-8\">(B) to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, <em>to enforce </em>his rights under the terms of the plan, <em>or to clarify </em>his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1338-9\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Congress has distinguished here between <em>enforcement </em>and <em>clarification </em>of rights. If required to choose between clarification and enforcement, we would characterize Transamerica\u2019s suit as one seeking clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>The defendant, on the other hand, could have sued under the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(B). <em>See Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, </em>473 U.S. 134, 146, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 3093, 87 L.Ed.2d 96 (1985). According to section 502(e)(1), she would have been permitted to bring this action in state or federal court, whereas Transamerica\u2019s suit, were it to fall within section 502(a)(3), could be heard only in federal court. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e)(1). This strongly suggests that section 502(a)(3) should be construed against permitting an insurer to transform a case over which Congress has authorized state court jurisdiction, when the insured seeks recovery, into a case over which there is only federal court jurisdiction, when the insurer sues. Standard policy terms such as Transamerica\u2019s double indemnity clause \u2014 even though the clause happens to figure in an ERISA plan \u2014 implicate no federal interests of such gravity as to warrant exclusive federal interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-6\">We hold, therefore, that Transamerica\u2019s suit does not fall within the ambit of section 502(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-7\">b. <em>Declaratory Judgment Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1339-8\">Nevertheless, we conclude that the district court erred in determining that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. We find that jurisdiction was plainly available by way of the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201. This follows from the fact that to ascertain the presence of federal jurisdiction in a declaratory judgment action, it is necessary to determine whether the defendant against whom declaratory judgment is sought could have asserted his rights in a federal court. <em>See Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>339 U.S. 667, 671-72, 70 S.Ct. 876, 878-79, 94 L.Ed. 1194 (1950). \u201cIf ... the declaratory judgment defendant could have brought a coercive action in federal court to enforce its rights, then we have jurisdiction____\u201d <em>Janakes v. United States Postal Serv., </em>768 F.2d 1091, 1093 (9th Cir.1985). As noted above, defendant\u2019s claim to double indemnity benefits is at the heart of this case, and ERISA would have permitted her to sue on this claim in federal court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus the district court without doubt had federal question jurisdiction to hear Transamerica\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-12\">\n<em>ABSTENTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-13\">We now must turn to the question of whether the district court could refuse to exercise its jurisdiction. We hold that it could.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-14\">The defendant chose to sue in state court even though the federal forum was open to her. This court has long held that a district judge has discretion to decline jurisdiction in favor of pending state court litigation when a party seeks to use the Declaratory Judgment Act to deprive a plaintiff of his choice of forum or to encourage a race to judgment. <em>E.g., Shell Oil Co. v. Frusetta, </em>290 F.2d 689, 692 (9th Cir.1961) <em>(Shell Oil), H.J. Heinz Co. v. Owens, </em>189 F.2d 505, 508 (9th Cir.1951), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>342 U.S. 905, 72 S.Ct. 294, 96 L.Ed. 677 (1952); <em>see Kerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-O-Two Fire Equip. Co., </em>342 U.S. 180, 185-86, 72 S.Ct. 219, 222, 96 L.Ed. 200 (1952); <em>Hanes Corp. v. Millard, </em>531 F.2d 585, 592-93 (D.C.Cir.1976). Despite the longevity of this rule, our decision in <em>Mobil Oil Corp. v. City of Long Beach, </em>772 F.2d 534 (9th Cir.1985), suggests questions about its vitality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-15\">In <em>Mobil Oil, </em>the panel reversed a district judge\u2019s abstention in a declaratory judgment action. The court stated that reliance on <em>Shell Oil </em>and indeed on any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>pre-1976 cases touching this point \u201cmay be hazardous.\u201d 772 F.2d at 541. The reason given was that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976), had severely curtailed the district courts\u2019 discretion to defer to state litigation in most kinds of cases, including declaratory judgment actions. <em>Mobil Oil, </em>772 F.2d at 542. Abstention under <em>Colorado River </em>is permissible only in \u201cexceptional\u201d circumstances. <em>See </em>424 U.S. at 818, 96 S.Ct. at 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-4\"><em>Mobil Oil, </em>however, must be applied circumspectly. It did not discuss <em>post-Colorado River </em>authority that has continued to support the district courts\u2019 special jurisdictional discretion as to declaratory judgment suits independent of the <em>Colorado River </em>analysis. <em>See, e.g., Mission Ins. Co. v. Puritan Fashions Corp., </em>706 F.2d 599, 601-02 &amp; nn. 1 &amp; 3 (5th Cir.1983) (holding that the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d test does not apply to declaratory judgment actions); 10A <em>Wright &amp; Miller &amp; Kane, supra, </em>\u00a7 2759, at 651; 6A J. Moore, <em>Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 57.08[5] (1986). Nor did the <em>Mobil Oil </em>court discuss the indications in post-<em>Colorado River </em>Supreme Court opinions that jurisdiction over declaratory judgment actions requires a different analysis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nor, finally, did the panel in <em>Mobil Oil </em>acknowledge our own post-1976 cases reiterating the well-settled rule. <em>See Fern v. Turman, </em>736 F.2d 1367, 1370 (9th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1210, 105 S.Ct. 1177, 84 L.Ed.2d 326 (1985); <em>Geni-Chlor Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Multisonics Dev. Corp., </em>580 F.2d 981, 985 (9th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-8\">Whatever may be the reach of <em>Mobil Oil, </em>abstention in this case has congressional support. Congress has expressly provided ERISA beneficiaries with the choice be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>tween a state or federal forum in their actions to recover benefits. If a district court generally were compelled to hear an ERISA insurer\u2019s declaratory suit, the insurer would be able to circumvent the beneficiary\u2019s choice of a state forum in every ordinary case on the insurance contract. We do not believe that Congress intended that result. We hold that in this type of case, notwithstanding <em>Mobil Oil, </em>district courts retain discretion to decline jurisdiction over a defensive declaratory judgment suit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1341-7\">In this case, the district court\u2019s exercise of its discretion was proper. All issues raised in Transamerica\u2019s suit may be fully litigated in state court. Moreover, many of the issues raised in the state action \u2014 e.g., those relating to the beneficiary\u2019s state law bad faith claims \u2014 are more appropriate for state court resolution. No compelling federal interests are at stake, the federal action was not too far advanced, and Transamerica does not face any danger of potentially conflicting obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-8\">It can be argued that federal common law should govern the interpretation of Transamerica\u2019s double indemnity clause. We express no opinion on this issue. Even were federal law to govern, however, district courts in this context would not be required to view the source of law as the dispositive factor with respect to abstention. This follows from Congress\u2019s express authorization of state court jurisdiction. As we have previously observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1341-9\">[ajctions to recover benefits or enforce rights under the terms of a plan will typically involve the application of those general principles of contract law with which the state courts have had substantial experience before ERISA; their expertise qualifies them to evaluate these rules in the light of ERISA\u2019s policies and apply federal common law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1341-5\"><em>Merihom v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>738 F.2d 1496, 1500 n. 2 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"As3\">Here abstention was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"AoK\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1337-10\">. We hold below that the district court had federal question jurisdiction over this case pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act. The reason we first consider Transamerica\u2019s argument for section 502(a)(3) jurisdiction is that such jurisdiction is exclusively federal. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e)(1). If the district court had <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction over Transamerica\u2019s suit, our analysis of its decision to abstain in favor of state court litigation might have been different. <em>Cf. Great Lakes Steel v. Deggendorf, </em>716 F.2d 1101, 1105 (6th Cir.1983) (suggesting that abstention may never be proper in section 502(a)(3) cases).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1337-15\">. In some cases, actions by ERISA beneficiaries to recover benefits are equitable for jury trial purposes. <em>See, e.g., Turner v. CF &amp; I Steel Corp., </em>770 F.2d 43, 47 (3rd Cir. 1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 800, 88 L.Ed.2d 776 (1986). But these cases involve pension suits against plan trustees, and their holdings turn on trust law rules under which such suits were previously heard in equity. <em>See id. </em>at 46-47. In such cases, the question presented is whether the trustee\u2019s conduct or interpretation of his duties was arbitrary or capricious, a question traditionally for judges rather than juries. <em>See id. </em>at 46; <em>Calamia v. Spivey, </em>632 F.2d 1235, 1237 (5th Cir.1980). Where an ERISA action is not of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>pension-trust type, these cases do not apply. See <em>Bugher v. Feightner, </em>722 F.2d 1356, 1360 (7th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 822, 105 S.Ct. 98, 83 L.Ed.2d 43 (1984). Here, no deference would be owing to Transamerica\u2019s construction of its own policy\u2019s terms. Furthermore, DiGregorio has a legal remedy against Transamerica for money immediately and unconditionally payable. Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 198 (1958); <em>see Wardle v. Central States, Etc., </em>627 F.2d 820, 829 &amp; n. 19 (7th Cir.1980). As against Transamerica, defendant\u2019s claim for benefits sounds essentially in contract, not in trust. It is no less legal in nature simply because the policy was purchased pursuant to an ERISA plan.</p>\n<p id=\"ANa\">We reenter the legal/equitable morass in this case with no alacrity. We must note, however, that Congress expressly considered a version of section 502(a) that would have authorized suits for \"legal or equitable\" relief, but ultimately chose only to permit the latter. <em>See Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, </em>473 U.S. 134, 146, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 3092, 87 L.Ed.2d 96 (1985). And the Supreme Court has counseled us to take section 502(a) \"as finally enacted\u201d strictly at its word. <em>Id. </em>at 146, 105 S.Ct. at 3093.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1339-9\">. Although not strictly necessary to its holding, the court in <em>Janakes </em>further stated that the hypothetical federal coercive action \"must \u2018arise under\u2019 federal law, and not be based merely on diversity of citizenship or another, nonsubstantive jurisdictional statute.\" 768 F.2d at 1093. Section 502(a)(1)(B) actions do arise under federal law. <em>See Menhorn v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>738 F.2d 1496, 1498 (9th Cir.1984). This is not to say that ERISA has preempted state law claims for insurance benefits, an issue we do not reach here. <em>See infra </em>note 5. Defendant <em>could </em>have sued under federal law even if her state law action is not preempted. That is all our jurisdictional analysis requires.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1340-5\">. In <em>Will v. Calvert Fire Insurance Co., </em>437 U.S. 655, 98 S.Ct. 2552, 57 L.Ed.2d 504 (1978), a sharply divided Court revisited abstention doctrine. Although <em>Calvert </em>was not a declaratory judgment case, four justices favoring abstention relied principally on <em>Brillhart v. Excess Insurance Co., </em>316 U.S. 491, 494, 62 S.Ct. 1173, 1175, 86 L.Ed. 1620 (1942), which <em>was </em>a declaratory judgment case, and which held that the district court \"was under no compulsion to exercise [its] jurisdiction.\" <em>See </em>437 U.S. at 662-64, 98 S.Ct. at 2557-58 (opinion of Rehnquist, J.). Four other justices, voting against abstention, stated that <em>Brillhart </em>was \"completely inapposite\u201d to <em>Colorado River </em>analysis because \"federal jurisdiction over declaratory judgment suits is discretionary.\" <em>Id. </em>at 670-72, 98 S.Ct. at 2561-62 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (citing cases and the language of the Declaratory Judgment Act). Both opinions, therefore, support the limited proposition that <em>Brillhart </em>survives <em>Colorado River </em>and authorizes jurisdictional discretion in Declaratory Judgment Act suits. <em>See also Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Mercury Const. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 18 n. 20, 103 S.Ct. 927, 937, n. 20, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983) (suggesting that the \"defensive\u201d or \"reactive\" nature of a federal declaratory judgment suit could be a ground for abstention independent of the <em>Colorado River </em>exceptional circumstances analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-6\">It is true, as the <em>Mobil Oil </em>court pointed out, that <em>\"Colorado River </em>itself involved a complaint for declaratory relief.\u201d 772 F.2d at 542. But the suit in <em>Colorado River </em>was for an adjudication of water rights. Neither the appellate court nor the Supreme Court mentioned the Declaratory Judgment Act, because the federal courts\u2019 power to declare real property rights is independent of the Declaratory Judgment Act. The Supreme Court itself, exercising its original jurisdiction, entertained cases to adjudicate territorial disputes well before passage of the Act in 1934, even though these were \"actions for a declaratory judgment in everything but name.\u201d <em>E. Borchard, supra, </em>at 142 n. 20. In such cases decided after 1934, as in <em>Colorado River, </em>the Court makes no reference to the Declaratory Judgment Act as the source of its authority. <em>See, e.g., Arkansas v. Tennessee, </em>310 U.S. 563, 60 S.Ct. 1026, 84 L.Ed.2d 1362 (1940). Thus the fact that the United States sought a declaration of water rights in <em>Colorado River </em>does not mean that the case arose pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act. We have called a similar suit an action to \u201cquiet title,\u201d <em>California v. United States, </em>235 F.2d 647, 652 (9th Cir.1956), and the Supreme Court has referred to suits for \"equitable apportionment\u201d or \"judicial apportionment\" of disputed water rights, <em>Idaho v. Oregon, </em>444 U.S. 380, 381, 100 S.Ct. 616, 618, 62 L.Ed.2d 564 (1980); <em>Arizona v. California, </em>298 U.S. 558, 560, 56 S.Ct. 848, 850, 80 L.Ed. 1331 (1936). Whatever the proper denomination, it is at least clear that the <em>Colorado River </em>Court did not consider that case to be a Declaratory Judgment Act suit. Otherwise the four dissenters in <em>Calvert </em>(all of whom were members of the six-justice <em>Colorado River </em>majority) would not have distinguished the \u201cdiscretionary\u201d federal jurisdiction over declaratory judgment suits from the \"non-discretionary\u201d federal jurisdiction to which <em>Colorado River </em>applies. <em>See Calvert, </em>437 U.S. at 671-73, 98 S.Ct. at 2561-62 (Brennan, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1341-18\">. We intimate no opinion as to the propriety of removal by the insurer to federal court. By giving ERISA beneficiaries their choice of a state or federal forum, Congress did not preclude removal in cases brought under ERISA section 502(a)(1). <em>See Clorox Co. v. United States Dist. Ct., </em>779 F.2d 517, 521 (9th Cir.1985). Nevertheless, the possibility of removal to federal court does not require that the insurer be permitted to become complete master of the insured\u2019s claim through a declaratory judgment action filed in the federal district court of the insurer\u2019s choice. <em>Cf. </em>6A J. Moore, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 57.19 at 57-207 (advising against allowing insurers to circumvent the insured\u2019s choice of forum via a declaratory judgment action).</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-19\">Moreover, it remains an open question in this circuit whether an ERISA beneficiary seeking to recover on an insurance policy in state court can rest on state law claims and thereby avoid removal. <em>See Takeda v. Northwestern Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 765 </em>F.2d 815, 822 &amp; n. 10 (9th Cir.1985) (reserving this question); <em>cf. Taylor v. General Motors Corp., </em>763 F.2d 216, 219 (6th Cir.1985) (state law action for insurance benefits under an ERISA plan could not be removed), <em>cert, granted, </em>106 S.Ct. 1182 (1986). We need not resolve here whether ERISA has preempted defendant\u2019s state law claims. As we have observed elsewhere, the state courts are perfectly competent to decide this issue. <em>See Takeda, </em>765 F.2d at 822 n. 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
