LEON HIGGINBOTHAM, Jr., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">This is an appeal and cross-appeal from a final judgment of the district court awarding attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1982). The fee award in question follows a judicial determination, in litigation initiated by plaintiffs-appellants (\u201cappellants\u201d), who in 1982 were the seven Republican members of Congress from New Jersey and seven citizens who resided in the districts represented by those members, that the congressional reapportionment plan adopted in 1982 by the New Jersey legislature was unconstitutional. The district court awarded appellants attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $253,461, to be assessed against defendants-intervenorsappellees (\u201cappellees\u201d), who are New Jersey state legislators.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Daggett v. Kimmelman, </em>617 F.Supp. 1269 (D.N.J.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Since we will affirm the holdings of the district court on the other issues appealed,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it is necessary to deal only with the award of counsel fees. Appellants, the congressional plaintiffs, assert error in the district court\u2019s refusal to award the full amount of fees requested. Appellees argue in their cross-appeal that the fee award should be substantially reduced as to every phase of the litigation and that the fees claimed for time expended in the so-called remedy phase should be disallowed. For the reasons noted below, we will affirm, with one exception, the district court\u2019s award of counsel fees for the so-called pre-remedy phase. Because it is unclear whether the <em>total </em>number of hours during the so-called remedy phase for which counsel were compensated involved solely \u201cgood-faith effort[s] to achieve population equality,\u201d <em>Karcher v. Daggett, </em>462 U.S. 725, 727, 103 S.Ct. 2653, 2656, 77 L.Ed.2d 133 (1983), or whether some of the time billed was spent obtaining favorable political results for the appellants, we will remand for further findings on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">\n<em>I. Facts and History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">As a result of the 1980 decennial census, the New Jersey General Assembly was required to reduce, from 15 to 14, and thereby to reapportion, that state\u2019s federal congressional districts. Eventually, the legislature enacted Public Law 1982 c. 1 (the \u201cFeldman Plan\u201d), a reapportionment scheme that was signed into law by the Governor of New Jersey on January 19, 1982. Thereafter, individuals including the incumbent Republican members of Congress from New Jersey filed suit in federal court. These plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Feldman Plan violated article 1, section 2 of the United States Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>tion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the fourteenth amendment and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Named as defendants were New Jersey Governor Kean, Attorney General Kimmelman, and Secretary of State Burgio. The 202d Session of the New Jersey General Assembly and the incumbent Democratic members of Congress from the State of New Jersey intervened in this suit to defend the constitutionality of the Feldman Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">After conducting a hearing, a three-judge district court, by a two-to-one vote, issued an opinion and order on March 3, 1982 declaring the Feldman Plan unconstitutional. <em>Daggett v. Kimmelman, </em>535 F.Supp. 978 (D.N.J.1982). Its order enjoined the three state defendants from New Jersey\u2019s executive branch from conducting elections under the Feldman Plan. On application of the intervenors from the state legislature and from New Jersey\u2019s Democratic congressional delegation, however, Justice Brennan stayed the district court\u2019s order pending appeal to the Supreme Court. <em>Karcher v. Daggett, </em>455 U.S. 1303, 102 S.Ct. 1298, 71 L.Ed.2d 635 (1982) (Brennan, Circuit Justice, in chambers). Appellants\u2019 motions to vacate this stay and to expedite the docketing of the state defendants\u2019 appeal from the district court order were denied, <em>Karcher v. Daggett, </em>456 U.S. 901, 102 S.Ct. 1745, 72 L.Ed.2d 157 (1982), and probable jurisdiction was noted, <em>Karcher v. Daggett, </em>457 U.S. 1131, 102 S.Ct. 2955, 73 L.Ed.2d 1347 (1982). The Supreme Court\u2019s affirmance of the district court\u2019s holding by a five-to-four vote restored the injunction. <em>Karcher v. Daggett, </em>462 U.S. 725, 103 S.Ct. 2653, 77 L.Ed.2d 133 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">When the New Jersey General Assembly subsequently failed to enact a constitutional congressional redistricting plan by February 3, 1984, the three-judge district court held a hearing on the question of further relief, and it unanimously adopted the redistricting plan submitted by appellants, which achieved the lowest population deviation and most compact congressional districts. <em>Daggett v. Kimmelman, </em>580 F.Supp. 1259 (D.N.J.1984). The intervenors then presented Justice Brennan with another stay application. He referred this application to the entire Court and, on March 30, 1984, by a six-to-three vote, the application was denied. <em>Karcher v. Daggett, </em>466 U.S. 910, 104 S.Ct. 1691, 80 L.Ed.2d 165 (1984). A few days later the Court denied intervenors\u2019 motion to expedite consideration of their jurisdictional statement. <em>Karcher v. Daggett, </em>466 U.S. 923, 104 S.Ct. 1703, 80 L.Ed.2d 177 (1984). Subsequently, on June 4, 1984, the Supreme Court summarily affirmed the three-judge district panel\u2019s adoption of the redistricting plan submitted by plaintiffs; three justices dissented from this order, voting to note probable jurisdiction and set the case for oral argument. <em>Karcher v. Daggett, </em>467 U.S. 1222, 104 S.Ct. 2672, 81 L.Ed.2d 869 (1984) (mem.).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1982), appellants on November 15, 1984, filed an application for an attorneys\u2019 fee award of nearly $600,000. The district court received extensive affidavits from all parties and heard oral argument on January 15, 1985 and July 30, 1985. The district court denied as moot the state defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and considered the request for fees by appellants, the disclaimer of liability by appellees, and their challenge to the amount of fees requested. In determining the lodestar, the district court first reduced the number of hours billed by 10%. It then reduced the resulting, modified lodestar by an additional 20%. The district court also reduced Mr. Bernard Hellring\u2019s hourly rate from $300 to $250. While the original request was for $577,787.01, the final fee awarded by the district court was thus $253,461 (both figures include costs).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>\n<em>II. Pre-Remedy Phase Hours</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">We have carefully evaluated appellees\u2019 vigorous challenge to the appropriateness of the fee award. We find no fundamental flaws in the district court\u2019s fee award for counsel hours in the pre-remedy phase of this litigation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Of the 1,886.40 hours counsel spent throughout this litigation, 1,004.62 were in the pre-remedy phase. Appellants were successful in an intensely contested case that explored, and thus helped to map, some of the more uncertain boundaries of our constitutional law. On the merits of this litigation, the district court panel divided two judges to one, and the Supreme Court split five justices to four. The district court found that the appellants\u2019 total number of counsel hours, as billed, for the pre-remedy phase was justified. However, it reduced the 1,886.40 hourly total by 10 percent per attorney. It thus determined that 1,697.76 attorney hours were \u201creasonably expended\u201d and therefore compensable under \u00a7 1988. The district court\u2019s reason for so lowering the hourly component of the lodestar that appellants sought was that a portion of the work performed was duplicative.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">In a series of opinions we have explicitly stated our standards for approving counsel fees for prevailing parties. <em>See, e.g., In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., </em>751 F.2d 562 (3d Cir.1984); <em>Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. v. Am. Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp, </em>540 F.2d 102 (3d Cir.1976) (in banc) <em>(\u201cLindy II\u201d); Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. v. Am. Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., </em>487 F.2d 161 (3d Cir.1973) <em>(\u201cLindy I </em>\u201d). In particular, this Court has held that trial judges may not, in a perfunctory fashion, order blanket percentage reductions without thoroughly probing the record and noting their reasons with care and specificity. \u201cIf [a] court believes that a fee reduction in the lodestar is indicated, it must analyze the circumstance requiring the reduction and its relation to the fee, and it must make specific findings to support its action.\u201d <em>Prandini v. National Tea Co., </em>585 F.2d 47, 52 (3d Cir.1978) <em>(\u201cPrandini II\u201d). Accord Cunningham v. City of McKeesport, </em>753 F.2d 262, 269 (3d Cir. 1985), <em>vacated and remanded, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 3324, 92 L.Ed.2d 731, <em>reinstated, 807 </em>F.2d 49 (3d Cir.1986); <em>In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., </em>751 F.2d at 596. It is well-established in this Circuit that a district court needs to identify specifically the lodestar components. <em>See Prandini II, </em>585 F.2d at 52. \u201c[A]n unanalyzed allocation of hours will not be permissible in arriving at the lodestar.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Repko, </em>578 F.2d 483, 487 (3d Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">Although the question is a close one, we find that the district court provided adequate justification for the ten percent reduction in hours. It identified duplication in hours billed by the four attorneys for their work at four particular points in the pre-remedy phase: the drafting of the memorandum in opposition to the intervenors\u2019 first stay application to Justice Brennan, the 1982 argument before the three-judge panel, the 1983 argument before the Supreme Court, and the time spent preparing for that argument. <em>See Daggett, </em>617 F.Supp. at 1281. In addition, the district court pointed to instances in the attorneys\u2019 Affidavit of Services where \u201cthree or four attorneys billed large numbers of hours for strategy and other conferences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court thus found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avo\">the attorneys did not in every instance need to spend all of the hours each of them did on legal research, [that] three and four attorneys were not necessary in court, [that] not all of the time spent preparing for oral argument by all four attorneys was necessary, and [that] not every attorney should be compensated for time spent in conference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">In affirming the ten percent pro rata reduction in the hours requested, we conclude that the district court here made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>sufficiently specific \u201cfinding[] as to the number of hours of duplication\u201d to support its across-the-board cut. <em>Prandini II, </em>585 F.2d at 52. No court, viewing a record of this magnitude from the distance inherent in appellate review, could assess the reasonability of a reduction as slight as ten percent with flawless precision. In the circumstances of this complex and lengthy case, the record is adequate to support some slight reduction in the hours billed by counsel, and we are not confronted here with a court\u2019s \u201cacross the board [hour] cut [of 50% that] may have penalized both the efficient and inefficient alike.\u201d <em>In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., </em>751 F.2d at 594; <em>cf. Copeland v. Marshall, </em>205 U.S.App. D.C. 390, 641 F.2d 880, 903 (D.C.Cir.1980) (en banc) <em>(\u201cCopeland III\u201d) </em>(refusing to fault district court for failing \u201cto decide, for example, whether a particular motion could have been done in 9.6 hours instead of 14.3 hours\u201d). We therefore conclude that this reduction was not an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">\n<em>III. Pre-Remedy Phase Rates</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Asn\">A. Top-Heavy Staffing</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Throughout this case, appellants employed only the most experienced lawyers, partners in the Newark law firm of Hellring, Lindeman, Goldstein, Siegal &amp; Greenberg. The intervenors from New Jersey\u2019s 202d General Assembly, who are the appellees/cross-appellants in this case, challenge appellants\u2019 exclusive use of four partners (Messrs. Hellring, Goldstein, Ray-mar and Dreyfuss). Appellees assert that many matters in this litigation could have been handled by junior associates or paralegals, and that \u201creasonable\u201d rates under \u00a7 1988 must therefore be lower than those billed. They assert that, according to the reasoning in <em>Ursic v. Bethlehem Mines, </em>719 F.2d 670, 677 (3d Cir.1983) (\u201cA Michelangelo should not charge Sistine Chapel rates for painting a farmer\u2019s bam.\u201d), if partners performed all tasks, including those normally handled by associates and paralegals, then they should not bill at their usual hourly rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Like the district court, appellees rely on the District of Columbia Circuit en banc opinion in <em>Copeland III </em>to urge lodestar reductions for inefficient use of partner time. <em>Copeland III, </em>however, is factually distinguishable from this case. The <em>Copeland III </em>litigation on the merits was a protracted gender discrimination suit against the government, and the district court there made specific findings as to the general expenditure of nonproductive hours by counsel for the plaintiff. <em>See </em>205 U.S.App.D.C. at 412, 641 F.2d at 902. \u201cUnder the <em>special circumstances </em>of th[at] case,\u201d the D.C. Circuit found that the district court\u2019s across-the-board lodestar reduction, without a precise identification of the hours or types of work spent that were not compensable, \u201cc[ould] not be condemned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, 641 F.2d at 903 (emphasis added). In addition, the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d in <em>Copeland III </em>were \u201cprimarily ... the expenditure of unnecessary time by relatively <em>inexperienced </em>lawyers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, 641 F.2d at 903 (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>at 412-13, 641 F.2d at 902-03 (\u201chours that simply should not have been spent at all ... may occur, for example, when young associates\u2019 labors are inadequately organized by supervising partners\u201d). Finally, we are not prepared to hold on this matter of great constitutional import that it was inappropriate to use only the most experienced litigators at the early stage of this case. With all due respect for the significant academic achievements of many recent law school graduates and neophytes at the bar, we recognize that it tends to be a significant distance from the theories spun in classrooms to the successes won in courtrooms. The insights obtained from years of experience in major litigation are often indispensable in making the most crucial, tactical judgments as to how a case should be framed and litigated. Counsel for the prevailing parties in <em>Copeland III, </em>for example, were criticized because that firm\u2019s partners left the vital stages of the litigation to their unsupervised or inadequately supervised junior as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>sociates.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In contrast to that litigation, the staffing of this case by counsel for appellants seems to have been more wise than top-heavy. This is not to say that we would not approve hour or fee reductions if the district court had specified in sufficient detail the tasks and the hours devoted to them that should have been performed by associates or paralegals. In the absence of such specific data, however, we cannot say on this record that the staffing of this case was top-heavy. We will therefore vacate the district court\u2019s twenty percent reduction in the lodestar amount awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">B. Hourly Rates</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Appellees also challenge the hourly rates approved by the district court. This Court measures the appropriate hourly rate for an attorney\u2019s services as that which has been historically charged in the community. <em>See Cunningham, </em>753 F.2d at 268; <em>In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., </em>751 F.2d at 591. Confronted by challenges to the rates approved by the district court, we look for abuses of discretion in that court\u2019s determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">The hourly rates approved were as follows: Mr. Goldstein, $200; Messrs. Dreyfuss and Raymar, $150. As to these amounts we can only say that, on the record of this case, they approach the highest limits that we could sanction upon review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Though generous, however, approving such rates was no abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">Appellants challenge the district court\u2019s reduction of Mr. Hellring\u2019s hourly rate from $300 to $250. While it may be appropriate for a lawyer of Mr. Hellring\u2019s standing at the bar \u2014 his competence and</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">effectiveness as an adovcate is acknowledged by all parties and by this Court \u2014 to charge his private clients $300.00 or more per hour, there nevertheless comes a point where a lawyer\u2019s historic rate, which private clients are willing to pay, cannot be imposed on his or her adversaries. <em>Cf. Black Grievance Comm. v. Philadelphia Elec. Co., </em>802 F.2d 648, 652 (3d Cir.) (\u201cThe reasonable value of an attorney\u2019s time ... is <em>generally </em>reflected in the attorney\u2019s normal billing rate.\u201d) (emphasis added), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>55 U.S.L.W. 3437 (U.S. Dec. 2, 1986) (No. 86-905). As the Sixth Circuit noted recently, \u00a7 1988 \u201cuse[s] the words \u2018reasonable\u2019 fees, not \u2018liberal\u2019 fees. Such fees are different from the prices charged to well-to-do clients by the most noted lawyers and renowned firms in a region.\u201d <em>Coulter v. Tennessee, </em>805 F.2d 146, 149 (6th Cir.1986). <em>See also Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 3088, 3098, 92 L.Ed.2d 439 (1986) (fee-shifting \u201cstatutes were not ... intended to replicate exactly the fee an attorney could earn through a private fee arrangement with his [or her] client\u201d); <em>Evans v. Jeff D., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 1531, 1551, 89 L.Ed.2d 747 (1986) (Brennan, J., joined by Marshall and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting) (\u201cthere is a <em>range </em>of \u2018reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u2019 consistent with the Fees Act in any given case\u201d) (original emphasis); <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 895 n. 11, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 1547 n. 11, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984) (in determining fee reasonableness under \u00a7 1988, \u201cthe rates charged in private representations may afford relevant comparisons\u201d). If we were confronted with a case where a litigator of national repute charged $1,000 per hour in the legal mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>ketplace and nevertheless had innumerable clients waiting at his or her door to pay such rates, that extraordinary level of remuneration could not be legally imposed as a matter of course on an adversary in a prevailing party\u2019s counsel fee case. Mr. Hellring established that, at the time of this litigation, his historic hourly rate was $300, and that he had received judicial approval for an hourly fee of $375 as court-appointed \u25a0 counsel in a case where there was an existing trust fund. While we recognize that \u201c[ajttomeys are not fungible,\u201d <em>Black Grievance Comm., </em>802 F.2d at 652, and note Mr. Hellring\u2019s disappointment in this diminution of his fee request, as we read the cases he has not established a clear legal entitlement to $300 per hour.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We therefore approve the reduction of his fee as a matter of judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">\n<em>IV. Remedy Phase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Au_\">According to the affidavits, the total number of attorney hours in the remedy phase<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> was 773.28, resulting in a fee request of $178,635.00. Of this time, 297.98 hours were spent in conferences with clients and congressmen.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The approximately 300 hours spent conferring with clients in this phase compares with 143.67 hours spent in the various aspects of the pre-remedy phase (45.1 in the initial challenge to the Feldman Plan; 88.57 during the first Supreme Court review). No billed hours were spent conferring with clients regarding the second Supreme Court review or the fee application.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-12\">Appellees take two positions on their liability for the remedy phase. They first assert that appellants are not entitled to <em>any </em>compensation for the remedy phase. However, to accept this assertion requires one first to disregard Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s admonition that where there is a right there must be a remedy. <em>See Marbury v. Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 146, 163, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). If the appellees had submitted a reapportionment plan that had been adopted by the district court, their argument might be plausible, for under such circumstances the appellants would not be the \u201cprevailing party\u201d on the remedy issue. The appellees\u2019 plan was rejected by the district court, however, so they certainly did not prevail. Appellants, by contrast, did prevail, at least in part, which is all that \u00a7 1988 requires.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>In the few reported decisions that have considered whether a \u00a7 1988 \u201cprevailing party\u201d is entitled to an attorney\u2019s fee award for work performed in the remedy phase of redistricting litigation, fees have been awarded. <em>See In re Kansas Congressional Dists. Reapportionment Cases, </em>745 F.2d 610 (10th Cir.1984); <em>Ramos v. Koebig, </em>638 F.2d 838, 845-46 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981); <em>Connor v. Winter, </em>519 F.Supp. 1337 (S.D.Miss.1981) (three-judge court). We will not, therefore, as a matter of law preclude recovery for the remedy phase of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Secondly, appellees contest the award of fees for hours which may have been spent solely in partisan negotiations and proceedings. As Justice Frankfurter once noted, \u201cthere comes a point where [we] should not be ignorant as judges of what we know as [women and] men.\u201d <em>Watts v. Indiana, </em>338 U.S. 49, 52, 69 S.Ct.1347, 1349, 93 L.Ed. 1801 (1949) (Frankfurter, J., joined by Murphy and Rutledge, JJ.): <em>cf. In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., </em>751 F.2d at 584 (\u201cwe do not approach the review process with any predisposition against what we know\u201d). Here, we cannot be oblivious to the fact that there are extraordinary political machinations and implications in the process of drawing congressional district boundaries. The Republican congressional appellants, to put the matter precisely, certainly were not interested in this statutory revision simply because of their innate attachment to mathematical exactitude. Indeed, it is certain that they would have tolerated any less exact redistricting plan that would have furthered their partisan prospects for reelection. We simply cannot discern, in the district court\u2019s opinion, how many attorney hours in the remedy phase were spent obtaining mathematical exactitude and how many hours were devoted solely to obtaining the most favorable political result for the appellants. While nothing in the record suggests that the appellants have acted in bad faith in making this fee request, we do find that the record is inadequate to justify the district court\u2019s order compensating 773.28 hours of work (i.e., an award of $178,635) in the remedy phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">Because of the magnitude of the amount sought and the possibility of confusing a lawyer\u2019s role in getting a mathematically equitable distribution with a client\u2019s preference for maximizing his or her political advantages, the complex record of this case requires closer inquiry into the nature of the services rendered and the time spent. In addition, we are mindful of the fact that it is the appellants\u2019 burden to demonstrate the reasonable necessity of the hours charged. <em>See, e.g., Hughes, </em>578 F.2d at 487. Appellees are not obligated to compensate counsel's efforts merely to maximize anyone\u2019s political leverage. <em>But cf. In re Kansas Congressional Dists. Reapportionment Cases, </em>745 F.2d at 613 (\u201cthe fact that some of the issues raised by the plaintiffs were political rather than constitutional does not alter the [\u00a7 1988 fee] award\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>We will therefore remand for further findings on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">\n<em>V. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court in regard to the preremedy phase hours will be affirmed, the hourly rates will be affirmed and applied to the lodestar without the twenty percent reduction, and the remedy phase determinations will be remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-11\">. The three state defendants from the executive branch (the Governor of New Jersey, its Attorney General and its Secretary of State) initially advised this Court that they would not file a response brief in light of the fact that neither the appellants nor the appellees asserted positions in their original briefs adverse to these state defendants. In response to allegations raised for the first time in the appellants\u2019 reply brief, however, a reply brief was filed by these state defendants on the issue of their liability. By failing to raise this issue in their original briefs, appellants simply did not appeal the district court\u2019s conclusion that these state defendants are not liable for counsel fees, and thus we do not consider this issue here. Fed.R.App.P. 28(a)(2) &amp; 28(a)(4). <em>See also J.E.K. Indus., Inc. v.

In their cross-appeal, the state legislators raise the following issues: (1) legislative immunity; (2) the absence of the \u00a7 1983 action prerequisite to a \u00a7 1988 award; and (3) mootness.

To offer one example that seemed to persuade the district court, Professor Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School is one of today\u2019s most effective advocates before the United States Supreme Court. Despite this established reputation and his particular success in vindicating one of the core protections of the first amendment, however, <em>see Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., </em>459 U.S. 116, 103 S.Ct. 505, 74 L.Ed.2d 297 (1982); <em>but see Evans v.

Larkin, </em>749 F.2d 945, 956 (1st Cir.1984). As a matter of law, we see no reason why Mr. Hellring is entitled to more favorable treatment here than Professor Tribe was in the <em>Grendel's Den </em>litigation. Indeed, on balance, the record suggests that the district court was far more generous to Mr. Hellring than the First Circuit was to Professor Tribe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b886-8\">.
