Skrable filed suit in district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the recovery of federal income taxes paid for 1980 in the amount of $15,938.66. Paul Skrable is a citizen of the United States, domiciled in Arkansas at the time of his complaint. During 1980 the Skrables resided in the Panama Canal Zone of the Republic of Panama. Paul Skrable was employed by the Panama Canal Commission. The Skrables timely paid their income tax for 1980 but filed for a refund based on Article XV of the Agreement in Implementation of Article III of the Panama Canal Treaty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Their refund was denied by the IRS. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant United States. Relying primarily on its prior decision in <em>Corliss v. United States, </em>567 F.Supp. 162 (W.D.Ark.1983), and other cases employing similar reasoning, the district court interpreted \u00a7 2 as exempting the appellants from Panamanian but not United States taxation. We affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">The Skrables interpreted the \u201cany taxes\u201d language in \u00a7 2 of Article XV as exempting them from both Panamanian and United States taxation. The Skrables submitted affidavits of \u201ckey\u201d Panamanian officials stating that \u00a7 2 was intended to exempt United States citizens working for the Commission and their dependents from both countries\u2019 taxation. The Skrables argue that the government\u2019s interpretation fails to consider intent of the Panamanians as reflected in the affidavits. In other sections of the treaty documents the parties were careful to specify which country\u2019s taxes were meant. The omission of any qualifying language, the Skrables argue, indicates that the intent was to exempt U.S. citizen employees from United States and Panamanian taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-15\">The Skrables rely on the claims court opinion in <em>Coplin v. United States, </em>6 Cl.Ct. 115 (1984) and on <em>Harris v. United States, </em>585 F.Supp. 862 (S.D.Ga.1984). The <em>Coplin </em>opinion was reversed by the Federal Circuit, <em>Coplin v. United States, </em>761 F.2d 688 (Fed.Cir.1985), which was upheld by the Supreme Court, <em>O\u2019Connor v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 107 S.Ct. 347, 93 L.Ed.2d 206 (1986). Judgment in the <em>Harris </em>case, affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit, <em>Harris v. United States, </em>768 F.2d 1240 (11th Cir.1985), was vacated by <em>United States v. Harris, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 107 S.Ct. 450, 93 L.Ed.2d 398 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-20\">In <em>O\u2019Connor, supra, </em>the Supreme Court held that Article XV applies only to Panamanian taxes, and hence petitioners were not entitled to refunds of the United States income taxes paid. The Court said the first section of Article XV \u201cestablishes the context for the discussion of tax exemptions in the entire Article \u2014 so that when \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 state that \u2018United States citizen employees * * * shall be exempt\u2019 from taxes they are understood to be dealing only with taxes payable in Panama.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor, supra, </em>107 S.Ct. at 350.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-21\">Unless one posits the ellipsis of failing to repeat, in each section, \u00a7 l\u2019s limitation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>taxes \u201cin the Republic of Panama,\u201d the Article takes on a meaning that is utterly implausible and has no foundation in the negotiations leading to the Agreement. For if the first sentence of \u00a7 2 refers to United States as well as Panamanian taxes, then the second sentence of \u00a7 2, and the totality of \u00a7 3, must do so as well\u2014 with the consequence that United States citizen employees and their dependents would be exempt not only from United States income tax on their earnings from the Commission, but also from United States income tax on all income from sources outside Panama <em>(e.g., </em>United States bank accounts), and from all United States gift and inheritance taxes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\"><em>Id. </em>The order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of the United States is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1289-8\">.
