The court denied all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims and entered judgment for defendants. Plaintiffs Trevino and Carbajal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appeal the district court\u2019s denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>class certification, denial of relief in their individual actions, and award of costs to defendants. (No. 85-1502). In a consolidated action, Holly appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for attorneys\u2019 fees against plaintiffs and their attorneys. (No. 85-1727). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">Holly is engaged in the business of producing sugar from sugar beets, with refineries in several states. The employees at Holly\u2019s Hereford, Texas refinery are covered by a collective bargaining agreement signed by Holly, the American Federation of Grain Millers International, and its affiliated local unions. Plaintiff Trevino is an employee at Holly\u2019s Hereford plant and is a member of the collective bargaining unit represented by Local 321. Plaintiff Carbajal was employed by Holly and a member of that collective bargaining unit until his discharge in September 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">The production of sugar at Holly occurs on a seasonal basis. The production season, called the \u201ccampaign,\u201d usually runs from October until January or February at the Hereford facility. During campaign season, when the sugar is refined, the factory operates twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. During \u201cintercampaign\u201d seasons, Holly repairs its production machinery, performs capital improvement projects, and packages and ships stored sugar. Due to the seasonal nature of the industry, the size and composition of the work force fluctuates over the course of each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">The collective bargaining agreement divides employees into two main categories\u2014 campaign employees and year-round employees. Holly selects its year-round employees at the end of each campaign. Employees on the year-round list receive greater benefits than campaign employees, such as paid vacation leave arid health insurance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Paragraph 14.19 of the collective bargaining agreement states: \u201cWhen hiring employees for year-round employment, the Company agrees to give due consideration to seniority, knowledge, ability, skill, together with the requirements of the job.\u201d Employees are selected for the year-round list based largely on their skills, because Holly selects those who perform jobs needed during the intercampaign or who are crucial to starting the next production period. Of those qualified for each needed position, the most senior employee usually is chosen, even if this means not selecting a more qualified employee with less seniority. In addition, the agreement divides all the jobs into five levels \u2014 Technician I, Technician II, Station Group A, Station Group B, and Station Group C \u2014 in decreasing order of wages. Employees move into the Technician and Station Group A levels only by bidding for vacancies, which are posted. These posted jobs are awarded \u201con the basis of seniority, knowledge, ability, skill, together with the requirements of the job.\u201d Agreement 1114.12. Employees holding Technician jobs possess the skills used most during intercampaign and thus are most likely to be selected for the year-round list.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-13\">In April 1983, plaintiffs filed an across-the-board employment discrimination class action against Holly and the Union, alleging discrimination based on race, national <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>origin, and/or sex.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiffs asserted that Holly and the Union discriminated against the members of the purported class \u201cat every step of the employment process, including recruitment, hiring, job assignment, discipline, promotion, demotion, wages, training, seniority, the allocation of seasonal versus full-time employment, layoff, recall, and termination.\u201d Plaintiffs initially sought class certification for themselves and all past, present, and future Hispanic employees at Holly\u2019s Hereford factory.\u00ae By the close of their five-day class certification hearing in April 1984, plaintiffs had narrowed the purported class to Hispanics adversely affected by the year-round employee provision of the collective bargaining agreement at any Holly facility subject to the agreement. At the hearing, plaintiffs also stated that they did not seek class certification against the Union and that they did not present Carbajal as a class representative. On May 11, 1984, the district court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">In March 1985, the district court conducted a ten-day bench trial on the merits of the individual claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 main contention was that they had been injured by Holly\u2019s pattern or practice of discrimination against Hispanics. Plaintiffs argued that the disparity between the time it takes Hispanic employees to achieve year-round status as compared to the time for non-Hispanic employees demonstrates Holly's discrimination against Hispanic workers.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also asserted that it takes Hispanics longer than non-Hispanics to attain seniority and to rise from lower to higher job levels. Trevino specifically claimed that he was discriminated against in not being placed on the 1982 and 1988 year-round lists. He also averred that his temporary demotion in 1982 from locomotive engineer to yard and factory worker was discriminatory, and that Holly illegally retaliated against him for attempting to enforce rights guaranteed by Title VII. Carbajal claimed that his discharge was discriminatory and that the Union failed to properly pursue his grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">The district court found that plaintiffs failed to prove discrimination in each of the discrete occasions asserted, and that plaintiffs had not suffered from a pattern or practice of discrimination. The district court analyzed the statistical evidence presented by each side and concluded that Holly\u2019s statistics presented \u201ca more accurate depiction of reality\u201d than the plaintiffs\u2019 statistics. The court observed that, even if it were to credit plaintiffs\u2019 statistics, it would not benefit the individual claimants in this case. Therefore, the court denied plaintiffs\u2019 relief and awarded costs to defendants. Plaintiffs do <em>not </em>appeal the district court\u2019s determination of their demotion, retaliation, or discharge claims; they do appeal the district court\u2019s finding that they failed to prove that defendants discriminated against them in the application of the year-round provision of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-12\">In July 1985, Holly filed a motion seeking attorneys\u2019 fees against plaintiffs, their attorneys, Texas Rural Legal Aid, Inc. (TRLA), and the Legal Services Corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>tion. Holly appeals the district court\u2019s denial of this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">\n<em>Individual Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">Plaintiffs appeal the district court's finding that defendants have not discriminated against them based on their national origin and race in violation of Title VII, section 1981, and section 301 of the LMRA. Plaintiffs claim to have suffered injury from a pattern or practice by defendants of discriminating against Hispanics in their application of the year-round employment status provision of the collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The thrust of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is that Hispanics do not have an equal opportunity to accrue the seniority or job skills that are important factors in selection to the year-round list and in successful bidding for job promotions (which in turn facilitates selection to the year-round list). Plaintiffs argue that it takes Hispanics longer than non-Hispanics to achieve year-round status and thus Hispanics are harmed in not receiving the economic benefits of year-round status on an equal basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">The nature of Holly\u2019s bidding system and year-round list selection has the effect of multiplying the advantages of seniority. An employee with little or no seniority is greatly disadvantaged, because an employee with any significant seniority has a much better chance to accrue increased seniority. Plaintiffs contend that Hispanics do not have an equal opportunity to accrue seniority and thus are disadvantaged in their attempts to get on the year-round list. Plaintiffs also argue that Hispanics lack seniority because they are not placed on the year-round list in adequate numbers considering their proportion of Holly\u2019s employees. It seems that a significant aspect of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is their contention that Hispanics are not proportionally represented among those employees recalled for intercampaign work. Campaign employees who are recalled for intercampaign work accrue more seniority for the year and are more likely to learn job skills important to the year-round operation of the plant than campaign employees who work only during the campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-12\">The district court carefully analyzed the statistics presented by plaintiffs and by Holly on the issue of a pattern or practice of discrimination. The court found flaws in each presentation, but found more significant deficiencies in plaintiffs\u2019 statistics. Therefore, the court credited defendants\u2019 statistics and concluded that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate a pattern or practice of national origin (or racial) discrimination by defendants. The court held, alternatively, that even if it had credited plaintiffs\u2019 statistics, they would not establish discrimination against the individual plaintiffs in this case. The evidence demonstrates that the only time Trevino was denied a job for which he bid was when he simultaneously bid for two positions. He received one job, and the other was also awarded to an Hispanic. Carbajal never bid for a job during his employment at Holly. The court concluded that, because the plaintiffs here were not harmed in the job-bidding process, they did not suffer from any discriminatory practices.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b987-13\">Plaintiffs contend, however, that a failure to exercise in job bidding the seniority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>and skills the plaintiffs had is not relevant to the pattern or practice issue, because the plaintiffs were harmed in their ability to accrue the seniority and skills that would have assisted them in other bids. Furthermore, plaintiffs argue that it took them longer than the average non-Hispanic to achieve year-round status. We believe that plaintiffs\u2019 failure to use the bidding system more effectively is relevant to the pattern or practice issue, because use of the bidding system is an important aspect of an employee\u2019s ability to acquire seniority and skills. Nevertheless, we need not determine whether plaintiffs\u2019 statistics would have benefited the individual plaintiffs, because we hold that the district court\u2019s finding that plaintiffs failed to establish a pattern or practice of discrimination is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">We review the district court\u2019s determination that plaintiffs have failed to prove discrimination under the clearly erroneous standard of Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985); <em>Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982); <em>accord Bazemore v. Friday, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 3000, 3008, 92 L.Ed.2d 315 (1986). As plaintiffs acknowledge, challenges to employment practices that rely on subjective selection criteria must be analyzed under the disparate treatment theory of discrimination, which requires a finding of intentional discrimination. <em>Page v. United States Industries, Inc., </em>726 F.2d 1038, 1045 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Carroll v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Company, </em>708 F.2d 183, 188 (5th Cir.1983). Under the disparate treatment theory, the plaintiff may prove the existence of a pattern or practice of discrimination by establishing by direct or circumstantial evidence \u201cthat racial discrimination was the company\u2019s standard operating procedure \u2014 the regular rather than the unusual practice.\u201d <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1855, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977). The plaintiff must prove more than the mere occurrence of \u201cisolated\u201d or \u201csporadic\u201d acts of discrimination. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff may establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate treatment using statistics alone if the statistics show a \u201cgross disparity\u201d in the treatment of workers based on discriminatory factors. <em>Page, </em>726 F.2d at 1046. However, if the plaintiffs\u2019 statistical evidence is insufficient alone to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate treatment, the plaintiff may combine the statistical evidence with \u201chistorical, individual, or circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Payne v. Travenol Laboratories, Inc., </em>673 F.2d 798, 817 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1038, 103 S.Ct. 451, 74 L.Ed.2d 605 (1982)). To rebut a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate treatment, the defendant must either discredit the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence or provide a nondiscriminatory reason for the apparently discriminatory results. <em>Page, </em>726 F.2d at 1046; <em>Carroll, </em>708 F.2d at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">Much of plaintiffs\u2019 statistical evidence was devoted to an effort to demonstrate that it takes Hispanics longer than non-Hispanics to move through the promotion system and to be selected for the year-round list. Plaintiffs contend that there is a statistically significant disparity between Hispanics and non-Hispanics for the total elapsed time from the date of hire during the year the employee began working continuous campaigns until an award of year-round status.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Bernard Yancy, testified that the average non-Hispanic employee was awarded year-round status after oniy 132 days, while the average Hispanic worker was awarded year-round status after 2,017 days. This figure is not compellingly persuasive evidence of discrimination, however, because plaintiffs\u2019 expert failed to take into account the effects of accrued seniority, job skills, or bidding activity. The evidence offered by both parties established that historically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>employees are selected for the year-round list primarily from the Technician II and Technician I job levels. In fact, in the years 1981 to 1983, most of the Technician I employees were on the year-round list, and thus not eligible for the liability period year-round lists. Therefore, plaintiffs attempted to demonstrate that it takes longer for Hispanics to move into the Technician positions than it takes non-Hispanics, and that it takes longer for Hispanic Technician employees to be selected to the year-round list than for non-Hispanic Technician employees. Plaintiff\u2019s expert analyzed movement during the discovery period from the Station Group levels to Technician II and suggested that there was a statistically significant disparity between the time it took Hispanics and the time for non-Hispanics, at least those who moved from Station Groups B and C.,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, as plaintiffs\u2019 own expert demonstrated, most of the Hispanics who move into Technician II jobs are promoted from within the factory, while the majority of non-Hispanics who move into Technician II jobs are either new hires or rehires who thus have zero days between date of hire and date of promotion. Therefore, the probative value of these figures would depend upon whether Holly discriminated in hiring from outside directly into the Technician II position. This was not shown. Plaintiffs also attempted to prove that it takes longer for Hispanic Technician employees to be selected to the year-round list than it takes for non-Hispanic Technician employees. The main problem with Dr. Yancy\u2019s figures in this area is that they reflect the total elapsed time from the employee\u2019s date of hire (before continuous campaign employment) to the date of selection to the year-round list and do not reflect any difference between elapsed time in the Technician levels for Hispanics and non-Hispanics selected to the year-round list. As the district court commented: \u201c[Tjhese statistics do not indicate whether any problem is in moving into the Technician II level, or in moving onto the year-round list from the Technician II level.\u201d In addition, these statistics again fail to take into account any differences in accrued seniority between Hispanics and non-Hispanics.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 assertions that it takes longer for Hispanics to gain year-round status are undercut also by the failure of plaintiffs\u2019 expert to consider the distribution between Hispanics and non-Hispanics of those job skills that Holly considers in selection to the year-round list. Holly\u2019s expert, Dr. Joan Haworth, analyzed selection to the year-round list among those in \u201ckey craft positions,\u201d those with skills usually needed during intercampaign. Her figures indicated that minorities with these skills were added to the year-round list in the same proportion in which these skilled workers appeared among the campaign workers. Her statistics also suggested that minorities not in key craft positions were added to the year-round list in the same proportion in which minorities without these skills appeared in the campaign work force. In addition, Dr. Haworth\u2019s analysis indicated that, considering the additions segregated by job skills, it did not take Hispanics longer to achieve year-round employee status. In fact, she testified that during the 1981 to 1983 liability period it took Hispanics <em>less </em>time than non-Hispanics to get on the year-round list whether added in a key position or another position, although the difference was not statistically significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">Dr. Haworth's statistics did not account for every variable material to selection for the year-round list. Although these statistics gave some consideration to the employee\u2019s skills, they were not segregated by job levels. Moreover, these figures considered all minorities in the same group. On the other hand, the evidence demonstrates that there were very few non-Hispanic minority employees at Holly. In general, Holly\u2019s analysis presented a more complete picture of the year-round selection process.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>Plaintiffs do not claim that defendants have discriminated in their application of the bidding process itself,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which is based primarily on seniority.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Indeed, Holly\u2019s statistical evidence indicated that during the entire discovery period almost ninety-four percent of the posted jobs were awarded to the most senior bidder of those qualified for the job, and that during the liability period the percentages of jobs going to the most senior bidder were even higher. Moreover, Holly\u2019s evidence demonstrates that minorities on the average were <em>more </em>successful than non-minorities in receiving awards when they bid for jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Plaintiffs contend not that the bidding system is illegal per se, but that Hispanics are discriminated against in their attempts to acquire important job skills and seniority. Plaintiffs\u2019 expert testified that almost half of all job bid awards went to a worker who was paid at the rate of the awarded job during the time before the vacant position was posted or before the job was awarded. Plaintiffs argue that these figures illustrate that many employees are pre-selected through temporary assignments in these positions and trained before the jobs are awarded, and that this pre-selection process adversely affects Hispanics. However, plaintiffs\u2019 expert did not take into account lateral movement between jobs with the same rate of pay and did not present any evidence that Hispanics were treated differently from non-Hispanics in making temporary (or lateral) assignments. Plaintiffs\u2019 expert also testified that during the discovery period there was a disparity between Hispanics and non-Hispanics in the amount of seniority accrued in a given year, and that this disparity was statistically significant for the years 1981 to 1983. Dr. Yancy based this conclusion on the seniority lists provided by Holly. Using the same seniority lists, Dr. Haworth concluded that from 1978 to 1983 on the average Hispanics not on the year-round list acquired slightly <em>more </em>seniority per year than non-Hispanics who were not on the year-round list. Of course, all employees\u2014 Hispanic or non-Hispanic \u2014 on the year-round list accrued twelve months of seniority each year. It appears that Dr. Yancy\u2019s failure to separate year-round employees from those not on the year-round list accounts for the difference between the experts\u2019 conclusions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because plaintiffs\u2019 disparate treatment claim centers around Holly\u2019s selection of campaign employees for the year-round list, the average yearly accrual of seniority by campaign employees rather than by all employees is more significant to the issue of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">We believe that the district court did not err in crediting defendants\u2019 statistical evidence. Because plaintiffs\u2019 analyses failed to take into account significant factors other than national origin (or race) that may have contributed to the results, their statistical evidence alone does not compel the conclusion that a pattern or practice of discrimination was demonstrated by a preponderance of all the evidence. <em>See Bazemore, </em>106 S.Ct. at 3008; <em>Page, </em>726 F.2d at 1049-51. Of course, plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>may supplement their statistical evidence with other evidence of discrimination. Several Hispanic Holly employees, including plaintiffs, testified that they had been discriminated against based on their being Hispanic. Much of the anecdotal evidence involved employees\u2019 claims that they had been given more difficult work assignment because they were Hispanic or that they were retaliated against for filing grievances or EEOC charges. This testimony did not directly relate to plaintiffs\u2019 pattern or practice claim concerning year-round selection. There was also some employee testimony indicating that sometimes some supervisors appeared more likely to train Anglo employees than Hispanic employees, especially on matters such as the general operation of the plant. However, as noted below, this evidence did not tend to show a pervasive practice and was not of a compelling character.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Plaintiffs failed to establish that Holly acted with discriminatory intent in not selecting Trevino to the year-round lists for 1981 and 1982. In each instance, all of those selected with skills similar to Trevino\u2019s had accrued more seniority. Nor did plaintiffs establish that Trevino suffered discrimination in his 1982 demotion. Three witnesses (two of them Hispanic) testified that, when Holly eliminated the four beet-end locomotive engineer positions because it no longer received beets by rail, Trevino was informed in Spanish and English that he would need to bid on a new position. Trevino completed the campaign (at the same pay rate) without bidding on a new position. When he returned for the next campaign, he received a job as yard and factory worker at a lower wage, but subsequently bid successfully for another locomotive engineer position.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses recounted general complaints of national origin discrimination, but offered few substantiated examples of different treatment between Hispanic and non-Hispanic workers.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 individualized comparisons of the work history of one Hispanic employee, such as Trevino, with that of one non-Hispanic employee, such as factory manager Gene Allen, may suggest disparities in Holly\u2019s treatment, but are not significant in light of the extensive evidence concerning the overall workforce. In any event, defendants\u2019 evidence did more than highlight the deficiency in plaintiffs\u2019 analyses, it also adequately rebutted any inferences of discrimination raised by plaintiff\u2019s evidence. <em>See Page, </em>726 F.2d at 1053. Defendants presented legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons to account for the disparities that plaintiffs attributed to discrimination. Because plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a gross disparity in the treatment of Hispanics and non-Hispanics, the district court was not required to infer that Holly has discriminated against Hispanics. We therefore conclude that the district court\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">\n<em>Class Certification</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">Plaintiffs also appeal the district court\u2019s denial of class certification. Plaintiffs sought class certification for all Hispanics who had been adversely affected by Holly\u2019s application of its year-round selection system. The district court concluded that the commonality and typicality requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(2) and (3) were not met, because each addition to the year-round list must be considered in light of the employee\u2019s accrued seniority and job skills. The necessity for individualized proof indicates that a class action is not \u201can economical or efficient way of processing the complaints of the proposed class.\u201d We will not overturn a decision to grant or deny class certification unless the district court has abused its discretion. <em>Redditt v. Mississippi Extended Care Centers, Inc., </em>718 F.2d 1381, 1387 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">Having affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of relief on Trevino\u2019s individual claim, and having granted Alonzo\u2019s mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>tion to withdraw, <em>see </em>note 2, <em>supra, </em>we therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of class certification. When the district court has denied class certification, our decision on review of whether the named plaintiffs should represent a class \u201cis appropriately made on the full record, including the facts developed at the trial of the plaintiffs\u2019 individual claims.\u201d <em>Everitt v. City of Marshall, </em>703 F.2d 207 (5th Cir.) (quoting <em>East Texas Motor Freight System, Inc. v. Rodriguez, </em>431 U.S. 395, 97 S.Ct. 1891, 1898 n. 12, 52 L.Ed.2d 453 (1977)), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 894, 104 S.Ct. 241, 78 L.Ed.2d 231 (1983). When an employee\u2019s individual claim of employment discrimination is properly dismissed, the employee no longer has a nexus with the membership of the purported class. <em>Id. </em>To represent a class, the employee must \u201cpossess the same interests and suffer the same injury\u201d as the purported class members. <em>Rodriguez, </em>97 S.Ct. at 1896. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of class certification, because the proposed class representative may not now claim to have suffered from the injuries asserted by the proposed class.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">\n<em>Defendants\u2019 Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Plaintiffs also challenge the district court\u2019s award of costs to defendants Holly and the Union pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d). Rule 54(d) provides that: \u201cCosts shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.\u201d Plaintiffs contend that the standard announced by the Supreme Court in <em>EEOC v. Christiansburg Garment Company, </em>434 U.S. 412, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978), that <em>attorneys\u2019 fees </em>should be awarded a prevailing defendant in a Title VII case only if the plaintiffs\u2019 action was frivolous, should be extended to an award of costs. However, we have rejected this argument in previous decisions. <em>Lewis v. NLRB, </em>750 F.2d 1266, 1279 (5th Cir.1985); <em>Hill v. J.C. Penney Co., </em>688 F.2d 370, 375 (5th Cir.1982). We thus affirm the district court\u2019s award of costs to defendants.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-11\">\n<em>Attorneys' Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b992-12\">Holly appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. Holly sought attorneys\u2019 fees from plaintiffs and their attorneys, TRLA, and attempted to join the Legal Services Corporation (LSC). The district court did not expressly rule on Holly\u2019s motion to join the LSC, but denied Holly\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. Holly bases its attorneys\u2019 fees claim on the following grounds: 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 20000e-5(k) (section 706(k) of Title VII), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, Fed.R.Civ.P. 11, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996e(f). Finding that none of these grounds requires us to reverse the denial of attorneys\u2019 fees in this case, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-13\">Prevailing defendants are entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees under section 706(k) of Title VII or under section 1988 only upon a showing that the plaintiff\u2019s action was frivolous, unreasonable, groundless, or made in bad faith, or that the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so. <em>Christiansburg Garment, </em>98 S.Ct. at 700. Holly argues that the district court abused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>its discretion in denying it attorneys\u2019 fees under this standard and in failing to evaluate its motion on a claim-by-claim basis. Holly contends under <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983), and <em>Commonwealth Oil Refining Co. v. EEOC, </em>720 F.2d 1383 (5th Cir.1983), that the district court should have conducted a claim-by-claim analysis to determine which claims were frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">In <em>Uviedo v. Steves Sash &amp; Door Co., </em>753 F.2d 369 (5th Cir.l985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 791, 88 L.Ed.2d 769 (1986), this Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXj\">\u201ca plaintiff\u2019s claims which are unrelated to each other, though formally and properly joined in a single suit against a single defendant, are nevertheless to be considered for attorneys\u2019 fees purposes as if each were brought in a separate suit, so that a party\u2019s success or failure on one claim is not to be considered in determining that party\u2019s entitlement (or vulnerability) to attorneys\u2019 fees on an unrelated claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370-71.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">We noted that the <em>Commonwealth </em>\u201ccentral issue\u201d test may be applied to a suit as a whole when all the claims are related to each other, <em>id. </em>at 370, although there is \u201cno certain method\u201d for determining which claims are related, <em>id. </em>at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">Holly relies primarily on plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings and statements in the pre-trial order alleging employment discrimination in several specific aspects of their employment at Holly in arguing that plaintiffs had unrelated claims. Plaintiffs contend that all the claims pursued at trial revolve around discrimination in selection for year-round status, and that they narrowed their claims from those originally pleaded. Nevertheless, it seems that plaintiffs pursued some claims \u2014 such as Carbajal\u2019s discharge claim and Trevino\u2019s Title VII retaliation claim \u2014 that are unrelated to the claims surrounding year-round employee status. We believe, however, that in the circumstances of this case, Holly should not be allowed to successfully challenge the district court\u2019s failure to perform a claim-by-claim analysis, because Holly did not request such findings in its motion or accompanying briefs below, nor did Holly make any attempt to segregate any of plaintiffs\u2019 claims for the district court in computing its requested fees, and instead pursued its entitlement to attorneys\u2019 fees on the basis of the case as a whole.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">Section 1927, 28 U.S.C., provides that an attorney who \u201cmultiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously\u201d may be liable for excess attorneys\u2019 fees resulting from such conduct. The district court found that Texas Rural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>Legal Aid did not unreasonably or vexatiously multiply the proceedings. We are unable to say that the district court abused its discretion. <em>See Jackson Marine Corp. v. Harvey Barge Repairs, Inc., </em>794 F.2d 989, 992 (5th Cir.1986). <em>See also Nilsen v. City of Moss Point, </em>621 F.2d 117, 122 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">Rule 11, Fed.R.Civ.P., provides for sanctions against an attorney who signs a pleading, motion, or other paper that to the best of his knowledge after reasonable inquiry is not \u201cwell grounded in fact and ... warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing law.\u201d The district court declined to impose sanctions based on the pleadings, and held that Holly\u2019s request for sanctions based on the filing of motions was not timely. <em>See </em>Rule 11, Notes of Advisory Committee (timing is within district court\u2019s discretion although it is anticipated that sanctions be determined \u201cwhen the motion is decided or shortly thereafter\u201d). We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Holly failed to preserve its challenge to plaintiffs\u2019 motions and that Holly did not establish that attorneys\u2019 fees should be imposed based on plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings. Holly claims that it clearly challenged all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims as frivolous since the beginning of the suit; yet, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that this general challenge was not adequate to preserve claims as to each motion separately considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Finally, defendants rely on the Legal Services Corporation Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996e(f), which provides for attorneys\u2019 fees against the LSC when one of its grant recipients (in this case TRLA) pursues an action \u201cfor the sole purpose of harassment of the defendant\u201d or when \u201ca recipient\u2019s plaintiff maliciously abuse[s] legal process.\u201d Again, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that plaintiffs\u2019 conduct did not meet the standard required for an award based on this provision. <em>See Jackson Marine Corp., </em>794 F.2d at 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">In sum, although plaintiffs initially pleaded a wide range of violations, they eventually narrowed their focus to a few claims that clearly were not frivolous. For the reasons stated, Holly is not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees under the <em>Christiansburg Garment </em>standard. Nor is it so entitled under the statutory and rule standards which it asserts. We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion. Thus, we will not overturn the district court\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Jackson Marine Corp., </em>794 F.2d at 992; <em>In re Hunt, </em>754 F.2d 1290, 1294 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">Determining that the district court was not clearly erroneous in finding that plaintiffs failed to establish a pattern of discrimination, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of relief to plaintiffs Trevino and Carbajal and the denial of class certification. Furthermore, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding costs to defendants or in denying Holly\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b984-10\">. Plaintiffs also sued the American Federation of Grain Millers International Union, AFL-CIO, and its Locals 279, 280, and 285 as defendants. Prior to trial, the parties stipulated that Local Unions 279, 280, and 285 would become necessary party defendants only pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a), and that plaintiffs would seek no economic relief from these locals. Local 321 and the International Union (collectively referred to as the Union) remain as primary defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b984-22\">. Having settled her claims against defendants, plaintiff Alonzo sought withdrawal from appeal No. 85-1502. We granted Alonzo\u2019s unopposed motion to withdraw from appeal No. 85-1502, but our action was without prejudice to the rights of Trevino and Carbajal in appeal No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>85-1502 or to Holly\u2019s rights against Alonzo and the other appellees in appeal No. 85-1727.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">Carbajal did not seek to be a class representative and brought only an individual claim.

On plaintiffs\u2019 Title VII actions, defendants were subject to claims of discrimination that occurred after January 1, 1982, which was 180 days before Trevino filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. The liability period for the section 1981 actions commenced on April 13, 1981, two years before this suit was filed on April 13, 1983.

Plaintiffs initially sought in the district court to prove discrimination under both disparate treatment and disparate impact theories, arguing that the agreement as written and as applied was discriminatory.

The court also concluded that to the extent that year-round list status goes to the most senior skilled employee in bidding system job classifications, it is also immunized by section 703(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b990-9\">.

Dr. Ha-worth stated that from 1978 to 1983 Hispanics not on the year-round list accrued a yearly average of 4.35, while non-Hispanics accrued an average of 4.14 months of seniority.

Plaintiffs also argue that our panel opinion in <em>International Woodworkers v. Champion International Corp., </em>752 F.2d 163 (5th Cir.1985), <em>on rehearing en banc, </em>790 F.2d 1174 (5th Cir. 1986), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 107 S.Ct. 568, 93 L.Ed.2d 573 (1986), supports by analogy their argument that costs should be awarded only upon a finding that the suit is frivolous. However, we voted to rehear the case en banc, thereby vacating the panel opinion, and issued a decision en banc. We held that costs for excess expert witness fees above the amount specified by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821 may be awarded only when expressly authorized by Congress or when one of the equitable exceptions to the American rule applies. 790 F.2d 1174. Because plaintiffs do not suggest that defendants were awarded any excess costs or explain how the costs here were beyond the scope of Rule 54(d), our decision in <em>International Woodworkers </em>does not support plaintiffs\u2019 contention that costs should not be awarded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b993-9\">. In Holly\u2019s Memorandum in Support of its Motion for Attorneys\u2019 Fees, Holly argued below that plaintiffs made an unreasonably wide and unsupported list of allegations, but Holly treated all these claims collectively as frivolous and did not apply the central issue approach or segregate groups of unrelated claims. Instead, Holly contended: \u201d[P]laintiffs\u2019 claims were not simply unreasonable and groundless when filed, but also pursued in bad faith for more than two years after receiving uncontrovertible evidence of their lack of merit. In its defense, Holly has incurred attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $690,-155.93 and costs in the amount of $12,193.29.\u201d Similarly, Holly averred: \"Plaintiffs had no legal right to compel Holly to expend the literally <em>thousands </em>of hours of attorney time and the literally <em>hundreds of thousands </em>of dollars required to defend a case that was demonstrably frivilous [sic ] from its inception.\u201d In its discussion of the amount of fees that should be awarded, Holly focused on the relevant factors set out in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974), but again did not suggest that the determination should be segregated by claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-13\">In its reply brief in support of its Motion for Attorneys\u2019 Fees, Holly did make one vague reference to the fact that <em>plaintiffs\u2019 </em>brief states that the district court should conduct a specific factual inquiry with regard to each unrelated claim. Holly did not challenge plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, nor offer its agreement, nor did Holly suggest how the rule would be applied in this case. Throughout the reply brief, Holly repeated its claim that <em>all </em>of plaintiffs\u2019 claims were frivolous and brought in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-14\">On appeal, Holly again maintains that all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims were frivolous and does not break down these claims into groups of \"unrelated claims.\u201d Instead, Holly suggests that the district court was required to <em>sua sponte </em>separately examine each of plaintiffs' initial allegations of discrimination <em>(e.g., </em>hiring, promotion, firing, etc.), although several of these allegations are clearly related.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
