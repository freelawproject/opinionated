We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">The hard facts were stipulated and are not in dispute. In 1974 and 1975, plaintiff-appellant, taxpayer E.F. Hutton Group, Inc., filed consolidated income tax returns as the parent company of E.F. Hutton and Company, Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a corporation engaged in the securities brokerage and investment banking business. During this period, E.F. Hutton\u2019s business, in addition to buying and selling stocks, bonds and commodities as both a broker and dealer, included holding tax-exempt obligations to be resold in underwriting syndicates and in the secondary market. The average monthly values of E.F. Hutton\u2019s tax-exempt obligations in 1974 and 1975 (excluding certain tax-exempt obligations held on deposit with commodity clearing corporations) were $23,-000. 000 and $16,000,000, respectively. In percentage figures, these tax-exempt obligations represented approximately 5.25% of the average monthly value of E.F. Hutton\u2019s total assets in 1974 ($438,348,000) and 3.09% of the average monthly value of E.F. Hutton\u2019s total assets in 1975 ($518,217,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">During 1974 and 1975, E.F. Hutton\u2019s indebtedness included bank indebtedness secured by the pledge of customers\u2019 securities, bank indebtedness secured by tax-exempt obligations, indebtedness to other broker-dealers, and subordinated indebtedness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1974, E.F. Hutton incurred an interest expense of $2,832,902 on its total subordinated indebtedness of $24,087,000. The following year, E.F. Hutton\u2019s interest expense was $2,680,674 based on a total subordinated indebtedness of $24,140,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">On its consolidated federal income tax returns for 1974 and 1975, taxpayer deducted in full the interest it paid on its subordinated indebtedness. Acknowledging that a portion of interest paid on its other debt was subject to partial disallowance under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 265(2), E.F. Hutton calculated the disallowed portion using the formula provided in Rev.Proc. 72-18, 1972-1 Cum. Bull. 740. Following an audit, the Commissioner determined that interest on subordinated debt was also subject to partial disallowance under the formula and issued to E.F. Hutton a notice of deficiency for 1974 and 1975 taxes. Appellant paid the deficiencies and, after the proper steps, filed suit in the Claims Court seeking refunds of income tax overpayments in the amounts of $249,598 and $119,183 for 1974 and 1975, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-13\">The Claims Court (Judge Wiese), ruling in favor of the United States, found that \u201ca principal purpose for a portion of [E.F. Hutton\u2019s] borrowing was to facilitate ... ownership of tax exempt securities.\u201d Accordingly, the court held that interest on E.F. Hutton\u2019s subordinated debt was subject to partial disallowance under \u00a7 265(2). In addition, the court upheld the Commissioner\u2019s adjustment of E.F. Hutton\u2019s calculation of tax liability under the formula provided in Rev.Proc. 72-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-14\">On this appeal, appellant assigns as error both the determination that interest on its subordinated debt is subject to partial disallowance and the manner in which the Claims Court applied the formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-16\">\n<em>Deductibility of Interest Paid on Subordinated Indebtedness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ArFo\">Section 265(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 provides (in pertinent part): \u201cNo deduction shall be allowed for ... [i]nterest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry obligations the interest on which is wholly exempt from the taxes imposed by this subtitle.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 26 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 265(2) (1954). To disallow a deduction under \u00a7 265(2), it must be determined, as the Claims Court held, that the interest involved pertains to a borrowing that was undertaken for the purpose of acquiring or continuing to hold tax-exempt securities. E.F. Hutton argues, however, that, instead of having the statutorily proscribed purpose, taxpayer incurred and continued its subordinated indebtedness solely for the purpose of increasing its net capital which, under Rules 325 and 326 of the New York Stock Exchange, governed the permissible level of its business operations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">The Claims Court properly examined E.F. Hutton\u2019s borrowing \u201cin light of all the attendant circumstances.\u201d <em>E.F. Hutton v. United States, </em>No. 579-83T, slip op. at 2 (Cl.Ct. January 22, 1986) (order). <em>See Investors Diversified Services, Inc. v. United States, </em>575 F.2d 843, 848 (Ct.Cl.1978). In reaching its legal conclusions, the court relied upon the following undisputed facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">(1) E.F. Hutton undertook the subordinated indebtedness to augment its capital structure, thereby enhancing its ability to respond to opportunities for business growth. However, the indebtedness was not incurred to remedy an existing or threatened violation of New York Stock Exchange capital requirements;</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">(2) subordinated indebtedness represented a more or less constant feature of E.F. Hutton\u2019s capital structure; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">(3) in its capacity as a broker-dealer engaged in securities transactions on all major securities and commodities exchanges, E.F. Hutton regularly held tax-exempt obligations purchased for resale. Although the dollar amounts of these purchases varied from month to month depending upon market conditions, trading in tax-exempts represented a regular and continuous part of E.F. Hutton\u2019s everyday business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">Because we agree with the Claims Court that there are no genuine issues as to any material fact, we must uphold its summary judgment unless we are persuaded that E.F. Hutton is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We turn then to the Claims Court\u2019s legal conclusion that E.F. Hutton\u2019s subordinated indebtedness was, at least in part, incurred to facilitate ownership of tax-exempt securities. Simply stated, the court held that, since E.F. Hutton\u2019s regular subordinated borrowings increased its capacity to carry tax-exempts, and because E.F. Hutton also regularly dealt in tax-exempts, E.F. Hutton necessarily borrowed partly for the purpose of carrying tax-exempts. This was the Claims Court\u2019s reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-11\">Given the constancy of E.F. Hutton\u2019s reliance on subordinated indebtedness to augment its capital structure and the simultaneous regularity of its purchasing of tax-exempt securities, it must be concluded that a principal purpose for a portion of the company\u2019s borrowing was to facilitate the purchasing or continuing ownership of tax-exempt securities. To put it another way, where the object of a borrowing is to enhance the company\u2019s financial ability to expand its overall business and that business predictably includes the acquisition of tax-exempt securities in a regular and on-going fashion, then it follows that, for a portion of the borrowing, the principal purpose is the acquisition of tax-exempt securities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1D\"><em>E.F. Hutton v. United States, </em>No. 579-83T, slip op. at 3 (Cl.Ct. January 22, 1986) (order).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-12\">Of course, the ultimate issue is whether taxpayer\u2019s subordinated indebtedness was \u201cincurred or continued to purchase or carry\u201d its tax-exempt obligations. One of this court\u2019s predecessors recognized that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>\u201cthe mere contemporaneous existence of the indebtedness and the ownership of tax-exempt obligations does not <em>ipso facto </em>establish the barred purpose within the meaning of section 265(2).\u201d <em>Investors Diversified Services, Inc., v. United States, </em>216 Ct.Cl. 192, 575 F.2d 843, 848 (1978), <em>supra, </em>citing <em>Wisconsin Cheeseman, Inc. v. United States, </em>388 F.2d 420, 422 (7th Cir.1968). Under <em>Investors Diversified Services, </em>as we have already noted, \u201cwhere the issue is disputed there should always be an inquiry, more-or-less particularized, into the connection and relationship between the tax-exempts and the indebtedness so as to discover whether in fact the taxpayer used borrowed funds for the primary purpose of purchasing or carrying those securities.\u201d 575 F.2d at 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\">Taxpayer urges us to draw a distinction between the purpose for which it incurred the subordinated indebtedness and the actual use of the borrowed funds because \u201cuse of the proceeds does not establish the purpose for which the indebtedness was incurred.\u201d Under E.F. Hutton\u2019s reading of \u00a7 265(2), the fact that some of the borrowed funds are ultimately used to purchase or carry tax-exempt obligations does not establish or suggest the purpose for which the indebtedness was incurred. Because appellant says that its purpose for incurring the indebtedness was simply to provide net capital to satisfy the New York Stock Exchange regulatory requirements, it contends that the ultimate use of borrowed funds to purchase or carry tax-exempts should not trigger a \u00a7 265(2) deduction disallowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">We reject as artificially narrow E.F. Hutton\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 265(2). The literal language of the statute prohibits the deduction of interest on indebtedness \u201cincurred <em>or continued </em>to purchase <em>or carry </em>\u201d tax-exempts. (Emphasis added.) Although it may be true that use of the proceeds of the borrowing does not, in itself, establish the purpose of the borrowing, the statute mandates a broader inquiry. The fact that E.F. Hutton may not have <em>incurred </em>the subordinated indebtedness specifically <em>to purchase </em>tax-exempts is not dispositive. But where trading in tax-exempts and the incurring of long-term indebtedness both represent a regular, continuous, routine, and substantial part of taxpayer\u2019s daily business, taxpayer\u2019s decision to <em>continue </em>(rather than retire) its subordinated indebtedness undoubtedly facilitates its ability to <em>carry </em>tax-exempts. There is a clear correlation-and-parallelism which cannot be disregarded\u2014a continued, solid tie between the incurring of subordinated indebtedness and the purchase and maintenance of tax-exempts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In these circumstances, \u00a7 265(2) operates to disallow the deduction of interest on the indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">As the Claims Court noted, <em>Leslie v. Commissioner, </em>413 F.2d 636 (2d Cir.1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 1007, 90 S.Ct. 564, 24 L.Ed.2d 500 (1970) and <em>Bradford v. Commissioner, </em>60 T.C. 253, 260 (1973) are to the same effect. In <em>Leslie v. Commissioner, </em>Bache &amp; Co., a brokerage firm, routinely borrowed from banks to finance its operations. Of its average total bank indebtedness of $78 million, Bache incurred more than $3 million of subordinated indebtedness. 50 T.C. 11, 15 (1968). Bache\u2019s operations were identical to E.F. Hutton\u2019s operations in two respects. First, a relatively small, but nonetheless quite substantial, portion of Bache\u2019s business included holding tax-exempt securities. Second, because the proceeds of Bache\u2019s loans were commingled with the firm\u2019s other funds, it was impossible to trace loan proceeds to any particular use. Notwithstanding the inability directly to trace borrowed funds to tax-exempts, the Second Circuit disallowed a portion of Bache\u2019s interest expense under \u00a7 265(2). The court noted that \u201cBache borrowed money for the purpose of conducting its business, including the holding of some tax-exempt securities____\u201d 413 F.2d at 639. Moreover, \u201csince the use of the bor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>rowed funds cannot be traced, it is reasonable to allocate them to all the business purposes of Bache.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to the court, \u201c[t]here was a direct relationship between the continuance of the debt and the carrying of the tax-exempt securities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 641. E.F. Hutton\u2019s fine-tuned attempts to distinguish <em>Leslie </em>are all unpersuasive. In particular, the fact that E.F. Hutton\u2019s subordinated borrowings were made on a long-term basis rather than daily is irrelevant and does not compel or push toward a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">On virtually identical facts, the Tax Court disallowed a portion of a brokerage firm\u2019s interest expense in <em>Bradford v. Commissioner, </em>60 T.C. 253 (1973). The <em>Bradford </em>taxpayers argued that they borrowed for the purpose of maintaining bank balances necessary to carry on their business which included dealing in both taxable securities and tax-exempt bonds. <em>Id. </em>at 259. The court observed that a brokerage firm which dealt exclusively in tax-exempt securities would not be entitled to deduct the interest paid on its recurring debt, and that it would be unjust to allow taxpayer \u201cto escape the strictures of section 265(2)\u201d simply by dealing in <em>both </em>taxable securities and tax-exempt bonds. Id.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-9\">Finally, the Claims Court\u2019s decision is entirely consistent with the guidelines published by the Internal Revenue Service for the application of \u00a7 265(2). Rev.Proc. 72-18 states in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arf\">[wjhere indebtedness is incurred or continued for the general purpose of carrying on a brokerage business which includes the purchase of both taxable and tax-exempt obligations, and the use of the borrowed funds cannot be directly traced, it is reasonable to infer that the borrowed funds were used for all the activities of the business which include the purchase of tax-exempt obligations. Accordingly, section 265(2) of the Code is \u2022 applicable in such circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahz\">Rev.Proc. 72-18 \u00a7 5.03, 1972-1 Cum.Bull. 740, 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-11\">\n<em>Calculation of Tax Liability Under the Formula in Rev.Proc. 72-18</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ATR\">In determining what portion of E.F. Hutton\u2019s interest deductions to disallow under \u00a7 265(2), the Claims Court applied the method set forth in Rev.Proc. 72-18. Under that directive, the amount of interest deduction disallowed under \u00a7 265(2) is calculated using the following formula:</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">Interest Deductions Subject to Partial Disallowance Under \u00a7 265(2)</p>\n<p id=\"ANPU\">x</p>\n<p id=\"AKc\">Amount of Taxpayer\u2019s Tax_Exempt Obligations_</p>\n<p id=\"AiH_\">Taxpayer\u2019s total assets less amount of indebtedness the interest on which is not subject to disallowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-15\">Obviously, the greater the amount of indebtedness that is subtracted from the denominator of the above fraction, the smaller the fraction\u2019s denominator, the greater the fraction, and the greater the amount of interest deduction disallowed under \u00a7 265(2). E.F. Hutton claims as error the trial court\u2019s decision to reduce the fraction\u2019s denominator by an amount equal to the liabilities included in credits 1 and 3 through 9 of Rule 15c3-3 of the Rules of the Securities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>and Exchange Commission.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These liabilities were not incurred for the purpose of purchasing and holding for resale any type of security but rather flowed directly from E. F. Hutton\u2019s activities with customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">In arguing against subtraction of these liabilities from the denominator, taxpayer relies primarily on the language of Rev.Proc. 72-18. As noted above, Rev. Proc. 72-18 requires subtraction from the denominator of any \u201cindebtedness the interest on which is not subject to disallowance.\u201d Because E.F. Hutton did not pay any interest on these liabilities, it claims that this particular indebtedness is not covered by the literal terms of the Revenue Procedure. The Claims Court stated, however, and we agree that Rev.Proc. 72-18 suffers from a \u201clack of clarity\u201d with respect to whether an indebtedness must generate an interest expense in order to qualify for subtraction. We cannot condemn as legal error the trial court\u2019s decision to effectuate the purpose of the formula at some expense to its language read precisely. \u201cWhile the intention of the legislature must be ascertained from the words used to express it, the manifest reason and obvious purpose of the law should not be sacrificed to a literal interpretation of such words.\u201d <em>Peirce v. Van Dusen, </em>78 F. 693, 696 (6th Cir.1897) (Harlan, Circuit Justice).</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-7\">Judge Wiese properly held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1039-8\">[t]he purpose of the allocation formula is to apportion, between tax-exempt obligations and other business assets, that interest expense which stems from borrowings whose use cannot be traced to specific purchases in either investment category. The premise is that where such direct tracing is not possible, all business assets are presumed to have contributed equally to the interest burden. Since the formula is concerned with the apportionment of interest expense associated with borrowings traceable only generally (rather than specifically, <em>i.e., </em>by asset and dollar amount), to taxable and tax-exempt assets, it necessarily excludes the amount of any borrowing the interest on which would not be disallowed in any event.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1039-11\"><em>E.F. Hutton v. United States, </em>No. 579-83T, slip op. at 6 (Cl.Ct. January 22, 1986) (order).</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-12\">In reducing the fraction\u2019s denominator by an amount equal to the liabilities included in credits 1 and 3 through 9 of Rule 15c3-3, the court properly elected to effectuate the plain purpose of Rev.Proc. 72-18 rather than contradict the objective of the formula by resort to a dry literalism.</p>\n<p id=\"AXg\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">.

Under New York Stock Exchange Rules 325 and 326, as in effect in 1974 and 1975, a member firm, such as E.F.
