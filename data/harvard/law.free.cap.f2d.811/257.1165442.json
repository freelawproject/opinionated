Appellee Roberts, along with codefendant Ross, was charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice by participating in sham real estate transactions and with related substantive obstruction offenses. In addition, both Roberts and Lloyd were charged with making false statements before a grand jury in connection with its investigation of the real estate transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">Appellees entered pleas of not guilty and filed motions for discovery pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a). The motions sought, among other things, the disclosure of any statement made by a codefendant, especially by Ross, which might be imputed to appellee Roberts under the government\u2019s conspiracy theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">A magistrate ordered the government to comply with this discovery request, and, on the authority of <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>757 F.2d 1486 (4th Cir.1985), the district court affirmed the magistrate\u2019s order. The government, however, opposed the discovery order, claiming that disclosure would threaten the safety of its witnesses. In light of the government\u2019s refusal to comply, the district court entered an order that any co-conspirator statements admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) would be suppressed at the defendants\u2019 forthcoming trial. The government appealed the suppression order, and the panel, in an opinion which elaborated upon the holding in <em>Jackson, </em>affirmed the district court. 793 F.2d 580 (4th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-16\">We now vacate the decision of the panel and reverse the suppression order of the district court. The plain language of Fed. R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(A) pertains to the discovery of statements \u201cmade by the defendant.\u201d The rule does not mention and is not intended to apply to the discovery of statements made by co-conspirators. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>statements are more properly governed by the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">When the statements of persons other than the defendant are sought, questions of witness safety necessarily arise. The phrase \u201cwitness safety\u201d incorporates our concerns about those persons whose inculpatory statements may be introduced at trial. The dichotomy the dissent would have us draw between declarants and witnesses is utterly unrealistic. It fails to recognize, among other things, that the disclosure of co-conspirator statements may expose not only the declarant to threats and intimidation, but also those expected to testify at trial concerning the declarant\u2019s statements.' This approach endangers government witnesses by circumventing the protections of the Jencks Act, and we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">In reaching this result, we adopt the reasoning set forth in the separate concurrence in <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>757 F.2d at 1492-94 (Wilkinson, J.). That opinion explains in detail why the alleged \u201cspirit\u201d of the rules is no substitute for their plain meaning, why the safety and well-being of witnesses is compromised by the position of the dissenting judges, and why the reading of the rules adopted herein poses for criminal defendants no danger of unfair surprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">We remand the case for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b345-9\">JAMES DICKSON PHILLIPS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Art\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">I respectfully dissent for the reasons explained in the vacated panel opinion. 793 F.2d 580 (4th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">In particular, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, simply does not \u201cgovern\u201d the pre-trial discovery of co-conspirator statements when, as, here, the co-conspirator is not a prospective witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">No one attempting fairly to divine the proper application to co-conspirator statements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(A) (pre-trial discovery of \u201cdefendant statements\u201d); Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) (co-conspirator \u201chearsay\u201d declarations admissible as admissions of a defendant); and Fed.R.Crim.P. 26.2 (Jencks Act bar to pre-trial disclosure of prospective witness statements) could fail to appreciate that the three rules in combination do not yield a \u201cliteral\u201d answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">For the panel opinion\u2019s reasonable and just accommodation of the conflicting interests of prosecution and accused well within the spirit of the most pertinent rules the en banc majority has substituted a woodenly rigid approach plainly violative of the manifest spirit of the rules in combination. Instead of leaving the question of disclosure in particular cases to the circumscribed discretion of district judges, the majority, claiming a \u201cliteralist\u201d approach to rule interpretation, has left disclosure entirely to the discretion of government prosecutors, adopting the government\u2019s extreme litigation position here lock-stock-and-barrel.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-15\">The practical result is that while an accused may protect himself against the risk of being surprised at trial by his own falsely reported statements, he may not protect himself against the much more treacherous risk of surprise by falsely attributed or reported hearsay statements of a \u201cco-conspirator\u201d admitted against him by the \u201cfiction\u201d that they are his own. It can only be hoped that if this is what the rules \u201cliterally\u201d prescribe, the rules-makers will give renewed attention to a problem that has already occupied them considerably in recent years.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-16\">I am authorized to say that Chief Judge WINTER, Judge ERVIN, and Senior Judge BUTZNER join in this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
