(Var\u00edan). Utley contends that the district court\u2019s removal of his action from state court was improper because his state law causes of action, some of which were predicated on Varian\u2019s alleged violation of its federal affirmative action duties, did not raise a federal question. Utley also contests the grant of summary judgment. We hold that the district court did not have removal jurisdiction over this action and therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-21\">Var\u00edan, a federal government contractor, laid off Utley after four years of employment. Eventually, it dismissed him. Utley sued in California court, alleging five state law counts, three of which are the subject of this appeal. In his first claim, Utley alleged that Var\u00edan dismissed him because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>of his race (Utley is black) in violation of Varian\u2019s affirmative action duties as a federal contractor under Executive Order 11,-246, 30 Fed.Reg. 12,319 (1965), <em>reprinted in </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e app. at 28-31 (1982), and its implementing regulations, 41 C.F.R. ch. 60 (1985), and thus committed an unlawful employment practice under section 12940 of the California Government Code. Section 12940 prohibits employers from discharging employees on the basis of race. Cal.Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 12940(a) (West 1986). Utley also claimed that Var\u00edan misrepresented itself as an \u201cequal opportunity employer\u201d by failing to comply with the federal affirmative action program. Finally, Utley alleged that Varian's conduct constituted an unlawful business practice under section 17200 of the California Business and Professions Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">Var\u00edan removed the action to federal district court. The district court held that Utley's reliance on the executive order gave it federal question removal jurisdiction, the case being \u201ca clear example of \u2018a substantial dispute over the effect of federal law\u2019 where \u2018the result turns on the federal question.\u2019 \u201d 625 F.Supp. 104, 106 (N.D.Cal.1985) (quoting <em>Guinasso v. Pacific First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>656 F.2d 1364, 1365-66 (9th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1020, 102 S.Ct. 1716, 72 L.Ed. 138 (1982)). The court granted Varian\u2019s summary judgment motion dismissing Utley\u2019s state claims to the extent they were based on violations of the executive order, holding them to be preempted by the executive order. The court remanded Utley\u2019s remaining claims to the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-5\">On appeal Utley contends that the district court did not have removal jurisdiction over the action, that the executive order did not preempt his causes of action based on the order, and that the district court should have abstained from exercising jurisdiction because of unsettled questions of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-7\">Utley argues that the district court\u2019s removal of his action from state court was improper, because he could not have brought his state law action in federal court in the first instance. We review the district court\u2019s decision to remove <em>de novo. Bright v. Bechtel Petroleum, Inc., </em>780 F.2d 766, 768 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-9\">Removal is proper of any state civil action \u201cof which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a). The district CQurts\u2019 original jurisdiction extends to \u201call civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1331. Thus, \u201cpropriety of the removal ... turns on whether the case falls within the original \u2018federal question\u2019 jurisdiction of the federal courts.\u201d <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 3229, 3232, 92 L.Ed.2d 650 (1986). The issue is whether Utley\u2019s state law claims, predicated on Varian\u2019s alleged violation of federal affirmative action duties, \u201carise under\u201d federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-12\"><em>Merrell Dow </em>clarifies the \u201carising under\u201d issue in cases in which the federal law incorporated by a state law claim does not itself confer a private right of action. In <em>Merrell Dow </em>the plaintiff alleged that the defendant\u2019s misbranding of a drug in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301-392, established a rebuttable presumption of negligence in his state law products liability action. 106 S.Ct. at 3231. On defendant\u2019s petition, the district court removed the action from state court, holding that the plaintiff's reliance on the defendant\u2019s violation of the FDCA made the action one \u201carising under\u201d federal law. <em>Id. </em>The Court, in rejecting the district court\u2019s reasoning and holding that it did not have removal jurisdiction, found that the lack of a private right of action under the FDCA disposed of the issue of whether a state claim based on its violation arose under federal law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1368-13\">[A] complaint alleging a violation of a federal statute as an element of a state cause of action, when Congress has determined that there should be no private, federal cause of action for the violation, does not state a claim \u201carising under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 3237. The Court explained that to permit removal based on a federal statute not conferring a private right of action would disregard the will of Congress to preclude a private remedy in federal court for the statute\u2019s violation. <em>Id. </em>at 3234-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-6\"><em>Merrell Dow </em>provides the framework of analysis for this case, for Utley\u2019s state claims are based on Varian\u2019s alleged violation of federal law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Varian attempts to distinguish <em>Merrell Dow </em>on two grounds. First, Varian cites <em>Franchise Tax Board v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, </em>463 U.S. 1, 13, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 2848, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983), for the proposition that \u201c[e]ven though state law creates [the] causes of action, [the] case might still \u2018arise under\u2019 the laws of the United States if a well-pleaded complaint established that [the] right to relief under state law requires resolution of a substantial question of federal law in dispute between the parties.\u201d It argues that here, unlike in <em>Merrell Dow, </em>a \u201csubstantial\u201d federal question is necessarily raised. In <em>Merrell Dow, </em>resolution of the issue of the defendant\u2019s violation of the FDCA did not necessarily dispose of the liability issue, as the violation created only a rebuttable presumption of negligence. Here, Varian contends, determination of its liability in Utley\u2019s state law causes of action requires resolution of the \u201csubstantial\u201d issue of its compliance with the federal affirmative action program. Varian argues that this necessary resolution of a \u201csubstantial\u201d federal question dictates finding, under <em>Franchise Tax Board, </em>that Utley\u2019s state law causes of action arise under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-9\">We disagree. The Court in <em>Merrell Dow </em>found that the congressional determination not to provide a private cause of action under the federal statute constituted \u201ca congressional conclusion that the presence of a claimed violation of the statute as an element of a state cause of action is insufficiently \u2018substantial\u2019 to confer federal-question jurisdiction.\u201d 106 S.Ct. at 3236. Under <em>Merrell Dow, </em>if a federal law does not provide a private right of action, then a state law action based on its violation perforce does not raise a \u201csubstantial\u201d federal question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-10\">Varian also argues that Utley has a private, federal remedy to redress violations of the affirmative action program. Varian points to the availability of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706; <em>see Legal Aid Soc\u2019y v. Brennan, </em>608 F.2d 1319 (9th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Chamber of Commerce v. Legal Aid Soc\u2019y, </em>447 U.S. 921, 100 S.Ct. 3010, 65 L.Ed.2d 1112 (1980), and administrative enforcement initiated by employee complaints, Exec. Order No. 11,-246 \u00a7\u00a7 206, 208-209; 41 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 60-1.20 to -1.28 (employee complaint, hearing, and sanction proceedings); <em>see also infra </em>section III. These remedies, however, are not comparable to a suit against the employer in federal court. Judicial review under the APA typically involves suit against the Department of Labor, not the employer. Administrative enforcement can include an award of back pay from the employer, 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 60-1.26(a)(2), but this enforcement mechanism is nonjudicial. Neither remedy indicates congressional intent to permit suit against the employer in federal court, and thus neither supports removal jurisdiction under <em>Merrell Dow.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>Only if the executive order provides Utley with a private right of action against Varian in federal court might his complaint raise a \u201csubstantial\u201d federal question permitting removal jurisdiction. This is an issue of first impression in this circuit, which we address next.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-5\">The cornerstone of the affirmative action program is its requirement that government contracting agencies provide in all nonexempted government contracts a clause that, among other things, prohibits contractors from discriminating on the basis of race and requires the contractors to take \u201caffirmative action\u201d to ensure that employees are hired without regard to race. Exec. Order No. 11,246 \u00a7 202; 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 60-1.4(a); <em>see also </em>41 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 60-1.40 to -1.43, -2.10 to -2.14, -2.20 to -2.26, -3.1 to -3.16 (detailing affirmative action requirements). The executive order assigns to the Secretary of Labor the duty to enforce its provisions, Exec. Order No. 11,246 \u00a7 201, which the Secretary has delegated, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 401 (permitting delegation of Secretary\u2019s duties), to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 60-1.2. The OFCCP monitors program compliance through compliance reviews and investigation of employee complaints. Exec. Order No. 11,246 \u00a7 206; 41 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 60-1.20 to -1.24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-6\">The program contains several enforcement mechanisms. First, the OFCCP may refer complaints to the EEOC for proceedings under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Exec. Order No. 11,246 \u00a7 209(a)(3); 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 60-1.24(a). Second, the OFCCP may, after making reasonable attempts to secure compliance \u201cby methods of conference, conciliation, mediation, and persuasion,\u201d recommend to the Justice Department that it bring \u201cappropriate proceedings,\u201d including those for injunctions, to redress \u201csubstantial or material\u201d violations. Exec. Order No. 11,246 \u00a7 209(a)(2), (b); <em>see also </em>41 C.F.R. \u00a7 60-1.-26(a)(2), (e) (implementing regulations permitting Attorney General to also bring suit in federal court for recovery of back pay). Finally, after making reasonable attempts at conciliation, the OFCCP may institute administrative enforcement proceedings to cancel or suspend the contract and bar the contractor from future government work. Exec. Order No. 11,246 \u00a7 209(a)(5), (a)(6), (b); <em>see also </em>41 C.F.R. \u00a7 60-1.26(a)(2) (regulations providing also for award of back pay). The regulations provide that the Secretary may impose these administrative remedies only after the Solicitor of Labor conducts a hearing or the contractor waives it. 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 60-1.26(a)(2), (c), (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-10\">Neither the executive order nor the regulations <em>expressly </em>provides a private right of action in federal court to redress affirmative action violations. The district court found no private right of action <em>implicit </em>in the executive order, on the ground that a private right of action \u201c \u2018would be obviously destructive of the administrative scheme\u2019 \u201d established by the order. 625 F.Supp. at 107 (quoting <em>Traylor v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>402 F.Supp. 871, 875-76 (N.D.Cal.1975)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review the district court\u2019s decision construing the executive order <em>de novo. Cf. Trustees of Amalgamated Ins. Fund v. Geltman Indus., </em>784 F.2d 926, 929 (9th Cir.1986) <em>(de novo </em>review for statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>interpretation), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 107 S.Ct. 90, 93 L.Ed.2d 42 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-5\">Were the affirmative action program created by Congress, we would examine congressional intent to determine whether a private right of action should be inferred. <em>See, e.g., Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, </em>473 U.S. 134, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 3092-94, 87 L.Ed.2d 96 (1985); <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975); <em>In re Mexico City Aircrash of October 31, 1979, </em>708 F.2d 400, 406-08 (9th Cir.1983). Because the executive has created the affirmative action program, a similar analysis, focusing on executive rather than congressional intent, is appropriate in determining whether the executive order contemplates a private right of action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Cort v. Ash </em>listed four factors relevant \u201c[i]n determining whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute not expressly providing one\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-7\">First, is the plaintiff \u201cone of the class for whose <em>especial </em>benefit the statute was enacted\u201d \u2014 that is, does the statute create a federal right in favor of the plaintiff? Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one? Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff? And finally, is the cause of action one traditionally relegated to state law, in an area basically the concern of the States, so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1371-10\">422 U.S. at 78, 95 S.Ct. at 2087 (citations omitted). Focusing on executive rather than legislative intent, we apply these factors to the executive order program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-11\">The first <em>Cort </em>factor weighs in favor of inferring a private right of action. Utley is black, and the affirmative action program clearly seeks to secure equal opportunity in employment for minorities. Utley is thus a member of the class for whose \u201cespecial benefit\u201d the program was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-12\">The second factor, however, strongly cautions against finding a private right of action. The executive order and regulations provide no explicit indication that the executive intended to create such a remedy. Likewise, this court has found no executive statement expressing an unambiguous view on the subject.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We are left, then, to analyze the program to determine whether it implicitly indicates an executive intent to provide a private remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-13\">We follow the \u201celemental canon of statutory construction that where a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, a court must be chary of reading others into it.\u201d <em>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, </em>444 U.S. 11, 19, 100 S.Ct. 242, 246, 62 L.Ed.2d 146 (1979); <em>accord Mexico City Aircrash, </em>708 F.2d at 407. The affirmative action program contains detailed enforcement procedures, including referrals to the EEOC and the Justice Department, and administrative pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>ceedings for contract cancellation and recovery of back pay. This comprehensive enforcement mechanism creates a strong presumption that the executive deliberately omitted a private remedy from the program. <em>Cf. Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers Union, </em>451 U.S. 77, 97, 101 S.Ct. 1571, 1583, 67 L.Ed.2d 750 (1981) (\u201cThe presumption that a remedy was deliberately omitted from a statute is strongest when Congress has enacted a comprehensive legislative scheme including an integrated system of procedures for enforcement.\u201d) The Fifth Circuit in <em>Farkas </em>considered whether the predecessor of Executive Order 11,246 \u2014 Executive Order 10,-925 \u2014 conferred a private right of action. The court found the existence of administrative enforcement procedures under the executive order, \u201cits narrowly limited reference to judicial enforcement,\u201d and the opportunity to file complaints with the EEOC, evidenced an executive intent not to provide a private remedy. 375 F.2d at 633. The present affirmative action program even more strongly evidences such intent, for it explicitly provides for the administrative recovery of back pay in addition to the remedies available under the program considered in <em>Farkas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\">This lack of any indication of executive intent to provide a private judicial remedy would alone arguably support a finding that none was implicit in the executive order. Cf<em>. Mexico City Aircrash, </em>708 F.2d at 408 (failure to satisfy second <em>Cort </em>factor indicates that no private right of action under statute should be inferred). Yet, if the latter two <em>Cort </em>factors are considered, this conclusion becomes even stronger. While equal opportunity in federal employment is not an area of law \u201ctraditionally relegated to state law,\u201d a private judicial remedy would not be particularly consistent with the \u201cunderlying purposes\u201d of the affirmative action program. It is, of course, quite possible that private actions under the executive order would further promote the program\u2019s goal of equal employment opportunity for minorities in the workplace. However, as previously noted, the executive order envisions achievement of this goal through conciliation \u2014 not confrontation. Only after having made reasonable attempts at \u201cconference, conciliation, mediation, and persuasion\u201d does the executive order direct the Secretary to resort to other enforcement methods. A private action against the employer for affirmative action violations could very well circumvent the Secretary\u2019s conciliation efforts, upsetting the administrative enforcement mechanism contemplated by the executive order. <em>Traylor v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>402 F.Supp. at 875-76.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This inconsistency with the affirmative action program\u2019s emphasis on conciliation further demonstrates the inappropriateness of inferring a private right of action under the executive order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-7\">Our analysis of the <em>Cort </em>factors leads us to conclude that the executive did not intend a private judicial remedy to redress violations of Executive Order 11,-246\u2019s affirmative action program. We therefore decline to interpret the executive order as providing a private right of action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because Utley possesses no private right of action under the executive order, his state claims\u2019 incorporation of it does not raise a \u201csubstantial\u201d question of federal law under <em>Merrell Dow, </em>and the district court could not assume removal jurisdiction on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-9\">Var\u00edan lastly contends that Utley\u2019s causes of action, even though drafted as arising under state law, are \u201creally federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>law claims.\u201d Var\u00edan argues that the executive order preempts Utley\u2019s state law claims incorporating it and that the district court therefore could have assumed jurisdiction over the action under the \u201cartful pleading doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-4\">The artful pleading doctrine is an exception to the long-standing rule that federal courts cannot assume federal question jurisdiction solely on the basis of federal law raised as a defense. <em>Williams v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., </em>786 F.2d 928, 931 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 107 S.Ct. 455, 93 L.Ed.2d 401 (1986). In the preemption context it provides that \u201c \u2018if a federal cause of action completely pre-empts a state cause of action any complaint that comes within the scope of the federal cause of action necessarily \u201carises under\u201d federal law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 932 (quoting <em>Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U.S. at 24, 103 S.Ct. at 2854).</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-7\">The artful pleading doctrine involves the court\u2019s recharacterization of a state law claim as a federal one. <em>Williams, </em>786 F.2d at 931 n. 1, 932 n. 2, 933; <em>Hunter v. United Van Lines, </em>746 F.2d 635, 640 (9th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 180, 88 L.Ed.2d 150 (1985). This court has used this recharacterization to distinguish actions maintaining jurisdiction under the artful pleading doctrine from those involving only \u201cordinary\u201d preemption raised as a defense, which does not itself support jurisdiction. <em>See Williams, </em>786 F.2d at 932; <em>Hunter, </em>746 F.2d at 641-43. From this fiction of recharacterization stems the prerequisite for invoking the doctrine that not only must the federal cause of action \u201ccompletely preempt\u201d the state cause of action, but it must also provide a \u201csuperseding remedy replacing the state law cause of action,\u201d <em>Williams, </em>786 F.2d at 932, for if no federal right of action exists under the preempting federal law, recharacterization of the plaintiff\u2019s state law claim as a federal claim is doctrinally impossible. <em>Id. </em>at 932 n. 2; <em>Hunter, </em>746 F.2d at 642-43. <em>But cf. Bright v. Bechtel Petroleum, Inc., </em>780 F.2d 766, 768-70 (9th Cir.1986) (applying artful pleading doctrine in nonpreemption context in which no analogous federal right of action existed).</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-15\">Before analyzing the artful pleading doctrine\u2019s applicability to this case, we briefly address the doctrine\u2019s relationship to the jurisdictional analysis of the preceding sections (the <em>Merrell Dow </em>test). The two modes of analysis are coexistent, and federal question jurisdiction may be supported under either basis. <em>See Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U.S. at 14-27, 103 S.Ct. at 2848-55 (applying both modes of analysis to determine whether federal jurisdiction existed). While both analyses are similar in that under either the lack of a private remedy under the relevant federal law will frustrate jurisdiction,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> they are not identical. Under <em>Merrell Dow </em>a federal question is potentially raised by the state law cause of action\u2019s express incorporation of federal law. The artful pleading doctrine, on the other hand, asks whether the state law cause of action is properly recharacterized as a federal cause of action because a federal law, not necessarily expressly incorporated by the state law cause of action, preempts it. Even though a state law cause of action may not expressly raise a \u201csubstantial\u201d federal question, jurisdiction may still be established under the artful pleading doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-16\">Having found that Utley\u2019s state law claims\u2019 express incorporation of the executive order does not raise a substantial federal question, we must then consider whether jurisdiction could be supported under the artful pleading doctrine. <em>See Shaw v. California Dep\u2019t of Alcoholic Beverage Control, </em>788 F.2d 600, 603 (9th Cir.1986) (district court\u2019s judgment may be affirmed on any basis supported by the record even if district court did not rely on that basis). Varian\u2019s sole argument is that Executive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>Order 11,246 preempts Utley\u2019s state law claims, which should therefore be recharacterized as arising under the executive order. The executive order, however, does not provide a private right of action in federal court. Nor does the administrative relief available to Utley under the executive order qualify as a \u201csuperseding\u201d remedy for purposes of the artful pleading doctrine. The superseding federal remedy must provide a right of action <em>in federal court; </em>otherwise the federal court would be unable to take jurisdiction over the state law cause of action by recharacterizing it as a federal court action. We need not decide whether the executive order \u201ccompletely preempts\u201d Utley\u2019s state law causes of action, because, without an existing federal right of action, recharacterization of Utley\u2019s state law claims as an action under Executive Order 11,246 is impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-4\">Finally, although Var\u00edan does not make the argument, we note that Utley\u2019s state law claims are not properly characterizable under the artful pleading doctrine as Title VII claims. While Title VII does provide a private right of action, it does not preempt Utley\u2019s state law claims. <em>See California Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Guerra, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 107 S.Ct. 683, 690-91, 695, 93 L.Ed.2d 613 (1987) (preemptive reach of Title VII is narrow, limited to state statutes that are inconsistent with or unlawful under Title VII); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-7, 2000h-4. Therefore, the district court could not take jurisdiction of this action under the artful pleading doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-8\">We conclude that the district court did not have jurisdiction over this action. We therefore do not address the preemption or abstention issues. The judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the action REMANDED. The district court is directed to remand the entire action to the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Mateo.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1369-7\">. The district court entered judgment prior to the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Merrell Dow </em>and thus did not adopt this analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1369-8\">. Although Varian does not argue the point, we note that the possible existence of a private right of action for Utley under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l), does not mean that his state law causes of action arise under federal law: Utley\u2019s causes of action do not specifically invoke Title VII, and thus do not require resolution of any questions arising under it. The fact that the executive order program provides for the referral of complaints to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for proceedings under Title VII, Exec. Order No. 11,246 \u00a7 209(a)(3); 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 601.24(a), does not alter this analysis. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>Any resulting private right of action would be grounded on Title VII, which Utley\u2019s state law causes of action do not invoke, and not on the executive order program itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1370-8\">. Most courts that have considered the issue have found no implied private right of action under the executive order. <em>See, e.g., Cohen </em>v. <em>Illinois Inst. of Technology, </em>524 F.2d 818, 822 n. 4 (7th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 943, 96 S.Ct. 1683, 48 L.Ed.2d 187 (1976); <em>Weise v. Syracuse Univ., </em>522 F.2d 397, 411 n. 23 (2d Cir.1975); <em>Manuel v. International Harvester Co., </em>502 F.Supp. 45, 47-48 (N.D.Ill.1980); <em>Traylor v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>402 F.Supp. at 874; <em>cf. Farkas v. Texas Instrument, Inc., </em>375 F.2d 629, 632-33 (5th Cir.) (private action under predecessor of Exec. Order No. 11,246 would be inconsistent with its administrative enforcement scheme), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 977, 88 S.Ct. 480, 19 L.Ed.2d 471 (1967). <em>But see Lewis </em>v. <em>Western Airlines, Inc., </em>379 F.Supp. 684, 686-89 (N.D.Cal.1974) (private action under Exec. Order No. 11,246 compatible with its administrative enforcement scheme).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1371-9\">. One, potentially critical, difference between the two forms of analyses is that the principle of separation of powers may require an executive-created action to be rooted in an appropriate grant of authority from Congress. <em>See Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281, 302, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 1717, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979) (principle of separation of powers requires any \"substantive\u201d regulation, \"\u2018affecting individual rights and obligations,\u2019 \u201d to be \"rooted in a grant of [legislative] power by the Congress and subject to limitations which that body imposes\u201d); <em>cf. Kuhn v. National Ass'n of Letter Carriers, </em>570 F.2d 757, 760-61 (8th Cir.1978) (Exec. Order No. 11,491 regulating federal labor-management relations is not \"law\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, because not congressionally authorized) (cited with approval in <em>Leath v. Stetson, </em>686 F.2d 769, 771 (9th Cir.1982)). Because we conclude below that Executive Order 11,246 provides no private right of action, we need not address the authorization issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1371-15\">. The proposed 1976 revisions to the implementing regulations expressly stated that the executive order did not confer a private right of action. Equal Employment Opportunity: Proposed Revisions and Redesignation of Regulations, 41 Fed.Reg. 40,340, 40,352 (1976). This statement was omitted from the final regulations. We decline to read tea leaves and infer from this omission an executive intent to create a private right of action, particularly in light of the following analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1372-5\">. This conflict between public and private enforcement is not present to the same degree in Title VII, because Title VII expressly provides a private right of action but limits the right to cases where the EEOC has been unsuccessful in achieving compliance. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). The executive order program, which does not expressly address private actions in federal court, does not provide a comparable mechanism to reduce this conflict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1372-11\">. <em>Lewis v. Western Airlines, Inc., </em>379 F.Supp. 684 (N.D.Cal.1974), is overruled to the extent it is inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1373-10\">. Under <em>Merrell Dow, </em>because the congressional intent not to provide a private right of action dictates that the federal question expressly raised by the state law claim is not \"substantial\u201d; under the artful pleading doctrine because without a federal right of action recharacterization of the state law claim as a federal claim is impossible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
