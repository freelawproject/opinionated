A vote was taken, but a majority of the active judges were not in favor of en banc consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b588-6\">REINHARDT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The petition for rehearing is denied. Triple \u201cA\u201d Machine Shop\u2019s reliance on <em>Kentucky v. Graham, </em>473 U.S. 159, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985), is misplaced. <em>Kentucky v. Graham </em>held only that a government entity cannot be held liable in an action against a government official in his personal capacity. The decision in no way alters or affects the basic rule that a prevailing party may be awarded attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to Section 1988. Most important of all, the Court expressly disavowed any intent to change the current law with respect to the criteria for, or definition of, a \u201cprevailing party\u201d. As the Court explicitly said: \u201cWe express no view as to the nature or degree of success necessary to make a plaintiff a prevailing party. <em>See Maher v. Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980).\u201d 105 S.Ct. at 3105 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Thus the law of the case, <em>Southwest Marine v. Campbell Industries, </em>732 F.2d 744 (9th Cir.1985), remains applicable. Moreover, in our view, that law was properly decided. For reasons stated in the above cited opinion, <em>Southwest Marine </em>was the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">NOONAN, Circuit Judge, with whom GOODWIN, SNEED, and J. BLAINE ANDERSON, Circuit Judges, join dissenting from the denial of en banc rehearing:</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">The opinion of the court in this case is defensible if either of the following propositions is valid:</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">1. A losing litigant is entitled to be paid his attorneys\u2019 fees by the winning litigant.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">2. Once a court makes a serious mistake, the court should not correct the mistake, even though its error is called to its attention and the litigation is still in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-14\">The present case treats the award of fees under the antitrust laws, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 26, as parallel to awards under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. In <em>Kentucky v. Graham, </em>473 U.S. 159, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985) a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court, Justice Marshall writing for the Court made a number of statements on court-awarded attorneys\u2019 fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988,\u2014 statements which very strictly read could be taken as dicta but which form the warp and woof of the Court\u2019s reasoning and which, because of the precedential force of \u00a7 1988 cases, are highly relevant here. <em>Kentucky v. Graham </em>is of a breadth and weight that makes disregard of its teaching all but direct defiance of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-15\">In <em>Kentucky v. Graham, </em>Justice Marshall for the Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-16\">... It is clear that the logical place to look for recovery of fees is to the losing party- \u2014 the party legally responsible for relief on the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 3104.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-18\">Justice Marshall also wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-19\">That a plaintiff has prevailed against one party does not entitle him to fees from another party, let alone from a non-party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-20\"><em>Id. </em>at 3106.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-21\">Justice Marshall further wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-22\">... <em>fee </em>and merits liability run together.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATP\"><em>Id. </em>at 3108.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-23\">In the present case, recovery of fees has been looked to in the illogical place \u2014 the winning party, the party found to be not responsible for relief on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-24\">\u25a0In the present case, the plaintiff prevailed against one party by means of settlement and is now awarded fees from another party which did not settle, a party which in fact did prevail against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-25\">In the present case, fee and merits liability do not run together, but liability for the fee is attached to a defendant that has won on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The only conceivable justification for this bizarre result is that the law of the case in an earlier phase of this litigation had established that the victorious defendant should be liable. In the earlier phase, a per curiam opinion stated that \u201cthe defendants decided to permit Southwest Marine to use the dock under an assignment from National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co.\u201d <em>Southwest Marine, Inc. v. Campbell Industries, </em>732 F.2d 744, 747 (9th Cir.1984). The opinion went on to say that the plaintiff had \u201cprevailed within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.\u201dThe implication of the opinion was that the plaintiff had prevailed against both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Two major difficulties exist in treating the law of the case thus set out as binding now:</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">First, the law of the case is not binding when the law changes. <em>Kentucky v. Graham </em>clarified the law of court-awarded attorneys\u2019 fees in such a way that it should be read as changing the law subsequent to this court\u2019s earlier decision. Accordingly, the earlier opinion should give way.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Second, the law of the case does not have the same binding force as <em>res judicata. </em>As Justice Holmes succinctly put it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">In the absence of statute the phrase, law of the case, as applied to the effect of previous orders on the later action of the court rendering them in the same case, merely expresses the practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided, not a limit to their power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmW\"><em>Messenger v. Anderson, </em>225 U.S. 436, 444, 32 S.Ct. 739, 740, 56 L.Ed. 1152 (1912). The difference between the law of the case and <em>res judicata </em>is that \u201cone directs discretion, the other supersedes it and compels judgment.\u201d <em>Southern Railway Co. v. Clift, </em>260 U.S. 316, 319, 43 S.Ct. 126, 127, 67 L.Ed. 283 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">We are dealing then with what is properly a matter of discretion \u2014 discretion so vague that the law of the case has been described by the Supreme Court as \u201can amorphous concept.\u201d <em>Arizona v. California, </em>460 U.S. 605, 618,103 S.Ct. 1382, 1391, 75 L.Ed.2d 318 (1983). It is essentially \u201ca rule of practice and not a limit on authority.\u201d 1 B J. Moore, J. Lucas, &amp; T. Currier, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00a7 0.404[1] at 120 (2d ed. 1982). Specifically, to correct \u201ca manifest injustice\u201d the law of the case should be reconsidered. <em>Arizona v. California, </em>460 U.S. at 644, 103 S.Ct. at 1404 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Law of the case should not be applied woodenly in a way inconsistent with substantial justice. <em>Moore v. James H. Matthews &amp; Co., </em>682 F.2d 830, 833-34 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">A substantial miscarriage of justice is involved in this case. The single sentence speaking of \u201cthe defendants\u201d in the plural is based on this court\u2019s erroneous impression that the defendants had some kind of joint control over the dry docks. In fact, the users\u2019 agreement was between the San Diego Port Authority and a series of independent shipbuilders. No one of these shipbuilders acted on behalf of all the other shipbuilders. The assignment made by National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co. to Southwest Marine was not an assignment that was authorized, concurred in or in any way made possible by Triple \u201cA\u201d. There was no way that the defendants could \u201ccollectively\u201d permit Southwest Marine to use the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">In its brief on appeal in this case, Triple \u201cA\u201d made crystal clear the error which the court\u2019s earlier opinion had made. For reasons that are not apparent, the court has been unwilling to acknowledge that the earlier panel committed an error of fact and it has been unwilling to rectify the miscarriage of justice based on the error of fact. Indeed, in footnote 2 of the present opinion, the court has chosen to repeat the original error. On this appeal Southwest Marine did not attempt to dispute Triple \u201cA\u201d s refutation of this mistake. The court nonetheless still seems to recite the error as fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">The final liability to be imposed by the district court is as yet undetermined. Whether it is ultimately small or large (the losing plaintiff has asked for over $350,000 in fees) is not decisive. Justice is too precious a commodity to have a price. Even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>the ult\u00edmate fee awarded should be small, we should not so turn things on their head that the winner becomes the loser, nor, out of charity for the mistakes of this court, should we turn a blind eye when the court itself is the instrument of injustice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
