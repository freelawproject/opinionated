BROWNING, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1352-23\">In October, 1970 Northrop and Triad entered into a \u201cMarketing Agreement,\u201d under which Triad became Northrop\u2019s exclusive marketing representative to solicit contracts for aircraft and related maintenance, training, and support services for the Saudi Air Force, in return for commissions on sales. Northrop made substantial sales to Saudi Arabia and paid Triad a substantial part of the commissions due under the Marketing Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-24\">On September 17, 1975, the Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia issued Decree No. 1275, prohibiting the payment of commissions in connection with armaments contracts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Northrop ceased paying commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>sions to Triad. Triad protested, and demanded payment of the commissions remaining due under the Agreement. The dispute was submitted to arbitration. The arbitrators sustained Triad\u2019s claim in part, denied it in part, and entered an award in Triad\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">Triad filed an action to confirm the arbitrators\u2019 award, and Northrop filed suit to vacate it. The district court vacated the award in some respects. 593 F.Supp. 928, 942 (C.D.Cal.1984). Triad appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-7\">The arbitrators noted that the essence of Northrop\u2019s defense was that Saudi Arabia\u2019s Decree No. 1275 applied to the Marketing Agreement, and made illegal any commission payment to Triad under the Agreement. \u201cThis contention,\u201d the arbitrators said, \u201cnecessitates a consideration of the meaning and effect of paragraph 13 of the Marketing Agreement.\u201d First Arbitrators\u2019 Decision at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-8\">Paragraph 13 of the Marketing Agreement provided: \u201c[T]he validity and construction of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California.\u201d It further provided: \u201cAny controversy or claim between the parties hereto arising out of or in connection with this Agreement ... shall be settled by arbitration,\u201d and \u201c[t]he award of a majority of the arbitrators ... shall be final and binding upon the parties.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1353-14\">The arbitrators noted that Northrop had proposed inclusion of paragraph 13 in the Marketing Agreement to make it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqX\">unnecessary for Northrop to make an in-depth study of the law of countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, etc., to know what its rights and obligations would be. Instead of having varying and even inconsistent results under the same contractual provisions as a result of applying different laws, depending on where the marketing was to occur, this clause resulted in uniformity of interpretation and application of the contract. Northrop was familiar with the law of California and knew what to expect from it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYlY\"><em>Id. </em>at 19-20. Accordingly, the arbitrators interpreted paragraph 13 as requiring that the local law of California determine the effect of Saudi Arabia Decree No. 1275 on Northrop\u2019s obligation to pay commissions to Triad pursuant to the Marketing Agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Northrop does not disagree with this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-15\">Northrop argued the Marketing Agreement was invalid under California Civil Code \u00a7 1511. This statute provides \u201cperformance of an obligation ... is excused ... [w]hen such performance ... is prevented ... by the operation of law____\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>Cal.Civ.Code \u00a7 1511(1). Northrop reasoned Saudi Decree No. 1275 rendered the Marketing Agreement unlawful under California Civil Code \u00a7 1511 because the Decree \u201cprevented\u201d payment of commissions to Triad and thus \u201cexcused\u201d Northrop\u2019s performance of its obligations under the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">The arbitrators pointed out that the decisions interpreting California Civil Code \u00a7 1511 principally relied upon by Northrop, including <em>Baird v. Wendt Enterprises, Inc., </em>248 Cal.App.2d 52, 56 Cal.Rptr. 118 (1967), and <em>Johnson v. Atkins, </em>53 Cal.App.2d 430, 127 P.2d 1027 (1942), did not look to the law of the foreign jurisdiction to determine whether performance of the contract was unlawful, but instead examined the legal action the foreign jurisdiction had taken to determine whether in fact it prevented performance of the contract. In <em>Baird, </em>the court concluded that a foreign jurisdiction\u2019s adoption of a building code precluding issuance of a permit to construct a building \u201cprevented\u201d performance of the contract within the meaning of section 1511. In <em>Atkins, </em>the court held a foreign jurisdiction\u2019s cancellation of entry permits for copra \u201cprevented\u201d performance of a contract to sell copra for delivery in the foreign jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-5\">The arbitrators concluded there \u201cwas no comparable governmental action in this case.\u201d The building in <em>Baird </em>could not be built without a building permit; the copra in <em>Atkins </em>could not be delivered without an entry permit; but in this case despite the issuance of Decree No. 1275, Northrop could still pay Triad the commissions the Marketing Agreement called for, and Triad could still give advice, translate documents, make local arrangements, and perform the other services the Agreement required. Moreover, as Triad points out, before Decree No. 1275 issued, Triad had successfully solicited the sales contracts Northrop sought and thus had already completed performance of its principal obligation under the Marketing Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-6\">Northrop argued that to honor its obligation to Triad, Northrop would be required to violate Decree No. 1275. The arbitrators adopted Judge Hamley\u2019s statement for this court in a similar case and responded: \u201cIt may be that Boeing has gotten itself into some trouble with the government of Kuwait by setting up and terminating a selling agency in a manner allegedly violative of Kuwait law. But as between Boeing and Alghanim, we think the contract provision must govern.\u201d <em>Alghanim v. Boeing Co., </em>477 F.2d 143, 150 (9th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-9\">The district court reviewed the arbitrators\u2019 decision <em>de novo, </em>rather than under a deferential standard, on the ground that the question presented was whether the Agreement was \u201ccontrary to law and public policy,\u201d 593 F.Supp. at 936. We consider later whether the arbitrators\u2019 interpretation and application of the Agreement is unenforceable because it is contrary to public policy. As the district court correctly stated, this was a question for the court alone to decide. <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Local 759, Int\u2019l Union of United Rubber Workers, </em>461 U.S. 757, 766, 103 S.Ct. 2177, 2183, 76 L.Ed.2d 298 (1983); <em>American Postal Workers v. United States Postal Serv., </em>682 F.2d 1280, 1286 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-10\">The question the arbitrators decided, however, was one of contract interpretation. That issue was the proper interpretation of the requirement of paragraph 13 of the Marketing Agreement that claims arising in connection with the Agreement be settled by arbitration and that California law be applied in resolving them. More specifically, the question was whether paragraph 13 required the arbitrators to apply California Civil Code \u00a7 1511 to determine the effect of Saudi Arabia Decree No. 1275 on the obligations of the parties under the Agreement, and, if so, what that determination should be. This issue arose from the very terms of the Marketing Agreement. Its resolution was an inescapable part of the arbitrators\u2019 task of interpreting and applying the Agreement and resolving the dispute between these parties. Courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>are bound to enforce an award based upon the arbitrators\u2019 resolution of such an issue \u201ceven in the face of \u2018erroneous findings of fact or misinterpretations of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>French v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, </em>784 F.2d 902, 906 (9th Cir.1986) (quoting <em>American Postal Workers, </em>682 F.2d at 1285) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-4\">This case is not unlike <em>George Day Construction Co. v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters, </em>722 F.2d 1471 (9th Cir.1984). A clause in the contract in <em>George Day Construction </em>provided that the terms of the contract were intended to be consistent with federal and state law. The arbitrators interpreted this contract provision as authorizing the arbitrators to look to external law to resolve the parties\u2019 dispute. In reviewing the award, the court held that both the arbitrators\u2019 interpretation of this provision and their resolution of the legal questions the dispute raised as to the parties\u2019 contractual obligations were entitled to deferential review. <em>Id. </em>at 1479-80. <em>See also International Bhd. of Teamsters v. Washington Employers, Inc., </em>557 F.2d 1345, 1349-50 (9th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">Similarly, in this case it was within the arbitrators\u2019 authority to interpret paragraph 13 as requiring that all disputes under the Agreement be determined by the arbitrators in accordance with California law. This interpretation required the arbitrators to decide questions of California law relevant to the parties\u2019 dispute as to their obligations under the Agreement. \u201cIn such circumstances, the arbitrator may and indeed must do so to fulfill his function under the agreement, and a court should not review the merits of his performance in any more depth than it reviews the merits of his interpretation of other contractual provisions.\u201d Kaden, <em>Judges and Arbitrators: Observations on the Scope of Judicial Review, </em>80 Colum.L.Rev. 267, 286 (1980).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1355-9\">The arbitrators\u2019 conclusions on legal issues are entitled to deference here. The legal issues were fully briefed and argued to the arbitrators; the arbitrators carefully considered and decided them in a lengthy written opinion. To now subject these decisions to <em>de novo </em>review would destroy the finality for which the parties contracted and render the exhaustive arbitration process merely a prelude to the judicial litigation which the parties sought to avoid.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1355-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-11\">In stating the rule of deferential review afforded arbitration awards, the Supreme Court also noted a limitation: \u201cthe interpretations of the law by the arbitrators <em>in contrast to manifest disregard axe </em>not subject, in the federal courts, to judicial review for error in interpretation.\u201d <em>Wilko v. Swan, </em>346 U.S. 427, 436-37, 74 S.Ct. 182, 187-88, 98 L.Ed. 168 (1953) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). Although the \u201cmanifest disregard of law\u201d standard is not easily defined, <em>see San Martine Compania de Navegacion, S.A. v. Saguenay Terminals Ltd., </em>293 F.2d 796, 801 n. 4 (9th Cir.1961), it is clear it has not been met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-12\">By the very terms of the rule of deferential review, mere error in interpretation of California law would not be enough to justify refusal to enforce the arbitrators' decision. Moreover, it is far from evident that the arbitrators misread <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>California law at all. No California case clearly contrary to the arbitrators\u2019 interpretation has been called to our attention. It was not unreasonable for the arbitrators to distinguish the cases upon which Northrop relied on the ground stated by the arbitrators.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s analogy to <em>Industrial Development &amp; Land Co. v. Goldschmidt, </em>56 Cal.App. 507, 206 P. 134 (1922), was misplaced; in that case the law claimed to make performance illegal was not foreign law but the eighteenth amendment, which was as controlling in California as if it had been a California statute or constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">The district court examined the language and history of Saudi Arabia Decree No. 1275 in some detail and concluded that it prohibited the payment of the commissions involved in this case. 593 F.Supp. at 938. But as we have said, the question was whether payment was prohibited under California law, not Saudi law, and the answer to that question turned not upon whether Decree No. 1275 stated a rule of Saudi law under which the payment wouid be illegal, but rather upon whether the existence of such a rule in Saudi law excused performance under California Civil Code \u00a7 1511.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">Northrop also argues that if the Saudi Decree did not excuse performance of the Marketing Agreement under California Civil Code \u00a7 1511, the choice-of-law clause in the Agreement should be set aside and the Saudi Decree should be applied directly to invalidate the Marketing Agreement under the principle announced in Restatement (Second) of Conflicts \u00a7 187(2)(b) (1971).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, choice-of-law and choice-of-forum provisions in international commercial contracts are \u201can almost indispensable precondition to achievement of the orderliness and predictability essential to any international business transaction,\u201d and should be enforced absent strong reasons to set them aside. <em>Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., </em>417 U.S. 506, 516-20, 94 S.Ct. 2449, 2455-57, 41 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974); <em>The Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., </em>407 U.S. 1, 92 S.Ct. 1907, 32 L.Ed. 513 (1972). We agree with the arbitrators that the general principle of conflicts Northrop cites is not sufficient standing alone to overcome the strong policy consideration announced in <em>Scherk </em>and <em>Bremen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-9\">Northrop argues the courts should not enforce the Marketing Agreement because to do so would be contrary to public policy. As noted earlier, this is a question for the courts alone to decide. <em>W.R. Grace, </em>461 U.S. at 766, 103 S.Ct. at 2183.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-10\">Northrop contends the central question upon which this appeal turns is one of public policy. Northrop argues \u201cthat California law, as a matter of public policy, prohibits enforcement of a contract where performance of the contact would be illegal under the law of a foreign state. This rule is codified in California Civil Code \u00a7 1511 ____\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-11\">Section 1511 appears in California\u2019s codification of the law of contracts, under the heading \u201cExtinction of Obligations.\u201d Cal.Civ.Code \u00a7 1511 (West 1982). We do not regard section 1511 as a declaration that it is the public policy of the state of California that contracts unenforceable under the laws of any other jurisdiction shall not be enforced in California. Section 1511 is a codification of a rule of purely private law embodying a common-law de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>fense in an action between contracting parties for breach. If the statutory codification of such rules of contract law were regarded as converting them into principles of public policy cognizable only in courts, the capacity of arbitrators to resolve contract disputes would be seriously diminished.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>\u00a7 187. Law of the State Chosen by the Parties (2) The law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and duties will be applied ... unless ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-14\">(b) application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>Northrop\u2019s argument that the courts should decline to enforce the Marketing Agreement because it conflicts with the public policy Saudi Arabia announced in Decree No. 1275 flies in the face of the parties\u2019 agreement that the law of California, and not Saudi Arabia, would determine the validity and construction of the contract. Northrop has cited no California regulation, statute, or court decision demonstrating that enforcement of a contract to pay commissions to a marketing representative is contrary to the public policy of California, whether such commissions are illegal under the law of a foreign state or are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">Northrop\u2019s most substantial argument is that the public policy reflected in Decree No. 1275 was also the policy of the United States Department of Defense. In its opinion the district court said \u201cit is clear [the Department of Defense] wished to conform its policy precisely to that announced by Saudi Arabia.\u201d The court concluded that the Department\u2019s \u201cenforcement of Saudi policy was coercive rather than voluntary, and is properly characterized as U.S. public policy.\u201d 593 F.Supp. at 936 n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-7\">To justify refusal to enforce an arbitration award on grounds of public policy, the policy \u201cmust be well defined and dominant.\u201d <em>W.R. Grace, </em>461 U.S. at 766, 103 S.Ct. at 2183. The Saudi Arabian policy the Department of Defense arguably adopted was neither. It is clear the Department wished to accommodate Saudi Arabian interests and sensibilities. It is also clear, however, that the Department was interested in encouraging sales to Saudi Arabia of American manufactured military equipment, and considered the efforts of Triad critical to that end. It is not clear from the evidence before the arbitrators and the district court what policy the Department of Defense adopted in pursuit of these sometimes inconsistent goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-9\">Northrop calls attention to evidence indicating Saudia Arabia and the Department of Defense adopted a policy of prohibiting payment of commissions whether or not ultimately charged to the Saudi Arabian government. Triad argues from evidence indicating both Decree No. 1275 and Department of Defense policy were aimed at prohibiting commissions that added to the cost of Saudi procurement, and that in any event the Department of Defense was unable to determine the Decree\u2019s exact application, even assuming the Department wished to mirror its policy. The district court resolved the conflict in Northrop\u2019s favor, 593 F.Supp. at 936 n. 13, 937-38, but even if we were to agree, we could not say on this record the policy the Department adopted was \u201cwell defined and dominant.\u201d The district court\u2019s refusal to enforce the arbitrators\u2019 decision on the ground that it conflicted with the policy of the Department of Defense was, therefore, unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-10\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1352-14\">. That Decree provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-15\"><em>First: </em>No company under contract with the Saudi Arabian government for the supply of arms or related equipment shall pay any amount as commission to any middleman, sales agent, representative or broker irrespective of their nationality, and whether the contract was concluded directly between the Saudi Arabian government and the company or through another state. Any commission arrangement already concluded by any of these companies with any other party shall be considered void and not binding for the Saudi Arabian government;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-26\"><em>Second: </em>If any of the foreign companies described in Article I (one) were found to have been under obligation for the payment of commission, payment of such commission shall be suspended after notifying the concerned companies of this decision. Relevant commissions shall be deducted from the total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>amount of the contract for the account of the Saudi Arabian government.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1353-10\">. Northrop did not appeal the district court\u2019s holding that the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78dd-l, did not apply retroactively to Triad\u2019s pre-Act conduct. 593 F.Supp. at 940-41. Nor did Northrop appeal the district court\u2019s holding that the dispute was arbitrable. <em>Id. </em>at 934-36.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1353-11\">. Paragraph 13 of the Marketing Agreement states in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-12\">The validity and construction of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California in the United States of America. Triad agrees not to institute any litigation or proceedings against Northrop outside the continental United States. Any controversy or claim between the parties hereto arising out of or in connection with this Agreement which might be the subject of any action at law or suit in equity shall be settled by arbitration in the City of Los Angeles, State of California, in the United States of America, under the rules then obtaining of the American Arbitration Association. The award of a majority of the arbitrators, including the apportionment of the expenses of the arbitration, shall be final and binding upon the parties, and judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1353-17\">. The arbitrators noted that if paragraph 13\u2019s choice of California law were to be read as including California\u2019s conflict-of-law rules, the effect would be to inject \"the laws of various other countries into the resolution of these disputes, thereby causing the uncertainty and lack of uniformity which the parties sought to avoid.\" First Arbitrators\u2019 Opinion at 21. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 186 comment b, 187(3) &amp; comment h.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1355-6\">.
