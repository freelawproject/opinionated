The defendant asked the judge to rule, and instruct the jury, that sales made by the defendant on Labor Day would not be punishable under the complaint, and that the defendant, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>an innholder holding the said license, had a legal right to sell intoxicating liquors on that day to any persons to whom he would have a right to sell on any week day or secular day, and that the statutes prohibiting such sales by common victuallers did not apply to innholders.

By the St. of 1887, c. 263, the first Monday in September, commonly known as Labor Day, was made a legal holiday <em>\u201c </em>to all intents and purposes.\u201d The St. of 1888, c. 254, \u00a7 1, prohibited sales made of intoxicating liquors by common victuallers under a penalty on certain specified holidays (not enumerating Labor Day). Section 2 of the same act prohibited, under a penalty, sales by innholders having a license on \u201c either of the days named \u201d in \u00a7 1, except to <em>bona fide </em>guests or travellers sojourning at the inn. The St. of 1889, c. 347, added after the the word \u201c Memorial Day,\u201d in \u00a7 1 of chapter 254 of the St. of 1888, the words \u201c Labor Day,\u201d and directed that such section should thereafter read with these words inserted, and thus made it one of the days which came within the provisions of \u00a7 1 of the act of 1888.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">The ruling of the court was that the defendant, who was a licensed innholder, could sell on Labor Day \u201c only to <em>bona fide </em>guests or travellers sojourning at his inn.\u201d It is the contention of the defendant that the prohibition on innholders forbidding sales by them \u201c on either of the days named \u201d in the St. of 1888, c. 254, \u00a7 1, is not extended to holidays which were subsequently inserted in that section. This contention is, in our view, erroneous. The statute of 1888 assumed to deal with sales of intoxicating liquors on holidays by two classes of licensed persons, victuallers and innholders, enumerating in \u00a7 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>which concerned the victuallers, the holidays to which the statute was applicable, and referring to this enumeration in \u00a7 2, which related to the innkeepers. Section 1 having been amended by including a day not within the original enumeration, and by directing that the section should thereafter be thus read, the reference of \u00a7 2 must be held to extend to \u00a7 1, as the same is thus amended. Such was the ruling of the court. <em>Parkman </em>v.
