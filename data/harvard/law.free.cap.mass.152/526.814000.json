Gaskill trustee of a fund created by the will of John Green. Hearing before Holmes, J., who, at the request of the appellants, reported the case for the consideration of the full court, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-12\">Meltiah B. Green received the fund in question, which was bequeathed to him for life by John Green, and has now died leaving no children. His widow, Mary S. Green, who survives him and is entitled to the income of the fund for her life, requests and desires the appointment of Mr. Gaskill. The appointment is opposed by the appellants, who are persons entitled to half of the fund after her death; she is now seventy-nine years old. Mr. Gas-kill has been her counsel in some matters distinct from the present, but is not. acting for her in this case, and is not in any way personally prejudiced as between her and the appellants. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>only ground of opposition requiring consideration was based on the fact that Mrs. Green is the executrix of her husband\u2019s will, and that Mr. Gaskill is a surety on her bond as such executrix, with another solvent person, for $10,000; and that, if her husband should be found to be chargeable in any way to the trust fund, the estate in her hands would be chargeable. Her husband left all his property, amounting to much more than the trust fund, to her, and his estate owes no debts. The trust fund exists <em>in </em>specie, and the securities in which it is invested have not declined through his fault, but, on the contrary, so far as appears, have risen in value, and there is no doubt that the fund is ready to be turned over. The only specific ground on which it was suggested that the husband\u2019s estate might be chargeable was that there was received by him from the estate of John Green, and receipted for in a lump sum with the capital, but on a distinct understanding and statement that it was received as interest, the sum of $8,244.35, being accrued interest on the fund since the death of John Green. This the appellants claim should be accounted for by the husband\u2019s estate as added to the principal under the terms of the will of John Green, because it was not actually expended or applied by the husband in his lifetime. There seems to be no ground for the claim, or ground to doubt that Mr. Gaskill will do whatever is required by impartial dealing between the parties concerned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-5\">The judge refused to rule that the foregoing facts necessarily and as matter of law made Mr. Gaskill incompetent, and found that he is a proper person to be appointed, and ought to be appointed ; and ordered the decree of the Probate Court to be affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-6\">If the refusal to rule as requested was correct, the decree of the Probate Court was to be affirmed; otherwise, such decree was to be made as to the court might seem proper.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b545-7\"><em>W.
