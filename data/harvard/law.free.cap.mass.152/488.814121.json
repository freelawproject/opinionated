The defendant, who was a witness in his own behalf, explained that he put his hand into the pockets of Delano while attempting to get a bottle of liquor which Delano 'had on his person. The defendant was then asked if he testified to this attempt of his to get the bottle at his examination in the district court the day after the occurrence, and he answered that he did not recollect whether he did or not. Two police officers, who testified that they heard the defendant\u2019s testimony at such examination, were permitted to add, against the defendant\u2019s objection, that they did not at that time hear him say anything about attempting to take a bottle out of Delano\u2019s pocket.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-10\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b506-11\"><em>J.
