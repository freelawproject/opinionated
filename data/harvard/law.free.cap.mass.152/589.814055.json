The demandants, who were certain of the heirs at law of Moore, contended that he was not of sufficient mental capacity to execute the deed, and introduced evidence tending to show that his mind was impaired, and that at times he did not understand what he was doing. Doctor Brown, called as a witness by the demandants, and admitted to be an expert on the subject of insanity, was asked, upon a hypothetical case based upon the evidence respecting Moore\u2019s mental condition, \u201c Would such a man, in your judgment, Doctor, have the usual and ordinary capacity for the transaction of the business of life ? \u201d This question, against the tenant\u2019s objection, was allowed to be answered, and the witness replied, \u201c I should think not.\u201d The demandants then asked the same witness the following question: e\u2018 Would you consider, in the case I have cited, that that man during the last year or two of his life could have any days or hours when he had the usual and ordinary capacity for doing business ? \u201d This question was also allowed to be answered, against the tenant\u2019s objection, and the witness replied, \u201c I should say not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>The jury returned a verdict for the demandants; and the tenant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b608-3\"><em>8.

The competency of the witness as an expert is not in dispute, and no objection is made to the form of the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The witness was called upon to give his opinion as to the mental condition of Moore in regard to his capacity for the transaction of business, and this involved merely his judgment as an expert upon matters within his field of investigation. The standard which he was asked to use in expressing his opinion was \u201c the usual and ordinary capacity for doing business.\u201d This was a standard familiar to everybody, and none could have been chosen more likely to be well understood both by the witness and the jury. In describing Moore\u2019s mental condition in this particular, some form of words was necessary to convey the meaning of the witness, and if none had been suggested by the question, he would have been obliged to select some standard, supposed to be familiar, with which to compare it. If he had chosen the simplest words of description, like \u201c good \u201d or \u201c bad,\u201d the inquiry would have come in the last analysis, What is meant by \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d? Such a term would have been less likely to be definitely understood than the expression contained in the question, and we see nothing objectionable in the method adopted to make the answer intelligible.'</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The inquiry did not involve any question of law for the consideration of the witness, nor did it require him directly to express an opinion as to the capacity of Moore to do the specific act in controversy, and thus to put himself in the place of the jury. Any expression of opinion which will aid a jury in such a case necessarily involves the consideration of questions which are similar to that in issue, and sometimes of those which include it. But that alone does not render the evidence incompetent, if the witness is not permitted to express opinions upon evidence, and if the questions are so framed as to confine him to a statement of his conclusions as an expert, and not to submit to him the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>precise issue which is presented to the jury. Indeed, we are not prepared to say, if everything else is eliminated except that upon which the witness is competent to give an opinion, that a question becomes incompetent merely because it calls for an answer to the remaining part of the question to be answered by the jury.
