At the hearing in the Superior Court, before Mason, J., there was evidence in support of the averments of the libel, and no misconduct was shown on the part of the libellant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ar\">The libellant asked the judge to rule: \u201c If the court find that the libellee has committed bigamy or adultery, it follows, as a legal consequence, that she ought not to have the care and training of the libellant\u2019s sons, unless the court finds that the libellant is not a suitable person to have such care and custody; also, that, in the absence of misconduct on the part of the libellant, it is not within the discretion of the court to give the custody of his children to the libellee, if she has deliberately committed bigamy or adultery.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-12\">The judge granted a divorce <em>nisi </em>to the libellant, but declined so to rule, or to give him the custody of the two sons; and ordered that during their tender years, and until the further order of the court, they should remain in the custody of the libellee, and be supported by her, but should not be removed beyond the jurisdiction of the court; and that the libellant should have an opportunity to see them with reasonable frequency. The libellant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b34-13\"><em>0.

We see no error of law in the exceptions. Whether the justice who tried the libel, in view of all the facts appearing at the trial, exercised a sound discretion is a question not before us.
