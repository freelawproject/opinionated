The first count of the declaration was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-10\">\u201c The plaintiffs say that the defendant, on divers days and times, forcibly entered the plaintiffs\u2019 close, being premises now numbered 25 Shavings Street, in said Boston, and more fully described in deed of Daniel Hill to James W. Leatherbee, dated August 15, 1823, and recorded in Suffolk Registry of Deeds, Lib. 285, fol. 117, and tore down, demolished, took, and carried away a wooden stable belonging to the plaintiffs, and standing thereon, and converted the same to his use.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-11\">The answer contained a general denial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-12\">At the trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before Bishop, J., the defendant asked the judge to rule that upon this declaration the action could not be maintained, for the reason that the place of the alleged trespass was not sufficiently designated by name, abuttals, or other proper description. The judge refused so to rule, and found for the plaintiffs; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b550-13\"><em>J. A.

Sts. c. 167, \u00a7 61; but at the trial he asked the court to rule that the place was not sufficiently described in the declaration, and this the court refused to do. We cannot say that the defendant was entitled to this ruling as matter of law.
