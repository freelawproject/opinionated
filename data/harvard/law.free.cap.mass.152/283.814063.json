Dunbar, J. overruled the motion; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-9\">At the trial, certain police officers of the city of Worcester testified on behalf of the government, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-10\">The rooms of the Pelican Club were in a building numbered 98 Front Street, in that city. On the afternoon of August 2, 1890, the officers knocked at the door of the front room, and the defendant admitted them. The room was fifteen by eighteen feet, and contained five or six small tables, eighteen chairs, a small writing-desk, a few pictures on the walls, a piano, and four books. There were seven men sitting at tables, four or five of them drinking beer. There was no beer in the rooms except what the men were drinking. In the rear of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>room was a small room with a large refrigerator, six feet high by-four feet broad, with nothing in it but ice. On another side of the room were twenty-five small closets, or lockers, about fifteen inches deep, the doors of which were twelve or fourteen inches square. There were a sideboard and a table on which were twenty tumblers, twenty-four beer glasses, twelve small whiskey glasses, a sugar-bowl with sugar shaker, lemons, corkscrew, and under the table were a large tub to wash glasses in, and two pails, one partially filled with water, and in it some lemon peel and slices of lemon. The defendant was asked who had charge of the place, but made no reply. Upon being asked a second time, he replied that he did not know as he ought to tell. The defendant was then asked, \u201cDo you run it?\u201d and he answered, \u201c I suppose I do, I stay here.\u201d The defendant unlocked the drawers in the sideboard in which were the keys for the lockers; one key unlocked several lockers, and a few opened all the lockers. A few had something in them; none had anything except liquor; there were whiskey, gin, beer, and empty bottles. Many of the lockers had nothing in them. One Cronin, who was present at the time, had been seen by one of the officers <em>ah </em>another club within half an hour.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-5\">On August 5,1890, the officers again visited the rooms ; Ryan was there and in charge. They found in the back room two lai-ge sugar barrels, containing three or four hundred empty lager beer bottles, near the door; also beer and whiskey in the refrigerator; the beer was in bottles, and there were names on the bottles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-6\">On August 8, 1890, the rooms were again visited, and the defendant was there and a large number of people. The defendant met the officers at the door, and tried to hold it. There were two barrels of lager beer bottles, one full of empty bottles, the other with fifteen or twenty empty bottles, and the others full of beer. Six men were in the rooms drinking, with lager beer in glasses in front of them, and only one of them had a bottle. One of them, named Holden, had a bottle in front of him marked Oonlin, who was not in the room. The defendant was seen to take the bottles and glasses away, and put empty bottles into a barrel. In the refrigerator were forty bottles of lager beer. During the evening of the same day, ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>men were found sitting at the table; one barrel of empty bottles was gone, and the other then had about one hundred bottles in it. There were about ninety bottles of lager beer then on ice. The officer who arrested the defendant at the rooms found him in a room with thirteen men besides himself sitting at tables, and rapped four different times at the door before he got in. When told that the officer had come to arrest him, the defendant said, \u201c I cannot go, \u2014 I am running this place, and I can\u2019t let these men stay,\u2014if I go, the men will help themselves to the liquor.\u201d He then turned down the gas, ordered the men to leave, put on his coat and hat, and came out. He locked the door, on which were two locks, one of them a spring lock, and put the key in his pocket.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-5\">The certificate of membership of the club which was introduced in evidence was dated June 25, 1890, and showed that the Pelican Social Club was duly incorporated under the Pub. Sts. c. 115, \u00a7 2. The defendant testified that he went to work for the Pelican Social Club about four weeks before; that he was hired by the treasurer of the club, and was to receive nine dollars a week; that each locker had upon it the name of a member of the club; that, if a member wished to obtain liquor, he wrote an order directed to a wholesale liquor dealer in East Brookfield to deliver to such member at the rooms of the Pelican Social Club the liquor ordered; that the liquors were sent by express to the rooms of the club; that he put the liquors into the lockers, that is, each man\u2019s goods into his own locker, or into the refrigerator; that when the member came to the rooms and asked for his liquor, either he brought it and put it on a table, or the member went himself to his own locker and took it out; that he received no money for the liquors; that he never took one man\u2019s liquors from a locker and gave them to another man ; that the only money he handled he received from the sale of cigars, and passed it over to the treasurer\u2019; that the lemons and sugar were the property of the club, and paid for by the club; that all the property in the rooms of the club belonged to it, and he had no interest in it; that he was not a member of the club, but was hired merely as steward of the club; that the members of the club paid the treasurer for liquors,' who settled with the wholesale dealer; and that the dealer labelled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>all the liquors sent by him. The president of the Pelican Social Club testified that it numbered one hundred and thirty-five or one hundred and forty members.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-5\">The defendant asked the judge to rule that the evidence would not warrant a verdict of guilty on the second count. The court refused so to rule, and directed a verdict of not guilty on the first count, by reason of a variance. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the second count; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b305-6\"><em>J. Eophins J. E. </em>Sullivan, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b305-7\"><em>A. J. </em>Waterman, Attorney General, <em>H. A. </em>Wyman, Second Assistant Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b305-8\">Knowlton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-x\">For the reasons stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Jacobs, <em>ante, </em>276, the motion to quash was rightly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">There was evidence from which the jury might have inferred that the organization of a club, the construction of lockers, and the marking of names on bottles was a mere device to cover the unlicensed sale of intoxicating liquors. The evidence that a large quantity of lager beer, of bottles, and of liquors was found there at different times, together with the utensils, fixtures, and other articles which are commonly used in bar-rooms, that Holden was drinking from a bottle marked with the name of Conlin when Conlin was not present, that the keys for the lockers were in a drawer in the defendant\u2019s control, and that a few of the keys opened all the lockers, that many men were found drinking there, that Cronin, who was there, had been seen at another club within half an hour, that the defendant tried to hold the door on one occasion when the officers came there, and at first made evasive answers to the question who had charge of the place, that at another time he said to an officer, \u201c I cannot go, \u2014 I am running this place, and I can\u2019t let these men stay,\u2014 if I go, the men will help themselves to the liquor,\u201d \u2014 and that he then turned down the gas, ordered the men to leave, came out, locked the door, and put the key in his pocket, \u2014 was all to be considered with other matters in connection with the defendant\u2019s testimony in determining whether his statement should be believed. The court could not say, as matter of law, that there was no evidence to warrant a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
