The defendant offered to prove that he did not know that the hop beer contained the prohibited quantity of\u00b0 alcohol, or that it was spirituous or intoxicating liquor, and believed that it was not, and did not have any information leading him to believe that it was.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1P\">If the beer was an intoxicating liquor, the sale of it by the defendant was illegal, whether he did or did not know it to be intoxicating, and the tenement used for the illegal sale of it was declared by the statute to be a common nuisance. The fact that the defendant did not know that the beer was an intoxicating liquor, within the definition of the statute, would not prevent the place used for its illegal sale from being a nuisance, nor relieve the defendant from the penalty prescribed for keeping such nuisance. If the defendant kept the place and used it for the sale of intoxicating beer, the facts that he did not know that the beer contained such a proportion of alcohol as rendered its sale illegal, and that he believed that it was not intoxicating, were immaterial, and would not constitute a defence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v.
