Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Barker, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-12\">The plaintiffs, who composed a firm of granite-cutters, agreed in writing to construct the monument in question for the defendant ; and a warranty was embodied in the agreement, that the work should be free from all imperfections. The defendant contended, and offered evidence to show, that the monument was cracked in several places, and that some of the cracks had been craftily and fraudulently mended or concealed by a process which was described, and sought to recoup the damages which he had suffered by reason of the monument not corresponding to the warranty. The plaintiff Feri\u2019ari testified that he had never used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>or seen used, and had no knowledge of, the process so described for .concealing cracks in granite, and that to his knowledge it had never been used in their yard. To contradict this plaintiff, and to show his familiarity with the process by which, as the defendant contended, the cracks had been concealed, the defendant on cross-examination asked certain witnesses introduced by the plaintiffs, some of whom had worked upon the monument and all of them in the yard, whether they had ever seen any job of mending as above described done in the plaintiffs\u2019 yard, or under their direction. The judge excluded the questions, but ruled that the witnesses could be asked whether they had ever seen any cracks in the monument in question mended under Ferrari\u2019s observation or direction, or otherwise, by the process described.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-6\">The case was ai\u2019gued at the bar in March, 1890, and afterwards was submitted on the briefs to all the judges.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b515-7\"><em>S.

The question put by the defendant to the plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses on cross-examination, to show the plaintiff Ferrari\u2019s knowledge of a particular process described to him of mending and concealing cracks in granite, was immaterial. The plaintiffs\u2019 knowledge of a process by which cracks could be concealed had no tendency to prove that cracks existed, and, if cracks did exist, it was immaterial whether the plaintiffs did or did not know of them, or attempt to conceal them. A majority of the court are of opinion that the entry should be,</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
