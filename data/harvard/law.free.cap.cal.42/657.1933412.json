In March of the same year Pierce commenced an action to restrain Barbour from using the way. The two cases were tried together by the Court without a jury. In the first case the Court filed the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>\u201c 1. That in 1861 Alfred Alford was the owner and in possession of a tract of land in Solano County, including the strip or roadway in suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-6\">\u201c 2. That in said year plaintiff attempted to secure a private road over the premises of Alford, on the east side of the creek, to his (plaintiff\u2019s) premises, in pursuance of the law of this State, and took such steps as secured the appointment of viewers by the Supervisors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-7\">\u201c 3. That while the viewers were upon the ground, the project of opening a road where plaintiff wanted it\u2014to wit: on the east side of the creek\u2014was abandoned, for the reason that neighbors interfered, and a compromise (the terms of which do not clearly appear) was effected, and a road was agreed to be opened at the point in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-8\">4. That on the advice and at the suggestion of one of the viewers, Alford (who was the plaintiff\u2019s father-in-law) proffered to give him a roadway on the <em>west </em>bank of the creek\u2014to wit: the strip in suit; that plaintiff accepted the offer, and, with the consent and permission of Alford, entered into the enjoyment of said right and roadway, and built a bridge at the point where said roadway terminates at the main public road, and also some fencing along the line of the roadway, the bridge and fencing amounting in value to six hundred dollars. The said improvements were necessary to the enjoyment by plaintiff of his way, and do not appear to have been of any value to Alford, or any advantage to his property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-9\">\u201c5. That plaintiff continued to use and pass over said roadway, with the knowledge of Alford, and without objection, until 1869, when Alford sold and conveyed the premises, over which said roadway ran, to defendant, Pierce, who had no notice of the verbal arrangement between Alford and the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-10\">\u201c 6. That plaintiff, at various times while using said roadway, asked Alford to convey the same, and the strip of land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>covered thereby, to him by deed, and that Alford always declined and refused to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-6\">\u201c7. That defendant, Pierce, after his purchase, closed said roadway at the point where it intersected the main public road.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-7\">And as conclusions of law:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-8\">\u201c 1. That plaintiff took his interest in said roadway, and . used the same by the permission and with the consent of Alford; that his rights therein were acquired and held by license merely, and that plaintiff did not and could not acquire any rights by reason of such use, by prescription or otherwise, which he could enforce against Pierce.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-9\">\u201c 2. That whatever rights plaintiff had in said roadway were held at the will of Alford, and terminated with his conveyance to Pierce.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-10\">In the second case the Court found similar facts, and made the following additional findings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-11\">\u201c 4. That after Pierce purchased the premises, he caused the said roadway to be closed up, by fencing it at the point where it terminated in the main public road; that defendant removed said fence, which was replaced by plaintiff, and removed by defendant, repeatedly and continuously up to the time of the commencement of this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-12\">\u201c 5. That there was no other agreement between Alford and Barbour than as above set forth, and that Pierce had no notice of any right claimed by Barbour in the premises, aside from the fact that said road was used by Barbour in the manner found above.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-13\">As conclusions of Jaw, the Court finds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-14\">\u201c That the right of defendant to the use of said road rested in license from Landy Alford, and that said license terminated with the conveyance to plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>\u201c That no adverse claim or right was held by Barbour in or to said roadway as against Alford, and that he acquired no rights under said license by use, prescription, or otherwise.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-6\">Judgment was rendered against Barbour in each case and he appealed therefrom.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b660-7\"><em>M.

Pierce, therefore, is not bound by the arrangement, as such; and Barbour, in order to succeed in maintaining his claim to the right of way, must show a right based upon adverse possession\u2014or, as it is usually denominated, when applied to a way, prescription. That the right may become perfect by prescription, where the use began under a parol gift, is abundantly shown by the authorities cited by the appellant\u2019s counsel. The authorities also sustain the position that the user, which had its origin in license or permission, may by prescription ripen into a perfect title; but in such case the user must have been exercised for the period prescribed by the Statute of Limitations, <em>under a claim of right. </em>This qualification is of, course applicable also where the right has its origin in a parol gift or sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">It was found by the Court in the first case that Barbour, \u201c with the consent and permission of Alford, entered into the enjoyment of said right and roadway;\u201d and it is also stated, among the conclusions of law, that Barbour \u201c took his interest in said roadway, and used the same, by the permission and with the consent of Alford; that his rights therein were acquired and held by license merely; and that plaintiff did not and could not acquire any rights, by reason of such use, by prescription or otherwise, which he could enforce against defendant, Pierce.\u201d This latter, though found among the conclusions of law, is a fact, or perhaps more than one fact. Whether Barbour took or held his interest by grant, gift, or license, are questions of fact; and whether he acquired a right by prescription is also a question of fact. That the question of adverse possession or of prescription is a question of fact there can he no doubt. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>would not assist the appellant, Barbour, to leave that finding where the Judge of the Court below improperly placed it, for the Court neither found the prescription claimed by Barbour nor the elements going to compose it. The user is found; but it is not found that it was exercised under claim of right, or adversely to Alford.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">In the second case the findings are substantially the same as in the first, in the respects we have mentioned. Hot only has the Court not found for Barbour on the issue of prescription, but has found against him in this as in the first case, though here again the finding is improperly called a conclusion of law. In the first case, the finding that he took and held by license merely negatives the possibility of an adverse holding; and in the second case the finding is directly against the adverse claim, and right by prescription, on the part of Barbour. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the appellant, Barbour, is not entitled to judgment, in either case, on the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Judgment in each case affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Mr. Chief Justice Wallace did not express an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
