He also argued- that the verdict was so excessive as to justify the presumption that the jury were influenced by j passion and prejudice. <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>North Beach and Mission Railroad Company, </em>34 Cal. 594:) The verdict was, therefore, an abuse of discretion. l</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-7\"><em>Quint &amp; Hardy, </em>for Respondent, argued that exemplary damages are allowed under the statute, without any averment of malice or gross negligence. <em>{Oldfield </em>v. <em>N.Y. and H</em>. <em>R.

The language of the section is: \u201cIn every such action the jury may give such damages, pecuniary and exemplary, as they shall deem fair and just, and may take into consideration the pecuniary injury resulting from such death to the wife and next of kin of such deceased person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">The statute, then, having authorized the jury to give exemplary damages, when the death is caused by the simple negligence of defendant, the discretion of the jury in fixing the amount of such damages should not be interfered with by the Court, except in cases of most palpable abuse of such discretion. The statute supersedes the common law rule, and must control. Most of the States have statutes authorizing actions by personal representatives, or next of kin, of deceased persons against the person or corporation through whose simple or willful negligence the death was occasioned; but our statute, upon the matter of damages authorized, is essentially different, and less restricted than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>any cognate statute of other States, so far as I am at present advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">In Hew York and Connecticut the <em>maximum </em>of damages is limited to five thousand dollars, and in these States, as also in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, damages are required to be assessed with reference to the pecuniary injury. In Kentucky, by statute, if the death of a person, not an employ\u00e9, be caused by the negligence or carelessness of the proprietor or proprietors of any railroad, the personal representative of such deceased person is authorized to institute suit and recover damages in the same manner that the person himself might have done for any injury when death did not ensue, and under this statute the Supreme Court of Kentucky holds that exemplary damages may be recovered. <em>(Bowler </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>3 Met. R. 313.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The damages assessed by the jury in this case, under the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, are not, in my judgment, so excessive as to justify a presumption that the jury was misled, either by passion, prejudice, or ignorance; hence their verdict should not be disturbed on the ground of abuse of their discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
