Meld, insufficient to prove either actual or constructive possession in the plaintiff of the land sued for.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b149-12\">Deed of Possessory Claim does not Convey Constructive Possession.\u2014Where the vendor of a tract of land taken up under the Possessory Act (Stats. 1852, p. 158,) remained in possession, with vendee\u2019s consent, of the only portion ever actually occupied by him, and vendee never entered. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>under his deed; <em>held, </em>that whether such possession hy the vendor might be considered as an entry under his deed by the vendee or not, the deed would certainly not extend the vendee\u2019s possession by construction to any portion of the tract never in the actual possession of the vendor.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b150-6\">Appeal from the District Court of the Seventeenth Judicial District, Los Angeles County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-7\">Ejectment for eighty acres of land in Los Angeles County. There having been a judgment for defendants, and motion for new trial overruled, plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-8\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b150-9\"><em>A. </em>Brunson, for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-10\">The boundaries of the claim of Quijada, plaintiff\u2019s grantor, were well defined. They were marked by furrows and ditches, and that in a county where nine tenths of the crops are and for the last twenty years have been raised without fence' or inclosure. These facts are entitled to some significance, as they enter into the reason of the law, and for that reason become a part of the law itself. It was not necessary under the Possessory Act that Quijada should have the entire tract inclosed in order to have the legal possession of the whole, or to eject a naked intruder. (Hitt. Gen. Laws, Sec. 6,795; <em>Keane </em>v. <em>Cannovan, </em>21 Cal. 291; <em>Doran </em>v. <em>Central P. R. R. Co., </em>24 Cal. 248; <em>Moon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>36 Cal. 333.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-11\">A purchaser in good faith from a prior possessor in good faith can expel a mere naked trespasser from lands claimed by metes and bounds, whether inclosed or uninclosed, especially when the lines and exterior limits are all plainly marked on the soil and traced upon the public records of the county. Nor can we see that this principle, recognized as law by the authorities, has been overruled by <em>Wolfskill </em>v. <em>Malajowich, </em>39 Cal. 276.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b150-12\"><em>H. T. Hazard, </em>for Respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-13\">The deed from Quijada to plaintiff\" was void as to the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>in controversy. Quijada himself never had possession of it, and there is no pretense that plaintiff ever was on it. There was no constructive possession in the plaintiff. <em>(Cannon </em>v. <em>Union Lumber </em>Company, 38 Cal. 672.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-6\">The decision in <em>Wolfskill </em>v. <em>Malajowich, </em>39 Cal. 276, is a sufficient answer to the argument on the other side. It is there clearly held that an entry on part of a tract of land under a deed which the grantee knows conveys no title, will not establish constructive possession of the whole tract. In this case, therefore, even if the plaintiff had made tm entry, which he did not, it would not aid him.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b151-7\">By the Court, Temple, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Action of ejectment, in which the plaintiff relies upon the prior possession of his grantor. On the trial the plaintiff proved a claim and affidavit made by his grantor under the Act known as the Possessory Act, passed April 20th, 1852, for a tract of laud, including the tract in controversy. He also proved the occupation by his grantor of a portion of the land described in his possessory claim, but not of any portion of the land now in the possession of the defendants, except that the witness states that he had a fence on one side, and furrows were run with a plow around the whole tract, and stakes set at the corners and along the lines. This is manifestly insufficient to prove actual possession. After the conveyance to plaintiff, his grantor remained in possession, with plaintiff\u2019s consent, until he had removed his crops. Plaintiff never entered into possession of any portion of the premises under his deed. The possession of the vendor, after the deed was executed, was in accordance with the contract of sale. But if the continued possession of the vendor, with the consent of the plaintiff, can be considered as an entry under his deed on the part of the plaintiff, it does not appear that he had the actual possession of any portion sued for, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>and the deed, under such circumstances\u2014the lands being public lands, were never in the possession of the vendor\u2014 would not extend\u00edais possession by construction. <em>[Wolfskill </em>v. <em>Malajowich, </em>39 Cal. 276.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
