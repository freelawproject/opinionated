On December 17th, 1869, findings were filed and judgment ordered to be entered in favor of defendant Coleman. A few days afterwards, plaintiffs moved on the same findings for judgment the other way; and on December 29th, 1869, the former judgment was vacated and judgment for plaintiffs rendered. On July 9th, 1870, defendants\u2019 motion to vacate the latter judgment was vacated, and on July twelfth judgment for plaintiffs entered.

(See <em>Genela </em>v. <em>Relyea, </em>32 Cal. 159; <em>Casement </em>v. <em>Ringold, </em>28 Cal. 337; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>28 Cal. 416; <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>31 Cal. 207.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-10\">The order for judgment was made and entered on December 29th, 1869. The notice of appeal was dated March 29th, 1871.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-12\"><em>B. S. Brooks </em>and <em>William M. Pierson, </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-13\">The only ground for dismissing an appeal, under the statute, is \"the failure of the appellant to furnish the necessary papers. (Practice Act, Sec. 346.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-14\">The right to have a cause heard in the Supreme Court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>like the right to have the same cause heard in the District Court, constitutional, and cannot be taken away by a rule of Court, but only by the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-6\">The motion to dismiss an appeal is based upon an objection to any hearing of it. If the Court have to look into the transcript, then the case will come on in its regular order, and if the objection is well taken it will prevail, and the judgment will be affirmed. <em>(Ricketson </em>v. <em>Compton, </em>23 Cal. 636; <em>Day </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>2 Hill, 403; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Hisack, </em>5 Hill, 521; <em>Beecher </em>v. <em>Conrad, </em>11 How. Pr. 181.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b389-7\">By the Court, Wallace, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Findings were filed and judgment for the defendant <em>rendered </em>(though not recorded or entered in form by the Clerk) on the 17th day of December, 1869.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">On the 29th day of December, 1869, upon motion of plaintiff, this judgment was vacated and set aside, and judgment was rendered for the plaintiff (but not recorded or entered in form by the Clerk).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">On the 9th day of July, 1870, a motion made by the defendant to set aside the judgment rendered on the twenty-ninth of December, coming on to-be heard, was denied, and on July 12th, 1870, under the direction of the Court then given, judgment in favor of the plaintiff was formally recorded and entered against the defendant; and on March 27th, 1871, this appeal was taken from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">This judgment, as entered, was in pursuance of the order of December 29th, 1869; it recites that \u201c on motion of plaintiff\u2019s attorney, made in open Court, which motion was based upon the findings of the Court, now on file herein, and upon the order of this Court duly made and entered on the 29th day of December, 1869, it is now ordered, adjudged,\u201d etc. It was therefore but the entry in form of the judgment rendered on the 29th day of December, 1869, and was in effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>only a special direction to the Clerk to record in form the judgment which by the effect and operation of the order of December twenty-ninth he should have theretofore recorded in form.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The time limited for an appeal from the judgment, thus commenced to run from the 29th day of December, 1869, when the judgment was <em>rendered. </em>The appeal taken March 27th, 1871, was, therefore, too late, and the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss it must, for that reason, be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">But even if an appeal had been taken from the judgment within one year from the <em>rendition </em>(i. e., the order of December 29th, 1869), the supposed error of the order of that date could not have been reviewed upon such an appeal, for that order was one entered in the cause after the rendition of the judgment of December 17th, 1869, which it purported to set aside, and was itself, as being a Special order made after final judgment, the subject of a distinct appeal (Practice Act, Sec. 347), to be taken in sixty days after the making, of the order. Upon an appeal from a final judgment an order made in the cause which is itself, by statute, made the subject of a distinct appeal, cannot be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The appeal must be dismissed; and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Mr. Justice Temple did not participate in the foregoing decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
