The reason for the refusal was not stated. <em>Held, </em>that the exception must be overruled since it did not appear affirmatively in the bill that the judge had received or read the request, (which he was not bound to do since it was presented too late,) or that his attention had been called to the error in his charge.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b612-9\">A request for a ruling which is not applicable to the facts in evidence properly may be refused.

At the close of the evidence, and before the judge\u2019s charge, the plaintiff made the following requests for rulings: \u201c (1) Passengers on street cars are not required to expect that on turning a curve in the street that the car will be driven at a rapid rate, but on the contrary they may reasonably expect a careful driver to slacken the speed of the car. (2) Passengers have a right to believe that the car will be operated in view of the fact that some of the passengers may be standing in the car or on the platform.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>At the close of the charge, under the circumstances stated in the opinion, the plaintiff made the following further requests for rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-4\">\u201c (3) There is no evidence in the case that the plaintiff had rheumatism; the testimony as to what Mrs. Zamore said respecting rheumatism, if made, can only be considered to affect her credibility and not to prove the fact that the plaintiff had rheumatism. (4) It is not necessary for plaintiff to show that the rate of speed rounding the curve was unusual or extraordinary if it was moved at such a rate of speed round the curve as to make it likely to throw people off standing on the rear platform, in what the jury would consider a safe position. (5) The plaintiff was not bound to anticipate that the car might be run at an unusual rate of speed either before reaching the curve or while rounding it, even though the jury may find that he heard the conductor tell the motorman that they were three or four minutes late. (6) Passengers have a right to believe that the car will be operated in view of the fact that some of the passengers are or may be standing in the car or on the platform, provided such position was reasonably safe.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-5\">As stated in the opinion, the presiding judge refused to give \u201c any further instructions,\u201d there was a verdict for the defendant, and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b613-6\"><em>F. S. Elliot, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b613-7\"><em>W. H. Foster, (H. S.

He took his stand on the rear platform. Some six or seven hundred feet from the terminus there is a curve in Norfolk Street, with \u25a0a radius of about one hundred and seventy-five feet. As the car in question went around this curve, the plaintiff was thrown or fell into the street, and this action is brought to recover compensation for that injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">The evidence was conflicting as to the speed of the car as it entered on and went around this curve. There was evidence that the plaintiff was intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">A witness called by the defendant was allowed to testify that the plaintiff\u2019s sister in law told him immediately after the acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>dent that the plaintiff \u201chad been suffering from rheumatism, which accounted for his unsteadiness on his feet.\u201d This was admitted as a statement in contradiction of testimony previously given by the sister in law, one Mrs. Zamore, who had testified as a witness for the plaintiff, as affecting her credibility. In his charge to the jury the presiding judge said: \u201cAnd it is for you to say whether the fact of the combination, the drinking of this liquor, the fact of standing upon the rear platform, the fact that he was in a state of partial lameness by reason of any rheumatism he had suffered from, if you find there was any such fact, is a circumstance to be taken into consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Before the judge\u2019s charge, the plaintiff presented in writing two requests for rulings, referred to in the bill of exceptions as numbered one and two. After the charge was made, he presented four more requests, referred to in the bill of exceptions as numbered three to six. The statement of the bill of exceptions is: \u201c The court refused to give any further instructions.\u201d \u201c To the refusal of the court to give . . . numbers one to six, inclusive, the plaintiff duly excepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">There was no evidence in the case that the plaintiff had had rheumatism, and if the plaintiff had stated to the judge what is set forth in the first ruling presented after the charge (being ruling numbered three) and had excepted to that portion of the charge in which the judge assumed that there was such evidence, it would have been his duty to correct it; and, if not corrected, the exception would have had to be sustained. But the plaintiff did not do this, and the question is whether what he did shall be treated as its equivalent. The case differs from both <em>Brick </em>v. Bosworth, 162 Mass. 334, and <em>Quimby </em>v. <em>Jay, </em>196 Mass. 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In <em>Brick </em>v. Bosworth, 162 Mass. 334, as in the case at bar, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel on the conclusion of the charge presented certain rulings to the judge. It is stated in the exceptions in that case\u201dthat these rulings were prepared by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel during the delivery of the charge, \u201cbecause of matter in the charge and the omissions therein.\u201d It is not specified that this was stated to the judge. The judge declined to give any of the rulings. Thereupon the plaintiff excepted to \u201cthis refusal to rule as requested and the rulings of the court as made.\u201d It was held that these exceptions should be treated as exceptions to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>portions of the charge which were at variance with the rulings asked for.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">In <em>Quimby </em>v. <em>Jay, </em>196 Mass. 584, a point was taken for the first time by the plaintiff during the closing arguments of the defendant that a certain contention was not open under the pleadings, and rulings to that effect were then written out and handed to the judge. The judge \u201c declined to receive them on the ground that they were too late under Rule 48 of the Rules of 1900 [of the Superior Court].\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">In the case at bar the judge was not bound to receive requests for rulings when the rulings here in question were presented. But he was bound, as we have said, to correct errors in his charge. It does not affirmatively appear why he \u201crefused to give any further instructions.\u201d It may be that he thought that they were intended to be (what they purported to be) further instructions, and refused to give them because they were presented too late. In other words, on this bill of exceptions the plaintiff has not made it apparent that the judge accepted the last four requests for rulings although presented too late and then refused to give them because he thought that they were wrong. Under the general rule that the burden is on the plaintiff to show error (see for example <em>Devine </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>159 Mass. 348; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Jagoe, </em>172 Mass. 538) this burden was on him, and that burden has not been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">We are also of opinion that the plaintiff has not made it apparent that he brought the fact to the attention of the judge that he was complaining of that portion of the charge which is in fact dealt with in this ruling. Under the rule we have already referred to, the burden was on him to do so in his bill of exceptions, and that burden, in our opinion, he has not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">This disposes of all the rulings presented after the charge was at an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">There is nothing in the other exceptions argued. The first \u25a0ruling asked for was defective in leaving out the kind of curve which the curve in question was. With this correction the rul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>ing was given. The second ruling would be true if the car had been so crowded that the plaintiff had to stand on the platform, or if the motorman knew that he was on the platform, with the consent of the conductor. The evidence showed that the car was almost empty, and there is no evidence of the second fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\">The exception to the admission of evidence was waived at the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">\n<em>.Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b615-9\"> \u201c All requests for instructions shall be made in writing before the closing arguments unless special leave is given to present further requests \"later.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
