No payment shall be made unless the original pass book is produced, that such payment may be entered therein.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-12\">\u201c Whenever a deposit shall be made by any person as trustee for another, all or any of the amounts at any time standing to the credit of such account shall be payable to the person named as trustee.

She offered evidence tending to prove that Willie Foley was a person of intemperate habits; that he was a spendthrift and spent money lavishly; that the plaintiffs\u2019 testatrix was devoted to him and endeavored to look after him; that he was her nephew. It also appeared that Foley had been committed to the prison at Deer Island at different times for insignificant offenses, and that he was thirty-eight years old when he died, which was within four months after the death of the plaintiffs\u2019 testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-6\">The claimant also testified that the plaintiffs\u2019 testatrix had a box at the Union Safe Deposit Vaults, and that she, the claimant, repeatedly went with her to the vaults and while there saw the book representing the deposit in question, and that the testatrix had said as to the book, \u201c That is for Willie \u201d; that, in the presence of the witness, Foley had \u201c asked her [the plaintiffs\u2019 testatrix] for some of this money \u2014 that she could give it and he wanted it \u201d; that certain bonds owned by Foley were held by the plaintiffs\u2019 testatrix for at least ten years; that they were bonds that were left by one Mrs. Mackay for Foley, and that the plaintiffs\u2019 testatrix took care of them for him and, whenever he wished for the interest on them, he went to her \"and she paid him the interest; \u201c and many times when he would go away she would hate to give him the heavy interest that was acquired on the bonds, because she didn\u2019t know where he would go to, and then he would fuss and he would want the whole of the bonds, and . . . she gave his bonds directly to him afterwards to cease that contention between the two. She wanted to hold them to save everything from him\u201d; that, although she gave Foley the bonds, the witness thought that she did not give him all of the interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-7\">A sister of the claimant testified, subject to exceptions by the plaintiffs, that she had heard Foley say to her mother in the presence of the plaintiffs\u2019 testatrix, that the latter had money belonging to him and he could not get it, could not get ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>cents, and that at such times, in the presence of Foley, the plaintiffs\u2019 testatrix had remarked that Foley was a poor unfortunate and that he drank very heavily and had no one to look after him but her and the witness\u2019s mother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-5\">At the close of the evidence, the plaintiffs requested the judge to rule that the claimant was not entitled to the deposit, but that the plaintiffs were; but the requests were refused, there was a finding for the claimant, and the plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-6\">Other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-7\"><em>James J. </em>McCarthy, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-8\"><em>J.

But it is not for us, as has often been said, to pass upon the weight of the evidence. The finding of the judge who tried the case without a jury must stand if there was any evidence to support it. If we assume that there was no delivery of the bank book to Foley, then the question was whether there was evidence that Mrs. Cunning,ham, by her own conduct and declarations, had manifested a completed and executed intention to establish a trust in his favor, and whether this intention had been communicated to him and assented to by him, so that both parties understood that the trust was not simply inchoate and resting in an intention to be finally consummated in the future, but actually had been fully carried out so that the beneficial interest had become irrevocably vested in him. <em>Gerrish </em>v. <em>New Bedford Institution for Savings, </em>128 Mass. 159. <em>Alger </em>v. <em>North End Savings Bank, </em>146 Mass. 418. It was not enough that Mrs. Cunningham should have made her deposit formally in trust for Foley; it would not be enough even that she had communicated to others the fact of her attempted creation of a trust; it could not be said to have become a completed and executed transaction until it had been communicated to him, or at least to some one acting in trust for him and for his benefit, and accepted by him. <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Henshaw, </em>170 Mass. 409. <em>Kendrick </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>173 Mass. 305. <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Littlefield, </em>177 Mass. 294. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number><em>Bedford Institution for Savings, </em>192 Mass. 564. <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Gale, </em>194 Mass. 320. But admissions by an alleged donor that there has been an executed gift or a completed trust may of course be proved against her or her representatives, and may be found to include admissions that there has been either an actual delivery of the article or an effectual communication of the trust to the intended beneficiary and an acceptance of it by the latter. <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>Lawler, </em>190 Mass. 343. In that case the gift was sustained, not because the intention of the donor had been made known to others, but because from her admissions a finding was warranted that the gift had been communicated to the beneficiary and accepted by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Applying these principles to the case at bar, there was evidence to warrant a finding for the claimant. The donor\u2019s declarations that she had made provision for Foley, which, standing alone, could have been accounted for by the provisions of her will, might be found on the other evidence to have applied to this deposit. Mrs. Levins testified that Foley spoke to Mrs. Cunningham of \u201c that money she had on the book for him.\u201d Mrs. Cunningham\u2019s drafts upon the account might be found to have been for his benefit, either to pay fines for him or to put him directly in funds. And a reservation of the interest for her own benefit would not necessarily have been fatal to the gift of the principal. <em>Bone </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>195 Mass. 495, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Moreover, there was evidence on which it might have been found that at least a part of the money deposited belonged originally to Foley; and, if this fact were established, it would go far in the claimant\u2019s favor. <em>Hunnewell </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>11 Met. 163. <em>Farrelly </em>v. <em>Ladd, </em>10 Allen, 127. She had held bonds belonging to him; and, though she finally had turned these over to him, it might have been found that she had not fully accounted for the interest which she had previously collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Accordingly the plaintiffs\u2019 requests for rulings could not have been given, and the judge\u2019s finding for the claimant was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The evidence of Foley\u2019s declarations as to money which Mrs. Cunningham had belonging to him was competent both to show his acceptance of the gift and because (as we must now take it) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>found by the judge to have been made by him in good faith upon personal knowledge, under R. L. c. 175, \u00a7 66. <em>Chaput </em>v. <em>Haverhill, Georgetown &amp; Danvers Street </em>Railway, 194 Mass. 218. If the answer of the witness, as distinguished from the question, was objectionable, the plaintiffs\u2019 remedy was to move that this be stricken out.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The exception to the admission of evidence that the plaintiffs as executors did not account for this deposit has not been separately argued by the plaintiff. Though of slight probative value we cannot say that it was incompetent as an admission by the plaintiffs. They knew of this deposit; if it was not Foley\u2019s, it was their duty to account for it. In the absence of explanation, and they seem to have offered none, this conduct might be found to be inconsistent with their contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
