The auditor found that the plaintiff carried on business as the Commercial Stock Company, and had&lt;two offices in Boston, one on Tremont Street and the other on Congress Street, the two being connected by telephone, that the transactions described in the declaration took place in the Tremont Street office, which \u201c was fitted up with all the paraphernalia of a broker\u2019s office.\u201d The auditor\u2019s description of the method of dealings between the plaintiff and the defendant accorded with the method of dealings between a stockbroker and his customer, but he found that the buying and selling were wholly fictitious and understood to be so by both parties, and that the plaintiff \u201c was not a broker and did not undertake to act as such in these transactions.\u201d The judge refused to rule that there \u201c was nothing in the auditor\u2019s report to warrant the court in finding that the plaintiff acted as a broker in the sense of being employed by the defendant to make the transactions alleged in the declaration.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the inference drawn by the judge from the facts stated in the report, although contrary to the conclusion of the auditor, was warranted.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b254-10\">A broker cannot recover under R.

The statements in his report with regard to the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s business were in substance as follows: The plaintiff carried on business as the Commercial Stock Company. He had a place of business at 131 Tremont Street in Boston which \u201c was fitted up with all the paraphernalia of a broker\u2019s office,\u201d and was in charge of one Emerson, who acted as manager for the plaintiff, and a Mrs. Ida B. Crosby was employed there as a clerk. He also had an office at 24 Congress Street, which was connected by telephone with the Tremont Street office. When any orders were given at the Tremont Street office, they were transmitted by telephone to the Congress Street office and, if \u201c filled,\" slips were made out therefor at the Tremont Street office and given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>to the customer. \u201c The defendant asked me to find that the plaintiff was a stockbroker and acted as such- in these transactions ; but I find that he was not a broker and did not undertake to act as such in these transactions.\u201d .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-5\">The statements in the report with regard to the transactions described in the third count were as follows,: \u201c The transactions referred to in the third count were for the purchase and sale of various stocks where the defendant had put up a margin in each case. When these various contracts were closed, the plaintiff figured up the amount due on each in accordance with the account marked \u2018 B \u2019 annexed , to his declaration, and would be entitled to recover the same if these were actual transactions, or if they came within the statutes hereinafter referred to. I find that the plaintiff at the time of each transaction intended that there should be no actual purchase or sale, and that the defendant had reasonable cause \"to believe that such intention existed ; and I also find that in no case was any actual purchase or sale or valid contract therefor made between the parties; that neither party owned the securities at the time, and that all settlements were made without the completion of any purchase or sale.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-6\">Other findings of the auditor are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-7\">There was a trial before Sherman, J., without a jury. The only evidence was the auditor\u2019s report. The plaintiff requested rulings as follows: (1) As a matter of law, upon the facts found by the auditor, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. (2) The findings of the auditor bring the plaintiff\u2019s case as set forth in the third count of his declaration within R. L. c. 99, \u00a7 4. (3) The findings of the auditor bring the plaintiff\u2019s case as set forth in the third count of his declaration within R. L. c. 99, \u00a7 4, cl. 1. (4) There is nothing in the auditor\u2019s report to warrant the court in finding that the plaintiff acted as a broker in the sense of being employed by the defendant to make the transactions alleged in the third count of his declaration. The presiding judge refused to rule as requested and found for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-9\"><em>F. H.

The auditor having come to no final decision in favor of either party, but only having found and reported the facts, it was competent for the, judge to draw such inferences from the statements in the report as they fairly would warrant, even if contrary to some of the auditor\u2019s conclusions. <em>Wirth </em>v. <em>Kuehn, </em>191 Mass. 51, 53, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">By a waiver of the first and second counts, the case was tried upon the third count, which alleged that the plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant whereby they mutually agreed that he was to buy and she was to sell certain shares of the capital stock of the corporations named in the report, with an account annexed for \u201c gains on trades,\u201d or the value of his services rendered in performance of the agreement. - But, even if the contract was as alleged, the auditor finds that the transactions referred to were for the purchase and sale of these shares upon margins; and, further, he states that the parties mutually intended that there should be no actual purchase and sale of the stocks, but only an adjustment of the account by a settlement of differences between the price at which the stocks could have been bought when the order to buy was given, and the price at which the stocks were selling when the speculation was ordered closed. The judge well might find from the recitals in the report that throughout the plaintiff dealt as a stockbroker with the defendant as a customer, and that, as no stocks were actually bought or sold, the transaction was purely fictitious. The buying and selling of values under such an agreement is founded upon the anticipated price for which each particular stock may in the future be sold in open market, and does not at any time contemplate the actual purchase or sale of stocks as such, or the buying and retaining of them for the purpose of receiving a possible increase in their market value. It is merely a species of gambling, or a wagering contract, alike prohibited at common law and by statute. <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>159 Mass. 344, 346. <em>Wakefield </em>v. <em>Farnum, </em>170 Mass. 422. <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>177 Mass. 382, 383. R. L. c. 99, \u00a7 4. The plaintiff having purposely entered into a contract which, being against public policy, was illegal and void, can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>not recover either the \u201c gains \u201d or a commission for his services, and his requests were rightly refused. <em>Harvey </em>v. Merrill, 150 Mass. 1,11.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
