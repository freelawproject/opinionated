The contract also provided that the word \u201c board,\u201d when used in the contract, meant the board of metropolitan sewerage commissioners, and that the word \u201cengineer\u201d meant \u201cthe chief engineer of the said board, acting either directly or through his properly authorized agents.\u201d The contractor and a surety executed a bond conditioned upon the performance of the contract. Work was begun under the contract in December, 1900. St. 1901, c. 168, which went into effect on March 20, 1901, abolished the metropolitan water board (created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>under St. 1895, c. 488,) and the board of metropolitan sewerage commissioners, and transferred all their \u201c powers, duties and liabilities \u201d to a new board called the metropolitan water and sewerage board, and provided that \u201c no existing contracts . . . shall be effected hereby, but the [new] board . . . shall be the lawful successor of \u201d the old ones. In January, 1902, one B., as \u201c engineer sewerage works \u201d certified to the new board that the work specified in the contract \u201c had been unnecessarily delayed and abandoned,\u201d and recommended that it be completed by the board. The board acted on the suggestion, and, after the completion of the work and notice to and a demand upon the contractor, brought an action upon the bond against the contractor and the surety. At the trial of the action, the foregoing facts appeared, and there was evidence that B. had been chief engineer under the board of metropolitan sewerage commissioners, but that, after the consolidation of boards in 1901, one S. became chief engineer for the new board and B. \u201c was engineer to the metropolitan sewerage works \" and was in charge of the work on the section to which the contract referred, that he was not an authorized agent of S. and that S. had no connection with him or his department. The presiding judge directed a verdict for the Commonwealth and the defendants excepted. <em>Held, </em>that the exception should be sustained, and that the judge should have ruled that it was not proved that any person within the definition of \u201c engineer \u201d stated in the contract made the required certificate to the board as to a breach of the contract.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-3\">Contract upon a bond in the sum of $50,000, conditioned upon the performance by the defendant contracting company of its contract with the plaintiff described in the opinion.

That act created a board to be known as the metropolitan water and sewerage board. By \u00a7 5 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>that act the metropolitan water board (a board created by St. 1895, c. 488, to construct a metropolitan water supply) and the board of metropolitan sewerage commissioners were abolished, and \u201c all the powers, rights, duties and liabilities of \u201d the two boards which were abolished were transferred to the new board. This section ends with this provision: \u201c No existing contracts, liabilities or suits shall be affected hereby, but the board hereby created shall in all respects and for all purposes whatsoever be the lawful successor of said metropolitan water board and of said board of metropolitan sewerage commissioners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\">On January 16, 1902, one W. M. Brown, as \u201c Engineer Sewerage Works,\u201d certified that the work done under the contract here in question <em>\u201c </em>has been unnecessarily and unreasonably delayed and abandoned,\u201d and recommended \u201c that the work be taken and completed as provided in Article L.\u201d This certificate was addressed to the new board. Acting under it the new board undertook to complete the work at the expense of the Contracting Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">On the completion of the work by the new board, a demand was made by it on the Contracting Company for the payment of $178,355, as the excess paid by it for completing the work over and above the contract price. This demand was made on December 2, 19Q3, and on December 8, 1903, this action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The case was sent to an auditor. He found that $129,069. 73 was the amount of the excess, and reported that in this action on the bond the plaintiff was entitled to recover the penal sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The case came on for trial by a jury. Some of the rulings asked for by the defendant were refused and exceptions taken. The only question submitted to the jury was whether the notice required by Section L of the contract was sent to the defendant National Contracting Company on December 2, 1903. This was answered in the affirmative, and thereupon the presiding judge directed a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The thirteenth ruling.asked for ended with these words: \u201c Nor is it proved that any person within the definition of engineer did certify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The auditor in his report found: \u201c After its organization the new board appointed Wm. M. Brown who was and for ten years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>had been the chief engineer of the old board, its engineer of the sewerage works under its charge, and he so continued and still is such engineer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\">At the trial Brown was called as a witness by the defendants and testified \u201c that in December, 1900, he was chief engineer of the metropolitan sewerage commissioners, that he ceased to hold said position when that board ceased to exist, that that board was succeeded by a consolidated board and that Frederick P. Stearns was the chief engineer of the consolidated board and had held that office since the consolidation, and that he (Brown) was not an authorized agent of Stearns; that at the time of trial he was engineer to the metropolitan sewerage works and that he had charge of the work on section 73<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and of the sewerage work during the construction of that section and that Stearns had no connection with him or his department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">The main question argued at the bar was the effect under the Constitution of the United States of the attempt made by St. 1901, c. 168, to transfer to the new consolidated board the powers given by section L of the contract to the board of metres politan sewerage commissioners abolished by that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The strength of the argument for the Commonwealth was that the board, in completing the contract under section L on a certificate that the work was unnecessarily and unreasonably delayed, acted for the Commonwealth as one of the parties to the contract, and that the chief engineer in giving his certificate was the person and the only person who was to act as a <em>quasi </em>arbitrator within the rule applied to this contract in <em>National Contracting Co. </em>v. Commonwealth, 183 Mass. 89, and established by the earlier cases of <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>106 Mass. 373; <em>Flint </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>106 Mass. 391; <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>129 Mass. 145. See also the later cases of <em>Norcross </em>v. <em>Wyman, </em>187 Mass. 25; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Brotherhood Accident Co. </em>194 Mass. 1, 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">But, if that be true, the difficulty with the case is that the engineer who gave the certificate of delay in the case at bar as a <em>quasi </em>arbitrator was not the engineer described in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">By the terms of section L of the contract (construed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>light of the definitions stated above given in the beginning of it) the engineer who was to act as <em>quasi </em>arbitrator was \u201cthe chief engineer of the said board acting either directly or through his properly authorized agents.\u201d After the consolidation of the two boards, Stearns was the chief engineer of the board, and Brown was not acting under him in any capacity, but was made an independent engineer of the sewerage works under the charge of the new board. The new board had a right, so far as the plaintiff was concerned, to put the sewerage works under an independent engineer, not their chief engineer and not subject to the orders of their chief engineer. But, when they elected to do that, they deprived themselves of the rights given by section L of the contract so far as their rights depended on a certificate by the engineer therein specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">It follows that the concluding part of the thirteenth ruling asked for should have been given and the exception to the refusal to give it and that to the ruling directing a verdict for the Commonwealth on the answer made by the jury must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\"> This was the section to which the contract in question referred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
