There was an account annexed to the declaration containing one hundred and seventy-five items. The plaintiff called the defendant\u2019s wife as a witness, she was handed the account annexed and was asked to examine it and state the articles that were delivered to the defendant by the plaintiff. The defendant objected, but the judge permitted the question to be answered, and the defendant excepted. It did not appear from the record what the answer was.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-13\">The plaintiff also called the defendant as a witness and he, having stated that he had received from the plaintiff statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>containing the items alleged by the plaintiff to have been delivered to him, that he had received a notice from the plaintiff requesting him to produce them at the trial and that he had them with him, was asked to produce them. No subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>directing the production of the statements had been served upon him, and his counsel refused to produce the writings and contended that therefore the plaintiff must resort to secondary evidence to prove their contents. The judge ruled that the defendant must produce the statements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-5\">The alleged agreement of the plaintiff with one Tirrell and the defendant, referred to in the opinion, was to the effect that the plaintiff was to supply the defendant with goods up to an amount owed to the defendant by Tirrell, and that Tirrell thereupon was to give the plaintiff credit on account of rent due to Tirrell from the plaintiff. The defendant testified that such an agreement was made; both the plaintiff and Tirrell denied it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-6\">There was evidence tending to show that the defendant had received from the plaintiff statements in writing containing the items of goods alleged to have been delivered to him by the plaintiff, that the plaintiff several times had demanded of the defendant payment of the amount shown as due by the statements and that the defendant never had contended that the goods had not been furnished, or that the bill was not just, and that he had promised to pay the claim. In the course of the trial the defendant\u2019s counsel said that there was no dispute that payment for the items was due from some one ; but such statement was made \u201c without any intention on his part to waive any objections to proof already taken.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-7\">The judge found for the plaintiff and found specially that no agreement between Tirrell, the plaintiff and the defendant ever was made; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b53-8\"><em>E.

As to the use made of the declaration and account annexed in the examination of the defendant\u2019s wife. It may be said in the first place that it does not appear what evidence the witness gave, and hence it is not shown that it was prejudicial to the defendant. But, however that may be, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>paper was not handed to the witness simply for the purpose of refreshing her recollection. There were one hundred and seventy-five items in the declaration. Counsel for the plaintiff might have read them one by one and asked a question as to each, or he might have read at a time a dozen, more or less, and asked the witness what she could say about them or any of them. Instead of that he was allowed to place the whole account before her, and, instead of framing a question as to each item, to ask her generally to answer as to each item without further question. This method of questioning a witness in such a case is not unusual, and it was within the discretion of the judge to permit it.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">2. As to the production of the statements. It is not contended by the defendant that they were not admissible, but he says that, upon his failure to produce them, the only thing the judge could do was to receive secondary evidence. We are of opinion however that, the defendant having taken the stand with the statements in court under his control, the judge at his discretion could either take secondary evidence or order the production of the papers. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Lannan, 13 Allen, 563. There was no need of a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>when both witness and documents were in the presence of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">3. The evidence as to whether the agreement between the plaintiff, Tirrell and the defendant ever was made was conflicting, and the finding that it was not made is warranted by the evidence. There was evidence also to support the general finding for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
