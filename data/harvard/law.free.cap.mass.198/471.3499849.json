Writ dated December 21, 1904.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-10\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Aiken, </em>C. J. The plaintiff at the time of the injury was in the employ of one Rand, a mason contractor, and was working on a building numbered 46 on the Fenway in Boston. The defendant was putting a tar and gravel roof on this building. The plaintiff was injured while using a hoisting tackle belonging to the defendant. The tackle consisted of a fall passing over a wheel, the wheel being suspended from a hook attached to a beam. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>The rope overhauled or ran up, so that a small hook on the end of the rope struck against the wheel, causing it to jump from the large hook and fall, knocking down the staging on which the plaintiff was standing. The hook from which the wheel jumped was not secured by lashing or \u201c mousing,\u201d and this omission was relied on by the plaintiff to show negligence on the part of the defendant. Shortly before the accident a derrick, constructed with a heavy beam nailed and braced and rigged with a double sheave, had been placed on the roof by the plaintiff and other workmen in the employ of Rand. There was evidence tending to show that this derrick was removed by the employees of the defendant with the knowledge of the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff was told by the foreman in charge of the gang who did this work that he might use the defendant\u2019s hoist in place of the one the defendant\u2019s employees removed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\">At the close of the evidence the Chief Justice ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-6\">The case was argued at the bar in December, 1907, before <em>Knowlton, </em>C. J., <em>Morton, Hammond, Braley, </em>&amp; <em>Rugg, </em>JJ., and afterwards was submitted on briefs to all the justices.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-7\"><em>R. Spring, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-8\"><em>C. S. Knowles, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b490-9\">Hammond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A10\">Under the circumstances we do not think the evidence would warrant a finding that there was any invitation to the plaintiff to use the derrick. The time had come to take down the heavy derrick which had been used by the employees of Rand, for whom the plaintiff was working. It was in the way of the roofers who were about to go to work. The derrick was a \u201c pretty simple appliance,\u201d \u201c a little roofer\u2019s derrick.\u201d The-plaintiff was not invited to use it. He was simply permitted to use it as it was. The absence of the \u201c mousing \u201d was easily seen, and the plaintiff took his risk of using it as it was. In the opinion of the majority of the court the defendant failed in no duty owed him as a licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
