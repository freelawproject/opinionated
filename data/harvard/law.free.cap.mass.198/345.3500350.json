L. c. 162, \u00a7 26, and may order a new trial of the issues in that court.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-14\">Two appeals from a decree of the Probate Court for the county of Suffolk allowing the will of George H. Ingalls. The cases were consolidated in this court, issues for a jury were framed and, by agreement of parties, the cases were sent to the Superior Court for trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-15\">There was a trial before <em>White, </em>J., and, the jury having answered the questions stated in the issues framed, he set aside the verdict and ordered a new trial on motions by the appellees; and the appellants appealed therefrom.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-16\"><em>J.

L. c. 162, \u00a7 25. It is plain, we think, that he had such right. The right of the presiding judge to set aside a verdict for good cause is as much an incident of the trial as the admission and exclusion of evidence, the ruling upon questions of law, or the settling and allowing of exceptions. Ho provision is made for a report of the evidence to this court with a view to the exercise by it of the power to set aside the verdict in such a case as this, and, unless the judge who presides at the trial has the right, aggrieved parties would be without a remedy. In <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>188 Mass. 16, 21, it was assumed that the judge of the Superior Court had the right to set aside the verdict if there was ground for it, and we see no reason to doubt the correctness of the assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
