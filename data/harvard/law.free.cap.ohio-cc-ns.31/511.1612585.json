S., 324; <em>State ex rel </em>v. <em>Liquor Board, </em>93 O. S., 375; <em>State ex rel </em>v. <em>Stryker, </em>95 O. S 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">(2) Section 4976 General Code, by reasonable construction recognizes the right of a candidate before the primary to withdraw, if such withdrawal is made and filed in proper time. <em>State ex rel </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>55 O. S., 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">(3) The withdrawal of relator\u2019s candidacy, in our judgment, took effect as of the date of the filing thereof with the board of deputy state supervisors, and being filed within proper time, required no further action by the election authorities to mak\u00e9 it effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-14\">(4) ' The statute does not expressly or by inference recognize a withdrawal of a withdrawal of candidacy. Consequently the law impos\u00e9s no duty upon such board of deputy state supervisors with respect thereto. Under the well established law governing proceedings in mandamus, such board can not therefore be compelled to act where the statute imposes no duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-15\">(5) Under the pleadings and undisputed evidence the relator is not entitled to relief and the judgment below should -be reversed, and final judgment.entered for plaintiffs in.error. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b520-16\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
