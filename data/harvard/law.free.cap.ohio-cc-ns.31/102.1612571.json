The averment that the former judgment was rendered by consent and without evidence of the nature and extent of the injuries is not of itself sufficient to require the vacation and opening up of the judgment, where the record shows affirmatively' that evidence was offered and where no fraud or unfairness in the rendition of the judgment is shown.</headnotes>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-12\"><em>A.

The petition for modification of the former judgment contains a full recital of the record in said former ease. From this record it appears that Isabel L. Cunningham, by her next friend, brought suit against the Cleveland Consolidated Bottling Works Company in the court of common pleas and on December 12th, 1906, recovered a judgment for the sum of $500 and costs. The judgment entry shows that the parties waived a jury and submitted the ease upon the pleadings and evidence. The plaintiff complains of the former judgment upon the grounds</p>\n<p id=\"b111-16\">(1) That the court erred in rendering said judgment for only $500 as that amount is grossly inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-17\">(2) That the court erred in that it heard no evidence in the ease other than the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-18\">(3) That the court erred in determining the ease without knowledge of the extent of plaintiff\u2019s injuries; and</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>(4) That the court erred in rendering judgment in favor of plaintiff for only $500 for the reason that the injuries are more serious than they appeared to be at the time said judgment was rendered and the damages could not have been reasonably anticipated, and were not anticipated or taken into consideration by said court in fixing the amount of said judgment, and the said injuries have since proven to be more serious and permanent than was anticipated; also that the plaintiff- is now in possession of newly discovered evidence to show that her injuries were much more serious than were or could have been anticipated by her physician at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Plaintiff relies upon Section 11631, G-. 0., which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">\u2018 \u2018 The common pleas court or the court of appeals may vacate or modify its own judgment after the term at which it was made * * -* (5) for erroneous proceedings against an infant, * * * when the condition of-such defendant does not appear in the record nor the error in the proceedings * * * (8) for errors in the judgment sought by an infant within twelve months after arriving at full age as prescribed in Section 11603.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Section 11603, provides:-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-10\">\u201cIt shall not be necessary to reserve in the judgment or order, the right of a minor to show cause against it after attaining the age of majority; but in any case in which, but for this section, such reservation would have been proper, within one year after his majority a minor may show cause against such judgment or order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">Section 11603 is found substantially in the same form in Section 386 of the Practice Code adopted March 11, 1853.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">In <em>Long </em>v. <em>Mulford, </em>17 O. S., 485, it was held that the remedy of an infant to open up or vacate a judgment against him in infancy was either by bill of review to review the record or by bill in equity to impeach the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">In the case of <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Kemper, </em>45 O. S., 93, it is held that the remedy of the infant under the 6th paragraph of Section 5354, R. S. (now 11631, G-. C.), was by a proceeding in the nature of a bill of review. It is further'held in that case, as in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the case of <em>Long </em>v. <em>Mulford, </em>that the infant was not confined to that remedy but might resort in a proper case to a bill in equity to impeach the judgment. In the case of <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>61 O. S., 96, a petition was filed in the court of common pleas of Crawford county to set aside a judgment of the probate court rendered during minority. The Supreme Court held that petition to be under the statute for a review of the regularity of the judgment, and not a bill in equity. We do not feel that we are called upon to determine whether the petition under consideration in the present case is one to review the regularity of the proceedings against the minor in the first ease or a bill in equity to impeach the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">We have considered the averments of the petition under both forms of procedure with the view of determining whether the facts are sufficient under either form of remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The Supreme Court was at first uncertain as to the scope of inquiry under a bill of review. In some instances the pleadings including the depositions were considered, but it was finally held in the case of <em>Helman </em>v. <em>Riddle, </em>8 O. S., 384, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">\u201cOn bill of review in such case the court can only examine such matters as appear upon the record; the testimony before the jury in regard to the validity of the will, being oral and forming no part of the files or record, can not be reviewed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">It is true that Section 11603, G-. C., was adopted subsequent to the decision in <em>Holman </em>v. <em>Riddle, </em>but the provisions of Section 11603, were held in the case of <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Kemper, supra, </em>to be a statutory substitute for the prior practice in courts of equity requiring such reservation to be entered in the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Paragraph 5, Section 11631, G-. C., provides for vacation or modification of a judgment against an infant where the fact of infancy does not appear in the record. In proceedings under this paragraph the fact of infancy may be shown upon the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">The theory of the law is that wh\u00e9re the disability does not appear in the pleadings, the infant does not have the protection which the law requires and the special consideration which the court is accustomed to give in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Where the disability appears in the pleadings and the infant is represented as provided by statute, there is a presumption in favor of the regularity of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">It is claimed in the petition in the present case that there was no evidence offered. The- record of the former case shows, however, that evidence was offered and considered by the court in the rendition of the judgment. We are bound by the recitals of this judgment so far as the petition in the present action may be considered as a bill of review. <em>Rankin </em>v. <em>Kemp, 21 </em>O. S., 651. <em>See Paulin </em>v. <em>Sparrow, </em>91 O. S., 279. The case of <em>Sawitske </em>v. <em>Peters Machine &amp; Manufacturing </em>Co., 29 O. C. A., 515, involved fraud and unfairness by the defendant in procuring the judgment against the minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Upon full consideration we are of opinion that so far as the petition in this case may be regarded as a bill of review or proceedings in error, it is not sufficient as there is no error appearing upon the face of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">We now come to the second phase, to-wit, is the petition sufficient as a bill in equity to impeach the judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">There is no showing of fraud, collusion or unfairness in the proceedings leading up to the original judgment. In fast the petition negatives this idea because it avers that the present-situation as to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries could not have been anticipated at the time of the original proceedings. There is no showing of collusion such as appeared in the case of <em>Long </em>v. <em>Mulford. </em>The next friend of plaintiff, who represented her in the original proceedings, is not claimed to have had any adverse interest or was otherwise disqualified to act in the capacity of next friend. We can not subscribe to the view expressed by counsel for plaintiff in error that the infant upon arriving at age had the rights of an adult who files a motion for a new trial within the statutory period. We think the infant is bound to show some equitable ground for the vacation of the original judgment. It will be noticed that Section <em>11603 </em>does not preserve to the infant the right to file a motion for a new trial. The reservation is to show cause against the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">In the ease of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Pomeroy, </em>31 O. S., 247, a judgment had been rendered against an insane person without the inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>vention of a trustee or guardian and in favor of one having knowledge of the insanity. It was held that such judgment was not void and \u2018 \u2018 can not be impeached by the guardian of the judgment debtor without showing some fraud or unfairness on the part of the creditor in obtaining the judgment.\u201d In the absence of such a showing we think the petition in this ease is not good as a bill in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">There is an averment in the petition of what is styled newly discovered evidence.. Taking all of the averments of the petition we do not consider that the petition contains a sufficient statement of newly discovered evidence to justify the infant in opening up the judgment upon that ground. The sum and substance of the claim in this particular is that there have been developments of the injuries not anticipated at the time of the proceedings and judgment. Almost every case involving personal injury has an element of uncertainty as to the future. The \u2019court or jury trying the case consider the testimony upon this subject and determine the possibilities. If the fact as to injury turns out to be less or more than the jury estimates, such facts could hardly be relied upon in later years to overthrow the judgment. If the courts were to so hold it would give a great advantage to the infant. If the verdict and judgment were greater than the actual damages the infant copld stand on the judgment and the other party would have no remedy, whereas if the verdict and judgment were less than the amount of damages as determined from the future then the infant would not be bound by the judgment but could open it up and recover the greater damages. This, we think, would be unfair to the opposite party and give the infant an advantage not contemplated by the law. Upon full consideration we are of opinion that the petition did not state a cause of action and that the judgment dismissing the petition was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b115-7\">Ferneding and Kunkle, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
