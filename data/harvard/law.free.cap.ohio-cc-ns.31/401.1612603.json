An indictment for blackmail need not set forth that the threat or menace was to do an unlawful act or unlawful thing, but it is sufficient to charge therein that the threat or menace was to injure one in his property or reputation, or to humiliate him so that he might be induced thereby to give money rather than be subjected to a charge that might have a tendency to affect him, or to humiliate him, in his rights, his property or his reputation.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b409-13\">2.

The substance of that</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">section which pertains to the indictment is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">\u201cWhoever, with menaces, orally * * * demands of another * * <em>* </em>money * <em>* * </em>with intent to extort or gain from him * * * money \u00ae * * muy be fined, \u2019 \u2019 etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">The indictment, after the formal parts, sets out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-12\">\u201cIn the name of and by the authority of the State of Ohio the Jurors of the Grand Jury do present and find that Charles B. Smith and John G. Owens, late of the county aforesaid, on or about the 1st day of December in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and fifteen, with force and arms at the county aforesaid, with the following menaces, to-wit \u2014 by saying to one Frank A. Collins, then and there being: \u2018You know you have got a great big job here and you are bound to have more or less labor trouble on it. We like you and we like the Gill company, but in order to go down the line for you, it is asking a whole lot of us. I think that Kerm Gill ought to give in and give us a nice little Christmas present. It is going to take a couple of years to build it and we have got to go to the mat for you fellows, and wo figure Kerm Gill ought to give us some money. We are afraid there is going to be trouble around here. If Kerm Gill wants to be that kind of a cheap skate, he can get out of this town. I want to tell you something, Frank, wo are going to make this a regular town like New York and Chicago. We are letting you off mighty easy. We are only asking you two thousand dollars ($2,000). It would have, been a whole lot better for you to have had us along with you all through this big job than have us against you. We like you personally, Frank, but we are going to make Kerm Gill\u2019s firm live hard from now on,\u2019 did demand of the said Francis A. Collins and o.ne Kermode F. Gill, money in the amount of two thousand dollars ($2,000) with intent to extort from them, the said Francis A. Collins and Kermode F. Gill, money in the amount of two thousand dollars ($2,000), contrary to the form of the statute in such.ease made and provided and against the peace and dignity of the State of Ohio.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Both defendants pleaded \u201cNot guilty\u201d to the indictment. Thereafter the plea was withdrawn, and a motion to quash was filed, and overruled, and a demurrer to the indictment was filed and overruled. The accused thereupon renewed their pleas of \u201cNot guilty.\u201d Trial was had, resulting'in the conviction of Smith and the acquittal of Owens.</p>\n<p id=\"A-\">Error is prosecuted by Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">It is claimed by counsel for plaintiff in error that the indictment did not sufficiently set out any menace to extort money, because it fails to set out that plaintiff in error threatened ColJins wdth an unlawful act.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">It is not necessary that the threat or menace should be to do an unlawful act or unlawful thing. It is sufficient that the threat or menace be to injure one in his property or reputation, or to humiliate him so that he might be induced thereby to give money rather than be subjected to a charge that might have a tendency to affect him, or to humiliate him, in his rights, his property or his reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">It is further urged that the indictment does not charge a conspiracy, and inasmuch as it is a joint indictment it is necessary to charge that they conspired to extort money by menace and threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">It is held by the Supreme Court in <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>The State, </em>36 Ohio St., 318, at page 324, that the crime \u201cmay be committed by one or more persons, and for which they may be jointly indicted without alleging a previous conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">It was not therefore necessary to charge a conspiracy in- order to have a joint indictment against Smith and Owens.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">It is further urged that the testimony of one of these parties could not be used against the other. But the record discloses that whatever was said and done touching the matters set out in the indictment was done or said by one or the other when they were both present, and therefore the evidence of a conspiracy was produced to the jury, and.it was a question of whether or not that evidence established a conspiracy -beyond a reasonable doubt. If it did, and the jury were the judges whether or not it. did, then the. testimony .of. one. was. admissible .against the other, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>under the rule laid down in <em>Ditzler </em>v. <em>The State of Ohio, </em>4 C. C., 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Tt is urged by plaintiff in error that the evidence was not sufficient to warrant the jury in returning a verdict against Smith in view of the fact that Owens was acquitted. It is urged that the evidence in the \u2022 record does not show that the offense was proved against Smith beyond a reasonable doubt, and that it is not conceivable that Smith could be convicted and Owens acquitted on the same identical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Collins testified that Smith and Owens came to his office and demanded of him $2,000. Owens was the spokesman, and this is the language that he used, as Collins testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">\u201c \u2018Frank, you have got a great big job here and you are bound to have more or less labor trouble on it. We like you and we like the Gill company. We like Kerm Gill, but we are going to have to go down the line for you. It is getting near Christmas and we think Kerm Gill ought to kick in with a Christmas present for us. You know how it is. We have got to do a whole lot for you to get your work over. I think he ought to kick in with a Christmas present for us.\u2019 I [Collins] said: \u2018Well, I will take it up with Mr. Gill and see what he says,\u2019 which I did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Two or three days after, Owens and Smith again went to see Collins, and they had another talk with him. Collins testified that the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">\u201cI had gotten fifty dollars from Mr. Robinson of The Guardian Bank, which I brought to them, and Mr. Smith remarked, \u2018Why,\u2019 he says, \u2018Jack and I spend more than that much every day\u2019\u2019 very contemptuously. I said, \u2018Well, how much did you expect?\u2019 He said, \u2018Why, at least two thousand dollars.\u2019 I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 I said, \u2018I didn\u2019t think you wanted any amount like that. I will see them again and see what he says, \u2019 which I did. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">Thereafter Collins testified that Smith and Owens again came to see him, in about a week, and this occurred between Collins and Smith and Owens:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-11\">\u201cQ. Tell us what you said in that respect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-12\">\u201cA. I said th\u00e9y wouldn\u2019t give that much money. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>thought fifty was all right. They wouldn\u2019t give that much. That\u2019s all there is to it. Mr. Smith said, \u2018Well, if .Kerm Gill is that sort of a cheap skate he can get the hell out of Cleveland. He can\u2019t build in this town.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">\u201cMr. Payer: Who said that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">\u201cThe Witness: Mr. Smith. He said, \u2018Why, do you know how they settle jobs like this in New 'York and Chicago ? They charge you one per cent, of the total contract. How much is your contract here?\u2019 Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018it will amount to about two and a half million.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 he says, \u2018that is twenty-five thousand dollars, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018Now,\u2019 he says, \u2018I think we are letting you off mighty easy with two thousand dollars. If he wants to be a cheap skate he can get the. hell out of Cleveland. He can\u2019t build in this town.\u2019 I said \u2014 '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">\u201cQ. Did he say anything else? What did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">\u201cA. No, they started out then, and Mr. Smith further remarked, \u2018Well, we will make you live hard from now on, Frank.\u2019 I immediately took up the remark and said, \u2018Charley, haven\u2019t I always been square with you?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes, you have. We like you personally, but we are going to get Gill, and we are going to get him good.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. Anything else ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">\u201cA. No, they left then.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">This is but a part of the evidence as to what took place between Smith and Owens, on the one hand, and Collins, on the other, but we think the evidence is sufficient to warrant the jury in finding that both Smith and Owens had endeavored to extort money from Collins, who was an employee of Gill, by threats and menaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">But it is said that .upon this evidence the jury should have found Owens guilty, as well as Smith, or, rather, having found Owens innocent they should also have returned a verdict of not guilty as to Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">It appears from the record that Owens took the witness stand on his own behalf and denied ever having uttered these statements attributed to him by Collins, and denied that he had asked Collins for two thousand dollars or any other sum, whereas Smith failed to testify in the case, and failed to deny the testimony of Collins as to his utterances. Under such a state facts the jury might well have concluded that the state had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>failed to establish the guilt of Owens 'beyond a reasonable doubt; but, in the absence of any denial on the part of Smith, the evidence was sufficient to establish in the minds of the jury the guilt of Smith, beyond a reasonable doubt. This, we think, is sufficient to account for the fact that the jury returned a verdict of \u201cguilty\u201d against Smith' and \u201cnot guilty\u201d against Owens.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">It is further claimed that the court erred in the admission of evidence of similar facts and -circumstances. There was a great mass of testimony admitted, of instances in which Owens and Smith, or Smith alone, had received money from contractors and builders and owners of buildings in the city of Cleveland, covering a period of one or two years prior to tjie'time of the indictment. Many of these cases were instances like those set out in the indictment, in which the contractor or owner of a building was threatened with disaster or strikes, or trouble, unless money was paid. Other instances' showed that money was paid to avoid strikes and trouble, and in order to settle strikes and labor trouble, and we think that on the whole the court did not err in admitting evidence of this character. The court charged the jury that the purpose of admitting this evidence was to show scienter, guilty knowledge or intent, and that it could not be used for the purpose of establishing the guilt of the defendants upon the charge against them in this case; that even though they had been guilty of all these former and subsequent offenses, nevertheless, unless the. evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that they were guilty of the offense charged in the indictment, it would be the duty of the jury to acquit them. In thus charging the jury we find that the court committed no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">A careful consideration of the entire record in the case fails to \"disclose any error prejudicial to the plaintiff in error which would warrant us in reversing this judgment of conviction. The plaintiff in error had a fair and impartial trial, ably defended by able counsel. The court\u2019s rulings during the trial were fair, impartial and just; and his charge to the jury, including the special charges, was fair and impartial, and substantial justice was done in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>The judgment of the court of common pleas is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b415-5\">Jones, Gorman and Hamilton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
