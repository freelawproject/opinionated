ODH determined that certain outpatient surgery services constitute a \u201creviewable activity\u201d under Ohio\u2019s Certificate of Need (\u201cCON\u201d) laws. These services have been performed for a number of years as part of the private ophthalmology practice known as Midwest Eye Center (\u201cMidwest\u201d). Midwest is an entity owned and operated by Dr. David M. Schneider and his professional corporation, Dr. David M. Schneider, M.D., Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Midwest has been in existence since approximately 1986, and has been Medicare-certified for the performance of surgery at its 4425 Eastgate Boulevard location since October 1987. Dr. Schneider and his employees are the only physicians who use the facility to perform surgery. Over the years, Midwest has charged facility fees to both Medicare and other patients for the costs of performing surgery. After six years of providing these services and collecting facility fees, an insurance company requested verification that Midwest did not need a CON for its surgery services. This insurance company was a potential, additional, third-party payer for whom Midwest was seeking to become a provider. Thus, in October 1998, Midwest wrote to ODH and asked for a letter of clarification regarding its \u201cCON status.\u201d ODH determined that Midwest\u2019s surgery services did, in fact, constitute a \u201creviewable activity\u201d requiring a CON. This determination was based upon Midwest\u2019s collection of \u201cfacility fees\u201d from non-Medicare, third-party payers. ODH acknowledged that, prior to this time, such activities would not have been considered \u201creviewable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Midwest appealed to the CONRB. The hearing examiner recommended reversing ODH\u2019s order because it was based upon a newly adopted position of ODH which had not been promulgated in accordance with R.C. Chapter 119. The CONRB, however, rejected this recommendation and affirmed the reviewability determination of ODH.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">On appeal to this court, Midwest raises the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">\u201cFirst Assignment of Error: The Certificate of Need Review Board erred in affirming the determination of the Director of the Ohio Department of Health herein, because the determination was arbitrary and capricious and constituted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>denial of Midwest Eye Center\u2019s rights to due process and equal protection under the Constitutions of the State of Ohio and of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u201cSecond Assignment of Error: The Certificate of Need Review Board erred in affirming the determination of the Director of the Ohio Department of Health that the activities of Midwest Eye Center constituted the creation of a \u2018health care facility\u2019 and a \u2018reviewable activity\u2019 within the meaning of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 3702.51.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">As we find the second assignment of error dispositive, the first assignment of error is rendered moot and, therefore, overruled. Consequently, it is not necessary to address the constitutional issues raised in the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">What constitutes a \u201creviewable activity\u201d is set forth in R.C. 3702.51(R). The relevant provision is found in R.C. 3702.51(R)(5), which states that a reviewable activity is:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">\u201cThe establishment, development, or construction of a new health care facility or a change from one category of health care facility to another[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Private medical practice, as a general rule, is exempt from CON review. This is clearly stated in R.C. 3702.51(G) as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">\u201cA health care facility does not include the offices of private physicians * * * whether for individual or group practice * *</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">ODH, however, determined that Midwest\u2019s surgical services brought it within the definition of \u201chealth care facility\u201d under R.C. 3702.51(G)(7), because it operated as an \u201cambulatory surgical facility.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 3701-12-01(H)(11) lists the criteria necessary for determining whether an entity constitutes an \u201cambulatory surgical facility.\u201d Although ODH found that Midwest \u201cheld itself out\u201d as an ambulatory surgical facility, it found the determinative factor to be the fact that Midwest charged \u201cfacility fees.\u201d The CONRB agreed with ODH\u2019s determination. Additionally, the CONRB found that another factor in Ohio Adm.Code 3701-12-01(H)(11) was met. In noting that Midwest had more than one office, the CONRB felt that the \u201corganizational relationships\u201d factor also supported ODH\u2019s determination that Midwest operated as an ambulatory surgical facility, thereby rendering it reviewable as a \u201chealth care facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">We find it unnecessary to determine whether these factors establish an exception to the general rule of nonreviewabihty in this case. The threshold criterion was not met. Midwest\u2019s activities do not meet the primary elements of R.C. 3702.51(R), the statutory provision which establishes \u201creviewable activities\u201d in Ohio. Under R.C. 3702.51(R)(5), only a <em>\u201cnew </em>health care facility\u201d or a <em>\u201cchange </em>\u201d in the type of health care facility is reviewable. Neither situation is present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The real issue, therefore, is whether Midwest is legally performing services which it has performed for years. We find it significant that, prior to 1993, ODH had uniformly taken the position that collection of facility fees did not make a physician\u2019s practice reviewable. Also significant is the fact that Midwest\u2019s surgical practice, which had been in existence since 1987, would not have been considered a reviewable activity prior to 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">A review of the transcript of proceedings indicates that Midwest\u2019s facility has been legally in existence. From its inception, in 1986, up through October 1993, when it applied for a letter verifying its nonreviewability status, Midwest was not in violation of any regulation, law or determination concerning ambulatory surgical facilities or other reviewable activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The fact that Midwest applied for a reviewability determination, after the change in ODH policy, does not make its surgical practice a reviewable activity. Midwest operated legally as a nonreviewable practice for years. Simply put, R.C. 3702.51(R) requires the creation of a <em>new </em>health care facility, or a <em>change </em>in the type of health care facility, before a facility may be considered to be a \u201creviewable activity.\u201d Even assuming Midwest qualifies as an ambulatory surgical facility and, thus, a health care facility, Midwest\u2019s surgical activities were not <em>new, </em>nor did they constitute a <em>change. </em>For this reason alone, the reviewability determination was contrary to law. The CONRB\u2019s order affirming ODH\u2019s determination is, therefore, reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">We note additionally, however, that, even under Am.Sub.S.B. No. 50, which was passed by the House during the pendency of this appeal, the result would not differ. The bill added a new provision, R.C. 3702.30(A), which defines \u201cambulatory surgical facility\u201d as \u201ca facility, * * * in which outpatient surgery is routinely performed, * * * which <em>junctions separately </em>* * * from the offices of private physicians.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Both Dr. Schneider and Midwest\u2019s office supervisor testified that the surgery services were not separate from the physicians\u2019 office practice. This testimony is uncontroverted. Thus, even if Midwest\u2019s practice was determined to be a creation of a <em>new </em>facility, or a <em>change, </em>it would not qualify as a reviewable activity under the recently enacted R.C. 3702.30(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained, and appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled as moot. The order of the CONRB is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">\n<em>Order reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b254-10\">John C. Young and Petree, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
