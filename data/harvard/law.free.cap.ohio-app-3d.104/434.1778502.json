On August 13, 1993, an indictment was returned by the Scioto County Grand Jury charging the appellant with alternative counts of felonious assault. The first count alleged that the appellant knowingly caused serious physical harm to another in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1). The second count alleged that the appellant knowingly caused physical harm to another by means of a deadly weapon in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-19\">The appellant claimed that he was indigent, and he was assigned trial counsel. On November 30, 1993, a jury returned verdicts finding the appellant guilty of</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>the first count and not guilty of the second count. The court sentenced the appellant, and this appeal follows. Additional facts will be discussed as called for in ruling on the appellant\u2019s assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In his first assignment of error, the appellant submits that the trial court erred in failing to address his <em>pro se </em>motion to dismiss his trial counsel. The appellant\u2019s motion was filed with the Clerk of Courts of Scioto County on November 29, 1993, the first day of the appellant\u2019s trial. The appellant alleged in his motion that his trial counsel was not providing effective assistance because he refused to interview witnesses, refused to investigate the factual background of the case and was not preparing the case for trial. No mention of this motion, however, is made in the record by either the appellant, his trial counsel, or the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">When during trial an indigent defendant questions the effectiveness and adequacy of assigned counsel, it is the duty of the trial court to inquire into the complaint and make the inquiry part of the record. See <em>State v. Prater </em>(1990), 71 Ohio App.3d 78, 593 N.E.2d 44, and <em>State v. Deal </em>(1969), 17 Ohio St.2d 17, 46 O.O.2d 154, 244 N.E.2d 742. The inquiry may be brief and minimal, but it must be made. <em>Prater, supra. </em>No such inquiry appears in the record in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The appellee argues that the duty of the trial judge to inquire into this motion arises only if it is brought to the judge\u2019s attention in open court. However, while it appears that the motion was not brought to the trial court\u2019s attention in open court during the trial, the fact remains that the motion was duly filed during the trial. Whether the trial court was aware of the motion is not apparent from the record. This court has found no authority for the proposition that the trial court has a duty to inquire into an indigent defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss his counsel only when the motion is brought to the attention of the court during open court. Therefore, we find the appellee\u2019s argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Next, the appellee argues that the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel made by the appellant in his motion were not specific enough to warrant a review on the record by the trial court. The <em>Deal </em>court did state that the allegations of ineffective assistance had to be \u201cspecific, not vague or general.\u201d <em>Deal, supra, </em>17 Ohio St.2d at 19, 46 O.O.2d at 155, 244 N.E.2d at 743. We find that the appellant\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel were specific enough to require further inquiry by the trial court. The appellant alleged several distinct ways in which trial counsel was deficient, though the appellant did not provide details, such as which witnesses counsel refused to interview, or what particular facts counsel refused to investigate. However, we find that this lack of detail does not preclude the trial court\u2019s duty to inquire into the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Accordingly, we remand this case to the trial court for an investigation of the appellant\u2019s motion to be put on the record, with the instruction that, if appellant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is determined to be unfounded, the trial court may reenter the judgment of conviction. <em>Prater, supra, </em>71 Ohio App.3d at 85, 593 N.E.2d at 48. If the trial court finds the motion to be well founded, the court may, in its discretion, grant a new trial. <em>Id., </em>71 Ohio App.3d at 86, 593 N.E.2d at 48. We therefore do not reach the appellant\u2019s other eight assignments of error at this time. Of course, if the trial court reinstates the appellant\u2019s conviction and the appellant appeals, he is free to reassert these assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">We find the appellant\u2019s first assignment of error to be well taken. The appellant\u2019s conviction is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b474-7\">Peter B.
