Because we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s inability to articulate a racially neutral nonpretextual reason for the state\u2019s exercise of a peremptory challenge to an African-American venire person violated appellant\u2019s rights under \u2019 Amendment XIV of the Constitution of the United States, we reverse appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-16\">On June 9, 1998, witnesses observed three men break into a fenced lot at a Toledo auto repair shop and attempt to steal a car. These -witnesses gave police a description of the car in which the three were riding and its license number. A few minutes later police stopped a car fitting the general description and having the same license number; appellant, Ian D. Bryant, was the driver. Appellant was arrested and later indicted for breaking and entering and attempted grand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>theft of a motor vehicle. He pled not guilty to both charges and, on November 8, 1993, proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Appellant is an African-American. The jury venire for his trial contained two African-Americans. Following voir dire, both appellant and the state had no challenges for cause. For its first peremptory challenge, however, the state chose one of the two African-Americans on the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: State of Ohio, preempt. [Sic.]</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\u201c[STATE]: Edward Jamison.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: He is now juror 11?</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">\u201c[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, at this time I would object, cite the case of Batson. <em>[Batson v. Kentucky </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69.] This is a black juror. I think the prosecutor has to put on the record the reason for excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">\u201c[STATE]: There is another black individual on the jury. He indicated previous jury duty, and this is a preempt [sic ] situation, and other than that with another black or Afro-American on the jury or as a potential juror, which the state does not intend to throw off, no further explanation will be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">\u201c[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I think this is not acceptable on the Batson and ask the court if the court will allow her to use that peremptory. I feel \u2014 understand the Batson \u2014 the fact there\u2019s another black person, that\u2019s not enough. I think under Batson, I think there has to be some significant reason. Here, nothing about his employment, knowing any of the parties, any reason to show prejudice \u2014 the fact he is a black person is not enough to put him off under Batson.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">\u201c[STATE]: May I be heard?</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Go ahead.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-14\">\u201c[STATE]: I don\u2019t have the case in front of me. The reason why explanations had to be offered in that case is because he was, that person, that black individual, was the only person left on the jury at the time, and this is a situation where there is another Afro-American \u2014 there well could be another Afro-American called. This is preempt <em>[sic </em>], and other than that, the state need offer no further explanation. Preempts <em>[sic </em>] can be for the hair up on the back of the neck situation, or not right for this particular case. No other reason \u2014 and definitely not for reason of color. If my recollection serves me, it was a situation where there was only one black juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-15\">\u201c[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: The opinion went a lot deeper than that. BA-T-S-O-N.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Give me a neutral explanation for that challenge, if you have any.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\u201c[STATE]: You\u2019re addressing me, Your Honor?</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\u201c[STATE]: Basically, he stated he served previous jury duty many times. With previous jury duty, second and third time around, basically, it\u2019s harder to concentrate and they\u2019re irritated at being there, number; number two, this is a situation where there is another black juror on the potential juror\u2019s list; and three, that\u2019s part of the the state\u2019s preempt [sic ] option as to whether to give further reasons or not. Now I didn\u2019t spend an hour and a half on voir dire in this case because I thought we would move it along. I would be happy to go outside and question further and give you more of a basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Want to be heard further, Mr. Geller?</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">\u201c[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes. As far as him serving \u2014 maybe seven [sic ] as to a guilty verdict \u2014 he works at Jeep, so he\u2019s obviously paid for being here. I think he said he works at Jeep. He didn\u2019t seem annoyed. I don\u2019t know of any statistics a second or third time where someone is chosen makes a difference one way or the other. The fact there\u2019s another black there is not significant. The issue is only as this particular juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">\u201c[STATE]: I disagree with you, because I think it is significant. The fact is that the jury has to be representative of all different backgrounds. It will be representative, and if you throw the other guy off, which is speculative, you don\u2019t know at this point, that\u2019s your doing, and you don\u2019t know who might be called out, who out there in the back and there are other Afro-Americans and Asian-Americans and Mexican.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Preempt [sic ] will be granted. It\u2019s my view of the situation that the defendant has no right, he has no exclusive right to, no constitutional right to a jury with some members or a single member of his or her own race on the jury, a black member, a black or member of any other race who is on trial is not entitled to a mixed jury of, composed of members of his own race and members of the white race and it arbitrarily excludes no one of that race is on the jury. I\u2019m satisfied that there\u2019s sufficient neutral basis for the preempt [sic ] and it will be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">\u201c[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Note my objection and move for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">The case then proceeded to trial. Appellant was convicted on both counts and sentenced to two consecutive eighteen month terms of imprisonment. From this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>judgment of conviction and sentence appellant now brings this appeal. He raises the following four assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error and violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights afforded to him under the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution in its overruling the defense\u2019s objection and request for mistrial in the state\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge to exclude an African-American prospective juror without articulating a proper race-neutral explanation for the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\u201cThe verdict and judgment of the trial court was clearly and manifestly against the weight of the evidence necessitating reversal of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 3:</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">\u201cThe appellant was denied due process of law under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution by inadequate and ineffective assistance of counsel at pretrial and trial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 4:</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">\u201cThe trial court committed reversible error in the sentencing of the defendant to consecutive sentences for what were allied offenses, and the trial court\u2019s overruling of defendant\u2019s motion to set aside and/or modify its original sentence was contrary to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">Appellant, in his first assignment of error, argues that he was denied his constitutional rights to equal protection under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">It has long been held that a defendant is denied the equal protection of the law guaranteed to him or her by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States as well as Section I, Article 10 of the Ohio Constitution when the state places the defendant on trial before a jury from which members of the defendant\u2019s race have been purposely excluded. <em>Strauder v. W. Virginia </em>(1880), 100 U.S. 303, 305, 25 L.Ed. 664. It is, therefore, a violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to exclude members of the defendant\u2019s race from the jury venire because of their race, <em>id., </em>or under the false assumption that members of the defendant\u2019s race are unqualified to serve as jurors. <em>Neal v. Delaware </em>(1881), 103 U.S. 370, 379, 26 L.Ed. 567. It follows, then, that the equal protection clause forbids a prosecutor from challenging potential jurors solely on account of their race or on the assumption that jurors of the same race as the defendant will be unable to impartially consider the state\u2019s case against the defendant. <em>Batson, supra, </em>476 U.S. at 89, 106 S.Ct. at 1719, 90 L.Ed.2d at 82-83. The principle applies to the state\u2019s exercise of its peremptory challenge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>exclude members of the same race as the defendant on a petit jury. <em>Swain v. Alabama </em>(1965), 380 U.S. 202, 209-210, 85 S.Ct. 824, 829-830, 13 L.Ed.2d 759, 766-767.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In <em>Swain </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a defendant could make out a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination if he or she could prove, for example, that the peremptory challenge system was used in \u201ccase after case\u201d to exclude African-Americans from petit juries. <em>Id. </em>at 223, 85 S.Ct. at 837-838, 13 L.Ed.2d at 774. The burden of demonstrating the repeated peremptory striking of African-Americans over a number of years, however, was too onerous for many defendants, including <em>Swain. Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 92, 106 S.Ct. at 1720-1721, 90 L.Ed.2d at 84-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\"><em>Batson </em>made it easier for a defendant to establish a prima facie equal protection violation by setting up a three-part test to demonstrate such a violation. First, a defendant had to show that he or she was member of a cognizable racial group. (This requirement was negated by <em>Powers v. Ohio </em>[1991], 499 U.S. 400, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 113 L.Ed.2d 411, which held that any defendant may raise an equal protection claim on behalf of a juror excluded because of a juror\u2019s race.) Next, it must be shown that one of the group\u2019s members has been excluded from the defendant\u2019s jury. Finally, the circumstances of the exclusion must give rise to an inference that the exclusion was based on race. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 96, 106 S.Ct. at 1722-1723, 90 L.Ed.2d at 87-88. See, also, <em>State v. Hernandez </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 577, 581-582, 589 N.E.2d 1310, 1313-1314.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Once a prima facie case of discrimination is so established, the burden shifts to the prosecution to explain its peremptory challenge with a racially neutral reason. <em>Id.; Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 97, 106 S.Ct. at 1723, 90 L.Ed.2d at 88; <em>State v. Cook </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 519, 605 N.E.2d 70, 76-77. The reason must be more than merely an affirmation of the prosecutor\u2019s good faith or an expression of his or her intuition. <em>State v. Hernandez, supra, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 582, 589 N.E.2d at 1313-1314. The reason need not, however, rise to the level of a challenge for cause. <em>Id. A </em>trial court\u2019s determination that the prosecution provided a racially neutral reason for its peremptory challenge will not be overturned on appeal unless clearly erroneous. <em>Hernandez v. New York </em>(1991), 500 U.S. 352, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395; <em>State v. Hernandez, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 583, 589 N.E.2d at 1314; <em>State v. Cook, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Applying these principles to the facts in the instant case, we initially note that the argument of appellant\u2019s counsel that a prima facie equal protection violation arises simply because the state used a peremptory challenge on one of two African-Americans is erroneous. Simple numbers are insufficient to demonstrate the violation; there must be more. <em>United States v. Branch </em>(C.A.5 1993), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>989 F.2d 752, 755 (holding that the presumption does not arise merely because a prosecutor strikes one of two African-American jurors on a panel).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">However, in the instant matter, additional facts were available to the trial court. The record indicates that the state asked no questions of Jamison during voir dire. In fact, the only information elicited from Jamison was that he was married and an employee of the Jeep Division of Chrysler Corporation and had once, in 1987, served on a municipal court jury which returned a guilty verdict in a drunk driving case. All of this information was elicited by questions from the bench. Given the state\u2019s lack of interest in this juror and the sketchy information that this juror did provide, we cannot say that the trial court erred in its decision to require the prosecutor to state a racially neutral reason for its peremptory challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The trial court\u2019s decision to accept the state\u2019s explanation as racially neutral and nonpretextual is another matter. Once the prima facie demonstration of wrongful exclusion of a juror is made, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to provide a \u201c \u2018clear and reasonably specific\u2019 explanation of his \u2018legitimate reason\u2019 for exercising the challenges.\u201d <em>Harrison v. Ryan </em>(C.A.3 1990), 909 F.2d 84, 88 quoting <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 98, 106 S.Ct. at 1724, 90 L.Ed.2d at 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">When questioned, the state set forth three reasons for raising the peremptory challenge. First, because Jamison had served on a previous jury, he would supposedly find it hard to concentrate and become more easily irritable by again serving; second, because there was another African-American on the panel, there could be no discriminatory intent; and third, the state, according to the prosecutor, had no duty to state its reasons for exercising a peremptory challenge. As discussed above, the state\u2019s third position is simply wrong. Once a prima facie case of discriminatory exclusion has been made, the prosecution must come forward with a racially neutral explanation of its challenge. <em>Batson, supra, </em>476 U.S. at 89, 106 S.Ct. at 1719, 90 L.Ed.2d at 82-83. The state\u2019s second position is also unavailing. It is irrelevant how many minority jurors remain on the panel if even one is excluded on the basis of race. <em>Jones v. Ryan </em>(C.A.3 1993), 987 F.2d 960, 972; <em>United States v. David </em>(C.A.11 1986), 803 F.2d 1567.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Remaining is the state\u2019s explanation that because of Jamison\u2019s previous service as a juror he would be less able to concentrate during this trial or be more likely to become irritable. The state provided no support for this assertion whatsoever. It did not note any particular behavior by Jamison which would indicate that he was likely to become inattentive or irritable. It cited no answer that Jamison had given during voir dire which indicated such a propensity. In short, the state merely relied on the unsupported (and likely erroneous) generalization that jurors who have had a previous jury experience some years ago become irritable or fail to pay attention during a later jury trial. Such general<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>izations are simply insufficient to demonstrate a racially neutral reason for a peremptory challenge once the duty to state such a reason has arisen. <em>Jones v. Ryan, supra, </em>987 F.2d at 972-974. Therefore, the state failed to articulate a specific and reasonable racially neutral nonpretextual explanation for the peremptory exclusion of Jamison, and the trial court\u2019s determination that it did state an acceptable reason is clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In view of our handling of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, we need not reach the merits of appellant\u2019s remaining assignments of error. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>On consideration whereof, the courts finds that the defendant was prejudiced or prevented from having a fair trial, and the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is reversed. This case is remanded to the trial court for a new trial. It is ordered that appellee pay the court costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b556-6\">Abood, P.J., and Glasser, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-6\">. During the pendency of this case, the United States Supreme Court announced a modification of the <em>Batson </em>test. <em>Purkett v. Elem </em>(1995), 514 U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">\"Under our <em>Batson </em>jurisprudence, once the opponent of a peremptory challenge has made out a prima facie case of racial discrimination (step 1), the burden of production shifts to the proponent of the strike to come forward with a race-neutral explanation (step 2). If a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must then decide (step 3) whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial discrimination. <em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 358-359 [111 S.Ct. 1859, 1865-1866, 114 L.Ed.2d 395, 404-405] (1991) (plurality opinion); <em>id. </em>at 375 [111 S.Ct. at 1874-1875, 114 L.Ed.2d at 416] (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment); <em>Batson, supra, </em>at 96-98 [106 S.Ct. at 1722-1724, 90 L.Ed.2d at 87-89]. The second step of this process does not demand an explanation that is persuasive, or even plausible. 'At this [second] step of the inquiry, the issue is the facial validity of the prosecutor\u2019s explanation. Unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race neutral.' <em>Hernandez, </em>500 U.S. at 360 [111 S.Ct. at 1866-1867, 114 L.Ed.2d at 406] (plurality opinion); <em>id. </em>at 374 [111 S.Ct. at 1874, 114 L.Ed.2d at 415-416] (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACU\">\"The Court of Appeals erred by combining <em>Batson\u2019s </em>second and third steps into one, requiring that the justification tendered at the second step be not just neutral but also at least minimally persuasive, <em>i.e., </em>a 'plausible\u2019 basis for believing that \u2018the person\u2019s ability to perform his or her duties as a juror\u2019 will be affected. <em>[Elem v. Purkett </em>(C.A.8 1994) ] 25 F.3d, [679] at 683. It is not until the <em>third </em>step that the persuasiveness of the justification becomes relevant \u2014 the step in which the trial court determines whether the opponent of the strike has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination. <em>Batson, supra, </em>at 98 [106 S.Ct. at 1723-1724, 90 L.Ed.2d at 88-89]. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>at 359 [111 S.Ct. at 1866, 114 L.Ed.2d at 405\u2014406] (plurality opinion). At that stage, implausible or fantastic justifications may (and probably will) be found to be pretexts for purposeful discrimination. But to say that a trial judge <em>may choose to disbelieve </em>a silly or superstitious reason at step 3 is quite different from saying that a trial judge <em>must </em>terminate the inquiry at step 2 when the race-neutral reason is silly or superstitious. The latter violates the principle that the ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, -[113 S.Ct. 2742, 2748-2749, 125 L.Ed.2d 407, 416-419] (1993).\" <em>Id. </em>at ---, 115 S.Ct. at 1770-1771, 131 L.Ed.2d at 839.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-13\">The rule articulated in <em>Elem </em>arose in a federal habeas corpus proceeding and may not be applicable in the instant context. Even if applicable, however, it does not alter our conclusion. In this matter, the prosecutor\u2019s explanation of its challenge to juror Jamison because of his prior jury service may have been race neutral pursuant to <em>Elem, </em>but it was, nonetheless, implausible and unpersuasive as an explanation. Given this, we can only conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to find the explanation pretextual was clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
