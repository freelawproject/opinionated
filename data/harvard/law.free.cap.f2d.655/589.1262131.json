The vessel was moved to a marina where engine, electrical and hull repairs were to be performed by various contractors. After completion of repairs, the KRISTA K was to be used to transport equipment to Central America. Robert W. Kirk had some interest in the repair and safekeeping of this vessel. The exact nature of his interest does not appear in the record. While Kirk frequently referred to the vessel as \u201cmy boat\u201d, he also stated that it was in fact owned by United Steel Corporation. However, the ownership is not at issue in this matter. Kirk was also President of Robert W. Kirk &amp; Associates, Inc., a real estate brokerage and management company. The claimant, Jesse Holcomb, is a fifty-three year old man with a second grade education. Mr. Holcomb, having had pre-existing back and arm disability, could only perform light work. Kirk hired Holcomb in early January 1975, for the primary duty as watchman for the KRISTA K. He did this seven days a week, from dusk until morning. He would perform other chores. Holcomb\u2019s primary function was to see that no one boarded the KRISTA K, this in order to protect against vandalism and theft. He regularly watched the KRISTA K from a pick-up truck furnished him by Kirk, but he frequently went aboard in the performance of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-15\">On March 13, 1975, about 9:30 p. m., Holcomb was aboard the KRISTA K when he saw another boat coming alongside. In order to watch the approaching boat, he attempted to cross the deck and fell through an open hatch. As a result of the injuries he sustained in the fall, he is permanently and totally disabled. Holcomb filed a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits under Florida law. His employer and insurance carrier defended the claim with the assertion that the case was within the coverage of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act. The defense was sustained and Holcomb was denied any compensation under Florida law. He then filed the Longshoremen\u2019s Act claim, which gives rise to this proceeding. The Administrative Law Judge held that Holcomb was not \u201cengaged in maritime employment\u201d, so as to meet the definition of a covered employee. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Benefits Review Board on appeal under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, Section 21(b)(3), by a divided court affirmed. Holcomb and the Director then instituted the present review proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">In this petition, the petitioners present three issues for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">1. Whether employment that is performed aboard a vessel afloat in navigable waters, without more, is \u201cmaritime employment\u201d within the Longshoremen\u2019s Act \u00a7 2(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">2. Whether employment as a vessel watchman is \u201cmaritime employment\u201d within Longshoremen\u2019s Act \u00a7 2(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">3. Whether the Florida administrative tribunal\u2019s judgment sustaining the affirmative defense of the employer and carrier to Hoecomb\u2019s state compensation claim \u2014 that his injury was not compensa-ble under the state law because it was within the coverage of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act \u2014 should have foreclosed either,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-9\">(a) the employer\u2019s contrary assertion or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-10\">(b) relitigation of the question, in the Longshoremen\u2019s Act proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">Of course, the question is whether or not Holcomb at the time in question, was covered by the Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Section 3(a) of the Act is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-12\">Compensation shall be payable under this act in respect of disability or death of an <em>employee, </em>but only if the <em>disability </em>or death results from an injury occurring upon the <em>navigable </em>waters of the United States (including any adjoining pier, wharf, dry dock, terminal, building way, marine railway, or other adjoining area customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, or building a vessel). * * * 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a) (1976). (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">The undisputed evidence shows that Holcomb, at the time of his injury, was aboard the KRISTA K upon navigable waters. It is undisputed that Holcomb sustained an injury as above defined and that the injury resulted in \u201cdisability\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-16\">The two requirements, that the injured worker have been \u201can employee\u201d as defined in Section 2(3) of the Act and that the location of the injury was upon navigable waters, have come to be known as the status and situs test, both of which must be met in order for coverage to attach. <em>See, P. C. Pfeiffer and Co. v. Ford, </em>444 U.S. 69, 100 S.Ct. 328, 62 L.Ed.2d 225 (1979); <em>Northeast Marine Terminal Company v. Caputo, </em>432 U.S. 249, 97 S.Ct. 2348, 32 L.Ed.2d 320 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-17\">There is no dispute that the situs of Holcomb\u2019s injury was upon the navigable waters of the United States. Therefore, his disability is compensable under the Act if he was, at the time of the injury, an \u201cemployee\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Section 2(3) is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-18\">The term \u201cemployee\u201d means any person engaged in maritime employment, including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations and any harborworker, including ship repairman, shipbuilder, and shipbreaker .. . . \u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3) (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-19\">Both from the face of Section 2(3) and in light of its legislative history,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the occupations and activities expressly included in the general term \u201cmaritime employment\u201d are not exhaustive under its statutory scope. <em>Tri-State Terminals, Inc. v. Jesse, </em>596 F.2d 752 (7th Cir. 1979). Therefore, a worker engaged as a vessel watchman is a Section 2(3) \u201cemployee\u201d if it can reasonably be concluded either that he is within the intended scope of the term \u201charborworker\u201d or at the time of injury, his employment was inclusive within the general term \u201cmaritime employment\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-20\">As found in <em>Jacksonville Shipyards v. Perdue, </em>539 F.2d 533 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>1976)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, at page 541, \u201cIn deciding each appeal, we must remember that the Act is to be liberally construed in favor of injured workers, see <em>Voris v. Eikel, </em>346 U.S. 328, 74 S.Ct. 88, 98 L.Ed. 5 (1953). We were also bound by a statutory presumption that an individual claim comes under the Act\u2019s coverage. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Again, on page 545 in <em>Jacksonville Shipyards, supra, </em>\u201cOur conclusion is that, in the exercise of its discretion Congress could probably determine that \u2018new conceptions of maritime concerns\u2019 justified the extension of compensation coverage to workers in the immediate waterfront area who participate in ongoing shipbuilding operation. As the legislative history makes clear, Congress was concerned that under the former Act maritime workers were covered over the waters but not covered while performing similar or related work on shore. The inequities of the pre-1972 Act in this regard are obvious, and we feel that this concern was a \u2018maritime\u2019 one within the meaning of the Admiralty Clause. We have already indicated that, in defining \u2018maritime\u2019 concerns, we will not be limited by the rules which apply to tort and contract litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Holcomb was employed to watch the KRISTA K which was in port for repairs, having aboard much sophisticated electronic gear. Within the included activities in Section 2(3) is harborworker, including ship repairman, shipbuilder and shipbreaker. While the word \u201cwatchman\u201d is not set out in the statute, as held in the <em>Tri-State Terminals </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the included general terms of Section 2(3) are not exhaustive. The reasoning in <em>Jacksonville Shipyards, supra, </em>page 543, is helpful in the instant case. There the claimant, Nulty, was building a piece of woodwork which was to be installed in a new ship that had been launched but not yet commissioned. Most of Nulty\u2019s work was performed in the shop, 300 feet from where the ship was berthed, although at times he would go aboard a vessel to take measurements or to install or repair some woodwork. The Administrative Law Judge, the Benefits Review Board and the Court found that Nulty was working as a shipbuilder at the time of his injury, thus satisfying Section 902(3). \u201cIn our view, the only reasonable conclusion is that Nulty was directly involved in an ongoing shipbuilding operation.\u201d 539 F.2d at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\"> As further found in <em>Jacksonville Shipyards, supra, </em>at pages 539-540, \u201cOur holding is that an injured worker is a covered \u2018employee\u2019 if at the time of his injury (a) he was performing the work of loading, unloading, repairing, building, or breaking a vessel, or (b) although he was not actually carrying out these specified functions, he was \u2018directly involved\u2019 in such work.\u201d While the word \u201cwatchman\u201d was not included by Congress in the Section, Footnote 18 cited on page 540 is very interesting. Footnote 18 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-10\">See Gorman, The Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u2014 After the 1972 Amendments 6 Journal of Maritime Law and Commerce 1, 10 (1974). By this holding, we do not mean to suggest that future cases may not bring to light other types of covered work which cannot be characterized as loading, unloading, repairing, building or breaking, and which are not \u2018directly involved\u2019 with these five types of work, but which nevertheless are sufficiently similar to fall within the Congressional scheme. No such additional category of covered work appears in the cases before us, but we will not foreclose the possibility of such categories arising in future litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A17\">Sections 3(a) and 2(3) first appeared in the 1972 amendment, but it must be remembered that the 1927 statute had coverage provisions which were not withdrawn by the 1972 amendment. In dealing with Congressional intent concerning the 1972 amendment, we find on page 666 of <em>Fusco v. Perini North River Assoc., </em>601 F.2d 659 (2nd Cir. 1979), the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-11\">When Congress did deal with coverage, it did not undertake a general study of the subject. Congress did not address itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>to the problems raised in Parker, Davis, Pennsylvania Railroad, Calback or cognate lower federal court eases, nor did Congress comment upon the Calback doctrine that it was the Congressional purpose to give a federal compensation remedy to all workers, except crew members, injured seaward of the Jensen line. Congress took it for granted that injuries occurring upon water were covered and would remain covered. There was no indication that Congress considered withdrawing existing coverage or eligibility. What concerned Congress was injuries on land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The case of <em>Puget Sound Navigation Co. v. Marshall, </em>31 F.Supp. 903 (W.D.Wash. 1940) held that employment as a watchman aboard a ferry boat laid up between its weekend runs, was sufficiently maritime in nature for coverage under the pre-1972 LHWCA, where an employee was drowned in navigable waters in the course of such employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">In <em>Hillcone S.S. Co. v. Steffen, </em>136 F.2d 965 (9th Cir. 1943), the Ninth Circuit held that a watchman or caretaker injured in the course of his employment aboard a laid up steamship to have been engaged in maritime employment for purposes of coverage of pre-1972 LHWCA. The Deputy Commissioner had denied coverage on the ground that the employee\u2019s service at the time of his alleged injury was not maritime in character. The district judge reversed the finding of the Deputy Commissioner and was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Court noted that the employment fell under none of the listed exceptions to the Act\u2019s coverage and that the job of caretaker or watchman on a vessel was regarded as being related to navigation and hence falling within the terms of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">In <em>Union Oil Co. v. Pillsbury, </em>63 F.2d 925 (9th Cir. 1933), the Ninth Circuit held that a former third officer of a ship laid off when the ship entered port and later rehired as a night watchman while the ship underwent overhaul was engaged in maritime employment when shot by a burglar in the performance of his night watchman duties. <em>Rex Investigative and Patrol Agency, Inc. v. Collura, </em>329 F.Supp. 696 (E.D.N.Y.1971) affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s finding that an injured watchman was covered under the pre-1972 LHWCA, even though his duties were primarily on the pier or the dock and that his presence on navigable waters when injured was merely a temporary incident to his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">There are also several statements of interest in the case of <em>Northeast Marine Terminal Co. v. Caputo, </em>432 U.S. 249, 97 S.Ct. 2348, 53 L.Ed.2d 320 (1977). On page 264 of this opinion on page 2357 of 97 S.Ct. we find: \u201cBut with the definition of \u2018navigable waters\u2019 expanded by the 1972 Amendments to include such a large geographical area, it became necessary to describe affirmatively the class of workers Congress desired to compensate. It therefore added the requirement that the injured worker be \u2018engaged in maritime employment\u2019, which it defined to include \u2018any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations, and any harbor worker, including a ship repairman, shipbuilder, and shipbreaker, but . . . not ... a master or member of a crew of any vessel. ...\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">Again on page 268, 97 S.Ct. on page 2359, of <em>Northeast Marine Terminal, supra, </em>we find language particularly appropriate for the instant case. \u201cThe Act \u2018must be liberally construed in conformance with its purpose, and in a way which avoids harsh and incongruous results.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">We find that Holcomb at the time in question, was covered by the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Act. A watchman of a vessel docked in navigable waters at a ship repair yard for the purpose of being readied for sea who is injured aboard ship while in the performance of his duties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>is surely within \u201cmaritime employment\u201d. His work was certainly an \u201cintegral part\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of and \u201cdirectly involved in an ongoing ship repair operation.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We find that he meets both the \u201csitus\u201d and \u201cstatus\u201d requirements of the 1972 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">We do not hold that every watchman of a vessel in navigable waters comes under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act. We do hold that under the facts of this case, Holcomb, the petitioner, is covered under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Having disposed of the first two issues raised by the appellant, there is no need to address the third issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED for Findings of Fact required for the entry of an award of benefits under the Act.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-14\">.
