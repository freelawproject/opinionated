Boland subsequently filed suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia against Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Staff Director of the Committee, the members of the Committee, and the Committee itself, claiming violation of her liberty and property interests protected by the fifth amendment. United States District Judge Charles R. Richey granted the defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss on December 19, 1979, holding that Boland\u2019s complaint failed to state an interest protected by the Constitution. Boland filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>Plaintiff does not appeal the ruling by the district court that she failed to possess a constitutionally protected property interest in her non-tenured position as an investigative researcher. She contends, however, that the district court erred in holding that her complaint failed to allege a liberty interest under the fifth amendment. Appellant argues that she possessed a constitutional right to be informed of the reason or reasons for her dismissal and that the failure of the Committee so to inform her constituted a \u201cstigma\u201d foreclosing employment opportunities, and violated the fifth amendment. Brief for Appellant at 10, 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">It is undisputed that appellant\u2019s abrupt termination from her researcher position disadvantaged her in her search for future employment. As prior decisions in this area make clear, however, a constitutionally cognizable stigma arises only when a foreclosure of employment opportunity has resulted from the disclosure of derogatory information by the public agency in question. <em>See Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 574 n.13, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2707 n.13, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972); <em>Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 348, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 2079, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976); <em>Codd v. Velger, </em>429 U.S. 624, 628, 97 S.Ct. 882, 884, 51 L.Ed.2d 92 (1977) (per curiam). <em>See generally Mazaleski v. Treusdell, </em>562 F.2d 701, 712-15 (D.C.Cir.1977). Appellant can cite no authority holding that a dismissal without explanation <em>to </em>anyone<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> infringes a liberty interest protected by the fifth amendment. We must, therefore, agree with the district court\u2019s succinct observation: \u201cSilence alone does not provide the basis for an injury to professional reputation which is constitutional in dimension.\u201d <em>Boland v. Blakey, </em>No. 78-1921, slip op. at 3 (D.D.C., filed Dec. 19, 1979), Appendix at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">Although we may question the wisdom of the policy, if any, behind this lack of explanation for appellant\u2019s dismissal, this court \u201cis not the appropriate forum in which to review the multitude of personnel decisions that are made daily by public agencies.\u201d <em>Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. at 349, 96 S.Ct. at 2079, quoted in <em>Mazaleski v. Treusdell, </em>562 F.2d at 722. Such review can be predicated only upon the basis of an alleged infringement of a protected property or liberty interest. Appellant has failed to allege the disclosure of derogatory information by the Committee necessary for this court to find infringement of a protected liberty interest. The district court therefore correctly dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1292-6\">. Plaintiff makes no claim that the Committee provides an explanation to employers interested in hiring her that remains hidden only from her.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
