The subpoena was part of an FEC investigation into the activities of nine so-called \u201cdraft-Kennedy\u201d organizations which operated during the first ten months of 1979. We hold that FEC\u2019s subpoena exceeded the Commission\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, and therefore vacate the enforcement order.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-23\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b442-24\">MNPL is the political arm of the International Association of Machinists (\u201cIAM\u201d), and is registered as a \u201cmulti-candidate political committee\u201d under the Federal Election Campaign Act, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 431 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cFECA\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> MNPL and the IAM had supported the election of Jimmy Carter in 1976, but thereafter became disenchanted with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>various of his policies deemed antithetical to the interests of the IAM membership.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By February, 1979 MNPL had begun encouraging and assisting the formation of \u201cdraft-Kennedy\u201d groups in several states\u2014 including Iowa, Illinois and Florida \u2014 all engaged in promoting the acceptance of presidential candidacy by Senator Edward Kennedy. Between May, 1979 and November 7, 1979 when Senator Kennedy formally announced his candidacy for President, MNPL gave, by its own admission, approximately $30,000 to \u201cdraft-Kennedy\u201d groups in seven states. Brief for MNPL at 7-8.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">On October 4, 1979 the FEC received a complaint from the Carter-Mondale Presidential Committee, Inc., alleging that nine \u201cdraft-Kennedy\u201d organizations were in violation of certain provisions of FECA. Specifically, the complaint alleged (1) that the \u201cdraft-Kennedy\u201d groups were \u201cpolitical committee[s]\u201d as that term is defined by FECA, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 431(d); (2) that the nine named draft committees were affiliated within the meaning of 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a)(5), 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 110.3(a)(l)(ii)(D), and therefore all were subject to a single $5,000 contribution limitation, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a)(l)(C), (a)(2)(C); and (3) that MNPL had exceeded this contribution limitation, thereby violating 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a)(2)(C). The complaint <em>expressly </em>declined to take any position on whether Senator Kennedy had become a \u201ccandidate\u201d for purposes of the Act, Complaint at 11, and acknowledged that Kennedy had formally disavowed the various \u201cdraft-Kennedy\u201d organizations, <em>id. </em>at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">Based on this complaint, FEC notified MNPL on October 19, 1979, that it had \u201cfound reason to believe\u201d that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJe\">by contributing, in the aggregate, in excess of $5,000 in a calendar year to the Florida for Kennedy Committee, New Hampshire Democrats for Change, Committee for Alternatives to Democratic Presidential Candidate, and Illinois Citizens for Kennedy, MNPL may have violated 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a)(2)(C). The Commission has determined that these four committees, among others, may be affiliated within the meaning of the Act and the Commission\u2019s regulations and that, if affiliated, contributions to them must be aggregated for purposes of the limitations set forth in 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a)(2)(C).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVU\">Letter from William C. Oldaker, General Counsel, FEC, to Howard F. Dow, Secretary-Treasurer, MNPL (October 19, 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">On November 2, 1979, the Carter-Mondale Presidential Committee submitted an amendment to its complaint asking that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqn-dedup-0\">Senator Kennedy be found to be a candidate under 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 431(b)(2) as of no later than September 1, 1979; ... and that all contributions made by ... multi-candidate political committees in excess of $5,000 \u2014 to the Florida, New Hampshire and any other affiliated draft-Kennedy committees on or after September 1, 1979, be found in violation of the limitations of 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a) ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Amended Complaint at 3. Significantly, both the original complaint and the amended complaint focused exclusively on the nine respondents\u2019 \u201cdraft-Kennedy\u201d activities, not on any other political, candidate-support activities in which they may have engaged.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">On November 5, 1979, the Commission issued a sweeping subpoena to MNPL, ordering production of, <em>inter alia, </em>all documents and materials relating to communications between MNPL and other \u201cdraft-Kennedy\u201d groups. The Commission\u2019s subpoena further demanded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">All documents and materials (including but not limited to minutes, notes, memo-randa, or records of telephone conversations) relating to meetings, discussions, correspondence, or other internal communications whereby the MNPL or any of its committees or sub-units determined to support or oppose any individual in any way for nomination or election to the office of President in 1980.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Joint Appendix (hereinafter \u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 4-7. <em>MNPL was also ordered to provide a list of every official, employee, staff member, and volunteer of the organization, along with their respective telephone numbers. </em>The Commission made no attempt to limit its subpoena to the period after September 1, during which the amended complaint alleged that Senator Kennedy was a candidate for President, or to material relevant to the alleged support of Senator Kennedy\u2019s candidacy. In fact the subpoena nowhere even refers to Senator Kennedy or his alleged candidacy, except in listing the official names of the \u201cdraft-Kennedy\u201d groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Following denial by the Commission of MNPL\u2019s motion to quash the subpoena for lack of jurisdiction, the FEC filed a petition in district court to enforce its subpoena. At a hearing on the Commission\u2019s petition on January 28, 1980, the parties fully argued the issue of the Commission\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over draft committees. In ordering MNPL to comply with the Commission\u2019s subpoena, see J.A. at 13-17, the court held that a subpoena enforcement proceeding is not the proper forum for deciding the issue of the Commission\u2019s alleged lack of jurisdiction. Although the court twice emphasized that it was not deciding the \u201cmerits\u201d of MNPL\u2019s jurisdictional argument, the court did specifically find that the \u201cguidelines of enforceability\u201d found in <em>United States v. Morton Salt Co., </em>338 U.S. 632, 70 S.Ct. 357, 94 L.Ed. 401 (1950), were satisfied.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\">[T]he requirements to be met are first that the inquiry must be made within the authority of the agency. I don\u2019t think there is any question but what this inquiry is within the authority of the Federal Elections [sic] Commission. It was just this type of matter that caused Congress to set the whole machinery in motion when it enacted the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">J.A. at 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">The district court\u2019s order enforcing the Commission\u2019s subpoena raises two issues.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> First, we must decide if, before enforcing this particular subpoena, the district court first should have determined whether subject matter jurisdiction existed for the Commission\u2019s investigation. We answer that question affirmatively. Accordingly, we must also examine the district court\u2019s finding that the investigation of these draft committees was without \u201cany question . . . within the authority of the Federal Elections [sic] Commission.\u201d J.A. at 13. We find, contrary to the district court, that the Commission lacks subject matter jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>tion over the draft group activities it sought to investigate through this subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">II. STANDARDS FOR JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT OF THIS FEC SUBPOENA</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">FECA declares that federal courts \u201cmay, ... in case of refusal to obey a subpoena or order of the Commission . . ., issue an order requiring compliance^]\u201d 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 437d(b). This grant of permissive authority is similar to other statutes which also provide that courts \u201cmay\u201d enforce administrative subpoenas.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Where the concerns of the subpoena-issuing agency are of a corporate or commercial character, the Supreme Court has made it abundantly clear that courts should deny enforcement only where there is \u201ctoo much indefiniteness or breadth\u201d in the items requested, or where the inquiry is not one which the requesting agency is lawfully authorized to make. <em>See Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, </em>327 U.S. 186, 208-09, 66 S.Ct. 494, 505-506, 90 L.Ed. 614 (1946). As the Court has pointed out,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoJ\">[w]hile they may and should have protection from unlawful demands made in the name of public investigation, corporations can claim no equality with individuals in the enjoyment of a right to privacy. They are endowed with public attributes. They have a collective impact upon society, from which they derive the privilege of acting as artificial entities. The Federal Government allows them the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce. Favors from government often carry with them an enhanced measure of regulation. Even if one were to regard the request for information in this case as caused by nothing more than official curiosity, nevertheless law-enforcing agencies have a legitimate right to satisfy themselves that corporate behavior is consistent with the law and the public interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">Of course a governmental investigation into corporate matters may be of such a sweeping nature and so unrelated to the matter properly under inquiry as to exceed the investigatory power. <em>But it is sufficient if the inquiry is within the authority of the agency, the demand is not too indefinite and the information sought is reasonably relevant.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-11\"><em>United States v. Morton Salt Co., </em>338 U.S. 632, 652, 70 S.Ct. 357, 368-369, 94 L.Ed. 401 (1950) (citations omitted) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">The <em>Morton Salt </em>rule has been applied by this court repeatedly in business contexts to limit the scope of issues which may be litigated in a subpoena enforcement proceeding. In so doing we have repeatedly shown our awareness that the \u201c \u2018very backbone of an administrative agency\u2019s effectiveness in carrying out the congressionally mandated duties of industry regulation is the rapid exercise of the power to investigate ....\u2019\u201d <em>FTC v. Texaco, Inc., </em>555 F.2d 862, 872 (D.C. Cir.) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 974, 97 S.Ct. 2940, 53 L.Ed.2d 1072 (1977) <em>(quoting FMC v. Port of Seattle, </em>521 F.2d 431, 433 (9th Cir. 1975)). Usually, scrutiny under the <em>Morton Salt </em>standard results in routine subpoena enforcement when the information sought falls within the purview of the regulatory agency\u2019s authority. <em>See, e. g., FTC v. Carter, </em>636 F.2d 781, 785-87 (D.C. Cir.1980) (applying <em>Morton Salt </em>standard, and \u201cconcluding] that the Commission has sufficient statutory authority to conduct the investigation it has ordered and that the investigation is related to congressionally prescribed duties of the Commission\u201d); <em>FTC v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., </em>626 F.2d 966, 974 (D.C.Cir.1980); <em>FTC v. Anderson, </em>631 F.2d 741, 745 (D.C.Cir.1979); <em>SEC v. Arthur Young &amp; Co., </em>584 F.2d 1018, 1023-24, 1032-33 (D.C.Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1071, 99 S.Ct. 841, 59 L.Ed.2d 37 (1979); <em>Appeal of FTC Line of Business Report Litigation, </em>595 F.2d 685, 702-03 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 958, 99 S.Ct. 362, 58 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978) (all cases where <em>Morton Salt </em>rule was applied in cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>porate or commercial contexts). <em>See also CAB v. Deutsche Lufthansa Aktiengesells-chaft, </em>591 F.2d 951, 952 (D.C.Cir.1979) (\u201cIn general, this court respects the doctrine that an agency has jurisdiction to determine the scope of its authority, in the first instance, and that such matters will not be determined in a proceeding to enforce a subpoena. This doctrine is subject to exceptions, as where there is a patent lack of jurisdiction, but we do not find those exceptions to be applicable to the instant case.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Even in business regulation eases, however, the Supreme Court has never sought to eviscerate the independent role which the federal courts play in subpoena enforcement proceedings. In <em>Oklahoma Press, supra, </em>for example, the Court sustained judicial enforcement of an administrator\u2019s subpoenas issued to various news publishing corporations for the purpose of investigating alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d). Although the Court held it was unnecessary for the administrator to prove that the newspapers were \u201ccovered\u201d by the Act before securing enforcement of a subpoena to conduct his investigation, 327 U.S. at 216, 66 S.Ct. at 509, the Court went out of its way to emphasize that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">There is no harassment when the subpoena is issued and enforced according to law. The Administrator is authorized to enter and inspect, but the Act makes his right to do so subject in all cases to judicial supervision. Persons from whom he seeks relevant information are not required to submit to his demand, if in any respect it is unreasonable or <em>overreaches the authority Congress has given. </em>To it they may make \u201cappropriate defence\u201d surrounded by every safeguard of judicial restraint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUb\"><em>Id. </em>at 217, 66 S.Ct. at 510 (emphasis supplied). The Court pointed out various \u201cimportant questions which the Administrator\u2019s position concedes the courts may decide,\u201d and stressed the lower courts\u2019 duty to examine these questions with care. \u201cThe issues of authority to conduct the investigation, relevancy of the materials sought, and breadth of the demand,\u201d the Court declared, \u201care neither minor nor ministerial matters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216-17 &amp; n.57, 66 S.Ct. at 509 &amp; n.57. The Court also found significant \u201cthe discretionary power implied in the [FLSA] statute\u2019s use of the word \u2018may,\u2019 rather than \u2018shall,\u2019 ... in authorizing the court to enforce the subpoenas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n.57, 66 S.Ct. at 509-510 n.57; <em>compare </em>2 U.S.C. \u00a7 437d(b) (FEC statute also uses the word \u201cmay,\u201d rather than \u201cshall\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Other business regulation cases have recognized the duty of an enforcing court to assure itself that the subject matter of the investigation is within the statutory jurisdiction of the subpoena-issuing agency. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Morton Salt Co., supra, </em>338 U.S. at 652, 70 S.Ct. at 368; <em>FTC v. Carter, supra, </em>636 F.2d at 785-87; <em>FTC v. Owen-Corning Fiberglas Corp., supra, </em>626 F.2d at 974; <em>Appeal of FTC Line of Business Report Litigation, supra, </em>595 F.2d at 702-03; <em>FTC </em>v. <em>Texaco, Inc., supra, </em>555 F.2d at 872. The FEC does not, and could not, claim any exemption from similar judicial scrutiny of its subpoenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">The subpoena in this case, however, possesses a number of characteristics which make it especially important for an enforcing court to exercise particular care in assuring itself that subject matter jurisdiction does exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">First, this investigation into \u201cdraft-Kennedy\u201d groups represents an unprecedented assertion of subject matter jurisdiction<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for the FEC. The Commission has failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>show us a single prior instance where it sought to conduct an investigation based solely upon alleged jurisdiction over \u201cdraft candidate\u201d groups. Only two courts have ever considered FEC requests to enforce subpoenas on this basis, and in both cases the respondents were \u201cdraft-Kennedy\u201d groups named in the very same Carter-Mondale complaints which form the basis for this investigation. <em>FEC v. Wisconsin Democrats for Change in 1980, </em>Order No. 80-C-124 (W.D.Wis. Apr. 24, 1980); <em>FEC v. Florida for Kennedy Committee, </em>492 F.Supp. 587 (S.D.Fla.1980).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">This novel extension of the Commission\u2019s investigative authority warrants extra-careful scrutiny from the court because the activities which the FEC normally investigates differ in terms of their constitutional significance from those which are of concern to other federal administrative agencies whose authority relates to the regulation of corporate, commercial, or labor activities. The FEC does not oversee fair dealings in commerce, or insure adequate corporate disclosures, or guarantee fair labor standards, all of which are areas where only the minimal limitations upon the commerce power are usually implicated.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The subject matter which the FEC oversees, in contrast, relates to the behavior of individuals and groups <em>only insofar as they act, speak and associate for political purposes. See </em>2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 431, 441a. The creation of such an agency raised weighty constitutional objections, and its authority to exercise control over an area where \u201cuninhibited, robust, and wide open\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> activity is constitutionally protected was approved by the Supreme Court only after being meticulously scrutinized and substantially restricted. <em>See Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976). Thus the highly deferential attitude which courts usually apply to business related subpoena enforcement requests from agencies whose subject matter jurisdiction is unquestioned, has no place where political activity and association never before subject to bureaucratic scrutiny form the subject matter being investigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">A second consideration making careful judicial scrutiny of jurisdiction necessary in this case is the obvious difference between the scope of investigatory authority vested in agencies such as the FTC,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> SEC,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or the Administrator of the Department of Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Division <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> on the one hand, and the FEC on the other. The former agencies are vested with broad duties to gather and compile information and to conduct periodic investigations concerning business practices. But the FEC has no such roving statutory functions. On the contrary, investigations such as the one conducted here may begin only if an individual first files a signed, sworn, notarized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>complaint with the Commission.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s duty thereafter is \u201cexpeditiously\u201d to conduct a confidential investigation of the complaint. 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 437g(aX3). Plainly, mere \u201cofficial curiosity\u201d will not suffice as the basis for FEC investigations,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> as it might in others. <em>Cf. United States v. Morton Salt Co., supra, </em>338 U.S. at 652, 70 S.Ct. at 368 (FTC subpoena enforcement proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The third, and most important reason for heightened judicial concern over the absence of jurisdiction is the delicate nature of the materials demanded in this broad subpoena. As already described, the subject matter of these materials represents the very heart of the organism which the first amendment was intended to nurture and protect: political expression and association concerning federal elections and officeholding. The FEC first demands <em>all </em>available materials which concern a certain political group\u2019s \u201cinternal communications,\u201d wherein its decisions \u201cto support or oppose any individual in any way for nomination or election to the office of President in 1980\u201d are revealed. J.A. at 4-7. Then this federal agency, whose members are nominated by the President, demands <em>all </em>materials concerning communications among various groups whose alleged purpose was to defeat the President by encouraging a popular figure from within his party to run against him. As a final measure, the FEC demands a listing of every official, employee, staff member and volunteer of the group, along with their respective telephone numbers, without any limitation on when or to what extent those listed participated in any MNPL activities. The government thus becomes privy to knowledge concerning which of its citizens is a \u201cvolunteer\u201d for a group trying to defeat the President at the polls. This information is of a fundamentally different constitutional character from the commercial or financial data which forms the bread and butter of SEC or FTC investigations,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> since release of such information to the government carries with it a real potential for chilling the free exercise of political speech and association guarded by the first amendment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Current first amendment jurisprudence makes clear that before a state or federal body can compel disclosure of information which would trespass upon first amendment freedoms, a \u201csubordinating interest of the State\u201d must be proffered, and it must be \u201ccompelling.\u201d <em>NAACP v. Alabama, </em>357 U.S. 449, 463, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 1172, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958) <em>(quoting Sweezy v. New Hampshire, </em>354 U.S. 234, 265, 77 S.Ct. 1203, 1219, 1 L.Ed.2d 1311 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., concurring)).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has warned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\">It is particularly important that the exercise of the power of compulsory process be carefully circumscribed when the investigative process tends to impinge upon such highly sensitive areas as freedom of speech or press, freedom of political association, and freedom of communication of ideas ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><em>Sweezy v. New Hampshire, supra, </em>354 U.S. at 245, 77 S.Ct. at 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In particular, the FEC\u2019s demand for a list of all members and volunteers of this political group implicates the rigorously protected first amendment interest in privacy of political association.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">It is hardly a novel perception that compelled disclosure of affiliation with groups engaged in advocacy may constitute [an] effective . . . restraint on freedom of association .... This Court has recognized the vital relationship between freedom to associate and privacy in one\u2019s associations. . . . Inviolability of privacy in group association may in many circumstances be indispensible to preservation of freedom of association ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-11\"><em>NAACP v. Alabama, supra, </em>357 U.S. at 462, 78 S.Ct. at 1171-1172. <em>See also Bates v. Little Rock, supra, </em>361 U.S. at 523, 80 S.Ct. at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">We do not here demand of the FEC that it show a compelling interest before it may obtain the information it seeks. Instead, we may assume <em>arguendo </em>that if the FEC has statutory jurisdiction to conduct this investigation, then a compelling interest for the subpoenaed information can be shown. But if, on the other hand, the FEC lacks jurisdiction to enforce contribution limitations on \u201cdraft\u201d groups, then no compelling interest for the subpoenaed information can possibly exist. The highly sensitive character of the information sought simply makes it all the more important that the court be convinced that jurisdiction exists to conduct this investigation before it enforces subpoenas issued pursuant thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">A final factor which causes us to carefully examine jurisdiction at this stage is that the Commission\u2019s assertion of juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>diction here rests solely upon a legal interpretation of the statute which does not depend upon any facts sought to be gleaned through the subpoena.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Commission has already determined that Senator Kennedy was <em>not </em>a candidate for President as of August 17, 1979, but it nevertheless asserts that \u201cdraft-Kennedy\u201d activities both before and after that date are controlled by FECA\u2019s reporting and contribution provisions. FEC Advisory Opinion 1979 \u2014 40 (Aug. 17, 1979). <em>See also </em>FEC Advisory Opinion 1979 \u2014 49 (Oct. 5, 1979). No matter what facts it finds through this investigation, the requisite jurisdiction for the investigation itself must stand or fall on the purely legal claim that \u201cdraft\u201d groups are \u201cpolitical committees\u201d under FECA. The Commission does seek additional facts regarding the affiliation question,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> but this will not alter the Commission\u2019s legal assertion concerning jurisdiction over draft groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">After reviewing these particular characteristics of the FEC subpoena, we conclude that where the Commission seeks judicial enforcement of a sweeping subpoena, issued pursuant to an unprecedented investigation which intrudes upon centrally important first amendment associational and advocacy interests, and where the FEC\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction to conduct the investigation rests solely upon a legal interpretation of a statute without any need for additional facts, then it is essential for a court to assure, itself affirmatively that the investigation is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission before lending its authority to enforcement of a subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">III. FEC JURISDICTION OVER \u201cDRAFT CANDIDATE\u201d GROUPS</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">The sole proffered jurisdictional basis for this FEC subpoena is a complaint alleging that MNPL\u2019s contributions to various \u201cdraft-Kennedy\u201d groups in excess of $5,000 violated the contribution limitations of FECA. <em>See </em>pp. 383-384 <em>supra. </em>The Act provides that \u201c[n]o multicandidate political committee shall make contributions\u2014 ... to any other political committee in any calendar year which, in the aggregate, exceed $5,000.\u201d 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a)(2).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> MNPL argues that none of the groups to which it gave contributions were \u201cpolitical committee[s]\u201d for purposes of this contribution limitation, and that therefore the FEC lacks subject matter jurisdiction to conduct its investigation. The FEC, taking the opposite view, asserts that the \u201cdraft-Kennedy\u201d groups are \u201cpolitical committeefs].\u201d The Act defines the operative terms as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-12\">\u201cpolitical committee\u201d means any committee, club, association, or other group of persons which receives contributions or makes expenditures during a calendar year in the aggregate amount exceeding $1,000;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>\u201ccontribution\u201d\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">(1) means a gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value made for the purpose of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">(A) influencing the nomination for election, or election, of any person to Federal office or for the purpose of influencing the results of a primary held for the selection of delegates to a national nominating convention of a political party, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">(B) influencing the results of an election held for the expression of a preference for the nomination of persons for election to the office of President of the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">\u201cexpenditure\u201d\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">(1) means a purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of value, made for the purpose of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-10\">(A) influencing the nomination for election, or the election, of any person to Federal office, or to the office of presidential and vice-presidential elector; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-11\">(B) influencing the results of a primary election held for the selection of delegates to a national nominating convention of a political party or for the expression of a preference for the nomination of persons for election to the office of President of the United States[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">2 U.S.C. \u00a7 431(d), (e), (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">On its face, the statute might seem to include as political committees not only \u201cdraft candidate\u201d groups like the ones in this case, but also issue-oriented groups, lobbying organizations, religious bodies, and communal associations of all sorts.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976), however, the Supreme Court explicitly recognized the potentially vague and overbroad character of the \u201cpolitical committee\u201d definition in the context of FECA\u2019s disclosure requirements, and limited it appropriately.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-18\">The general requirement that \u201cpolitical committees\u201d and candidates disclose their expenditures could raise similar vagueness problems, for \u201cpolitical committee\u201d is defined only in terms of amount of annual \u201ccontributions\u201d and \u201cexpenditures,\u201d and could be interpreted to reach groups engaged purely in issue discussion. <em>The lower courts have construed the words \u201cpolitical committee\u201d more narrowly. To fulfill the purposes of the Act they need only encompass organizations that are under the control of a candidate or the major purpose of which is the nomination or election of a candidate. Expenditures of candidates and of \u201cpolitical committees\u201d so construed can be assumed to fall within the core area sought to be addressed by Congress. They are, by definition, campaign related.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-19\">424 U.S. at 79, 96 S.Ct. at 663 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-20\">The <em>Buckley </em>Court felt that a more expansive definition of \u201cpolitical committee\u201d would have been constitutionally dangerous, since once any group of Americans is found to be a \u201cpolitical committee\u201d it must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>then submit to an elaborate panoply of FEC regulations requiring the filing of dozens of forms, the disclosing of various activities, and the limiting of the group\u2019s freedom of political action to make expenditures or contributions. The Court declared that such limitations \u201coperate in an area of the most fundamental First Amendment activities.\u201d 424 U.S. at 14, 96 S.Ct. at 632. Specifically, the Court found only one \u201cconstitutionally sufficient justification\u201d which would enable the contribution limitations of FECA to survive: \u201cto limit the actuality and appearance of corruption resulting from large individual financial contributions\u201d to candidates. <em>Id. </em>at 12-28, 96 S.Ct. at 631-639. <em>See also Common Cause v. Schmitt, supra, </em>512 F.Supp. at 494. The Court made it clear that since the contribution limitations interfered with \u201cfundamental First Amendment interests,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 23, 96 S.Ct. at 636, the means chosen by Congress to promote this important goal had to be \u201cclosely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25, 96 S.Ct. at 638. The Court found that FECA\u2019s limitation on contributions to candidates and their political committees was \u201cfocus[ed] precisely\u201d on \u201cthe narrow aspect of political association where the <em>actuality and potential for corruption have been identified </em>. . .. \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28, 96 S.Ct. at 639 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">But where a group\u2019s activities are not related in any way to a person who has decided to become a candidate, the \u201cactuality and potential for corruption\u201d are far from having been \u201cidentified.\u201d Draft groups may vary widely in character, from those wishing to encourage a particular individual\u2019s entrance as a candidate, to those encouraging a whole field of possible candidates, all of whom meet the group\u2019s particular policy or personal qualifications. Draft groups do have one thing in common, however: they aim to produce some day a candidate acceptable to them, but they have not yet succeeded. Therefore none are promoting a \u201ccandidate\u201d for office, as Congress uses that term in FECA.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has found, however, that unless a group is \u201cunder the control of a candidate or [its] major purpose ... is the nomination or election of a candidate,\u201d 424 U.S. at 79, 96 S.Ct. at 663, it cannot constitute a \u201cpolitical committee\u201d under the Act. \u201cPolitical committee\u201d was defined in this way by the Court for the purpose of \u201cfocusing precisely\u201d FECA\u2019s broadly worded provisions on \u201cthe narrow aspect of political association\u201d which could constitutionally be restricted, because its potential for corruption had been specifically identified by Congress. \u201cDraft\u201d groups, however, neither fall within the Court\u2019s limited definition of political committees, nor has their potential for corruption been specifically identified by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The narrowing construction given to the words \u201cpolitical committee\u201d by the lower courts which was endorsed in <em>Buckley </em>appeared in <em>United States v. National Committee for Impeachment, </em>469 F.2d 1135 (2d Cir. 1972); <em>ACLU, Inc. v. Jennings, </em>366 F.Supp. 1041 (D.D.C.1973) (three-judge court), <em>vacated as moot sub nom., Staats v. ACLU, </em>422 U.S. 1030, 95 S.Ct. 2646, 45 L.Ed.2d 686 (1975); and <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>519 F.2d 821 (D.C.Cir.1975) <em>(en banc), aff\u2019d in part and rev\u2019d in part, </em>424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976). \u201c[I]n the candid service of avoiding serious constitutional doubt,\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> each of these courts attempted, as we shall attempt, to find a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>reading of the statute which comports with first amendment safeguards. All three of these decisions recognized the grave constitutional difficulties inherent in construing the term \u201cpolitical committee\u201d to include groups whose activities are not under the control of a \u201ccandidate,\u201d or directly related to promoting or defeating a clearly identified \u201ccandidate\u201d for federal office.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">In <em>National Committee for Impeachment </em>a group opposed to the Vietnam War spent over $17,000 to purchase a newspaper advertisement which reprinted a resolution introduced in the House of Representatives calling for the impeachment of President Nixon. The advertisement was published in May of a Presidential election year. The Committee asserted in the advertisement that it would devote its resources to any candidate for election or reelection to the House of Representatives, regardless of party, in the order in which they indicated support for the impeachment resolution. The United States obtained an injunction in the district court requiring the purchasers of the advertisement to register as a \u201cpolitical committee\u201d under FECA, arguing that the advertisement was purchased and \u201cmade for the purpose of influencing\u201d the outcome of the 1972 Presidential race, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 431, and that the purchasers had publicly promised to support various candidates for federal office. In reversing the trial court\u2019s decision, the Second Circuit looked first to the statutory definitions of \u201cpolitical committee\u201d and \u201ccontribution,\u201d and to the appropriate legislative history. The court found the legislative history entirely unenlightening, 469 F.2d at 1139, but did conclude that \u201c[t]he words of the Act themselves point toward some more definite connection between candidate and committee than was here involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court then declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">We thus construe the words \u201cmade for the purpose of influencing\u201d in [section 431(e) and (f)] to mean an expenditure made with the authorization or consent, express or implied, or under the control, direct or indirect, of a candidate or his agents.... We also construe the Act to apply only to committees soliciting contributions or making expenditures the major purpose of which is the nomination or election of candidates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">The Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the words \u201cpolitical committee\u201d was followed in <em>ACLU, Inc. v. Jennings, supra. </em>There plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of the disclosure provisions of FECA, alleging that the standards for determining when a group becomes a \u201cpolitical committee\u201d under the Act were overbroad and vague, and imposed a chilling effect upon their exercise of first amendment freedoms since the provisions might be enforced against them. 366 F.Supp. at 1047, 1054-55. Recognizing the problem of overbreadth, the court adopted a \u201climited and narrow construction\u201d of the Act in order to \u201cremove any chilling effects worked upon the plaintiffs as well as obviate the necessity of this Court having to invalidate the [disclosure] Title.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1056. The court stated its \u201cfull agreement\u201d with the <em>National Committee </em>test, which required that there be a clear connection between expenditures or contributions and a \u201ccandidate\u201d for federal office. <em>Id. </em>at 1057. \u201cWe are satisfied,\u201d the court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">that by so construing the reaches of [the disclosure sections of FECA] the fears of constitutional infringements expressed by plaintiffs will be eliminated. They and other groups concerned with the open \u2022 discourse of views on prominent national issues may, under both this ruling and that of the Second Circuit, comfortably continue to exercise these rights and feel secure that by so doing their associational rights will not be encroached upon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-11\"><em>Id. </em>The third and final case cited by the Supreme Court, this court\u2019s decision in <em>Buckley v. Valeo, supra, </em>also expressly approved the limiting interpretations given to the words \u201cpolitical committee\u201d in <em>National Committee </em>and <em>Jennings.</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>We recognize that <em>National Committee </em>and <em>Jennings </em>concerned so-called non-partisan, issue-oriented groups, not so-called \u201cdraft\u201d committees. We also understand that at the time the statute was written and amended in 1971, 1974, and 1976, \u201cdraft\u201d groups were either unheard of, or else not considered as a factor of sufficient importance in the political process to warrant concern by Congress.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> But the question before us is not whether Congress specifically considered, and then exempted, \u201cdraft\u201d groups from the contribution and disclosure requirements when it enacted and amended FECA; rather, the question is simply whether this statute \u2014 which nowhere mentions \u201cdraft\u201d groups \u2014 should be read to imply coverage for such groups.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">In this delicate first amendment area, there is no imperative to stretch the statutory language, or read into it oblique inferences of Congressional intent to include \u201cdraft\u201d groups. Achieving a reasonable, constitutionally sound conclusion in this case requires just the opposite. \u201cIt is our duty in the interpretation of federal statutes to reach a conclusion which will avoid serious doubt of their constitutionality.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Unless, therefore, Congress made reasonably clear its intent to bring \u201cdraft\u201d groups \u2014 organizations whose contributions and expenditures do not relate to an identifiable \u201ccandidate\u201d \u2014 under the contribution limitations of section 441a, we must decline to extend that provision to cover such groups so as to avoid the constitutional problems which <em>Buckley </em>and its lower court predecessors were able to avoid by narrowly construing the term \u201cpolitical committee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ao6\">In examining the legislative history, we find ourselves in agreement with the <em>National Committee </em>court that \u201cCongress \u2018has voiced its wishes in muted strains and left it to the courts to discern the theme in the cacophony of political understanding.\u2019 \u201d 469 F.2d at 1139. The legislative history of the term \u201cpolitical committee\u201d is, in a word, uninformative, at least prior to 1979. But although not dispositive, we do find that the legislative history of the 1979 Amendments to FECA does shed some light on the question whether \u201cdraft\u201d groups were, in 1979, considered by Congress to be subject to the contribution and disclosure provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Prior to the 1979 Amendments, the reporting requirement of FECA mandated that \u201ceach treasurer of a political committee supporting a candidate or candidates for election to federal office . . . shall file with the Commission reports of receipts and expenditures on forms to be prescribed or approved by it.\u201d 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 434(a)(1). Effective January 8, 1980, however, the law was amended to delete any reference to \u201csupporting a candidate or candidates for election to federal office,\u201d so that \u201cdraft\u201d groups would be required to comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>the reporting requirement. The House Report on the FECA Amendments of 1979 stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\">Each treasurer of a political committee is required to file reports of receipts and disbursements. Under the current Act, only treasurers of a political committee supporting a candidate or candidates were required to file. The change was made to insure that organizations set up to \u201cdraft\u201d individuals who are not actually candidates will be required to report.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvO\">H.R.Rep.No.96-422, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 15 (1979) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 2860, 2874.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">This change in the reporting requirements of FECA was the result of repeated efforts by the FEC to obtain jurisdiction over \u201cdraft\u201d groups. As early as 1975 the Commission stated in its legislative recommendations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">Thought should be given to <em>amending the law </em>to make the <em>contribution limitations </em>applicable to draft movements. Under the present law, an individual is not a <em>candidate </em>unless he takes the action necessary to get on the ballot, makes or raises, or authorizes a person to make or raise, contributions or expenditures on his behalf or takes affirmative action to become elected to federal office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">FEC 1975 Annual Report at 79 (emphasis supplied). This statement clearly indicates that the Commission believed that \u201cdraft movements\u201d were not covered by contribution limitations because they were not related to a \u201ccandidate,\u201d as that term is defined by statute. Again in 1976, the Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">The Congress may wish to consider amending the Act to bring draft movements within the <em>reporting provisions </em>and <em>contribution limitations.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">FEC 1976 Annual Report at 74-5 (emphasis supplied). Similar statements were made by the FEC in its 1977 and 1978 reports.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">In 1979 Congress finally accepted the Commission\u2019s recommendation to require that \u201cdraft\u201d groups file reports as political committees. The writers of the House report apparently believed that \u201cdraft\u201d groups should be treated as political committees for some purposes, at least. But there is no indication from the 1979 Amendments or the legislative history that such \u201cdraft\u201d groups were to be bound by the contribution limitations.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Certainly no such inference can be made regarding the state of the law prior to 1979. Indeed not even a whisper about limiting contributions to \u201cdraft\u201d groups has ever been heard in the legislative history of FECA. It is therefore clear that Congress has never acted expressly to bring \u201cdraft\u201d groups within the coverage of contribution limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">All of this \u2014 the absence of any indication that Congress affirmatively intended to make \u201cdraft\u201d groups political committees for contribution purposes; the Commission\u2019s admission that prior to 1979 Congress never even faced the issue of \u201cdraft\u201d groups; the Commission\u2019s repeated pleas to <em>amend </em>the law to make the contribution limits applicable; Congress\u2019 limited response to such pleas, which addressed only the reporting issue; and, finally, <em>Buckley\u2019s </em>judicial gloss limiting the definition of \u201cpolitical committees\u201d which could constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>tionally be regulated \u2014 compels us to conclude that the Commission lacked subject matter jurisdiction over allegations that groups seeking only to \u201cdraft\u201d Senator Kennedy to become a \u201ccandidate\u201d some time in the future have violated the contribution limitations of FECA. Whatever the post-1979 situation, it is clear to us that in this case the contribution limitations did not apply to the nine groups whose activities did not support an existing \u201ccandidate,\u201d but merely represented attempts to convince the voters \u2014 or Mr. Kennedy himself \u2014 that he would make a good \u201ccandidate,\u201d or should become a \u201ccandidate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In order to insure that the Commission\u2019s investigations comport with the fundamental first amendment interest in guarding constitutionally protected information from unlawful disclosure, we believe that when a serious and novel question of the Commission\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is presented, an essential prerequisite for enforcing an FEC subpoena is a determination by the district court that subject matter jurisdiction exists for the investigation. Since the FEC lacked jurisdiction to control \u201cdraft\u201d group contributions, the subpoena should not have been enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">There may be cases, however, where the Commission asserts a need for additional factual information before a decision on the jurisdictional question can reasonably be made. <em>Cf. </em>text at note 19 <em>supra. </em>If the court so finds, then it may adopt a two-step procedure similar to one used in <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Ass\u2019n v. FEC,</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a procedure designed to strike an appropriate balance between the need for effective investigations and the preservation of first amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ment liberties.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Initially, the court may enforce a subpoena limited to that information which will allow the PEC to ascertain whether it does or does not have jurisdiction. If jurisdiction for a full investigation appears to exist, a broader subpoena seeking evidence of a violation may then be enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">In this case, for example, the FEC may now wish to proceed with its investigation on another jurisdictional basis, alleging, for example, that these pro-Kennedy groups were, or may have been, operating on behalf of <em>candidate </em>Kennedy. A subpoena requesting information about when Senator Kennedy actually became a candidate might, in such a case, be enforceable. If after this jurisdictional investigation the Commission can demonstrate subject matter jurisdiction by showing, for example, that Senator Kennedy was a \u201ccandidate\u201d after August 17,1979, then a second, broader, subpoena may follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">But a sweeping demand by the FEC for membership lists and internal communications of a political group over which no showing of jurisdiction has been made cannot now be approved by this court without ignoring vitally important constitutional freedoms by which Americans conduct their political affairs. The district court\u2019s order is therefore vacated, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\n<em>Order vacated; case remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-15\">.

Those concerns are particularly acute where a governmental entity is investigating the press in connection with the dissemination of political matter.... Both the Constitution and the statutory exemption for press activities suggest that . . . judicial scrutiny [at] a later stage in the administrative process is not properly applicable to these circumstances. This is easily demonstrated in the context of a more extreme example: If a newspaper relying on a secret source were publishing a series of articles containing derogatory information about the incumbent President during his campaign for reelection, and the FEC undertook to investigate the newspaper asking among other questions the source of the information published, could it seriously be contended that an application by the newspaper for judicial intervention would be premature because of the preliminary stage of the FEC\u2019s proceedings? In my view the statute, in creating an exemption for the press in its news and opinion dissemination function, demands the FEC not even to investigate such circumstances and authorizes court intervention if the FEC oversteps the limitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">Because factual questions existed regarding whether the Commission had statutory authority to conduct its investigation, the court adopted a two-step process to govern its continuation.
