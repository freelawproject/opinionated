SKELLY WRIGHT.</p>\n<author id=\"b1293-21\">J. SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1293-22\">The appellant, William Camisano, who is currently serving a prison sentence for extortion, was summoned to testify about organized crime before a Senate subcommittee. After he refused to testify despite a grant of immunity, the District Court cited him for civil contempt and imposed a sentence. In this appeal Cammisano argues that the District Court erred in approving the grant of immunity and in sentencing him for civil contempt. Finding both the grant of immunity and the sentence for civil contempt to be proper, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-23\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-24\">In early April 1980 the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations voted to hold hearings on mob violence and organized crime. As part of those hearings the Subcommittee sought to obtain the testimony of the appellant, who since January 3, 1979 has been serving a five-year sentence for violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 (1976). Accordingly, the Subcommittee issued a subpoena to Cammisano and directed the Senate Legal Counsel to obtain a court order granting Cammisano immunity for testimony to be given before the Subcommittee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, on April 10, the Senate Legal Counsel notified the Attorney General of the Subcommittee\u2019s in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>tention to seek such a court order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And five days later, on April 15, the Department of Justice informed<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Senate Legal Counsel that it had no objection to such a court order and that it. was waiving the 10-day notice requirement of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6005(b)(3) (1976), under which at least 10 days must elapse between the time the Attorney General is notified of a committee\u2019s intention to obtain such an order and the time the request is actually made. On April 18 Senate Legal Counsel formally applied to the District Court for an order of immunity for Cammisano, an order which the court issued that day.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">Cammisano appeared before the Subcommittee on May 1, 1980. He refused, however, to answer any questions other than preliminary ones, such as regarding his name, current address, and criminal record.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He repeatedly stated that his refusal to answer questions was based on his rights under the Constitution and the terms of his plea bargain agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following Cam-misano\u2019s refusal to answer the series of questions, the Subcommittee informed him of the District Court\u2019s immunity order, under which Cammisano was granted \u201cuse\u201d immunity<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and directed not to refuse to answer any questions on the basis of his right against self-incrimination. Cammisa-no nevertheless continued to refuse to answer any questions, giving the same objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-11\">In view of Cammisano\u2019s recalcitrance the full Senate, upon the recommendation of the Committee on Govermental Operations,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> activated the civil enforcement regime established under Section 705 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 288d (Supp. Ill 1979), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1364 (Supp. II 1978). By resolution the full Senate directed Senate Legal Counsel to \u201cbring a civil action * * * to enforce the subcommittee\u2019s subpena to William Cammisano * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thereupon, Senate Legal Counsel applied to the District Court for the District of Columbia for an order enforcing the subpoena. Over Cammisano\u2019s objections the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>Court, on October 24, 1980, granted the application and ordered Cammisano to answer the questions of the Subcommittee.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-4\">In early December 1980 the Subcommittee accordingly gave Cammisano notice that he would again be called to testify about organized crime. Two days after Cammisa-no received notice, however, he signed a stipulation with the Subcommittee, providing that if he \u201cappeared before the Subcommittee * * * he would respectfully refuse to answer\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> its questions. Having been frustrated again in its effort to obtain the testimony of Cammisano, the Subcommittee, through Senate Legal Counsel, returned to the District Court and moved that it enter, pursuant to Section 705(f)(1) of the Ethics in Government Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1364 (Supp. II 1978), an order holding Cammisa-no in civil contempt. Over the objections of Cammisano the District Court, on December 29, 1980, held him in contempt and ordered that he be incarcerated until he answered the questions of the Subcommittee.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The order stated, however, that the period of incarceration \u201cshall not exceed the period in which the Subcommittee continues to certify an interest in the testimony of Cammisa-no, and shall end at the adjournment of the 97th Congress.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-11\">From this order, and the District Court\u2019s earlier order of October 24, 1980,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Cammi-sano appeals to this court, challenging both the validity of the grant of immunity and the lawfulness of the civil contempt sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-12\">II. THE IMMUNITY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"amc-dedup-0\">The District Court issued its immunity order, under which Cammisano was granted use immunity and compelled to answer the Subcommittee\u2019s questions, pursuant to its authority under Sections 6002 and 6005 of Title 18.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Relying on two technical objections, Cammisano argues that the immunity order was invalid under the terms of Section 6005 and that he was accordingly not required to answer the legitimate questions of the Subcommittee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-13\">Cammisano\u2019s first argument is that the 10-day notice requirement contained in Section 6005(b)(3) was not satisfied. This subsection reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-14\">(b) Before issuing an order under subsection (a) of this section, a United States district court shall find that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-15\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>(3) ten days or more prior to the day on which the request for such an order was made, the Attorney General was served with notice of an intention to request the order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">In the instant case the Department of Justice waived the 10-day notice requirement. Thereupon, only eight days after having notified the Attorney General of his intent to apply to the District Court for an immunity order, Senate Legal Counsel formally made such application. Cammisano argues that the 10-day notice requirement is mandatory, leaving the Department of Justice no discretion to waive it, and that the immunity order was consequently invalid under Section 6005(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">We must reject Cammisano\u2019s narrow interpretation of the notice requirement. The legislative history of Section 6005(b)(3) reflects two purposes behind the 10-day notice requirement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> First, a 10-day notice period provides the Department of Justice with \u201ctime to \u2018lobby\u2019 for a change of mind\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> on the part of the congressional committee should the Attorney General object to the grant of immunity. Second, the notice period gives the Attorney General \u201can opportunity to insulate from the immunity grant any incriminating data already in his files prior to the witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As is evident from these twin aims, the 10-day notice requirement was plainly intended to benefit <em>solely </em>the Department of Justice. And in view of that intent, it would be anomalous to hold that the notice requirement cannot be waived by the Department, its sole intended beneficiary, but must instead be administered in a manner antithetical to the interests of the Department. We decline to adopt such a bizarre rendering of Section 6005(b)(3). Instead we interpret the section consonant with congressional intent and common sense, and hold that the Department may waive the 10-day notice requirement.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-8\">In challenging the District Court\u2019s immunity order, Cammisano secondly argues that the court improperly issued the order prior to his refusal to answer questions before the Subcommittee. Under Section 6005, Cammisano contends, the District Court may issue immunity orders \u201conly after the witness \u2018refuses\u2019 \u201d to answer questions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Cammisano\u2019s contention is undercut, however, by the language of Section 6005(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-9\">In the case of any <em>individual who </em>has been or <em>may be called to testify </em>or provide other information at any proceeding before either House of Congress, or any committee, or any subcommittee of either House, or any joint committee of the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>Houses, a United States district court shall issue, in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, upon the request of a duly authorized representative of the House of Congress or the committee concerned, an order requiring such individual to give testimony or provide other information which he refuses to give or provide on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination, such order to become effective as provided in section 6002 of this part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1297-4\">(Emphasis added.) By its very terms the section permits District Courts to issue an immunity order before the witness has appeared before the congressional <em>body </em>\u2014 i. e., \u201c[i]n the case of any individual who * * * may be called to testify * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">Cammisano reads Section 6005(a) to the contrary, relying on the language in the section describing the order to be issued as one \u201crequiring such individual to give testimony or provide other information which he <em>refuses </em>to give or provide on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination * * (Emphasis added.) But Cammisano is mistaken in construing this language as prohibiting courts from issuing an immunity order prior to the witness\u2019 refusal to answer questions. Rather, the language relied on simply means that an immunity order issued under Section 6005 is not effective until the witness refuses to answer questions, although the District Court may have issued the order prior to the witness\u2019 appearance.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-9\">Any remaining doubt that Section 6005 permits preappearance issuances of immunity orders is dispelled by the legislative history of the section.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In testimony before a House subcommittee the Deputy Director of the Federal Commission that drafted the model provision from which Section 6005 originated<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> stated that the language now contained in Section 6005(a) permits issuance of an immunity order \u201cin advance of the witness\u2019 actually appearing under oath and being asked a question.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The benefit to be derived from permitting advance -orders is obvious. As the Deputy Director pointed out, \u201c[A]n advance order will permit, in those cases where the witness is willing to answer if he is granted immunity, the procedure to go forward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>without having to convene twice the body before whom he is testifying.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">III. THE CIVIL CONTEMPT SENTENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">Having failed to obtain the testimony of the appellant despite a grant of immunity, the Senate Subcommittee proceeded to seek enforcement of its subpoena through the civil contempt mechanism of Section 705 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 288(d) (Supp. Ill 1979), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1364 (Supp. II 1978). This was the first attempt to do so under the newly enacted law. Prior to 1978 Congress had only two means of enforcing compliance with its subpoenas: a statutory criminal contempt mechanism<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and the inherent congressional contempt power.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Neither means, however, permitted a witness to challenge judicially \u201cthe legality of the inquiry or procedures, and then to purge himself of his contempt by testifying if his contentions were not judicially upheld * * <em>United States v. Fort, </em>443 F.2d 670, 677 (D.C.Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 U.S. 932, 91 S.Ct. 2255, 29 L.Ed.2d 710 (1971). Responding to this deficiency, Congress enacted the mechanism for civil enforcement of Senate subpoenas contained in the Ethics in Government Act of 1978.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> This new civil enforcement mechanism, employed in this case, is relatively simple. If an individual refuses, or threatens to refuse, to comply with a Senate subpoena, the Senate may request a court order requiring the individual to comply with the subpoena. If the individual continues to disobey the court order, the District Court is directed to initiate a civil contempt proceeding before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-12\">Cammisano advances three arguments for reversing the order of the District Court holding him in civil contempt. His first argument is that the action of the District Court violated his 1978 plea bargain agreement. The relevant portion of the plea bargain agreement, as it was stated by the prosecutor, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-13\">[T]he government has agreed or has noted that the defendant has expressed his concern about further indictments that the government may be contemplating or planning. The government will represent as part of this deal or agreement that it has no knowledge of any other investigations of the defendant and, therefore, has no intention of recommending any indictment upon facts presently within the knowledge of the government, that is indictment of defendant William Cammisa-no.<footnotemark>[29]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1298-14\">Cammisano argues that \u201chis incarceration for contempt certainly constitutes prosecution and punishment for matters within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>knowledge of the Justice Department at the time he entered his plea.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AWVn\">We are unpersuaded by Cammisano\u2019s argument. The terms of the plea bargain agreement plainly do not preclude the Government \u2014 in this case the Senate \u2014 from seeking to secure the testimony of Cammi-sano.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Moreover, since the plea agreement only precludes <em>criminal indictments </em>of Cam-misano based on facts then known to the Government, a proceeding and sentence for <em>civil </em>contempt would be outside the scope of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-4\">Cammisano\u2019s second argument concerning the contempt sentence is that the District Court, by ordering his incarceration for civil contempt to interrupt the sentence he is currently serving for extortion, violated several provisions of law and abused its discretion. Cammisano\u2019s argument is foreclosed, however, by this court\u2019s <em>en banc </em>decision in <em>United States v. Liddy, </em>510 F.2d 669 (D.C.Cir.1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 980, 95 S.Ct. 1408, 43 L.Ed.2d 661 (1975). In <em>Liddy </em>this court held it lawful for a civil contempt sentence to interrupt a criminal <em>sentence </em>previously imposed.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Moreover, seven other circuits<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> have adopted a rule permitting civil contempt sentences to interrupt criminal sentences, and \u201cno circuit which has addressed the issue has held otherwise.\u201d <footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-10\">Cammisano\u2019s final argument is that the civil enforcement mechanism enacted as part of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 violates the constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection and permits cruel and unusual punishment, since it \u201cpermits the indefinite incarceration of Mr. Cammisano and others proceeded against in similar circumstances for so long as the Senate, its committee or subcommittee certifies a continuing interest in the information.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Unfortunately, Cammisano\u2019s argument is not properly presented at this juncture, since he does not face unending incarceration. The Subcommittee has only certified continuing interest in his testimony through the end of the 97th Congress,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and the District Court held that Cammisano\u2019s incarceration under the order here challenged \u201cshall not exceed the period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>in which the Subcommittee continues to certify an interest in the testimony of Cam-misano, and shall end at the adjournment of the 97th Congress.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">And even if Cammisano\u2019s attack on the constitutionality of the statute were properly presented at this time, we would be compelled to reject it. In <em>Shillitani v. United States, </em>384 U.S. 364, 86 S.Ct. 1531, 16 L.Ed.2d 622 (1966), the Supreme Court recognized that recalcitrant grand jury witnesses may be incarcerated for civil contempt until the end of a grand jury inquiry, and that \u201cthe sentences of imprisonment may be continued or reimposed if the witnesses adhere to their refusal to testify before a successor grand jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371 n.8, 86 S.Ct. at 1536 n.8. We can see no distinction between that situation and the situation hypothesized by the appellant, where successive civil contempt sentences are imposed on a Senate witness who continues to refuse to answer legitimate questions and where the Senate, or committee or subcommittee thereof, continues to express interest in the witness\u2019 testimony.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the orders of the District Court from which Cammisano appeals are</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1293-25\">.

This case is not the first instance in which the District Court for the District of Columbia has issued an immunity order under \u00a7 6005 after the Government has waived the notice requirement. <em>See Application of U.S. Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, </em>361 F.Supp. 1282 (D.D.C.1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1296-14\">. Brief for appellant at 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">. Indeed, this was the timing of events in the instant case. The District Court issued the immunity order on April 18, 1980, prior to Cammisano\u2019s appearance before the Subcommittee on May 1, 1980. The order did not become effective, however, until it was read to Cammisano on May 1, after he refused to answer legitimate questions of the Subcommittee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">. Our reading of the section is also buttressed by the holdings of other courts permitting prospective immunity orders under \u00a7 6003, which deals with grand jury and court witnesses. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leyva, </em>513 F.2d 774, 776 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>In re Weir, </em>520 F.2d 662, 665 (9th Cir. 1975). Significantly, \u00a7 6003(a) contains the same language contained in \u00a7 6005(a) on which Cammisano relies for his contention that prospective orders are precluded. While Cam-misano concedes that prospective orders are authorized under \u00a7 6003 as well as under \u00a7 6004, which deals with witnesses in administrative proceedings, he distinguishes these two sections from \u00a7 6005 on the basis that \u00a7\u00a7 6003 and 6004 \u201ccontain specific language which authorizes a pre-appearance grant of immunity * * * to an \u2018individual who has refused or is likely to refuse to testify * * Brief for appellant at 11 <em>(quoting </em>\u00a7\u00a7 6003(b) and 6004(b)) (last ellipsis in original). Contrary to the claim of Cammisano, it is not the additional language in \u00a7\u00a7 6003(b) and 6004(b) that authorizes prospective immunity orders under \u00a7\u00a7 6003 and 6004. The additional language Cammisano cites <em>limits </em>the grant of immunity orders to certain situations; it does <em>not authorize </em>prospective immunity orders. For example, under \u00a7 6004(b) an administrative agency may issue an immunity order</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-11\">\u2022 <em>only if </em>in its judgment\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-12\">(1) the testimony * * * may be necessary to the public interest; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-13\">(2) such individual has refused or is likely to refuse to testify * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1297-14\">(Emphasis added.) The authority for prospective grants under \u00a7\u00a7 6003 and 6004 is instead found in the language of \u00a7\u00a7 6003(a) and 6004(a), authorizing orders \u201c[i]n the case of any individual who * * * may be called to testify,\u201d language identical to that contained in \u00a7 6005(a). <em>See In re Weir, supra, </em>520 F.2d at 665 (\u201cProspective grants of immunity appear to be contemplated by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6003(a) * *.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1297-15\">. <em>See </em>note 16 supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1297-16\">. <em>Federal Immunity of Witnesses Act, Hearings on H.R. 11157 and H.R. 12041 Before Subcommittee No. 3 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, </em>91st Cong., 1st Sess. 70 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1298-7\">. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1298-8\">. 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 192, 194 (1976).
