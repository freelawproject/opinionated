CAMPBELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Plaintiffs, Plymouth County Nuclear Information Committee, Inc. and six individual residents of Plymouth, Massachusetts,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> instituted this action in the Massachusetts Superior Court on April 19, 1979. Alleging separate counts of negligence, battery, trespass, and eminent domain, they sought, <em>inter alia, </em>to enjoin defendant Boston Edison Co. from operating the Pilgrim Unit I Nuclear Power Station (\u201cPilgrim I\u201d) and to recover damages for injuries allegedly caused by the plant\u2019s release of low-level radiation during the course of its normal operations. On May 9, 1979, the superior court denied both plaintiffs\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction and Boston Edison\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint. On May 10, 1979, Boston Edison removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, which subsequently denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">On December 15, 1980, the district court, in an oral ruling made at the close of argument,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> granted Boston Edison\u2019s motion to \u201cstrike\u201d those portions of the second amended complaint \u201cwhich deal with the injunctive relief requested with respect to future operation of Pilgrim I.\u201d While the scope of the district court\u2019s order is not entirely clear,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the stricken material centered around plaintiffs\u2019 request</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aj-dedup-0\">2. That the Defendant, Boston Edison, be preliminarily and permanently enjoined from continuing to operate the Pilgrim I nuclear power plant until: a) The Pilgrim I plant can be operated without the emission of dangerous quantities of radiation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-14\">The order to strike was predicated on the court\u2019s determination that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which licensed and oversees the operations of Pilgrim I, has exclusive authority to regulate the plant\u2019s radioactive effluent levels, and that federal legislation in the nuclear power field has \u201cpreempted\u201d state common law actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>seeking to enjoin operation of a federally licensed nuclear power facility.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We do not address this complicated preemption issue, however, since we conclude that the order to strike is not presently appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">Plaintiffs rely on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) as the basis for this court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s interlocutory order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 1292(a)(1), an exception to the general federal policy that only <em>final </em>decisions of the district courts are reviewable on appeal, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, authorizes appeal as of right from \u201cinterlocutory orders of the district courts . . . granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions.\u201d Plaintiffs contend that the order at issue here has the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of \u201crefusing\u201d the requests for injunctive relief contained in their complaint, and we agree. The district court has determined, as a matter of law, that such injunctive relief is unavailable, and has thus erected a \u201clegal barrier\u201d foreclosing any meaningful future consideration of a formal application for injunction, either interlocutory or permanent. <em>Stewart Warner Corp. v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>325 F.2d 822, 828-30 (2d Cir. 1963) (Friendly, J., dissenting), <em>cert. denied, </em>376 U.S. 944, 84 S.Ct. 800, 11 L.Ed.2d 767 (1964); <em>see General Electric Co. v. Marvel Rare Metals Co., 287 </em>U.S. 430, 433, 53 S.Ct. 202, 203, 77 L.Ed. 408 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The Supreme Court has made clear, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">[f]or an interlocutory order to be immediately appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1), ... a litigant must show more than that the order has the practical effect of refusing an injunction. Because \u00a7 1292(a)(1) was intended to carve out only a limited exception to the final judgment rule, we have construed the statute narrowly to ensure that appeal as of right under \u00a7 1292(a)(1) will be available only in circumstances where an appeal will further the statutory purpose of \u201cpermit[ting] litigants to effectually challenge interlocutory orders of serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence.\u201d <em>Baltimore Contractors, Inc. v. Bodinger, supra, </em>348 U.S. [176] at 181 [75 S.Ct. 249, 252, 99 L.Ed.2d 233]. Unless a litigant can show that an interlocutory order of the District Court might have \u201cserious, perhaps irreparable, consequence,\u201d and that the order can be \u201ceffectually challenged\u201d only by immediate appeal, the general congressional policy against piecemeal review will preclude interlocutory appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-10\"><em>Carson v. American Brands, Inc., </em>450 U.S. 79, 84, 101 S.Ct. 993, 996, 67 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">Interlocutory orders striking claims for injunctive relief, entered early in the course of litigation, will often satisfy this test, since the foreclosure of relief <em>pendente lite </em>may have an immediate, and potentially serious, impact of the sort justifying immediate appeal. <em>See Carson, </em>450 U.S. 86, 87, 101 S.Ct. at 998; <em>General Electric Co. v. Marvel Rare Metals Co., </em>287 U.S. at 433, 53 S.Ct. at 203; <em>cf. Gardner v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., </em>437 U.S. 478, 482, 98 S.Ct. 2451, 2454, 54 L.Ed.2d 477 (1978). In this case, however, at the time the order to strike was entered, plaintiffs\u2019 motion for preliminary relief had already been denied. <em>See supra. </em>Plaintiffs never sought to appeal this denial, nor did they, in the course of over a year and a half between the denial and the entry of the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>stant order,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> seek reconsideration of the denial in the district court or renew their request for an interlocutory injunction. The court\u2019s order striking this part of the complaint was not addressed to any renewed attempt by plaintiffs to secure preliminary relief, or even any effort by defendant aimed particularly at forestalling preliminary relief. To all appearances, preliminary relief, as opposed to final injunc-tive relief, had become in this case a dead issue. Under the circumstances, we think plaintiffs are hard pressed to demonstrate that the instant order has any <em>immediate </em>consequences of a serious nature, or that they will suffer \u201cirreparable harm\u201d pending final disposition of the case in the district court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Cf. </em>16 Wright, Miller, Cooper &amp; Gressman, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 3924, at 69-70 (1977) (dismissal of counts seeking preliminary and permanent injunc-tive relief should be immediately appealable under section 1292(a)(1) \u201conly if the request for a preliminary injunction was in fact being pressed\u201d). To be sure, the district court may have \u201cfinally\u201d determined the \u201clegal sufficiency\u201d of plaintiffs\u2019 claims for injunctive relief, <em>cf. Gardner, </em>437 U.S. at 481, 98 S.Ct. at 2453.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Even so, its order has the \u201cpractical effect\u201d only of denying <em>permanent </em>injunctive relief, and as such may be \u201ceffectually challenged\u201d on appeal from final judgment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Such an order, we think, is, despite whatever aspects of \u201cfinality\u201d it may possess, immediately appealable only pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">There are sound policy reasons that militate against permitting, as of right, interlocutory appeals from orders which affect only a claim to permanent relief. In general, the \u201ccongressional policy against piecemeal review\u201d seems increasingly a wise one in light of the ever crowded dockets of the courts of appeals. Moreover, there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>possibility that further proceedings in the district court will obviate the need for us to decide the intricate constitutional issue presented by this appeal. For example, a judgment against plaintiffs on their remaining claims might well moot any dispute over the availability of injunctive relief. And, of course, the district court remains free to modify its order prior to a final disposition on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">We therefore conclude that the district court\u2019s order is not appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-9\">. Plaintiffs have amended their complaint twice, and the current complaint names only three individual plaintiffs who purport to represent \u201call persons living within three (3) miles of the Pilgrim I nuclear power plant.\u201d Class certification is presently being sought in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b76-10\">. We do not think the fact that the order was oral and never reduced to writing affects its appealability. The parties have treated the district court ruling as being in the <em>form </em>of an appealable order. <em>Cf. Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis, </em>435 U.S. 381, 98 S.Ct. 1117, 55 L.Ed.2d 357 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b76-11\">. Defendant\u2019s motion specifically listed the portions of the complaint it sought to strike, including two prayers for relief in their entirety, portions of three requests for what would amount to declaratory relief, and various allegations. At the December 15 hearing, however, plaintiffs asserted that many of these sections had relevance to their claims for damages and medical treatment, as well as to the request for injunctive relief contained in prayer 2(a), <em>infra. </em>In response, the court, while \u201cal-lowfing] the motion to strike, whether I treat it as a motion to strike or motion to dismiss prayer 2(a),\u201d made \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d that its orders dealt only with \u201cthose portions of the allegations ... which deal with the injunctive relief requested with respect to future operation of Pilgrim I.\u201d It is unclear, however, exactly which portions of the complaint, other than prayer 2(a), have been stricken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b77-7\">. The court did not explicitly state its rationale for granting the motion at the December 15 hearing. It made reference, however, to a written memorandum and order it had entered in a related case \u2014 an order with which counsel for both sides were familiar \u2014 in which its preemption analysis was outlined in some detail. <em>Massachusetts Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities v. Civil Defense Agency, </em>C.A. 80-794-MC (D.Mass. May 12, 1980) (denying injunctive relief), <em>affd on other grounds, </em>No. 80-1250, slip op. (1st Cir. May 26, 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b77-13\">. The district court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion that it \u201cgrant ... leave to take an interlocutory appeal on this issue to the First Circuit.\u201d We take this to have been a motion for \u201ccertification\u201d of the issue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b); it might possibly be construed also as a request for entry of final judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b78-4\">. Plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint was not filed until September 9, 1980. However, neither of the amended complaints added any new grounds on which preliminary relief might be granted. (The first amended complaint deleted the \u201ceminent domain\u201d count and struck paragraphs relating to relief sought from state agencies which were subsequently dismissed pursuant to an agreement with plaintiffs. The second amended complaint was filed primarily to redefine the putative plaintiff class. It also deleted the requests for damages as such; instead, it prayed that certain questions pertaining to liability be submitted to the jury which, if decided in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, would serve as a predicate to individual damages claims.) Prayers for relief similar to the one stricken were contained in all three versions of the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b78-5\">. There is some indication that the immediate importance of the instant order, to both plaintiffs and defendant, lies primarily in its possible effect on the pending request for class certification. Plaintiffs have argued to the district court that the propriety of maintaining this suit as a class action should, because of the claims for injunctive and declaratory relief, be judged under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) rather than under the relatively more stringent requirements of' Rule 23(b)(3). It is clear, however, that whatever effect the order has on the motion for class certification it is insufficient to justify appeal under section 1292(a)(1). <em>Gardner v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., </em>437 U.S. 478, 98 S.ct. 2451, 54 L.Ed.2d 477 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b78-6\">. We note, however, that the district court has explicitly stated its willingness to reconsider the underlying legal issue dependent on the outcome of a case currently pending before the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b78-11\">. It is true that the district court was not barred, as of December 15, 1980, from entertaining a renewed request for an interlocutory injunction. <em>See Hill </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>428 F.2d 112, 114-15 (5th Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 1008, 91 S.Ct. 564, 27 L.Ed.2d 621 (1971); <em>Hamilton Watch Co. v. Benrus Watch Co., </em>206 F.2d 738, 742 (2d Cir. 1953); 1A Moore\u2019s <em>Federal Practice </em>(| 0.157[10.--2], at 133 (1980). It might therefore be argued that the instant order has the \u201cimmediate\u201d and \u201charmful\u201d effect of creating an obstacle to such reconsideration, even should circumstances change in a manner rendering the need for interim relief more compelling. However, the district court is still able to reconsider <em>all </em>of the interlocutory orders entered in this case, including the one currently sought to be appealed. Moreover, we think there would be a limit to the extent to which a motion for \u201creconsideration\u201d of a denial of a preliminary injunction, made long after the time for appeal of the initial order had passed, would render the denial subject to appellate review. <em>See </em>16 Wright, Miller, Cooper &amp; Gressman, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 3924, at 87-89 (1977). On balance, we think the possibility of serious or irreparable harm to plaintiffs pending final judgment is, in this case, too remote to warrant immediate appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
