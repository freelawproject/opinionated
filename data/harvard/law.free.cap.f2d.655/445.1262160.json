It raises the question of whether Shell violated the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2801-2841, when it terminated its lease with the Gatelys and then failed to renew Veracka\u2019s franchise. The district court held that it did not, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-16\">On May 18,1970, Shell leased the premises that the station occupies from the Gate-lys for a primary term of ten years, ending May 31, 1980. The lease provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2M\">If Shell does not have or does not exercise any then-current option to extend, this Lease shall be automatically extended from year to year, on the same covenants and conditions as herein provided, unless and until either Lessor or Shell terminates this Lease at the end of the primary term or the then-current extension period or any subsequent year, by giving the other at least thirty (30) days\u2019 notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An6\">Thus the lease, after May 31, 1980, was self-extending on a year-to-year basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Shell granted Veracka a sublease for three years beginning June 1, 1970 and entered into a three-year franchise agreement. The sublease and the franchise agreement were both renewed for two more three-year periods. The last sublease and agreement entered into were for the term June 1, 1979 through May 30, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">On April 9, 1979, before the beginning of the final franchise period, Shell wrote Ve-racka telling him that the underlying lease would expire on May 31,1980. Shell added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR0\">This letter is. . . formal notice to you that Shell\u2019s underlying lease might. .. not be extended or renewed with the result that Shell will not be able to renew your Lease and Dealer Agreement. If Shell should extend or renew its underlying lease, then Shell will expect to renew your Lease and Dealer Agreement....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">On May 23, 1979 and again on December 4, 1979, Shell wrote the Gatelys that it had decided against renewal of the base lease after it expired at the end of May 1980. On January 21, 1980, Shell wrote Veracka that it would not renew the sublease and dealer (franchise) agreement. The letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJk\">The reason for such nonrenewal is the loss of Shell\u2019s right to grant possession of the... station premises because of the expiration or other termination of an underlying lease between a third party and Shell covering the said premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Veracka then sought an injunction in federal district court, claiming that Shell had violated the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act which states that, with certain exceptions, \u201cno franchisor.. .of motor fuel .. . may.. . fail to renew any franchise rela-tionship____\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(a)(2). Ve-racka also claimed a violation of a related state law, Mass.Gen.Laws Am. ch. 93A and ch. 93E. The court granted Veracka\u2019s motion for preliminary injunctive relief. After further submissions by both parties, the court decided that Shell\u2019s action fell within the Act\u2019s exceptions. It vacated its preliminary injunction and entered summary judgment for Shell. Shell then terminated the Gatelys\u2019 lease. The Gatelys leased the premises to Concord Oil Company. And Veracka, who has at all times remained in possession of the service station, now buys its gasoline supplies from Concord Oil and sells them as a Gulf-affiliated dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-17\">Appellant\u2019s principal claim is that Shell\u2019s action does not fit within the Act\u2019s relevant exception. That exception is, in the language of the Act, \u201cthe occurrence of an event which is relevant to the franchise relationship and as a result of which nonre-newal of the franchise relationship is reasonable\u201d, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(C).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This broad phrase is more specifically defined, in relevant part, as, among other things, \u201c[a] loss of the franchisor\u2019s right to grant possession of the leased marketing premises through expiration of the underlying lease....\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(c)(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>lant argues that this language was meant to apply only to situations in which the loss of a lease was outside the control of the franchisor. In his view, the franchisor may sit by passively and wait for a lease to expire. But, he believes that the language of the exception does not apply when the franchisor takes affirmative steps to stop an otherwise automatic extension of a lease, as was the case in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">We do not accept this argument, for it fits neither the Act\u2019s language nor its purposes as revealed by its legislative history. The Act itself refers to \u201cexpiration\u201d of the lease, without reference to the expiration\u2019s cause. Given the practical difficulty in many instances of determining a specific \u201ccause\u201d of a lease\u2019s nonrenewal, this general wording is not surprising.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The legislative history of the Marketing Act shows that its basic effort to prevent franchise terminations reflects a recognition of the disparity of bargaining power between franchisor and franchisee and an effort to prevent coercive or unfair franchisor practices. S.Rep.No.95-731, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 17, 18, <em>reprinted in </em>[1978] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 873, 876-77; <em>Sachi v. Mobile Oil Corp., </em>[1980-81] Trade Reg.Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 63,044 (E.D.N.Y.1979). But, the exceptions are also broad, reflecting an intent to allow reasonable business judgments by the franchisor. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(3)(A)-(D); 123 Cong.Rec. 10383 (1977) (remarks of Rep. Dingell). Insofar as Congress explicitly considered the type of problem at issue here, its members seemed anxious to prevent a franchisor from taking over a successful station operation and appropriating the benefit of the goodwill that the franchisee had developed. <em>See </em>123 Cong.Rec. 10385 (1977) (remarks of Rep. Conte); <em>id. </em>at 10386 (remarks of Rep. Mikva). Thus, there may be instances in which the word \u201cexpiration\u201d is not to be taken literally. The Senate Report, for example, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">[I]t is not intended that termination or nonrenewal should be permitted based upon the expiration of a lease which does not evidence the existence of an arms length relationship between the parties and as a result of the expiration of which no substantive change in control of the premises results.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">S.Rep.No.95-731, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 38, <em>reprinted in </em>[1978] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 873, 896. But, this is not the situation presented here. Shell dealt with the Gatelys at arms length. Its decision not to extend the lease resulted in total loss of Shell\u2019s but not Yeracka\u2019s control. It made no effort to appropriate for itself any goodwill that Veracka had developed. Its actions amount to little more than a decision not to exercise an option to renew a lease \u2014 a situation specifically foreseen by the Senate as falling within the language of the exception. Indeed, the Senate Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-11\">Among the enumerated events is the loss of the franchisor\u2019s right to grant continued possession of the premises under certain circumstances. Expiration of the underlying lease could occur under a variety of circumstances including, for example, a <em>decision by the franchisor not to exercise an option to renew the underlying lease.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">S.Rep.No.95-731, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 38, <em>reprinted in </em>[1978] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 873, 896. (Emphasis added). Thus, we believe the district court correctly held that Shell refused to renew the franchise for a reason that the Act allows. <em>See Sachi v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>[1980-81] Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 63,044 at 77,194-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">Appellant also argues that Shell did not give him adequate notice. He states that Shell can use as an excuse \u201cthe occurrence of an event ... as a result of which nonre-newal ... is reasonable,\u201d only if \u201cthe event occurs during the period the franchise is in effect and the franchisor first acquired .. . knowledge\u201d of it \u201cnot more than 120 days prior to the date on which notification of . . . non-renewal is given. . . . \u201d 15 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>\u00a7 2802(b)(2)(C)(i).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In other words, Shell must notify Veracka within 120 days of the time it learns about the \u201cevent\u201d \u2014 in this case termination of the base lease. Verac-ka argues that Shell learned about the termination on May 23, 1979, when it first wrote the Gatelys it would not extend the lease. Veracka points out that Shell did not tell him that his franchise would not be renewed until January 21, 1980, more than 120 days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In the district court Shell called attention to the first part of the notice proviso, the clause that speaks of notice having been given about an \u201cevent which occurs during the period the franchise is in effect\u201d. Shell claims that the May 23 letter did not take place during the <em>final </em>franchise period. Shell adds that its second letter to the Gate-lys, dated December 4, 1979, was the only event that occurred during Veracka\u2019s <em>final </em>franchise period, and Shell told Veracka about nonrenewal less than 120 days thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">We need not decide this point, however, for we note that of the twelve separate items that the statute defines as comprising \u201can event ... as a result of which . . . nonrenewal ... is reasonable\u201d,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> expiration of the underlying lease (and no other) comes accompanied with its own special notice requirement. \u201cExpiration\u201d counts as an excusing \u201cevent\u201d only if the \u201cfranchisee was notified in writing, prior to the commencement of the .. . franchise\u201d about the \u201cduration of the underlying lease, and . . . of the fact that ... [it] might expire ... at the end\u201d of the franchise term. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(c)(4)(A),(B).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We agree with the court in <em>Gasper v. Chevron Oil Co., </em>490 F.Supp. 971, 975 (D.N.J.1980), that this specific notice requirement is <em>meant </em>to supplant the more general notice requirement applicable to the other eleven exculpatory items. For one thing, the 120 day requirement is well designed to force the franchisor to decide quickly whether such events as franchisee bankruptcy or misconduct justify nonrenewal. It prevents him from terminating a franchise for impermissible reasons while reaching into the distant past for an excuse that the statute allows. Such a rationale simply does not apply when an underlying lease expires. For an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>other thing, the 120 day requirement is not well suited to a base lease termination. To apply the 120 day requirement to the nonre-newal of a base lease would promote, as in this case, a search for a single \u201cnonrenew-ing occurrence\u201d during the franchise period. Yet, often there will be no such single occurrence and the effort to find one will simply promote unresolvable controversy. For these reasons, because the specific notice requirement is better suited to a lease expiration and because (as the district court found) it seems totally fair to franchisees, we hold that it, not the 120 day requirement, governs. Shell complied with that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Finally, appellant argues that the district court wrongly denied his pendent state claim that Shell violated Mass.Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 93E, \u00a7 5A. That provision makes it a \u201cviolation . . . for a supplier . . . not [to] renew a marketing agreement of any retail dealer without due cause. . . . \u201d It is clear, however, that state law simply tracks the federal law for present purposes. Congress specifically stated in the Marketing Act that \u201cno State . . . may continue in effect any provision of any law ... with respect to . . . the nonrenewal ... of any such franchise relationship unless such provision ... is the same as the applicable provision of this subchapter.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2806(a). And, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that in applying this portion of Chapter 93E, \u201cstate law must conform to Federal requirements.\u201d <em>Amoco Oil Co. v. Dickson, </em>389 N.E.2d 406, 408 n.2 (1979). Thus, an event that constitutes good cause under federal law must also constitute good cause under this similar state statute. <em>See also Exxon Corp. v. Georgia Ass\u2019n of Petroleum Retailers, </em>484 F.Supp. 1008, 1017 (N.D.Ga.1979), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>644 F.2d 1030 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Ted\u2019s Tire Service, Inc. v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., </em>470 F.Supp. 163, 164-65 (D.Conn.1979); S.Rep.No.95-731, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 45, <em>reprinted in </em>[1978] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 873, 903. And Shell has therefore complied with the Massachusetts Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.'</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>7</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(C) sets forth the following as a permissible ground for nonrenewal of a franchise relationship:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-10\">The occurrence of an event which is relevant to the franchise relationship and as a result of which termination of the franchise or nonrenewal of the franchise relationship is reasonable, if such event occurs during the period the franchise is in effect and the franchisor first acquired actual or constructive knowledge of such occurrence\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-11\">(i) not more than 120 days prior to the date on which notification of termination or non-renewal is given, if notification is given pursuant to section 2804(a) of this title;
