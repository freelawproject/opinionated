The sole issue raised by his appeal questions the district court\u2019s denial of a jury trial as sought by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">Bynum now concedes that federal jurisdiction is based upon the maritime nature of the cause of action,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(1). He does not dispute the lack of right to a jury trial in an admiralty or maritime claim, Fed.R.Civ.P. 38(e). However, Bynum contends that, because of the \u201csavings to suitors\u201d clause of \u00a7 1333(1), he is nevertheless entitled to a jury trial of the negligence cause of action pleaded, since two of the defendants were of citizenship diverse from his. We affirm the denial of a jury trial, finding that there is no diversity jurisdiction (permitting trial by jury) and that federal jurisdiction of his claim is exclusively based upon the maritime character of the cause of action asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-16\">By original and supplemental petitions, Bynum sues four defendants to recover for personal injuries resulting from their negligence while he was working for his employer as a harbor worker aboard a barge. His cause of action is based upon third-party negligence, a recovery recognized as allowable in federal court by Section 905(b) of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Nevertheless, . federal jurisdiction of Section 905(b) claims is based upon general maritime law, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(1), not independently upon Section 905(b)\u2019s statutory recognition of the right of recovery; and accordingly, assertion in federal court of a Section 905(b) claim confers no more right to a jury trial than does any other claim asserted in federal court by reason of its maritime jurisdiction. <em>Russell v. Atlantic and Gulf Stevedores, </em>625 F.2d 71 (5th Cir. 1980) (see note 1 <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-17\">Bynum contends, however, that \u2014 because of the diversity of citizenship of two of the defendants \u2014 he is entitled also to assert jury-triable diversity jurisdiction of his negligence action against them by virtue of the \u201csaving to suitors\u201d clause of 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>\u00a7 1333(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As summarized by Gilmore and Black, The Law of Admiralty 37 (2d ed. 1975), the effect of this clause \u201cis that a suitor who holds an <em>in personam </em>claim, which might be enforced by suit <em>in person-am </em>in admiralty, may also bring suit, at his election, in the \u2018common law\u2019 court \u2014 that is, by ordinary civil action in state court, or in federal court without reference to \u2018admiralty\u2019, given diversity of citizenship and the requisite jurisdictional amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The flaw in Bynum\u2019s argument is that, since two of the defendants are citizens of the same state (Louisiana) as he, the requisites of diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, are not met: In order to sustain diversity jurisdiction, there must be complete diversity between each defendant and each plaintiff. <em>Owen Equipment and Erection Company v. Kroger, </em>437 U.S. 365, 373-74, 98 S.Ct. 2396, 2402-03, 57 L.Ed.2d 274 (1978); 13 Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 3605 (1975).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By virtue of this requirement, diversity jurisdiction as a basis for jury trial is ineffectual as asserted against the two diverse defendants, since two non-diverse defendants are also joined upon a cause (or causes) of action arising under the general maritime law, even though jurisdiction of non-diverse defendants is asserted only on a (non-jury) maritime basis. <em>Powell v. Offshore Navigation, Inc., </em>644 F.2d 1063 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Accordingly, we find no error in the order of the district court denying a jury trial, and we AFFIRM the dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-14\">. As originally pleaded, the plaintiff Bynum also asserted federal-question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a), because the claim was asserted as arising under 33 U.S.C. 905(b) of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. For present purposes, Bynum concedes that this basis of federal jurisdiction is foreclosed by our subsequent decision in <em>Russell v. Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, </em>625 F.2d 71 (5th Cir. 1980), which rejected 1331 as basis for jurisdiction of a Section 905(b) claim, on its holding that the latter section did not create a new federal cause of action for third-party negligence but merely preserved the existing right of an injured worker to recover damages from third parties in accord with nonstatutory negligence principles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b705-9\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(1) provides (italics supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-10\">The district courts shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-11\">(1) Any civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, <em>saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b705-21\">. The cited section of Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, notes that the \u201cpendent parties\u201d doctrine does not permit a litigant to evade the complete-diversity requirement, <em>id., </em>at 620, see <em>Owen Equipment </em>cited <em>supra </em>in text, and that the only recognized exception to the requirement is in the case of statutory interpleader. <em>Id. </em>at 620-24.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
