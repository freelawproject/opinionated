The plaintiff also contends that the government did not adequately attempt to mitigate damages and that it improperly calculated damages on the resale. We hold for the defendant on all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-8\">In 1974, the Forest Supervisor of the Bighorn National Forest in Wyoming invited bids for the sale of standing timber there. The contract was to cover the cutting and sale of 3,390 MBF (thousand board feet) of timber, and the invitation specified a minimum bid of $56.66 per MBF. The successful bidder also would be required to build about 8.96 miles of road. The plaintiff and Wyoming Sawmills, Inc., were the only bidders. An oral auction was then held, at which the plaintiff was awarded the contract on its bid of $100 per MBF.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-9\">The contract, awarded in August 1974, was for a 3-year term ending September 30, 1977. At the end of the term the plaintiff had not felled a single tree. It had constructed 5.86 miles of road for which it earned a \u201cpurchaser credit\u201d of $92,869.80 which, under the contract, was to be applied to reduce the plaintiff\u2019s payment for the timber it cut. The plaintiff also had paid a deposit of $6,233 when it received the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-10\">Following the termination of the contract, the Forest Supervisor, in October 1977, notified plaintiff that the government would assess damages against it, that the timber would be readvertised for sale, and that, pursuant to a cited regulation, the plaintiff would not be permitted to bid for the reoffered timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-11\">The government circulated the announcement of the reopening of the timber to a bidder list which included 19 persons. The announcement showed that the plaintiff had been removed from the eligible list. The minimum bid price was $80.37 per MBF, which was $23.71 more than the minimum bid for the earlier sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-12\">Plaintiff twice requested the Forest Supervisor to permit it to bid. In its final request, made the Friday before the Monday bid opening, the plaintiff stated that the regulation the Forest Service had relied upon had been changed. The Forest Supervisor reviewed the new regulation, and again denied plaintiff the opportunity to bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-13\">When the bids were opened in January 1978, only Wyoming Sawmills submitted a bid. It bid $80.42, or 5 cents above the minimum. Since there was only one bid, no auction was held, and the contract was awarded to Wyoming Sawmills at that price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-14\">In the present suit the plaintiff seeks $99,102.80, reflecting its purchaser credit of $92,869.80 for the construction of the roads and the $6,233 deposit it made when it received the original contract in 1974. The government has filed a counterclaim for $45,772.15, covering its damages for the plaintiff\u2019s failure to, perform the contract (see <em>infra, </em>pp. 1045-1046).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-16\">In seeking recovery of its purchaser credit and deposit, the plaintiff contends that in barring it from rebidding, the Forest Supervisor violated both the regulations of the Forest Service and the Small Business Act, and that the government therefore improperly retained those amounts to use as an offset against the loss it suffered on the relet contract (see <em>infra, </em>p. 1044).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-17\">A. The regulation upon which the plaintiff relies states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-18\">Except as otherwise provided in this section, no bid will be considered in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>resale of timber remaining from any uncompleted timber sale contract from any person, or from an affiliate of such person, who failed to complete the original contract (i) because of termination for purchaser\u2019s branch [sic] or (ii) through failure to cut designated timber or portions of the sale area by the termination date, <em>unless acceptance of such bid is determined to be in the public interest.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ana\">36 C.F.R. \u00a7 223.5(h)(1) (emphasis added) (italicized portion added effective June 2, 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">The plaintiff first points out that when the Forest Supervisor informed it in 1977 that it would not be allowed to bid on the reletting of the contract, he referred to an earlier version of the regulation that did not contain the italicized language above. In its second request to rebid, however, the plaintiff referred to the changed regulation, and the Forest Supervisor reviewed the current version when he continued to refuse to allow the plaintiff to rebid. The Forest Supervisor thus considered the plaintiff\u2019s request under the revised regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s major argument is that under the regulation the Forest Service was required to, but did not determine whether acceptance of the plaintiff\u2019s bid would be in the public interest and that without such determination the Forest Supervisor\u2019s refusal to allow the plaintiff to bid was improper. W\u00e9 do not interpret the regulation to require a formal public interest determination. The regulation bars a defaulting contractor from rebidding at a resale under a timber contract, but authorizes the Forest Service to allow it to rebid if the Service determines that awarding it the contract would be in the public interest. The refusal of the Forest Supervisor to permit the plaintiff to rebid was an implicit determination that awarding the plaintiff the contract would not be in the public interest. The regulation required no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\"><em>Everett Plywood Corp. v. United States, </em>206 Ct.Cl. 244, 512 F.2d 1082 (1975), upon which the plaintiff relies, is inapplicable. That case involved the Forest Service\u2019s refusal to extend the term of a timber-cutting contract. The Forest Service had a regulation under which it routinely granted extensions of timber-cutting contracts upon request unless the extension would be \u201cdisadvantageous to the United States.\u201d We held that the Forest Service had violated that provision since it denied the extension not because it concluded that the extension would be disadvantageous to the United States, but under a \u201cstandard entirely different from that theretofore applied by the Forest Service\u201d (namely, whether the reasons the plaintiff gave for an extension \u201camounted to extraordinary conditions\u201d). 206 Ct.Cl. at 257, 512 F.2d at 1090. In other words, we held that the Forest Service had deviated from its own regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-8\">In the present case, in contrast, we construe the rebidding regulation as barring a defaulting contractor from rebidding unless the Forest Service determines that awarding it the contract would be in the public interest. Here, unlike <em>Everett Plywood, </em>there is no indication that the Forest Service did not act in conformity with the regulations. Indeed, since the plaintiff had not cut a single foot of timber during the 3-year term of the contract, the Forest Service had no reason to think that the plaintiff would behave any better if it were awarded a second contract to cut the same timber. In these circumstances, the Forest Service was fully warranted in not determining that allowing the plaintiff to bid on the second contract would be in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-9\">B. The provision of the Small Business Act, upon which the plaintiff relies, states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-10\">(b) It shall also be the duty of the [Small Business] Administration and it is empowered whenever it determines such action is necessary\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-11\">(7)(A) To certify to Government procurement officers, and officers engaged in the sale and disposal of Federal property, with respect to all elements of responsibility, including, but not limited to, capability, competency, capacity, credit, integ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>rity, perseverance, and tenacity, of any small business concern or group of such concerns to receive and perform a specific Government contract. A Government procurement officer or an officer engaged in the sale and disposal of Federal property may not, for any reason specified in the preceding sentence, preclude any small business concern or group of such concerns from being awarded such contract without referring the matter for a final disposition to the Administrator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfOX\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 637(b)(7)(A) (Supp.I 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">The plaintiff contends that the Forest Supervisor\u2019s decision to bar it from bidding on the second contract was a determination that the plaintiff was not a responsible bidder, and that under section 637(b)(7)(A) the Small Business Administrator had exclusive authority to make all determinations concerning the \u201cresponsibility\u201d of bidders who are small business men. The plaintiff had filed an affidavit, which the government had not controverted, that it is a small business concern under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">Although the language of the second sentence of the section is broad enough to cover the Forest Supervisor\u2019s barring of the plaintiff from bidding on the second contract, the legislative history of the provision indicates that it was not intended to apply in this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">Section 637(b)(7)(A) had its genesis in the Defense Production Act Amendments of 1951, Pub.L.No.96 \u00a7 714(e)(6) [\u00a7 110(a)], 65 Stat. 131 (1951). Those amendments created the Small Defense Plants Administration and authorized it to certify the capacity and credit of small businesses. The House Report accompanying the 1951 amendments explained the reasons for this action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-8\">(a) Small business has been unable to obtain a fair share of defense contracts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6a\">\u2014This is a problem of business life or death to thousands of small manufacturing concerns which have been unable to obtain materials to continue in civilian production. Of course, the path of least resistance is that of loading defense contracts on to large corporations and allowing small business to fall by the wayside. This is the path which was followed in the early years of World War II, when 100 large corporations received 67 percent of prime contracts. During this same period, one-sixth of the small businesses in the Nation closed their doors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-10\">This mistake must not be repeated. Our mobilization program must extend down into the small plants, since they are a major source of our productive strength. The proposed amendment [subsequently enacted] would accomplish this by creating a Small Defense Plants Corporation with authority to certify qualified small businesses for prime contracts. Procurement officers would be directed to accept this authorization as conclusive. This provision would give small businesses definite assurance of a fair share of prime contracts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a4b-dedup-0\">H.R.Rep.No.639, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. 31, <em>reprinted in </em>[1951] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 1626, 1645-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-11\">The Small Business Act of 1958, Pub.L. No.85-536 \u00a7 8(b)(7), 72 Stat. 384 (1958), expanded this provision to cover all government procurement and sales, not just defense contracts. The provision took the form of the present section 637(b)(7)(A) except that the reference to the administrator and the administrator\u2019s certifying authority were limited to questions \u201cwith respect to the competency, as to capacity and credit, of any small-business concern or group.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-12\">The Small Business Act was amended in 1977 to broaden to its present form the concept of \u201cresponsibility\u201d for which the administrator was to certify small businesses. The House Report on the amendment explains the congressional concern:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aar\">Small business can and has been denied Government contracts because the procuring activity has determined that the small business lacked the requisite \u201ctenacity, perseverance or integrity\u201d to perform a specific Government contract. Such a finding results in the small firm being branded \u201cnonresponsible.\u201d Resort to the [\u201cCertificate of Competency\u201d] procedure in such cases is not available since capacity and credit are, purportedly, not involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>H.R.Rep.No.95-1, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 13, <em>reprinted in </em>[1977] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 821, 833. <em>See also </em>S.Rep.No.95-184, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 7-8 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">Although the 1977 amendments were intended to give the administrator broader authority to determine whether small businesses seeking to participate in government contracts are responsible, we conclude that the provision does not apply to the Forest Service\u2019s refusal to permit the plaintiff to bid on the second timber contract. The purpose of this provision, as reflected in the legislative history of its predecessors, was to end the discrimination against small business that existed because contracting officers had barred those businesses solely because of their smallness and disabilities allegedly resulting from that fact. There is no indication, however, that Congress also intended to cover the situation of the reletting of the contract after a small business firm had defaulted in performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">, The Forest Service regulation does not discriminate against small businesses but generally bars all defaulting contractors from bidding upon the reletting of the contract. The Forest Supervisor refused to allow the plaintiff to participate in rebidding, not because of alleged deficiencies stemming from its size, but because of its failure to cut any timber under the prior contract. The result would have been the same if the plaintiff had not been a small business. In the special circumstances of this case \u2014 where the plaintiff had not cut a single foot of timber under the contract for 3 years \u2014 section 637(b)(7)(A) of the Small Business Act did not require the Forest Supervisor to refer the matter to the administrator before he could bar the plaintiff from participating in the rebidding of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-7\">The plaintiff opposes the government\u2019s counterclaim covering the losses the government suffered when it relet the contract for a lower amount than the contract with the plaintiff would have produced on the ground that the government failed adequately to mitigate its damages. The argument has two branches: (A) By excluding the plaintiff from rebidding, the government lost the higher price it would have obtained at a second auction; (B) because the second contract was a \u201csole source\u201d situation, the government should have attempted to negotiate a higher price with Wyoming Sawmills than the minimum price the latter bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-9\">A. 1. Our conclusion in part II that the government justifiably excluded the plaintiff from rebidding also refutes the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the exclusion constituted a failure to mitigate damages. It would be anomalous to hold that the government properly barred the plaintiff from rebidding but that by taking such action the government violated its obligation to mitigate damages. Indeed, it would have been improper for the government to have permitted the plaintiff to bid on the relet contract where the government would not have awarded the contract to the plaintiff if the latter had been the high bidder. Permitting the plaintiff to bid in that circumstance would have been grossly unfair to Wyoming Sawmills, which would have had to pay a higher price as a consequence of an artificial and misleading auction procedure. Having been disqualified by totally breaching the first contract, the plaintiff now cannot properly complain because its exclusion from bidding on the second contract may have increased the damages it must pay for its breach of the earlier one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-10\">2. We recently recognized that the government\u2019s duty to mitigate damages does not necessarily require, although it may authorize, the government to permit a defaulted contractor to bid on the reprocurement (and, by the same reasoning on the reletting of a sales contract). In <em>Venice Maid Company, Inc. v. United States, </em>225 Ct.Cl.-,-, 639 F.2d 690, 697 (1980), in ruling that the government had not failed to mitigate damages by not awarding a contract to the defaulting contractor on the reprocurement, we stated that a defaulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>contractor <em>\u201cmay </em>be considered for award of the reprocurement contract\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>See also Churchill Chemical Corp. v. United States, </em>221 Ct.Cl.-,-, 602 F.2d 358, 363 (1979). The Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals similarly has stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1105-7\">[i]n some circumstances the reasons for the default may be such as not to indicate an inability on the part of the defaulted contractor to perform the reprocurement contract, in which event there may be an implied duty on the part of the Government to permit the defaulted contractor to bid on the reprocurement so as to permit him to mitigate his damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6U\"><em>Woodrow P. Hudson d/b/a San Diego Concrete Disposal, </em>ASBCA No. 21,044, 76-2 BCA (CCH) \u00b6 12,182 (1976). <em>See also Venice Maid Company, Inc., </em>ASBCA Nos. 20,-546, 20,792, 76-2 BCA (CCH) \u00b6 12,045 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">The Comptroller General has ruled that \u201conce the contracting officer decides that it is appropriate to conduct a new competition for reprocurement, he may not automatically exclude the defaulted contractor from that competition.\u201d <em>PRB Uniforms, Inc., </em>56 Comp.Gen. 976, 978 (1977). <em>See also Ikard Manufacturing Co., </em>58 Comp. Gen. 54, 57 (1978). Since the Forest Service\u2019s regulation permits a defaulting contractor to rebid if the Service determines that acceptance of his bid would be in the public interest, the Comptroller General might uphold the exclusion of the plaintiff from rebidding in this case. <em>But cf. </em>Unpublished Comptroller General Decision No. B-195497 (June 2, 1980), which recommends that the Forest Service \u201cconsider revising [this] regulation\u201d because the Comptroller General \u201cdo[es] not believe automatic disqualification of a defaulted timber purchaser insures open and fair competition.\u201d In any event, we conclude that in refusing to permit the plaintiff to participate in the rebidding, the government did not violate its obligation to mitigate damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-9\">B. The plaintiff contends that when, upon opening of the bids at the reletting, the Forest Supervisor discovered that only Wyoming Sawmills had bid, he should have attempted to negotiate a higher price with the bidder instead of accepting the bid and that his non-negotiation constituted a failure to mitigate damages. It urges that the Forest Service should have treated the case as a \u201csole source\u201d situation, in which the government is not required to accept whatever offer the prospective contractor makes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-11\">The sole source concept, however, relates mainly to procurement, not to sales. <em>See, e. g., </em>10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2304 (1976); 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 252(c) (1976). <em>See generally </em>IB J. McBride &amp; T. Touney, Government Contracts, ch. 9 (1981). It involves a situation where the government does not seek bids or invitations from more than one source, but instead decides to negotiate with only one person. Furthermore, a negotiated contract must be authorized by statute. <em>New York Mail and Newspaper Transportation Co. v. United States, </em>139 Ct.Cl. 751, 757, 154 F.Supp. 271, 275, <em>cert. denied, </em>355 U.S. 904, 78 S.Ct. 332, 2 L.Ed.2d 260 (1957). Even assuming that the same principle would apply to sales of government property and that a statute permits sale by negotiation, under the facts here this was not a sole source arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-12\">The Forest Service sent invitations to bid on the reletting of the contract to 19 concerns, 11 of which were located in Wyoming. It also advertised the sale in a local newspaper, The Sheridan (Wyoming) Press. The fact that only a single bid was submitted did not convert this advertised and solicited bidding procedure into a sole source arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-13\">Wyoming Sawmills\u2019 bid slightly exceeded the minimum bid the government specified in the advertisement. Implicit in setting a minimum bid is the understanding that the government is willing to and will make the sale at that price. The plaintiff points out that the selling price under the second contract dropped from $100 MBF in the first contract to $80.42 MBF, \u201cin spite of an apparent rise in the market price of timber sold.\u201d What the plaintiff overlooks, however, is that the minimum bid of $80.37 for the second contract was $23.71 higher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>than the minimum bid of $56.66 for the same timber under the first contract. This significantly higher minimum bid price under the second contract presumably reflected the increase in timber prices since the first contract was let and the higher price for the first contract that the auction had produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">The regulations governing the sale of standing timber do not provide for negotiation but only for advertising and bidding. 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 223.5(a). The Forest Supervisor did not act improperly or fail to mitigate damages in accepting the only bid he received at a price that exceeded the minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">The damages of $45,772.15 that the government assessed against the plaintiff\u2014 the subject of the counterclaim \u2014 were computed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1106-7\">The amount the government would have received if the plaintiff had performed the contract, based on the contract price of the timber at the time of termination (September 30, 1977) of $122.26 per MBF.

[tjimber.\u201d Paragraph B3.1. \u201cCurrent Contract Rates\u201d are the \u201cTentative Rates,\u201d which consist of the minimum bid prices (the \u201cAdvertised Rates\u201d) plus the amount by which the contract price exceeds the minimum (\u201cBid Premium Rates\u201d), to which is added any quarterly price escalation. Paragraphs A5, B3.1. Since no timber was cut in the present case, the \u201cCurrent Contract Value\u201d is the same as the \u201cCurrent Contract Rates\u201d multiplied by the amount of timber to be cut under the contract. The \u201cCurrent Contract Value\u201d when the contract was terminated on September 30, 1977, was $414,461.40, based upon the then \u201cCurrent Contract Rate\u201d of $122.26 per MBF multiplied by the 3,390 MBF of timber to be cut.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-24\">The issue in dispute is the meaning of the words \u201cthe resale value at new Bid Rates\u201d in paragraph B9.4, which is to be subtracted from the \u201cCurrent Contract Value\u201d in determining damages. \u201cBid Rates\u201d are defined as \u201cthe rates bid by Purchaser . . . and are the sum of Advertised Rates and Bid Premium Rates. Until a rate redeter-mination becomes effective, the Bid Rate [here applicable] ... is the Tentative Rate which is subject to quarterly adjustment .... \u201d Paragraph A5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-25\">As indicated, the \u201cAdvertised Rate\u201d is the minimum bid and the \u201cBid Premium Rate\u201d is the difference between that minimum rate and the price at which the contract was let. The \u201cnew Bid Rate\u201d for the resale of the timber to Wyoming Sawmills was the minimum price of $80.37 specified in the invitation plus the 5 cents additional that Wyoming Sawmills bid. The government determined that the \u201cresale value at new Bid Rates\u201d was $272,638.80 ($80.42 X 3,390), which was the amount the government subtracted from the Current Contract Value of $414,461.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>When the contract speaks of the resale value at \u201cnew Bid Rates,\u201d we think it refers to the specific price at which the new contract was let and not to any escalation of that price during the period of performance. The \u201cBid Rates\u201d are defined as the \u201crates bid by Purchaser.\u201d The rate Wyoming Sawmills bid was $80.42, not the amounts by which this bid subsequently was escalated. Although that rate was subject to quarterly adjustment, there is no indication in the contract that if the contractor defaulted and the government resold the timber, the government\u2019s damages were to be calculated upon the escalated rate rather than upon the rate the new contractor bid. When the contract refers to escalated rates, it uses the term \u201cCurrent Contract Rate,\u201d not \u201cBid Rates.\u201d We therefore conclude that the government correctly calculated the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied, and the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted. The petition is dismissed. The defendant is entitled to recovery of $45,772.15 on its counterclaim, and judgment in that amount is entered for it against the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
