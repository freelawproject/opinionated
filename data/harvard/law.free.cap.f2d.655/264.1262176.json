An Administrative Law Judge found that the aggravation of Hensley\u2019s pre-existing psoriatic condition was not work related. Appendix (\u201cApp.\u201d) at 16-19. The Benefits Review Board, in a 2-1 decision, affirmed the finding of the Administrative Law Judge, holding that there was substantial evidence to support his decision. App. at 1-15. Because the Benefits Review Board and the Administrative Law Judge erred in evaluating the evidence before them, and therefore failed properly to apply the statutory presumption favoring the claimant in a case where no substantial evidence was presented to contradict his claim, the decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-15\">I. THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b326-16\">Petitioner Hensley, husband and father of seven children, has been a bus driver for the past 33 years, employed for that entire period by respondent WMATA or its predecessor, D.C. Transit Authority. Since 1968 Hensley has been plagued by general psoriasis. Until August, 1977, however, his condition was well controlled by medication, and he never missed a day of work due to his skin condition. App. at 103. Hensley testified before the Administrative Law Judge that during June and July of 1977, his bus route came under construction, making the ride extremely rough.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> App. at 103-04. He further stated that the particular bus assigned to his route had very poor suspension, an uncomfortable driver\u2019s seat, and a steering ratio requiring far greater effort for turns than other buses used by WMATA; all of this was acknowledged to be true by the Board. <em>Id. </em>at 3 n.3; 104-06. Hensley testified that he was therefore exposed to severe bouncing at certain points of contact, especially his left hand, the small of his back, the underside of his thighs, and his feet. <em>Id. </em>at 106-08.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN-\">[D]uring the course of this time my skin began to dry out and peel and crack; and it was very hard for me \u2014 in other words, it would hurt to hold the steering wheel. And I was trying to drive with a thumb and finger proposition [sic]. But when I would grip the wheel and be out there on the job for a while, then it would crack open and bleed from the work, from doing the job, from holding the steering wheel; it would actually crack open and my hand would bleed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-18\">On August 15, 1977, Hensley ceased work on the advice of his treating physician, Dr. Donald Mitchell. Dr. Mitchell found peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>tioner to be in severe pain and unable to use his hands and feet; his psoriasis was extensive with pustular lesions on the palms and the soles of his feet. App. at 30-3. Hensley was started on medication and he returned to work on August 23, 1977, despite advice from Dr. Mitchell that his condition would worsen if he began driving again. <em>Id. </em>at 49. But on September 5, 1977, Hensley was forced to stop work again due to the condition of his hands and feet, and he remained off work until November, 1978. Once Hensley stopped working, his condition stabilized. <em>Id. </em>at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">II. THE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">This court\u2019s role in reviewing determinations of the Benefits Review Board under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act is limited. We examine the record only to assure that the Board\u2019s orders rest on substantial evidence on the record as a whole, and that the Board\u2019s underlying standards for granting or denying compensation are in accord with the law. <em>See Wheatley v. Adler, </em>407 F.2d 307, 310 (D.C.Cir.1968) (en banc). We have not hesitated, however, to reverse the Board\u2019s orders when they fail properly to apply the Act\u2019s presumption favoring claimants in disputed cases. <em>See, e. g., Riley v. U. S. Industries/Federal Sheet Metal, Inc., </em>627 F.2d 455 (D.C.Cir.1980), <em>cert. granted, </em>446 U.S. 941, 100 S.Ct. 2165, 64 L.Ed.2d 796 (1981); <em>Swinton v. Kelly, </em>554 F.2d 1075 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 820, 97 S.Ct. 67, 50 L.Ed.2d 81 (1976); <em>Wheatley v. Adler, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The Act provides that compensation shall be payable when an employee covered under the Act suffers an \u201cinjury,\u201d defined as \u201caccidental injury ... arising out of and in the course of employment . . . . \u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(2). Section 20 of the Act further provides that \u201c[i]n any proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for compensation under this chapter <em>it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary </em>\u2014 (a) <em>That the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter.\u201d </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920 (emphasis supplied). The Section 20 presumption is but one indication of the \u201chumanitarian nature\u201d of the Act generally, <em>O\u2019Keefe v. Smith, Hinchman &amp; Grylls Assoc., Inc., </em>380 U.S. 359, 362, 85 S.Ct. 1012, 1014, 13 L.Ed.2d 895 (1965), and the \u201cbeneficent purposes\u201d which underlie it. <em>Friend v. Britton, </em>220 F.2d 820, 821 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>350 U.S. 836, 76 S.Ct. 72, 100 L.Ed. 745 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The presumption operates in favor of the claimant unless and until \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d is presented by the respondent showing that the claimant\u2019s malady did not arise out of and in the course of his employment. At that point, the presumption \u201cfalls out of the case.\u201d <em>Del Vecchio v. Bowers, </em>296 U.S. 280, 286, 56 S.Ct. 190, 193, 80 L.Ed. 229 (1935); <em>Swinton v. Kelly, supra, </em>554 F.2d at 1082 n.35; <em>Maryland Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co. v. Jenkins, </em>594 F.2d 404, 407 (4th Cir., 1979); <em>St. Louis Shipbuilding Co. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>551 F.2d 1119, 1124 (8th Cir., 1977); <em>Travelers Insurance Co. v. Belair, </em>412 F.2d 297, 301 n.6 (1st Cir., 1969). This circuit has not decided whether, once the presumptive \u201cbubble\u201d bursts and falls out of the case, the ultimate burden of persuasion as to work-relatedness rests with the employer or employee. <em>Cf. Parsons Corp. of California v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>619 F.2d 38, 41 (9th Cir., 1980) (\u201cEven after the substantial evidence is produced to rebut the statutory presumption, the employer still bears the ultimate burden of persuasion.\u201d). But many courts, including our own, have decided that the beneficent purposes and humanitarian nature of the Act must be borne in mind when deciding whether the employer has presented \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence; thus doubtful questions, including factual ones like work-relatedness, must be resolved in favor of claimants. <em>Wheatley v. Adler, supra, </em>407 F.2d at 313-14 (\u201cWe have frequently pointed out that since the statute \u2018should be construed liberally\u2019 in favor of employees and their dependents, it is \u2018in their favor [that] doubts, <em>including the factual, </em>are to be resolved.\u2019 <em>This approach has . . . characterized our application of the substantial evidence test </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>in these cases.\u2019\u2019 </em>[emphasis supplied]). <em>See also Swinton v. Kelly, supra, </em>554 F.2d at 1084-85 (citing numerous cases); <em>Ryan-Walsh Stevedoring Co. v. Trainer, </em>601 F.2d 1306, 1316 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Army &amp; Air Force Exchange Service v. Greenwood, </em>585 F.2d 791, 794 (5th Cir., 1978); <em>Bath Iron Works Corp. v. White, </em>584 F.2d 569, 574 (1st Cir., 1978); <em>Young &amp; Co. v. Shea, </em>397 F.2d 185, 188, <em>rehearing en banc denied, </em>404 F.2d 1059, 1061 (5th Cir. 1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>395 U.S. 920, 89 S.Ct. 1771, 23 L.Ed.2d 237 (1969) (\u201cThe policy of the Act that all doubtful questions are to be resolved in favor of the [claimant] is to be considered in determining whether there was substantial evidence before the Commissioner.\u201d 404 F.2d at 1061). Applying this approach, this court has often found it necessary to reverse orders which are based on evidence too insubstantial to override the statutory presumption; we \u201cwill not sustain the administrative findings merely because they are substantiated by some isolated evidence.\u201d <em>Friend v. Britton, supra, </em>220 F.2d at 821. <em>See, e. g., Swinton v. Kelly, supra, </em>554 F.2d at 1085 n.61 (collected cases decided in this circuit). On the contrary, in order to overcome the presumption, the employer\u2019s \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d must be \u201cspecific and comprehensive enough to sever the <em>potential </em>connection\u201d between the disability and the work environment. <em>Id. </em>at 1083 (emphasis supplied); <em>Parsons Corp. of California v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, supra, </em>619 F.2d at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">III. THE LAW APPLIED IN THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">It is uncontested that Hensley\u2019s severely aggravated psoriasis condition is an \u201cinjury,\u201d as that term is used in the Act; further, under the well recognized \u201caggravation rule\u201d it is indisputable that \u201can aggravation of a pre-existing condition may constitute a compensable accidental injury under the Act[.]\u201d <em>Wheatley v. Adler, supra, </em>407 F.2d at 312. <em>See Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. Brandt Airflex Corp., </em>645 F.2d 1053, at 1057 (D.C.Cir.1981); <em>Friend v. Britton, supra, </em>220 F.2d at 823; <em>Robinson v. Bradshaw, </em>206 F.2d 435, 437 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>346 U.S. 899, 74 S.Ct. 226, 98 L.Ed. 400 (1953); <em>Ridgley v. Ceres, Inc., </em>594 F.2d 1175, 1177 (8th Cir. 1979). The fact that other, nonemployment related factors may also have contributed to, or additionally aggravated Hensley\u2019s malady, does not affect his right to compensation under the \u201caggravation rule.\u201d <em>Cordero v. Triple A Machine Shop, </em>580 F.2d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 911, 99 S.Ct. 1223, 59 L.Ed.2d 459 (1979); <em>see Wheatley v. Adler, supra, </em>407 F.2d at 312 n.11 (\u201c \u2018[T]he cases almost invariably decide that the fact that the injury would not have resulted but for the pre-existing disease, or might just as well have been caused by a similar strain at home or at recreation, are both immaterial.\u2019 \u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Thus, the only issue in this case is whether or not the <em>aggravation </em>of Hensley\u2019s psoriasis, which occurred during July and August of 1977 when potholes and construction on his route made driving particularly stressful, arose <em>even in part </em>\u201cout of and in the course of\u201d his employment. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(2). This statutory language</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOT\"><em>does not require \u201ca causal relation between the nature of employment of the injured person and the accident.. .. </em>All that is required is that the \u2018obligations or conditions\u2019 of employment create the \u2018zone of special\u2019 danger out of which injury arose.\u201d .. . [The line is drawn] only at cases where an employee [has] become \u201cso thoroughly disconnected from the service of his employer that it would be entirely unreasonable to say that injuries suffered by him arose out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-8\"><em>O\u2019Keeffe v. Smith, Hinchman &amp; Grylls Assoc., Inc., supra, </em>380 U.S. at 362, 85 S.Ct. at 1014 (emphasis supplied). <em>See, e. g., Mitchell v. Woodworth, </em>449 F.2d 1097 (D.C.Cir. 1971) (denial of compensation reversed despite apparent absence of evidence that death arose from any particularly unusual work related stress); <em>Butler v. District Parking Management Co., </em>363 F.2d 682 (D.C.Cir.1966) (denial of compensation re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>versed despite apparent absence of any particularized causal theory connecting claimant\u2019s mental breakdown with his 20 years of service as a parking lot attendant); <em>Robinson v. Bradshaw, supra </em>(denial of death benefits reversed for failure to apply presumption to issue of work-relatedness in case where deceased suddenly became obsessed with idea that he was being pursued by mob, resulting in his confinement in jail, where he was thereafter fatally shot by police officer whom he attacked; presumption applied that his job as a truck driver aggravated some pre-existing mental illness).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">In deciding whether the aggravation of Hensley\u2019s psoriatic condition arose, even in part, out of and in the course of his employment as a bus driver, the factfinder was required to apply the Section 20 presumption in his favor. <em>Swinton v. Kelly, supra, </em>554 F.2d at 1082 (\u201cThe statutory presumption applies as much to the nexus between an employee\u2019s malady and his employment activities as it does to any other aspect of a claim.\u201d Numerous cases cited); <em>see Riley v. U. S. Industries/Federal Sheet Metal, Inc., supra, </em>627 F.2d at 458; <em>Ridgley </em>v. <em>Ceres, Inc., supra, </em>594 F.2d at 1177.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Hensley\u2019s allegation of work-relatedness, however, did not rest solely on the statutory presumption; on the contrary, he presented testimony on work-relatedness which overwhelmingly supported his claim. Hensley testified that after 32 years of driving a bus \u2014 10 of them with chronic psoriasis but not a day\u2019s work lost because of the condition \u2014 his psoriasis flared up so badly in the summer of 1977 that he was forced to quit work on his doctor\u2019s advice. This was precisely the time when construction began on his route. He also testified that the lesions first appeared on those parts of his body where the physical trauma of driving was most concentrated, his left hand, his lower back and buttocks, and his right foot.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> App. at 106-08. While driving the bus his hands would \u201ccrack open and bleed . . . from holding the steering wheel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108. Then, when he stopped working, his condition improved; when he returned again, it worsened. All this was <em>uncontra-dicted </em>testimony, and by itself should have been sufficient evidence to show work-relatedness. <em>See Eller and Co. v. Golden, </em>620 F.2d 71, 74 (5th Cir. 1980) (claimant\u2019s own testimony may constitute substantial evidence justifying award of compensation under the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">In addition to Hensley\u2019s testimony, however, two accredited dermatologists, one of whom was actually treating Hensley\u2019s psoriasis at the time he had to stop work, stated that in their expert medical opinion the flare-up was, or certainly could have been, aggravated by Hensley\u2019s driving a bus.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The principal treating physician, Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Mitchell, testified that he advised Hensley at the time to stop working, warning that the condition would worsen if Hensley continued to drive. When Hensley persisted in staying on the job, the condition did worsen; when he finally stopped for good, it stabilized and improved somewhat. App. at 31-3, 36, 49, 111. Dr. Mitchell also corroborated many particulars of Hensley\u2019s testimony, for example, that the pustular lesions on Hensley\u2019s hands and feet were more severe than the lesions on the rest of his body,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 48, and that his left hand was more severely affected than his right, <em>id. </em>at 56.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">In sum, Dr. Mitchell\u2019s overall testimony was consistent with at least two theories of work-related aggravation, namely, that pustular lesions appeared initially as a response to the physical trauma of driving, or that driving aggravated existing lesions to the point that they cracked, bled and made driving impossible. It is possible both things happened. In either case, work-related aggravation of an underlying psoriatic condition is clearly established on this record. It is, frankly, difficult for us to discern how the Administrative Law Judge and the Benefits Review Board could deny his claim based on this evidence, especially when the statute as construed by our court and others, <em>see </em>cases cited at pp. 267-268, 269, <em>supra, </em>presumes causality \u201cin the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">We can find no <em>substantial </em>evidence to the contrary in this case. The only evidence adverse to Hensley that appears in the record is the testimony of Dr. Robert Stolar, hired by WMATA, who examined Hensley only once with regard to his claim. This examination took place <em>nine months after the flare-up and eight months after he left work. </em>The WMATA doctor\u2019s conclusions were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-15\">In my experience the pattern of work that he carried on does not produce psori-atic lesions by the only known traumatic mechanism which I mentioned for the Koebner phenomena, which would require a different type of injury than what I could visualize that he received at any time.... So in attempting to visualize Mr. Hensley\u2019s constant work pattern, his constant frictional pattern was of the smoothing or sliding variety, which is used very often as part of the treatment for psoriasis. So I could not visual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ize that particular pattern of injury that would aggravate his condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">App. at 73-4.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">This testimony does not constitute substantial evidence contradicting claimant\u2019s theory of work-relatedness. The WMATA doctor\u2019s \u201cexperience\u201d that bus driving would not <em>\u201cproduce </em>psoriatic lesions\u201d (emphasis supplied) in no way contradicts the claimant\u2019s or his own doctors\u2019 testimony that gripping the wheel and pressing the accelerator and brakes <em>aggravated existing pustular lesions </em>on his hands and feet to the point where he could not drive.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed the Board itself called the WMATA doctor\u2019s testimony on this basic issue in the case \u201cnot crystal clear.\u201d App. at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">More importantly, however, there is no evidence in the record that this third doctor had any particular experience or knowledge upon which to base his opinion regarding Hensley\u2019s \u201cwork pattern\u201d as a bus driver, or his opinion regarding the \u201cconstant frictional pattern\u201d to which Hensley was subjected on his particularly rough bus route during July and August of 1977. Dr. Stolar, while an accredited dermatologist, was not shown t\u00f3 have had any experience from which to estimate what sort of trauma Hensley was receiving from driving on his particular bus route, or which parts of the body received stress from such driving. At one point the Administrative Law Judge had to point this out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-11\">Judge Giesey: Counsel, Dr. Stolar is an impressively credentialed member of a learned profession; but I do not think this is part of what he learned. I know as much about driving as the Doctor does...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">App. at 84. Therefore, since this doctor\u2019s ultimate opinion on work-relatedness was based entirely upon his \u201cvisualiz[ationj\u201d of the kind of physical trauma involved in Hensley\u2019s job, and since this \u201cvisualization]\u201d was not derived from any particular experience or knowledge,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we find that Dr. Stolar\u2019s opinion on the issue of aggravation is not entitled to the \u201csubstantial\u201d weight which it must have to overcome the Congressionally mandated presumption. Hensley\u2019s claim should therefore have been sustained on the strength of that presumption, together with the evidence of his two treating physicians and his own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">IV. THE DECISIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE AND THE BENEFITS REVIEW BOARD</p>\n<p id=\"AM8\">Given our conclusion that there was not \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence to overcome the presumption of causality or the supporting evidence of claimant and his medical witnesses, we must conclude that the Administrative Law Judge erred in finding that \u201cthe weight of substantial evidence preponderate[d] on the side of non-exacerbation.\u201d App. at 19. In fact, the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s reasons for denying the claim are well nigh indecipherable to us. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Review Board itself admitted that his analysis was \u201cnot a model of clarity.\u201d App. at 11 n.8. He reasoned thus:<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aql\">[T]he treating physician testified that Koebner\u2019s phenomenon is produced only by injuries that penetrate the epidermis and injure the dermis but that \u201cit\u2019s well established that the mild, repeated trauma to the knees and elbows of patients accounts for the characteristic distribution of psoriasis, and this is a form of Keobner\u2019s phenomenon.\u201d Aside from the internal inconsistency of this testimony, photographs submitted in evidence with his report show that, while Hensley\u2019s elbows have extensive psoriatic lesions, his knees are clear and uninvolved \u2014 despite the fact that his work is largely performed in a seated position and at least one leg, according to Hensley, \u201cdoes all the work.\u201d Ironically, this physician\u2019s patient\u2019s condition is significantly inconsistent with the premise upon which the entire theory of causation is based.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">App. at 19. Our reading of the record reveals that the Administrative Law Judge badly misunderstood the import of the treating physician\u2019s testimony. There is nothing whatsoever inconsistent in Dr. Mitchell\u2019s conclusion that \u201cmild, repeated trauma\u201d which may come from \u201cgripping a wheel of a bus\u201d could produce a dermal injury likely to incite Koebner\u2019s syndrome.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Dr. Mitchell\u2019s testimony was not only internally consistent, but it also significantly bolstered claimant\u2019s theory of work-relatedness. The remainder of the Administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Law Judge\u2019s reasoning, which relies on the absence of aggravated psoriasis on Hensley\u2019s knees, is simply irrelevant; Hensley\u2019s claim was that his hands and feet, not his knees, were significantly involved in the driving.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s final conclusion that Hensley\u2019s condition was inconsistent with his \u201centire theory of causation\u201d is simply a <em>non sequitur.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Although the Benefits Review Board in large part disclaimed reliance on the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s reasoning, calling it \u201cpuzzling,\u201d it concluded nevertheless that his reasoning did not \u201cso undermine the . . . ultimate finding so as to require reversal.\u201d App. at 11 n.8. Yet the Board itself engaged in equally murky thinking, relying on alleged facts which were irrelevant to the issue in this case, and failing to apprehend the thrust of the testimony on work-relatedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">As to the former, the issue here has always been clear: whether the physical trauma of driving under unusually difficult circumstances contributed to the aggravation of Hensley\u2019s already present psoriatic condition. The Board\u2019s opinion, however, highlighted other factors such as obesity and emotional problems which could have contributed to the flare-up, App. at 6, though no one testified that they did so in fact. In this way the Board ignored decisions of this circuit and others, see p. 268, supra, which require a presumption in favor of job-relatedness where multi-causation may exist, and no substantial evi-deuce is introduced demonstrating that non-work related factors are the only causes. The Board also cited the fact that claimant had lesions on parts of his body not subjected to work pressure, i. e., his ankle and stomach. Such lesions are entirely consistent with the \u201ccapricious\u201d nature of the disease \u2014 a flare-up in one portion of the body can, without apparent cause, spread to other parts. <em>See </em>n.3 <em>supra. </em>Finally, the Board relied upon the fact that the condition was still \u201csevere\u201d several months after he stopped driving, but ignored the undisputed evidence that his condition stabilized when he stopped driving the bus. <em>See </em>pp. 269-270 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">In addition to all this, the Board also apparently misunderstood the testimony concerning work-relatedness. Claimant testified that by gripping the wheel of the bus the psoriasis on his hands was traumatized to the point of bleeding. His physician, Dr. Mitchell, corroborated the testimony that he had pustular lesions on his hands and feet, App. at 30. These lesions constituted a dermal injury giving rise to a diagnosis of Koebner\u2019s syndrome, one form of which occurs when \u201cmild, repeated trauma\u201d penetrates the dermal level of the skin causing a flare-up in the psoriatic patient\u2019s condition. <em>See </em>App. at 34-5. Dr. Nigra\u2019s statement was consistent with Dr. Mitchell\u2019s regarding this causal scenario. <em>See </em>n.4 <em>supra. </em>But the Board chose to rely not upon this evidence, but instead upon the testimony of the WMATA doctor,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and found that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>\u201cdisagreed with Dr. Nigra\u2019s opinion that trauma to an area of skin of a patient suffering from psoriasis will result in a flare of psoriasis in that area.\u201d App. at 8. If the WMATA doctor\u2019s testimony is so read by the Board, it is clear error. Medical texts on the disease recognize the fact that some kinds of trauma to the skin of a psoriatic patient may precipitate or aggravate the condition, see, e. <em>g., </em>6 P. Cantor, <em>Traumatic Medicine and Surgery for the Attorney </em>640-41 (1962) (\u201cChronic pressure caused by gripping tools may precipitate a psoriatic eruption of the palms. . . . The role of trauma in aggravating a pre-exist-ing psoriasis has to be accepted.\u201d), and the WMATA physician acknowledged that fact as well. App. at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Thus no testimony or evidence directly contradicted claimant\u2019s theory of work-relatedness, that under unusually physically demanding driving, his psoriatic hands broke out in pustular lesions and then cracked and bled from gripping the wheel. This constituted work-related aggravation, and since there was no substantial evidence to contradict this causal scenario, while ample evidence existed to support it, the Board\u2019s finding to the contrary is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Our review of the record here convinces us that both the Administrative Law Judge and the Benefits Review Board failed properly to apply the statutory presumption concerning work-relatedness in this case. There was no \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d contradicting either the presumption or the considerable independent testimony by Hensley and his two doctors supporting the claim that his psoriatic condition was aggravated by driving a bus. The only witness who held the contrary opinion, that the aggravation was not work-related, based his conclusion on a wholly unsupported assumption concerning the actual working conditions under which claimant was laboring. The decision and order of the Board is therefore reversed, and the case remanded for an appropriate award in accordance with this opinion. <em>Cf. Friend v. Britton, supra, </em>220 F.2d at 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-12\">.

Dr. Mitchell stressed repeatedly in his deposition that he felt claimant\u2019s underlying condition was aggravated by the conditions of his employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">Q. Doctor, do you have an opinion that you can state with reasonable degree of certainty as to whether or not Mr. Hensley\u2019s work as a bus driver aggravated his underlying condition of psoriasis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-12\">A. Let me preface my statement by saying, I don\u2019t think Mr. Hensley\u2019s psoriasis is due to his driving a bus, but 1 certainly think that Koebner\u2019s phenomenon plays a part in this, <em>and that this is service-aggravated, </em>as we used to call it in the Army.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-14\">Q. So his work did not cause the psoriasis <em>but it certainly did aggravate the condition? </em>A. <em>Oh, yes.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-15\">App. at 31-2 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-16\">Q. Let me ask just one or two more questions, Doctor.

Yes, that\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-18\">Q. You mean by that that some of the roughening skin of the lesions on the hands were rubbed to some extent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>A. No, I think what occurred was this man \u2014 and in psoriasis, you can never generalize to every patient, because every patient with psoriasis is slightly <em>different </em>\u2014 I <em>think the constant trauma of gripping and driving the bus made him worse.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">Now, if he had been a carpenter, using a hammer and a saw, I think it would have gotten worse from using a hammer and a saw.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">App. at 52 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">Q. I just have two questions, Doctor. Dr. Mitchell, you have testified that <em>the constant trauma of gripping the steering wheel made Mr. Hensley\u2019s condition worse?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-9\">\n<em>A. Yes.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">App. at 56 (emphasis supplied). <em>See also </em>Letter of Dr. Donald Mitchell, App. at 155 (\u201cThis condition is work aggravated as is demonstrated by the extensive psoriasis involving the palms and soles.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">Dr. Thomas P. Nigra, M.D., to whom claimant was referred by Dr. Mitchell, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-12\">When I saw him, he had physically disabling psoriasis of his left hand. He is a Metro Bus driver, and there is little question that he uses his hands in his work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-17\">Psoriasis is a capricious disease which waxes and wanes and comes and goes without cause. However, we definitely do know that trauma to an area of skin in a patient who has extensive psoriasis will result in a flare of psoriasis in the traumatic area. It is my opinion that using his hands in his work the way Mr. Hensley does as a bus driver could result in trauma and therefore flaring of his basic condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-18\">App. at 154.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b330-19\">. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s contention, Diss. Op. at 2, pustular lesions are blister-like and Dr. Mitchell testified that gripping a wheel can cause blisters, and blisters, in turn, signify a dermal injury which can give rise to Koebner\u2019s syndrome. <em>See </em>n. 11 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b330-20\">.

At the time he first examined him, Dr. Stolar wrote to the WMATA lawyer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">There is no question that Mr. William D. Hensley has an unfortunate and to a great extent disabling condition of psoriasis; however, in attempting to evaluate it from his history and examination, <em>I was unable to determine that it was work related or work aggravated.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">App. at 160 (emphasis supplied). Needless to say, the doctor\u2019s <em>inability to determine </em>that Hensley\u2019s condition was work-related does not satisfy the employer\u2019s burden of showing with substantial evidence that his condition <em>was not </em>work-related.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b331-10\">. Ironically, Dr. Stolar testified that if Hensley had been his own patient, he too \u201cprobably would have stopped him from work long before, and tried to clear his skin.\u201d App. at 83. But if Dr. Stolar really believed that work did not aggravate his condition, there would be no reason for such advice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b331-15\">. The WMATA doctor\u2019s \u201cvisualiz[ation]\u201d of Hensley\u2019s physical trauma as being \u201cof the smoothing or sliding variety\u201d was contradicted by the only witness whom the record shows had <em>actual knowledge </em>of the driving conditions: Hensley himself. If there was any question about Hensley\u2019s description of the physical trauma he underwent on the route, surely it would have been incumbent upon WMATA to produce a witness to contradict that description. WMATA must be presumed to have at its disposal witnesses who can testify as to the stresses its drivers are subjected to on its bus routes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b332-5\">. Prior to arriving at his \u201cFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law,\u201d <em>see </em>text immediately <em>infra, </em>the Administrative Law Judge cited Hensley\u2019s testimony that the streets on his route were \u201cchopped all to pieces,\u201d that the \u201cbus assigned his route had notably poor suspension,\u201d and that as a result \u201cvarious parts of his body were \u2018banged,\u2019 ... he was \u2018continually bouncing,\u2019 and [the] driving \u2018shook the heck out of [his] hands\u2019....\u201d App. at 17. The Law Judge then summarized the three doctors\u2019 testimony, and concluded by noting that Dr. Stolar \u201cstated ... that rubbing, smoothing or abrasion such as encountered in Hensley\u2019s work is a part of the treatment for psoriasis, rather than an exacerbating influence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18. The Administrative Law Judge\u2019s account of Dr. Sto-lar\u2019s testimony appears to assume \u2014 as did Dr. Stolar \u2014 a \u201crubbing, smoothing\u201d effect from driving that is completely at odds with Hensley\u2019s first-hand account of what he was undergoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Furthermore, it is incorrect to assert that \u201crubbing, smoothing, or abrasion\u201d <em>per se </em>constitutes a treatment for psoriasis, particularly if the \u201crubbing, smoothing or abrasion\u201d is neither medically prescribed nor administered as in Hensley\u2019s case. Dr. Stolar testified that one particular form of treatment for psoriasis involves using a polyester fiber sponge \u201cto get rid of the scale, so that <em>medication which is applied </em>can be better absorbed and be much more effective.\u201d App. at 75 (emphasis supplied); <em>accord, </em>App. at 35-6 (testimony of Dr. Mitchell). Since Hensley\u2019s exposure to banging, bouncing and shaking was not part of any prescribed medical treatment involving medication and special sponges, his situation is far different from the one outlined in Dr. Stolar\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b332-9\">. The Administrative Law Judge was probably referring to the following portion of Dr. Mitchell\u2019s deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-10\">Q. This Koebner\u2019s syndrome or phenomenon of which you spoke a while ago, you used the illustration of a pin scratch, I believe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-12\">Q. Is that correct? And in order to produce this phenomenon, you must at least scratch below the first layer of skin, must you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-13\">A. Below'the first several layers of skin. You must go entirely through epidermis, and injur [sic] the dermis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-14\">Q. So that simply gripping a wheel of a bus, using your hands in that manner, doesn\u2019t produce scratches, does it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-15\">A. Oh, haven\u2019t you ever driven a car as much as I have? I have had blisters on my hands from driving an automobile. I had a little sports car; I had to change the steering wheel because it produced blisters every time I drove the thing....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-16\">Q. That produced blisters, but it didn\u2019t cut your hands, did it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-17\">A. No, but when you produce a blister, you have got a dermal problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-18\">App. at 40-1. Needless to say, this testimony is not at all inconsistent with another illustration of the Koebner phenomenon which Dr. Mitchell provided at another point in his deposition: that \u201cit\u2019s well established that the mild, repeated trauma to the knees and elbows of patients accounts for the characteristic distribution of psoriasis, and this is a form of Koeb-ner\u2019s phenomenon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35. In fact. Dr. Mitchell\u2019s testimony was clear and unambiguous on the issue of whether the aggravation of Hensley\u2019s psoriasis was work-related. <em>See </em>n.4 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b333-6\">. The Board itself admitted that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s \u201cstressing of the fact that claimant\u2019s knees were not affected by psoriasis is puzzling in light of the fact that claimant\u2019s knees did not appear to be subject to repeated trauma.\u201d App. at 11 n.8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b333-7\">. There is little doubt in our minds that even if the Administrative Law Judge had entirely ignored the statutory presumption, he would still have had to find that the weight of the medical evidence was in Hensley\u2019s favor, since the testimony of two treating physicians is normally entitled to greater weight than the testimony of one physician who examines the claimant only once, many months later, in connection with the claim. See <em>generally Combs v. Gardner, </em>382 F.2d 949, 956-57 (6th Cir. 1967); <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Harris, Civ. </em>No. 79-869 (D.D.C., Nov. 6, 1979) at 5 (\u201cas a matter of law the testimony in evidence of a doctor who treats a patient over a substantial period of time is entitled more consideration than the testimony of a doctor who examined a patient once.\u201d); <em>see also Robinson v.

They reach such result first by ruling there was no \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d contradicting the presumption of coverage, and then by ruling that in any event there was no \u201csubstantial evidence in the record considered as a whole\u201d to reject Hensley\u2019s claim that his psoriatic condition was <em>aggravated </em>by driving his bus over some bumpy pavement. In reaching these conclusions the majority, claiming reliance on \u201cthe humanitarian nature of the Act,\u201d but in reality relying on compassion, side-step longstanding principles of judicial review that are firmly established by decisions of the Supreme Court in Longshoremen\u2019s Act cases. Therefore, I must dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-15\">Hensley had driven buses for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority (WMATA) for 32 years. Since 1967 he has been plagued by general psoriasis, the cause of which he concedes is <em>not </em>work related. Hensley contends that in 1977 the new route he \u201cpicked\u201d in the fall of 1976 (App. 17) became bumpy due to chuck holes and traffic of heavy vehicles, that this caused him to be bounced around in driving his bus, and, with supporting testimony from his treating doctors, that this caused a disabling aggravation of his longstanding psoriatic condition. As to the circumstances Hensley testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>[D]uring the course of this time <em>my skin began to dry out and peel and crack: </em>and it was very hard for me \u2014 in other words, it would hurt to hold the steering wheel. And I was trying to drive with a thumb and finger proposition [sic]. But when I would grip the wheel and be out there on the job for a while, then it would crack open and bleed from the work, from doing the job, from holding the steering wheel; it would actually crack open and my hand would bleed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">App. 108 (Emphasis added). Hensley fixed August 15, 1977 as the date of his injury (aggravation).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The work related aggravation that is claimed here was capsulated in the following testimony by Hensley\u2019s regular treating doctor (Dr. Mitchell):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">In August of 1977, Mr. Hensley came in with more extensive psoriasis. His psoriasis was what we call guttate type of psoriasis,<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark> drop like, <em>all over the body. </em>And he had extensive pustular lesions on the palms and soles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">(App. 30) (Emphasis added). Note that Hensley\u2019s doctor claimed that in August 1977 his patient developed the psoriasis <em>\u201call over his body\u201d </em>that also included the affliction on his palms and soles. The \u201csevere pustular lesions of the palms <em>and soles\u201d </em>were the reason his doctor considered \u201cit was impossible [for Hensley] to continue\u201d driving a bus, but these lesions were but one part of the guttate type psoriasis that manifested itself all at the same time. (App. 32) (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">In claiming that such aggravation was job related, Hensley\u2019s treating doctors opined that the aggravation resulted from the operation of a medical theory known as the Koebner phenomenon (App. 28, 31, 35, 40, 68, 73). This theory, according to Dr. Mitchell, with whom Hensley\u2019s other treating doctor (Dr. Nigra) agreed, holds that \u201cif the dermis in a psoriatic patient is injured, [the patient] will get psoriatic lesions <em>in the area that was injured.\u201d </em>(App. 28) (Emphasis added). The Koebner theory requires that there be some force that goes \u201centirely through [the] epidermis and injure[s] the dermis.\u201d (App. 40). There was testimony from Hensley\u2019s Dr. Mitchell indicating that blisters can cause Koebner phenomenon (App. 41), but no unequivocal testimony from anyone that Hensley had blisters. My colleagues, trying to explain Hensley\u2019s symptoms with a \u201cblister theory,\u201d state there is no direct evidence to contradict claimant\u2019s theory that \u201chis psoriatic hands first broke into pustular lesions and then cracked and bled from gripping the wheel.\u201d Maj. op. at 274; see also <em>id. </em>at 270 n.5. But evidence need not be \u201cdirect\u201d to be substantial, and Hensley\u2019s testimony itself contradicts his blister theory. In relating the causal scenario that led to his disability he spoke of no blisters; rather, he said, \u201cmy skin began to dry out and peel and crack.\u201d (App. 108.) It is true that \u201cpustular lesions\u201d were later found on his hands and feet. But pus-filled lesions are not necessarily blisters. More likely than not they were the <em>result </em>of Hensley\u2019s aggravated psoriasis and not the cause. That at least is a reasonable inference, and it is for the Benefit Review Board and not this court to assess the relative weights of contrary inferences. Hensley\u2019s failure to testify as to blisters <em>preceding </em>the onset of what is claimed to be the operation of Koebner\u2019s phenomenon thus dooms his case at its most critical point \u2014 his hands. <em>The testimony of Hensley\u2019s Dr. Mitchell </em>also dooms his case at his feet. See <em>infra. Dr. Mitchell </em>also testified: \u201cThe friction or the abrasive pattern does not appear to exemplify [the \u201cKoebner phenomenon, the trauma, the cutting of the skin\u201d]\u201d (App. 86). <em>Thus, even ignoring the substantial evidence introduced </em>against <em>Hensley, the evidence introduced in his behalf affords a reasonable inference that his aggravated psoriasis was not work-related.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">Dr. Stolar (the WMATA doctor) testified that Hensley\u2019s aggravation was not an ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>ample of the working of the Koebner phenomenon. The Administrative Law Judge and the Benefits Review Board agreed, finding that Hensley\u2019s condition was <em>not </em>work-aggravated. Such \u201cfindings of fact in the decision under review by the Board shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3); <em>Banks v. Chicago Grain Trimmers Association, Inc., </em>390 U.S. 459, 467, 88 S.Ct. 1140, 1145, 20 L.Ed.2d 30 (1968); <em>Marcus v. Director, </em>548 F.2d 1044, 1051 (D.C.Cir.1976). Therefore, this court must follow the decision of the Administrative Law Judge and the Board unless it is <em>not </em>supported by <em>substantial evidence. </em>There is a statutory presumption \u201c[t]hat the claim comes within the provisions of the [Act].\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(a). This presumption, however, is procedural and falls when the employer introduces substantial evidence to overcome it. <em>Del Vec-chio v.

In an effort to keep this presumption alive, my colleagues poor mouth the testimony of Dr. Stolar, assert that he was \u201chired by WMATA\u201d (who else would he be hired by?), claim that he was not qualified by \u201cexperience or knowledge\u201d to give the expert testimony he did, and then, after reciting the presumption favoring a finding of causality, conclude: \u201cWe can find no <em>substantial </em>evidence to the contrary\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aty-dedup-0\">[T]here is no evidence in the record that this third doctor [Dr. Stolar] had any particular experience or knowledge upon which to base his opinion regarding Hensley\u2019s \u201cwork pattern\u201d as a bus driver, or his opinion regarding the \u201cconstant frictional pattern\u201d to which Hensley was subjected on his particularly rough bus route during July and August of 1977. .. .

ENDRESS [Hensley\u2019s lawyer]: <em>No questions.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">(App. 64-65) (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">This case, which involves a question of medical fact, turns on whether the testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>ny of this national expert in dermatology (Dr. Stolar), who is \u201cBoard-certified in that specialty\u201d (App. 64), <em>and other testimony of record, </em>constitutes \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d The AU observed \u201cDr. Stolar is an impressively credentialled member of a learned profession.\u201d (App. 84). Dr. Stolar gave his opinion after reading Dr. Nigra\u2019s medical reports (App. 79), letters from Drs. Mitchell and Nigra (App. 65), and after personally interviewing Hensley as to his medical history and then subjecting him to a physical examination. (App. 65, 157-160). The colored pictures of Hensley\u2019s affliction that Dr. Stolar had taken are an appendix to the WMATA brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">It is the testimony (opinion, and uncon-troverted and admitted factual statements) of this accredited national medical expert in dermatology, and substantial additional circumstantial evidence, that my colleagues recklessly condemn as not \u201csubstantial\u201d and consign to oblivion. In lieu of Dr. Stolar\u2019s testimony, and the additional circumstantial evidence, they rely completely on the opinion of the very dermatologist who had been treating Hensley for many years when his psoriasis flared up and choose to ignore that portion of the dermatologist\u2019s testimony that is fatal to his patient\u2019s claim. If any doctor\u2019s testimony should be questioned it should be that of Hensley\u2019s regular dermatologist, who had substantially less experience than had Dr. Stolar and who, because he had been treating Hensley for psoriasis for years, had a definite self-interest in attributing Hensley\u2019s psoriatic flare-up to some cause other than his own treatment. Dr. Stolar testified that he probably would have stopped Hensley from working long before and tried to clear up his skin. (App. 83, 89).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Hensley\u2019s doctor (Mitchell) was not a novice in dermatology but his medical credentials were definitely inferior to those of Dr. Stolar. He was Board certified in 1963, had been licensed to practice for about 14 years. Recently he had been \u201cemployed by Group Health\u201d as a dermatologist. (App. 23). He was in private practice only from 1964 to 1967 and for a \u201cshort time after he came to Washington.\u201d He was on the staff at Doctor\u2019s Hospital and Georgetown University. As to publications, \u201conly one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Relying on his own analysis, Dr. Mitchell claimed the Koebner phenomenon supported his contention that Hensley\u2019s psori-atic. condition was <em>aggravated </em>by his occupation as a bus driver.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The aggravation claimed was the development of <em>psoriatic lesions </em>during the time he was driving his bus over some bumpy pavement (App. 28, 30, 32, 48). However, Dr. Stolar\u2019s testimony and reports indicate that in his expert opinion the Koebner phenomenon did <em>not </em>support the contention that the psoriatic lesions constituting the alleged aggravation were caused by Hensley\u2019s driving his bus over the bumpy pavement (App. 73, 157-158, 159-160). In determining work relatedness all doctors, of necessity, relied upon their interviews with Hensley, but my colleagues determine that the testimony of the WMATA doctor because of such reliance is not substantial. Maj. op. at 271. There is no justification for refusing to accept Hensley\u2019s factual statements as reported to Dr. Stolar and accepting them when given to his own doctor. There is no testimony that either doctor was with him when he was driving the bus. If Dr. Stolar could not give an opinion on the basis of the patient\u2019s statements, neither could Hensley\u2019s doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">On the controlling issue the Administrative Law Judge in his Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">The sole issue is one of medical fact, specifically, whether Mr. Hensley\u2019s holding the steering wheel of a bus, being bounced in the seat and using his feet in driving has aggravated his underlying non-job related condition. I believe that the weight of substantial evidence preponderates on the side of non-exacerbation. Thus, the treating physician testified that Koebner\u2019s phenomenon is produced only by injuries that penetrate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>epidermis and injure the dermis but that \u201cit\u2019s well established that the mild, repeated trauma to the knees and elbows of patients accounts for the characteristic distribution of psoriasis, and this is a form of Koebner\u2019s phenomenon.\u201d Aside from the internal inconsistency of this testimony, photographs submitted in evidence with his report show that, while Hensley\u2019s elbows have extensive psoriatic lesions, his knees are clear and uninvolved despite the fact that his work is largely performed in a seated position and at least one leg, according to Hensley, \u201cdoes all the work.\u201d Ironically, this physician\u2019s patient\u2019s condition is significantly inconsistent with the premise upon which the entire theory of causation is based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\">While I am mindful of the presumptions of section 20 of the Act, the provisions of that section mandate that these presumptions cannot supply causation where other substantial evidence indicates that it is non-existent. <em>Cf. Calbeck v. Strachan Shipping Company, </em>306 F.2d 693, 694, 696 (5th Cir. 1962). Accordingly, the claim will be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">(App. 19).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The Administrative Appeals Judges, one judge dissenting,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> after reviewing the record and the ALJ decision, reached the same conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">The record as summarized above contains substantial evidence to support the administrative law judge\u2019s conclusion. Dr. Stolar stated clearly on several occasions that he was of the opinion that claimant\u2019s condition was not work-aggravated. Although the other physicians expressed opinions to the contrary, the administrative law judge is entitled to weigh the medical evidence and draw his own inferences from it and is not bound to accept the opinion or theory of any particular medical examiner. <em>Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Donovan, </em>300 F.2d 741 (5th Cir. 1962). Dr. Stolar\u2019s opinion that claimant\u2019s psoriasis was not work-aggravated together with the record evidence that <em>areas not subject to trauma were also involved and that the problem has continued despite the fact that claimant has been removed from the continual pounding constitutes substantial evidence to support the administrative law judge\u2019s ultimate </em>conclusion3 [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-10\">8 We acknowledge that the administrative law judge\u2019s analysis is not a model of clarity. Also, his stressing of the fact that claimant\u2019s knees were not affected by psoriasis is puzzling in light of the fact that claimant\u2019s knees did not appear to be subject to repeated trauma. However, we do not believe these factors so undermine the administrative law judge\u2019s ultimate finding so as to require reversal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-11\">Accordingly, the Decision and Order of the administrative law judge is affirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aql-dedup-0\">(App. 11-12) (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">These decisions by agency officials specially trained in these workmen\u2019s compensation matters under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act clearly refute my colleagues\u2019 claim that Dr. Stolar\u2019s testimony and the other supporting evidentiary facts do not constitute \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">The evidentiary record contains several basic facts that the Board and the ALJ relied upon in their opinions which in my view support their conclusion that the aggravation in Hensley\u2019s psoriatic condition was <em>not </em>work related, i. e.,</p>\n<p id=\"b338-15\">(1) Hensley began as a bus driver in 1946 and he had been driving continuously for 32 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-16\">(2) He contracted psoriasis in 1967 and it is admitted that this was <em>not </em>the result of any work related cause. (App. 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-17\">(3) \u201c[Hensley] had dental surgery in the summer of 1977, <em>and following that </em>his psoriasis flared badly.\u201d (App. 154, Letter of Hensley\u2019s Dr. Nigra) (Emphasis added). This is the approximate time when he claimed- his work caused the aggravating flare-up.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-18\">(4) Other pre-existing causes that are recognized to cause such aggravation as Hensley suffered were present and were <em>not </em>work related. They include: (a) obesi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>ty, (b) severe emotional distress, and (c) burns of the skin (Cf., App. 156). Hensley had all of these causes. He was \u201cconstantly told that his obesity is an aggravating factor in his psoriasis.\u201d (App. 52). He had suffered extreme emotional distress in 1975 when his son attempted suicide and wound up being \u201cmentally incapacitated and back at home.\" (App. 45-46).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He had also suffered some skin burns from the ultraviolet treatment he was receiving from the doctor for his psoriasis. (App. 41, 68, 159).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">(5) Hensley\u2019s Group Health medical records show that he had \u201cLesions of psoriasis in scalp, both elbows and groin area\u201d as far back as <em>July 15, 1970. </em>(App. 162). This same <em>1970 entry </em>stated: \u201cNon-psoriatic ma-cular papular <em>lesions </em>\u2014 Koebner\u2019s <em>phenomena and in groin area.\u201d </em>(App. 162). Thus, his lesions were of longstanding duration and the Koebner phenomenon was claimed to be causing aggravation for reasons that were not claimed to be work related as far back as 1970. His situation was much the same in 1978. He had lesions on his hands and the soles of his feet, which he attributed to work-related physical trauma. <em>The claim with respect to his feet, however, was subsequently attributed to another cause by his doctor. </em>But he also had lesions in other areas of his body <em>where no trauma was claimed to exist. </em>His scalp was \u201cheavily crusted all over,\u201d and he had lesions on the groins, perineum, upper inner thighs, knees, elbows, center of the back, and buttocks. Dr. Stolar stated that he \u201clooked for evidence of Koebner phenomenon, but did not find any. The varying lesions appear to be spontaneous and well established.\u201d (App. 158).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">(6) On August 15, 1977, after years of medical treatment which controlled his pso-riatic condition reasonably well, it again became aggravated over his whole body. Ignoring the other aggravating lesions Hensley contended that the contemporaneous aggravation of his palms and soles was caused by the recent \u201cpounding\u201d which resulted from driving his bus over the new (bumpy) route. He had selected this new bus route in the fall of 1976 (App. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">(7) Hensley\u2019s doctors in 1977 contended that the Koebner phenomenon supported their claim that his aggravated condition was work related. The doctors had also attributed his 1970 flare-up to the Koebner phenomenon but had never contended that the aggravation at that time was work related. As to the 1977 claim (the present claim) the Board ruled against Hensley and pointed opt that his <em>aggravation (lesions) was present in areas not subject to the alleged physical work-related trauma that he contended were the cause of the aggravation. </em>His right ankle<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and stomach and other areas that were not involved in any of the alleged trauma also had the same lesions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (App. 6) and his condition remained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>severe three months after he quit driving a bus (App. 6). The existence of such lesions in areas that could <em>not </em>be considered to have been affected by the alleged work related cause (trauma) is extremely significant because Hensley\u2019s own doctor testified that \u201ctrauma to an area of skin in a patient who has psoriasis will result in a flare of psoriasis <em>in the traumatic area.\u201d </em>(App. 4, 14) (Emphasis added). <em>Thus, the existence of the numerous psoriatic lesions in areas admittedly not affected by the alleged trauma was fatal to the probative effect of the testimonial claims and theory of Hensley\u2019s doctors. </em>And see (8) <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">(8) Hensley\u2019s doctor (Mitchell) admitted that the psoriatic lesions on the soles of the feet of his bus driving patient were caused by \u201chis walking\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">I think <em>his </em>[Hensley\u2019s] <em>walking was aggravating his feet. </em>I think Mr. Hensley was a psoriatic who we describe as very brittle. And a lot of things would set him off. And I think this was one of the contributing factors to his getting worse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Av0\">(App. 53) (Emphasis added). There is no testimony in the record that such \u201cwalking\u201d was related to his occupation as a bus driver. Thus, here again the testimony of Hensley\u2019s own doctor is fatal to his claim, i. e., the pustular lesions on his feet were caused by a non-work related reason. And see (9) <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">(9) This leaves only the issue of the application of the Koebner phenomenon to Hensley\u2019s <em>hands. </em>It has already been noted, with respect to his hands, that the <em>sine qua non </em>for work-related causation \u2014 some work related force that causes a penetration of the outer skin and injures the inner skin \u2014 is absent here. Part II <em>supra. </em>Also, since his hands were affected in <em>exactly </em>the same manner as his feet, and the aggravation of his feet was not work related, the Board\u2019s decision that the entire aggravation was not work related is amply supported by substantial evidence and logic. This conclusion is even stronger when it is recognized that lesions also occurred over the rest of his body and <em>none </em>of the other areas was affected by a work related cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">From all the medical history and facts Dr. Stolar concluded that Hensley\u2019s condition \u201cwas [not] work related or work aggravated.\u201d (App. 160). The AU and the Board credited his testimony and opinion. My colleagues say such record testimony does <em>not </em>constitute substantial evidence and they reverse the judgment based thereon because, allegedly absent substantial evidence, the \u201cBoard failed properly to apply the statutory presumption [of coverage] concerning work-relatedness in this case.\u201d Maj. op. at 274. In reality this is a blatant attempt to reweigh the evidence in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Del Vecchio v. Bowers, supra. </em>If Dr. Sto-lar\u2019s testimony does not constitute \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d then substantial evidence does not exist. To characterize his testimony, and the very strong circumstantial evidence, as \u201cinsubstantial\u201d is to transmogrify the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">All this leads to my colleagues misapplying the statutory procedural presumption of coverage in \u00a7 920(a). They give lip service to the proper rule but end up treating the presumption as substantive rather than procedural by applying it to resolve disputed factual issues.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Del Vecchio v. Bowers, </em>296 U.S. 280, 56 S.Ct. 190, 80 L.Ed. 229 (1936) is the definitive case on this point. It dealt with the \u00a7 920(d) presumption against suicide which has the same status as the presumption of coverage that is involved here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"afo-dedup-0\">The statement in the act that the evidence to overcome the effect of the presumption must be substantial adds nothing to the well understood principle that a finding must be supported by evidence^ ] <em>Once the employer has carried his burden by offering testimony sufficient to justify a finding of suicide, the presumption falls out of the case. It never had and cannot acquire the attribute of evidence in the claimant\u2019s favor.[] Its only office is to control the result where there is an entire lack of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>competent evidence. </em>If the employer alone adduces evidence which tends to support the theory of suicide, the case must be decided upon that evidence. Where the claimant offers substantial evidence in opposition, as was the case here, the issue must be resolved upon the whole body of proof pro and con; [] and <em>if it permits an inference either way upon the question of suicide, the Deputy Commissioner and he alone is empowered to draw the inference; his decision as to the weight of the evidence may not be disturbed by the court.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">296 U.S. at 286-87, 56 S.Ct. at 193. (Footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\"><em>Del Vecchio </em>thus limits presumptions under \u00a7 920 to their procedural effect and prohibits such presumption from having any substantive or evidentiary effect. The Board properly found that the presumption of \u00a7 920(a) had been rebutted and that there was substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole to support its finding that the cause of Hensley\u2019s aggravation was <em>not </em>work related.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">When my colleagues treat the presumption as substantive rather than as procedural they commit error in so doing. The AU and the Board had extensive circumstantial evidence from all the doctors that completely belies Hensley\u2019s work-related theory. See n.4, <em>supra, </em>for testimony of Hensley\u2019s doctor. In addition, they had a choice between the expert testimony of a national medical expert and the opinion of a doctor of lesser stature and experience whose personal treatment of the patient as a potential cause of his aggravation was directly involved. They elected to credit Dr. Sto-lar\u2019s opinion, and the surrounding factual circumstances, amply established in the record, also supported their decision. The claim that the psoriatic lesions on Hensley\u2019s hands and feet were <em>caused </em>by the bouncing of his bus on the road, and that these lesions were examples of Koebner\u2019s phenomenon, was refuted by the fact that he had similar lesions on other areas of his body which were not subject to the work related cause he contended brought about the aggravated condition of his feet and hands. My colleagues wholly ignore the circumstantial evidence, including the fatally adverse testimony of Hensley\u2019s doctor (n.4 <em>supra) </em>and apply the discredited claim that \u201cnormally . . . greater weight\u201d goes to two physicians rather than one. Maj. op. at 273 n.13.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is no such rule. The greater weight should be given to the more creditable testimony, all factors considered. And the <em>weight </em>of the evidence is primarily to be determined by the ALJ and the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The decisions of the Supreme Court require that the Administrative Law Judge and the Benefits Review Board be affirmed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUP\">\u201cIt matters not that the basic facts from which. the Deputy Commissioner draws this inference are undisputed rather than controverted.... It is likewise immaterial that the facts permit the drawing of diverse inferences. <em>The Deputy Commissioner alone is charged with the duty of initially selecting the inference which seems most reasonable and his choice, if otherwise sustainable, may not be disturbed by a reviewing court. . . . </em>Moreover, the fact that the inference of the type here made by the Deputy Commissioner involves an application of a broad statutory term or phrase to a specific set of facts gives rise to no greater scope of judicial review. ...\u201d <em>Cardillo v.

Adler, </em>407 F.2d 307, 313-14 (D.C.Cir.1968), (Maj. op. at 267, 267-268, 268) is misplaced so far as this case is concerned or as to any case where there was medical testimony that the injury was <em>not </em>work related. In <em>Wheatley </em>the doctor for the defendant \u201cwas <em>unable </em>to state an opinion on the key question, whether there was a work related factor that aggravated the employee\u2019s condition.\u201d 407 F.2d at 313 (Emphasis added). Thus, the decision in <em>Wheatley </em>is not relevant here where the doctor did testify as to his opinion. This likewise is not a case like <em>Ryan-Walsh Stevedoring Co. v. Trainer, </em>601 F.2d 1306 (D.C.Cir.1979) where the case was remanded to determine if claimant was married to the deceased because the contrary determination was not based upon the \u201capplicable state law of domestic relations as required by [the applicable Supreme Court opinion].\u201d 601 F.2d at 1315. Nor can WMATA\u2019s case against Hensley\u2019s claim by any stretch of the imagination be construed to involve \u201cisolated evidence.\u201d <em>Friend v.

If the pattern they follow here were proper, all testimony of employer physicians who examined the worker <em>after </em>he made his claim could be arbitrarily ignored as \u201cnot entitled to \u2018substantial\u2019 weight\u201d (Maj. op. at 271), and <em>every </em>contested claim could be determined by the presumption of coverage and a sympathetic desire to bring about \u201cbeneficent purposes and humanitarian\u201d objectives.

This was extremely upsetting to Mr. Hensley.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\"><em>And I can tell you, Mr. Hensley does Pare with emotional stress. I couldn\u2019t say that his condition in 1977 was related to anything other than maybe this is an on-going stress in his life, </em>because this, as I recall, happened in 1975, I believe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">[Hensley\u2019s medical record in Dr. Turner\u2019s handwriting for January 10, 1975 states:] \u201cSeries of catastrophes hit his family.\u201d I have trouble reading Dr. Turner\u2019s handwriting, too. Looks like: \u201c. . . initiating last spring and he\u2019s starting to flare up again.

There was no work related scratching, cutting or bumping of his belly, chest, elbows or backside, but all these areas had psoriatic lesions (App. 42 \u2014 43). My colleagues refer to pustular lesions on his hands and feet but it was the lesions, not their pustular nature, that caused the bleeding. Hensley never disputes the argument that the lesions elsewhere on his body belie his claim that his work caused the lesions on his hands and feet. (Cf. App. 6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\">.

Yet the majority is prepared to give \u201cgreater weight\u201d to the testimony of Hensley\u2019s two treating physicians, whose experience and knowledge in this respect were no greater.
