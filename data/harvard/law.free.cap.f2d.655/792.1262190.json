He allegedly placed a large knife at the throat of Lynn Peters and cut her neck. The jury found defendant guilty on Count 2 and acquitted defendant on Count 1, in which he was charged with kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">The only issue on appeal is whether an indictment charging assault with a dangerous weapon under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(c) is defective when it fails to allege that the defendant committed the assault without just cause or excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">The Magistrate in denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss Count 2 relied on an earlier decision by Judge Gordon, who presided at this trial, in <em>U. S. v. Peters, </em>476 F.Supp. 259 (E.D.Wis.1979). In <em>Peters </em>Judge Gordon decided that the prosecution was not obliged to include a reference to \u201cjust cause or excuse\u201d in the indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <em>Hockenberry v. U. S., </em>442 F.2d 171, 173 (1970), decided that it was not necessary to recite in the indictment that the assault was \u201cwithout just cause or excuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">We agree with the Ninth Circuit in <em>Hock-enberry </em>and with Judge Gordon in <em>Peters.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">The judgment of conviction on Count 2 is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
