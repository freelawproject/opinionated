The case is being decided by a quorum. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b146-21\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b146-22\">In our original decision, <em>Alford v. American Bridge Division, U. S. Steel Corp., </em>642 F.2d 807 (5th Cir. 1981), we affirmed the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and Benefits Review Board\u2019s (BRB) denial of coverage under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Hector Cantu for injuries which he sustained while he was constructing a seventy-five pound black diamond navigational signal which was to be attached to an American Bridge barge loaded with vessel modules. A careful review of the Petition for Rehearing En Banc which attacks this denial, convinces us that we made an error with respect to that portion of the decision. In all other respects our decision remains unaffected.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">We originally held that Cantu did not qualify as a covered \u201cemployee\u201d under the Act because the construction of the black diamond did not \u201cqualif[y] as traditional maritime activity or reac[h] the level of involvement in the shipbuilding process described as <em>fundamental, integral </em>or <em>essential.\u201d Alford, </em>642 F.2d at 813. Rather, the marker \u201cwas merely to be used in maritime commerce as a navigational traffic sign and we find this use too tenuous a connection to shipbuilding or ship repairing as required under the LHWCA.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">A reconsideration of the principles of \u201cmaritime employment status\u201d developed in prior decisions, persuades us that Cantu is entitled to coverage. Recently, <em>Trotti &amp; Thompson v. Crawford, </em>631 F.2d 1214 (5th Cir. 1980), and many other past decisions of the Supreme Court and this Court have held that making and maintaining facilities and items of equipment for loading and unloading vessels<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and for building them <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are covered operations. <em>Trotti </em>involved a land-based carpenter who was injured while constructing a pier \u2014 a facility essential to maritime commerce. The Court there reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">Although we minimize their importance,\" both [dry docks and piers] are aids to maritime commerce and are used in support of navigation even though the analogy to traditional aids to navigation is a little far-fetched.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-11\"><em>Trotti, </em>631 F.2d at 1219 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">Even more recently, we have canvassed the many cases in <em>Hullinghorst Industries v. Carroll, </em>650 F.2d 750, 751 (5th Cir.). Since the black diamond navigational signal was essential for a tow exceeding 600 feet in length and was being constructed for installation on a barge to be used in transporting ship modules to the shipyard in the East, the activity was sufficiently related to maritime commerce as to be maritime employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">We now find that the analogy between a black diamond navigational signal, which is required by the U.S. Coast Guard as a daytime indicator on barges towing 600 feet or more, and traditional \u201caid to navigation\u201d is not so \u201ctenuous\u201d as to deny Cantu LHWCA benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">In addition we find Cantu within the perimeters of \u201cemployee status\u201d based on the principles announced by the Supreme Court in <em>P.G. Pfeiffer Co., Inc. v. Ford, </em>444 U.S. 69, 100 S.Ct. 328, 62 L.Ed.2d 225 (1979), which emphasizes that in defining \u201cemployee status\u201d the crucial factor is the nature of the activities which a worker <em>may be assigned.\u201d Pfeiffer, </em>444 U.S. at 82, 100 S.Ct. at 337. (Emphasis added). <em>See also Howard v. Rebel Well Service, </em>632 F.2d 1348, 1350 (5th Cir. 1980) <em>(\u201cCaputo </em>defines status in terms of workers who spend \u2018at least some of their time\u2019 in ship repair\u201d; claimant \u201cwas a member of a crew of workers who regularly performed some portion of the traditionally maritime activity of ship repair, thus he was constantly <em>eligible for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>assignment </em>to that task\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; <em>Thibodaux v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>580 F.2d 841, 844 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 909, 99 S.Ct. 2820, 61 L.Ed.2d 274 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Finding that Cantu falls within the foregoing principles delineating \u201cemployee status\u201d under the LHWCA, we vacate that portion of the decision which originally denied his benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">MODIFIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-8\">.

In <em>Howard, </em>the claimant was employed as a sandblaster and painter at a yard which performed minor repairs on navigable floating barges. Claimant testified that he \u201cmostly\u201d worked on equipment removed from barge rigs and brought to the yard. Although his superior at the yard testified that equipment from the barge rigs comprised only about ten percent of work assigned to the sandblasting crew, the Court found claimant a covered employee under' the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
