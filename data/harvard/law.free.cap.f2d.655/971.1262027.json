Because reversal would necessitate a retrial barred by the double jeopardy clause, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-24\"><em>FACTUAL </em>BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-25\">The appellee was charged in a three-count indictment with willful failure to file individual income tax returns for the years 1973-1975, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203. Following appellee\u2019s plea of not guilty, and waiver of trial by jury, the district court began hearing testimony on April 13, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-26\">During the presentation of the government\u2019s case, the court heard the testimony of Ostrove, an attorney who had represented appellee prior to this trial. Ostrove testified that after appellee\u2019s accountant had received an administrative summons to produce Dahlstrum\u2019s law partnership\u2019s accounting records, he had contacted an IRS special agent, Marc Schreiber, to discuss a possible civil settlement of appellee\u2019s delinquent taxes. Schreiber, the agent who had issued the summons, told Ostrove that he was not interested in the civil aspects of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>Dahlstrum\u2019s case. At that point, the trial judge became concerned that the IRS had abused its power by issuing a \u00a7 7602 summons in an investigation that had solely criminal purposes. <em>See United States v. La Salle National Bank, </em>437 U.S. 298, 98 S.Ct. 2357, 57 L.Ed.2d 221 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">The government called Special Agent Schreiber to the stand in an attempt to eliminate the judge\u2019s concern. Schreiber\u2019s testimony had the opposite effect. The judge grew increasingly disturbed over the events in question, and ordered the special agent\u2019s group manager, Sullivan, to appear and explain the IRS\u2019s practices and procedures. Sullivan was questioned almost exclusively by the trial judge, although at one point defense counsel asked the witness a few questions. Sullivan testified that, as an institutional practice, special agents issue \u00a7 7602 summonses before a cooperating revenue officer has been brought in on the case. On the basis of Sullivan\u2019s testimony, the judge orally dismissed the indictment against appellee because of governmental misconduct. The judge suggested that defense counsel prepare findings of fact and conclusions of law, and submit them to the court within 30 days. Defense counsel complied with this suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">The district court formally entered its judgment on July 11, 1980, ordering, <em>inter alia, </em>that the indictment be dismissed with prejudice, and that the appellee be acquitted from all charges contained in the indictment. The district court did not adopt the defense counsel\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Rather, the court made its own decision, including findings and conclusions. The government appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-9\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-10\">Although other issues are addressed by the parties, we hold that the issue of double jeopardy<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is dispositive of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-12\">Appellee alleges that the double jeopardy clause bars this appeal, because (1) the ruling of the district court constituted an acquittal, (2) the termination of the trial was not the result of his voluntary choice, and (3) there was no \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for the termination of the trial. We need not decide whether the disposition below constituted an acquittal because we hold that this appeal is barred since appellee did not seek a termination of the trial on non-guilt related grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-13\">It is fundamental that the government has no right of an appeal in a criminal case, absent explicit statutory authority. <em>United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 84-5, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 2190-91, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> authorizes appeals by the government except when the double jeopardy clause prohibits further prosecution. Congress, by enacting \u00a7 3731, intended to remove all statutory barriers to government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>appeals and to allow appeals whenever the Constitution would permit. <em>DiFrancesco, supra; United States v. Wilson, </em>420 U.S. 332, 337, 95 S.Ct. 1013, 1018-19, 43 L.Ed.2d 232 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">The law attaches particular significance to an acquittal. The Supreme Court has held that the Constitution does not permit a judgment of acquittal to be appealed when a second trial would be necessary upon reversal. <em>DiFrancesco, supra; Scott, supra, </em>437 U.S. at 91, 98 S.Ct. at 2194. A \u201cdefendant is acquitted only when \u2018the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution [in the defendant\u2019s favor], correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u2019 <em>[United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 571, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 1354, 51 L.Ed.2d (1977)].\u201d <em>Scott, supra, </em>437 U.S. at 97, 98 S.Ct. at 2197.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">There is some evidence to support appel-lee\u2019s contention that the district judge\u2019s disposition constituted an acquittal. It is clear that the district judge had serious doubts as to whether the government had established its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Appel-lee calls our attention to the following colloquy between the court and the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcG\">\u201cTHE COURT: I know. But I haven\u2019t found anything so far, I must tell you. The evidence so far indicates lack of guilt, if you take the presumption of innocence together with the burden upon the government to prove each and every essential element of the crime charged and if you look at the cases which I point out to you requiring specific intent even in misdemeanor IRS cases, specific intent, which means voluntarily and intentionally and with specific intent to So something the law forbids with a bad purpose to disobey or disregard the law. I haven\u2019t found it beyond a reasonable doubt so far.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-6\">If you want to ask my opinion now, I\u2019ll tell you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-8\">MR. KLUGER: Well, there are certain matters that I would venture to put before this Court that have been testified to that would indicate everything you have required; however, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my position at this time to elaborate on them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-9\">THE COURT: This isn\u2019t the time for argument, but you suggest to me that I find him guilty, and that\u2019s a suggestion I find without merit at this stage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1034-10\">In addition, the judge, when he orally dismissed the case with prejudice, stated: \u201cNow, I don\u2019t think that any case can be made beyond what\u2019s been made, so I\u2019m going to dismiss it with prejudice, and then it will be up to the government to do what they wish about it. I think that it\u2019s an appropriate dismissal.\u201d The judgment entered on July 11, 1980, states, in part: \u201cDefendant is acquitted of and from any and all counts and charges contained in said indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-11\">The judge\u2019s characterization of his actions, however, does not control. <em>Scott, supra, </em>at 96,98 S.Ct. at 2196; <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>617 F.2d 1358, 1361 (CA9 1980), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Patel v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 899, 101 S.Ct. 268, 66 L.Ed.2d 129. After reviewing the entire record, we cannot conclude, with any degree of certainty, that the district judge\u2019s disposition <em>actually represented </em>a resolution of any of the factual elements of the offense charged. The judge, in response to the contention that appellee had waived findings of fact, stated: \u201cYes. That\u2019s on the merits, but this is on another matter now. This is not on the merits that I\u2019m deciding this case. It\u2019s on the question of governmental impropriety.\u201d The court\u2019s decision and order, filed on July 11, 1980, dealt exclusively with \u201cgovernmental misconduct\u201d, and clearly stated that the dismissal was on that basis. Because of the lack of clarity in the record, we do not rest our holding on the district judge\u2019s \u201cacquittal\u201d of appellee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>Because there does not appear to have been a resolution of the factual elements of the offenses charged, a reversal of the dismissal would clearly require additional proceedings. Appellee asserts that a retrial would violate the double jeopardy clause\u2019s prohibition against multiple prosecutions. The Supreme Court, however, has stated that a second prosecution does not offend the double jeopardy clause if \u201cthe defendant is <em>responsible </em>for the second prosecution.\u201d <em>Scott, supra, </em>437 U.S. at 96, 98 S.Ct. at 2196. (Emphasis added). A \u201cdefendant, by <em>deliberately choosing </em>to seek termination of the proceedings against him on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence of the offense of which he is accused, suffers no injury cognizable under the Double Jeopardy Clause if the Government is permitted to appeal from such a ruling of the trial court in favor of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98-99, 98 S.Ct. at 2197-98. (Emphasis added). This \u201cexception\u201d from the double jeopardy bar clearly contemplates a significant level of participation by the defendant in bringing about a termination of his trial prior to a determination on the merits. The Supreme Court in <em>Scott, </em>emphasized this by its descriptions of the sort of defense participation which removes any double jeopardy problem, e. <em>g., </em>the defendant \u201celected to seek termination\u201d, made a \u201cvoluntary choice\u201d, \u201csuccessfully avoided [a decision on the merits] . . . <em>by persuading the trial court to dismiss\u201d, </em>\u201cundertook <em>to persuade the trial court not to submit the issue of guilt or innocence to the jury\u201d, </em>\u201cobtain[ed] the termination\u201d, and <em>\u201c[sought] to have the trial terminated.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added)v The Court stressed the importance of the defendant retaining \u201cprimary control over the course to be followed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94, 98 S.Ct. at 2195 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 609, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 1080, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (1976)). In <em>Scott, </em>the defendant moved before trial and twice during for dismissal of two counts of the indictment on the ground that his defense had been prejudiced by pre-in-dictment delay. The trial court, at the close of all the evidence, granted the motion. The Court held that, because the defendant could be considered <em>responsible </em>for any reprosecution, the government\u2019s appeal was not barred by the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">Here, <em>the judge </em>was <em>the instigator and the primary mover of the events that led to the dismissal of the indictment. The record convinces us that the judge took complete control of the proceedings and set off on a course over which appellee had practically no control. </em>Nowhere does it appear that the judge, prior to the oral dismissal of the indictment, even consulted appellee on what course of action to take. For that matter, the judge\u2019s words and actions indicated that his primary concern was not with the case before him, but with the effect of his actions on future IRS investigations. The entire record indicates that the judge had no interest in completing the trial. Appellee\u2019s involvement in the termination of the trial was at best minimal and in no way reached the high degree of participation that was present in <em>Scott. </em>Nor can it be said that appellee retained \u201cprimary control\u201d over the course of the trial. <em>Dinitz, supra, </em>at 609, 96 S.Ct. at 1080. For that matter, the record shows that he had no control over what was occurring. The mere fact that appellee\u2019s counsel complied with the judge\u2019s request to prepare findings of fact and conclusions of law prior to the formal entry of judgment is of no consequence. The transcript clearly shows that the judge did not believe the government had proved its case. In these circumstances, there is no doubt but that appellee wanted the judge to decide the case in his favor. Appellee certainly was not seeking to avoid a decision by the trier of fact. His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>relatively passive role should not be taken to reflect anything beyond a keen appreciation of the fact that the judge had taken over the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">We do not believe that appellee can be considered <em>responsible </em>for the termination of his trial. He did not \u201cvoluntarily choose\u201d to avoid submitting the case to the trier of facts on the merits, in the sense the Supreme Court described in <em>Scott </em>We can find no persuasive justification for an expansive reading of <em>Scott </em>In fact, the serious risks to double jeopardy clause values presented by multiple prosecutions caution against such a construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">We conclude that appellee did not \u201cseek\u201d the termination of the trial and hold that his minimal participation did not fall within the rule stated in <em>Scott</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">We conclude that even though the trial court\u2019s decision may not have been a factual determination of guilt or innocence, the government\u2019s appeal is barred by the double jeopardy clause because appellee did not \u201cseek\u201d the termination of his trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Consequently, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1032-15\">. The district court opinion, <em>United States v. Dahlstrum, </em>493 F.Supp. 966 (C.D.Cal.1980), contains a detailed factual statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">. On the merits, the government contends that the district judge erred in dismissing the indictment. The government asserts that the IRS summons was not used improperly, and that even if it was appellee was not thereby entitled to dismissal. This latter contention is based on three arguments: -(1) appellee waived such a claim by failing to raise it prior to trial, (2) appellee had no standing to challenge an IRS summons issued to a third party, and (3) dismissal was an inappropriate remedy because any \u201ctainted\u201d evidence (and the government contends that there was no such evidence introduced at trial) could have been suppressed. Because of our disposition of this appeal, if is unnecessary to comment on these contentions. We express no opinion on the government\u2019s claims, and this disposition should not be construed as an approval of the district judge\u2019s reading of <em>La Salle National Bank, supra, </em>and its progeny.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1033-15\">. Appellant concedes that jeopardy had attached in the district court proceedings. <em>See </em>Serfass <em>v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 377, 388, 95 S.Ct. 1055, 1062, 43 L.Ed.2d 265 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1033-16\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-17\">\u201cIn a criminal case an appeal by the United States shall lie to a court of appeals from a decision, judgment, or order of a district court dismissing an indictment or information as to any one or more counts, except that no appeal shall lie where the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution prohibits further prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">. Appellant also asserts that a resolution of any of the factual elements of the case would have been premature because it had not yet completed its case-in-chief. Appellant notes that it cut short its examination of special agent Schreiber when the judge made it clear that he was only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>interested in the summons issue. Appellee asserts that the government did not have any additional evidence on the specific intent issue, and that, therefore, the judge\u2019s suggestion that he was not yet convinced that the government had met its burden of proof was the equivalent of a specific resolution of a factual element of the offense charged. Since we do not rely ultimately on the \u201cacquittal\u201d of appellee, we need not address whether a resolution of any of the factual elements of the offense would have been premature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">. Appellee, out of an abundance of caution, argued that there was no \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for the dismissal. <em>See Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978). The government does not argue that there was \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d, and, in fact, its argument that dismissal was unnecessarily severe is irreconcilable with a claim of \u201cmanifest necessity.\u201d Furthermore, although the Supreme Court has recently treated mistrials and dismissals similarly, we are not convinced that the \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d analysis applies when a subsequent prosecution is not contemplated. In any event, the arguments of both parties convince us that it was not manifestly necessary to terminate the bench trial prior to a resolution on the merits. The judge, because of his desire to send the IRS \u201ca message\u201d, did not consider available alternatives.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
