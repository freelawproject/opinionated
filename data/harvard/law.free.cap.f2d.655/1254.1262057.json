The FCC was directed to \u201cregulate the rates, terms, and conditions for pole attachments to provide that such rates, terms, and conditions are just and reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6 (codified at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 224(b)(1) (Supp. II 1978)). In the present consolidated cases, a number of utility companies petition for review of a set of FCC orders promulgating rules and policies for rate regulation under the Act. In particular, petitioners and intervenors challenge the FCC\u2019s determinations that CATV should be regarded as occupying one foot of the usable space on utility poles, that capital costs should be assessed whenever possible on the basis of historical costs rather than replacement costs, and that the Act\u2019s provisions for rate regulation apply prospectively to all pole attachments, including those arranged pursuant to contracts made before the enactment of the statute. We uphold the FCC orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-17\">For the first five years of the Act\u2019s effectiveness, the FCC is to be guided by a statutory specification of the range of rates that may be considered just and reasonable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"asc-dedup-1\">[ A ] rate is just and reasonable if it assures a utility the recovery of not less than the additional costs of providing pole attachments, not more than an amount determined by multiplying <em>the percentage of the total usable space ... which is occupied by the pole attachment </em>by the sum of the operating expenses and actual capital costs of the utility attributable to the entire pole....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1315-18\">Act \u00a7 6 (codified at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 224(d)(1) (Supp. II 1978)) (emphasis added). The operation of this interim rate system is illustrated by a calculation explicitly worked out in a Senate report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-19\">[ 0 ]n a typical utility pole 35 feet in length there are 11 feet of usable space (that space above minimum grade level clearance used to attach cable, telephone, and electric wires and associated equipment). By what is virtually a uniform practice throughout the United States, cable television is assigned 1 foot out of the 11 feet of usable space. (While cable only physically occupies approximately 1 inch of this space, the clearance space <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>between CATV and the next adjacent pole user is attributed to CATV.) Cable\u2019s share of the total capital costs and operating expenses for the entire 35-foot pole would be one-eleventh.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">S.Rep. No. 580, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 20 (1978) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, pp. 109, 128. The FCC\u2019s announced procedure for determining whether rates are just and reasonable is consistent with the Senate report\u2019s analysis and the industry practice it describes: the FCC has attributed one foot of the usable space to CATV. Petitioners attack this decision as arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">Petitioners concede that Congress left the FCC broad discretion to determine the amount of space \u201coccupied by the pole attachment\u201d for purposes of the initial implementation of the Act. They argue, however, that the FCC failed to exercise its discretion by erroneously regarding itself as bound by the illustrative example in the Senate report. But the FCC\u2019s language, especially that in its final <em>Memorandum Opinion and Order </em>on the subject, 77 F.C. C.2d 187 (1980), demonstrates that the FCC viewed the legislative history as supporting its own reasoning. That reasoning was based in part on industry practice, in part on utility companies\u2019 profitable use of the safety clearance space, and in part on the risk of replacement cost that many utility contracts imposed on their CATV lessees. \u201cIn sum,\u201d the FCC stated, \u201cwe conclude that our decision on usable space was not only grounded in the legislative intent, but was also amply justified as an equitable and practical matter in the record before us.\u201d 77 F.C.C.2d at 191. We find that the FCC\u2019s determination was a conscientious exercise of discretion, and was a reasonable interpretation of the Act, particularly in view of the interim nature of the current regulatory structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-6\">Petitioners attack the FCC\u2019s preference for historical cost data in evaluating the reasonableness of rates. The Act does not specify the precise method for calculating \u201cactual capital costs,\u201d and the legislative history suggests that Congress intended to give the FCC discretion to decide when historical cost data would be appropriate. \u201cNot wishing to foreclose the Commission from accepting any particular costing methodology, the committee merely seeks to permit the Commission to consider each case on its own merits and according to its own facts.\u201d 124 Cong.Rec. 1598 (remarks of Sen. Hollings). The FCC has decided that historical cost data will be preferred, although other approaches will be permitted when historical data are unavailable. <em>Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, </em>68 F.C.C.2d 3, 11 (1978); <em>Memorandum Opinion and Order, </em>77 F.C.C.2d 187,198 (1980). This determination is clearly within the agency\u2019s discretion; Congress did not intend to require the FCC to reevaluate the merits of current replacement cost data in every rate case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-8\">Finally, intervenors challenge the FCC\u2019s authority to apply its regulatory structure to release CATV operators prospectively from contractual arrangements made before the passage of the Act. Intervenors recognize the issue as one of statutory interpretation, and raise no constitutional argument. <em>See Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. Co. v. Mottley, </em>219 U.S. 467, 31 S.Ct. 265, 55 L.Ed. 297 (1911).</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-9\">The statute itself is all-encompassing in its wording: the FCC is to \u201cregulate the rates, terms, and conditions for pole attachments to provide that such rates, terms, and conditions are just and reasonable,\u201d and is authorized to \u201chear and resolve complaints concerning such rates, terms, and conditions.\u201d Act \u00a7 6 (codified at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 224(b)(1) (Supp. II 1978)). This sweeping language is consistent with the urgings of the Act\u2019s sponsors, who were alarmed by \u201cnumerous abuses of [the utilities\u2019] monopoly power,\u201d 123 Cong.Rec. 35,006 (1977) (remarks of Rep. Wirth), and who encouraged Congress to \u201cact quickly\u201d for the protection of \u201cconsumers now receiving cable television as well as consumers who desire access to this service in the future,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 16,694 (remarks of Rep. Wirth). Intervenors point to no evidence whatever that Congress meant to deny the FCC the disputed power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>Moreover, this view of the legislative intent is supported by the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute. The FCC concluded that it would be \u201cpowerless to act in accordance with its mandate\u201d if it were required to await the expiration of existing contracts before granting relief to CATV lessees. <em>First Report and Order, </em>68 F.C.C.2d 1585, 1591 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">For the reasons stated, we uphold the FCC\u2019s orders. The Commission may proceed \u201cto hear and resolve complaints regarding the arrangements between cable television systems and the owners or controllers of utility poles,\u201d S.Rep.No. 580, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1978), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, 1978, p. 110, including those involving preexisting contracts, using the methods for calculating and apportioning costs that it has prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
