We must decide whether the plaintiffs, a construction company and its surety, may sue the United States for their alleged losses in completing a federally insured housing project. After consideration of the parties\u2019 written and oral submissions, we dismiss these petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-14\">Plaintiff Curtis Johnson (Johnson) is a construction company. Johnson substantially completed a housing project known as the University Gardens project under a construction contract with the owner, the Hoover Interfaith Housing Corporation (Hoover). Johnson brings this action to recover $278,483 (plus attorneys\u2019 fees and costs) supposedly owed it for work done under the contract with Hoover.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-15\">Plaintiff Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (Aetna) provided Johnson with performance and payment bonds to be given Hoover and Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company (Pacific) (Hoover\u2019s lender) to ensure Johnson\u2019s . contract performance. Aetna brings this action as subrogee to recover funds which it paid Johnson\u2019s subcontractors and materialmen when Johnson became unable to make the required payments. Aetna seeks recovery in the amount of $152,350.49 plus interest. This amount represents $118,160.51 paid by Aet-na to subcontractors and materialmen and $34,189.98 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Alternatively, Aetna claims entitlement to an unpaid final progress payment and certain retainages aggregating $150,542 (plus interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-16\">The financing for the University Gardens project was insured by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) pursuant to the National Housing Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the relevant provisions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> HUD insured 100 percent of a secured construction loan (the mortgage) between Hoover (a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>non-profit private corporation created to own the resulting low-income housing) and Pacific (the commercial lender). Separate agreements were executed between these multiple parties, including the construction contract between Johnson and Hoover, the Building Loan Agreement and other financing arrangements between Hoover and Pacific, a mortgage insurance agreement between Pacific and HUD, and a regulatory agreement (detailing property management and like concerns) between HUD and Hoover. As a practical matter, HUD was intimately involved with all details of the project from its inception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">Normally, amortization of section 236 project mortgages begins after the project is occupied. Interest on the construction loan is incorporated into the principal of the section 236 mortgage, and thus, owners undertaking such projects need little, if any, operating capital. Section 236 owners are generally non-profit, private corporations formed to hold formal title to the property. Should default on the mortgage occur, the mortgagee has the option of assigning the mortgage to HUD and receiving reimbursement of all approved advances, plus interest. Other options are also available to the mortgagee, including renegotiation of the loan, foreclosure, or accepting voluntary conveyance of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-9\">Under the construction contract, the contractor receives progress payments as expenses are incurred. Payment requests are submitted to the non-profit owner, who in turn requests corresponding mortgage proceeds. Assuming the loan is in balance, /. e., remaining loan proceeds equal or exceed costs of completion (including those for delivered materials and rendered services), the lender and HUD approve the advance, less a 10 percent retainage. The reduced advance is made to the owner and, ultimately, the contractor. The retainages are payable after the project is complete, state and local occupancy certification occurs, and HUD approves.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-10\">Construction of this project was substantially complete by December 2, 1971. Various local authorities and HUD approved the project for occupancy shortly thereafter. However, at that time the remaining mortgage proceeds were apparently inadequate to cover remaining costs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pacific, with HUD\u2019s approval, therefore withheld disbursement of the final progress payment ($17,162) and the retainages ($133,380) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>pending settlement of the unpaid costs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, although the project was at least partially occupied, Hoover defaulted on the amortization, although the exact date of technical default is unclear from this record. Negotiations followed without result. Johnson filed a mechanic\u2019s lien under California law on the property. Also during this period, Johnson was unable to pay the materialmen and subcontractors. As surety, Aetna paid the subcontractors and materialmen. Pursuant to an arbitration clause in the construction contract, Johnson was awarded $272,358 (plus costs) against Hoover. In early 1973 Hoover sought proceedings under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, formerly 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701 <em>et seq. </em>Hoover was formally declared in default on the mortgage in August 1973, and thereafter, the mortgage was assigned to HUD. HUD ultimately foreclosed the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">Eventually, district court litigation in the Ninth Circuit ensued between Aetna, Johnson, Hoover, Pacific, and HUD. Judgment was entered for Aetna against Johnson totaling $203,958.88. However, the district appeals court determined under <em>Marcus Garvey Square, Inc. v. Winston Burnett Construction Co., </em>595 F.2d 1126 (9th Cir. 1979), that the actions against HUD were in reality against the United States and in excess of the $10,000 Tucker Act limit on such actions in the district courts. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(2) (1976). The reformed actions were transferred to this court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(c) (1976) and consolidated. These cross motions for summary judgment followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">These suits, of course, are proper only insofar as the United States has waived its sovereign immunity and consented to suit. <em>See United States v. Mitchell, </em>445 U.S. 535, 538, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 1352, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980); <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 399, 96 S.Ct. 948, 953, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976); <em>United States v. Sherwood, </em>312 U.S. 584, 586, 61 S.Ct. 767, 769, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941). Waivers of the immunity \u201ccannot be implied, but must be unequivocally expressed.\u201d United <em>States v. King, </em>395 U.S. 1, 4, 89 S.Ct. 1501, 1502, 23 L.Ed.2d 52 (1969); <em>Soriano v. United States, </em>352 U.S. 270, 276, 77 S.Ct. 269, 273, 1 L.Ed.2d 306 (1957). Similarly, any waiver must be strictly construed. <em>See, e. g., Schillinger v. United States, </em>155 U.S. 163, 167-169, 15 S.Ct. 85, 86-87, 39 L.Ed. 108 (1894); <em>Minnesota v. United States, </em>305 U.S. 382, 388-389, 59 S.Ct. 292, 295-296, 83 L.Ed. 235 (1939). Thus, except as Congress has expressly consented, \u201cthere is no jurisdiction in the Court of Claims more than in any other court to entertain suits against the United States.\u201d <em>United States v. Sherwood, supra </em>312 U.S. at 587-588, 61 S.Ct. at 770-771.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-9\">The Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 (1976), is the general Congressional consent to suit in this court. Under the Tucker Act, suit in this court is proper only as to actions \u201cfounded either upon the Constitution or any Act of Congress, or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.\u201d Transfer of this case from the district court does not found jurisdiction here, <em>Berdick v. United States, </em>222 Ct.Cl.-,-, 612 F.2d 533, 536 (1979), and if these claims are not within one of the categories enumerated by the Tucker Act, the petitions must be dismissed. Several theories are advanced to support jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONTRACT</p>\n<p id=\"AbEq\">Plaintiffs <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> begin by conceding that Johnson\u2019s construction contract was with Hoover, not the United States. Nevertheless, plaintiffs argue, the United States has implicitly contracted with Johnson to provide this low-cost housing. Hoover, plaintiffs say, was in reality a \u201ccreature of HUD,\u201d that is, a corporate shell (with grossly inadequate capital) created exclusively to facilitate this project. All parties, plaintiffs continue, were aware HUD was the true source of capital. HUD drafted all relevant documents. HUD approved all mortgage advances. HUD required all work to be of a certain quality. In short, HUD conceived, implemented, and supervised this project in intimate detail to effect the statutory goal of rental housing for the nation\u2019s poor. These facts, the argument goes, require this court to disregard the contracting intermediaries, Hoover and Pacific, and to conclude a contract existed between the United States and Johnson on which plaintiffs can sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">We cannot agree. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are but the most recent in \u00e1 litany of cases<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> where those indirectly associated with a dispensation of the federal largess have sought to recover an assortment of damages from the Government. It is well-settled, however, that where the United States does not make itself a party to the contracts which implement important national policies, no express or implied contracts result between the United States and those who will ultimately perform the work. This doctrine is hardly novel, for its roots date to <em>Jones v. United States, </em>1 Ct.Cl. 383 (1865). It was first clearly enunciated in <em>D. R. Smalley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. United States, </em>178 Ct.Cl. 593, 372 F.2d 505, <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 835, 88 S.Ct. 45, 19 L.Ed.2d 97 (1967), a case involving construction of a federal highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">In <em>D. R. Smalley, </em>we concluded there was no jurisdiction in this court over the plaintiff contractor\u2019s suit against the United States for the plaintiff\u2019s contracts had been with the State of Ohio and not the Federal Government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-9\">* * * The defendant did not sign the contracts with the plaintiff and there were no negotiations or communications whatsoever between them. Consequently, there were no express contracts between them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-10\">The same reasoning applies to plaintiff\u2019s alternative claim that defendant is liable because of implied contracts with plaintiff. The sovereign acts of defendant described above do not impose liability on defendant for the acts and omissions of the State of Ohio on the theory of implied contract. The contracts were between the state and plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-11\">Accordingly, since there was no privity of contract, express or implied, between plaintiff and defendant, the defendant is not liable in contract for the damages claimed by plaintiff. [178 Ct.Cl. at 598, 372 F.2d at 508.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-12\">We have since applied the <em>D. R. Smalley </em>doctrine in a variety of circumstances where Government agencies (including HUD) use other entities to contract for the general welfare, notwithstanding the Government\u2019s intimate involvement with all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>stages of a project. Such intimate involvement, were the United States not acting as sovereign, might require reformation of the contract or a conclusion that a contract should be implied in fact. Nevertheless, the sovereign nature of the acts insulates the United States from liability. For example, in <em>Housing Corp. of America v. United States, </em>199 Ct.Cl. 705, 468 F.2d 922, and <em>Correlated Development Corp. v. United States, </em>214 Ct.Cl. 106, 556 F.2d 515, the plaintiff contractors had contracted with local housing authorities (LHAs) to construct and sell housing projects to the LHAs. Funds for the projects were received from the Federal Government under annual contributions contracts. Although HUD was not a party to the contracts between the LHAs and the plaintiffs, those contracts were subject to approval by HUD officials; the construction contracts referenced the annual contributions contracts between HUD and the LHAs; closing documents were prepared by HUD; HUD approved the plans and specifications, as well as any changes in the contract price; and HUD construction representatives inspected the work as it progressed. The plaintiffs in both cases contended, as do plaintiffs here, that the Government made itself a party to the contracts by its dominant control and supervision of every phase. In <em>Housing Corp. of America, </em>199 Ct.Cl. at 710,468 F.2d at 924, we rejected such claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-5\">The contract here in issue is one of many pursuant to which the Federal Government subsidizes projects of state and local authorities for the public betterment. The United States, however, does not make itself a party to the contracts relating to said projects but obligates itself by separate agreements, as here, to local authorities for the funding of those projects it approves. The significance of that approval is spelled out here in Article IX. This does not create an express or implied contract between plaintiff and defendant nor does it make the Commission defendant\u2019s agent through HUD. HUD\u2019s actions were performed in defendant\u2019s capacity as sovereign. This principle has been settled for some time by a similar case involving construction under the Federal-Aid Highways Act. <em>D. R. Smalley &amp; Sons v. United States, </em>178 Ct.Cl. 593, 372 F.2d 505, <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 835, 88 S.Ct. 45, 19 L.Ed.2d 97 (1967). The <em>Smalley </em>case is squarely in point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A93r\">Relying on <em>Housing Corp. of America, Correlated Development Corp. </em>reached a similar result.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> More recently, in <em>H. A. Ekelin &amp; Assocs. v. United States, </em>650 F.2d 289 (1980), we extended the <em>D. R. Smalley </em>rationale to HUD mortgage insurance provisions similar to those involved here. We concluded in <em>H. A. Ekelin </em>that although HUD was intimately involved in all phases of a housing project under section 231 of the Act (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715v), provision of mortgage insurance including eventual default assignment under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713(g) was a sovereign act within the purview of <em>D. R. Smalley.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1113-8\">We see no reason to reach a different result today as to the mortgage insurance for section 236 projects, and we reaffirm the <em>H. A. Ekelin </em>holding. Therefore, HUD\u2019s acts in insuring this project (including accepting default assignment) do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>create either express or implied contracts between Johnson and defendant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY</p>\n<p id=\"apy-dedup-0\">The plaintiffs next claim entitlement to the undisbursed mortgage proceeds as third-party beneficiaries to the mortgage agreement. Plaintiffs focus on the language in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713(g),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which provides \u201cthe mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance * * * upon assignment, transfer, and delivery to the Secretary * * * of * * * all rights and interests arising under the mortgage so in default * * *.\u201d Plaintiffs contend that as an assignment has occurred, the United States is therefore a \u201cmortgagee\u201d under the definition of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713(a)(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, plaintiffs continue, Congress intended the United States to become liable <em>as a successor mortgagee on </em>the <em>mortgage agreement. </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 argument concludes that the United States can be compelled by either the mortgagor or third-party beneficiaries to the mortgage agreement to pay undis-bursed mortgage proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-9\">The plaintiffs are, we think, wrong. The critical inquiry is the scope of the \u201cassignment, transfer, and delivery\u201d required in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713(g), that is, whether Congress intended the United States to be liable in the same manner a private successor mortgagee would for undisbursed proceeds. That Congress recognized default assignment might occur when mortgage proceeds were undisbursed is beyond doubt, for 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713(g)(4) requires the then mortgagee to deliver to the Secretary \u201cany balance of the mortgage loan not advanced to the mortgagor.\u201d Yet there is no corresponding provision obligating the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>States to pay those undisbursed proceeds to the defaulting mortgagor. Indeed, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713(k)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> suggests a contrary conclusion for that section authorizes the Secretary to exercise only the <em>rights </em>of a mortgagee. Similarly, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713(7)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> mentions only the \u201cpower * * * to pay * * all expenses or charges in connection with * * * any property acquired by [the Secretary] under this section\u201d and the \u201cpower to pursue * * * all claims assigned and transferred to [the Secretary] * * * in connection with the assignment, transfer, and delivery provided for in this section * * *.\u201d The implication, of course, is that although such proceeds are clearly to be given to the Secretary, there is no <em>enforceable legal duty </em>to disburse those proceeds. Plaintiffs\u2019 inventive use of the statutory definition of mortgagee to create such a duty is not supported elsewhere in the statute, for the subsections of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713 detailing post-default rights and consequences refer separately to the mortgagee and the Secretary. <em>See, e. g., </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713(g), (h), (j), (k), and (7). Leaving aside \u00a7 1713(a)(2), we simply find nothing in the statute to support plaintiffs\u2019 contentions that the use of distinct terms should be ignored and an obligation to pay these proceeds found. The better reading of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713(a)(2) is to limit that definition to mortgagees who obtain the mortgage other than through post-default \u201cassignment, transfer, and delivery\u201d under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-8\">Nor does the legislative history support plaintiffs\u2019 contention that Congress intended 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713 as a consent to suit over undisbursed mortgage proceeds. That section was added as section 207 of the National Housing Act by section 3, National Housing Act Amendments of 1938, ch. 13, 52 Stat. 8. Our research of the legislative history of section 3 discloses no intent to obligate the United States to disburse any unpaid mortgage proceeds acquired after default. Indeed, testimony at both the House and Senate Committee Hearings by the Federal Housing Administrator indicated that the purpose' of allowing the mortgage to be assigned (in lieu of the mortgagee acquiring title and then assign<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>ing the underlying property) was merely to place the United States in possession of the property more quickly.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">Thus, notwithstanding the statutory requirement that an \u201cassignment\u201d of the mortgagee\u2019s interest occur, we think it inappropriate to conclude that Congress intended the United States to become bound thereby to disburse any unpaid mortgage proceeds. <em>Cf. United States v. Mitchell, </em>445 U.S. at 541-544, 100 S.Ct. at 1353-1355 (the statutory term \u201ctrust\u201d must be read in conjunction with the remainder of the statute and legislative history to define obligations of the United States). It follows that if the United States is not liable to disburse the mortgage proceeds, plaintiffs have no third-party beneficiary claim, whether founded on California law or otherwise, within our jurisdiction.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">REGULATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">The plaintiffs advance a similar contention regarding the mortgagee's regulatory duty to disburse all mortgage proceeds. In essence, the plaintiffs argue that the United States, as assignee of the mortgage, became a successor mortgagee under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713(a)(2). At the time of the assignment, a mortgagee was required by 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 221.512 (1973)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> to disburse</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ab8-dedup-0\">* * * as a part of the mortgage transaction * * * the principal amount of the mortgage, to, or for the account of the mortgagor or <em>to his creditors </em>for his account and with his consent. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1116-11\">Plaintiffs rely on the emphasized portion, claiming entitlement to the mortgage proceeds as creditors of Hoover. Plaintiffs are wrong for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-12\">As we have already discussed, the Secretary does not under the statute become a successor mortgagee with a duty of disbursement. Plaintiffs\u2019 application of the mortgagee\u2019s regulatory duty to disburse is therefore incorrect. Even were the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>less clear, the regulations themselves negate the conclusion plaintiffs would have us reach. First, the regulations governing section 236 projects contain their own definition of mortgagee in 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 207.251(g):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-5\">(g) The term \u201cmortgagee\u201d means the original lender under a mortgage, its successors and such of its assigns as are approved by the Commissioner, and includes the holders of the credit instruments issued under a trust indenture, mortgage or deed of trust pursuant to which such holders act by and through a trustee therein named.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">That regulation also contains a separate definition for the Secretary\u2019s representative, the Federal Housing Commissioner. See 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 207.251(a). No mention is made of the Commissioner as a mortgagee, and as the Commissioner must approve any successor mortgagee, see also 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 207.261, the implication is that a mortgagee is one other than the Commissioner. Moreover, consistently throughout the regulations, and including the provisions discussing default assignment, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 207.-255 \u2014 207.259, the distinct terms \u201cCommissioner\u201d and \u201cmortgagee\u201d are used in contrast to each other. Given the precise use of these terms, we can hardly infer that the terms \u201cCommissioner\u201d and \u201cmortgagee\u201d become interchangeable, as plaintiffs\u2019 reading requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">Second, those who drafted the regulations establishing the default procedures in 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 207.255 <em>et seq. </em>were aware (as was Congress, <em>supra) </em>that mortgages with undisbursed proceeds might be assigned to the Commissioner. See 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 207.-258(bX4)(i). Had the drafters thought the United States bound as a successor mortgagee to disburse those proceeds, it is surprising they would fail to include either a provision to that effect or a cross reference to the mortgagee\u2019s disbursement duty. Yet there is none.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-8\">In light of these considerations, we conclude that the plaintiffs have no claim founded on the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-9\">MECHANIC\u2019S LIEN</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-10\">The plaintiffs argue that under California law they have a valid mechanic\u2019s lien against the University Gardens property. See Cal.Civ.Code \u00a7 3110 (West 1974). Plaintiffs theorize that as the United States has foreclosed the mortgage and now owns the property, that lien may be enforced against the United States. Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments, however, ignore the long-settled rule that liens such as Johnson claims are not enforceable against the United States or its property. <em>Armstrong v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 40, 46 &amp; n.4, 80 S.Ct. 1563, 1567 &amp; n.4, 4 L.Ed.2d 1554 (1960), and cases cited; <em>J. F. Hodgkins Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>162 Ct.Cl. 40, 43, 318 F.2d 932, 934 (1963). Plaintiffs have thereby overlooked what may be their strongest claim, viz., that because a once-valid lien has been made unenforceable, the United States has taken a property interest so as to require Fifth Amendment compensation. <em>See Armstrong, supra </em>at 44 \u2014 49, 80 S.Ct. at 1566-1569; <em>J. F. Hodgkins, supra </em>at 43, 318 F.2d at 934; <em>J. J. Henry Co. v. United States, </em>188 Ct.Cl. 39, 46, 411 F.2d 1246, 1249 (1969). The relevant inquiries are whether Johnson had an enforceable lien which became unenforceable and if so, whether foreclosure of the mortgage amounts to a Fifth Amendment taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-11\">We need only reach the question of whether Johnson has an enforceable lien under California law. Article VII of the construction contract between Johnson and Hoover provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-12\">The Contractor shall file no mechanic\u2019s or materialman\u2019s lien or maintain any claim against the Owner\u2019s real estate or improvements for or on account of any work done, labor performed or materials furnished under this Contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1117-13\">The provision clearly purports to waive Johnson\u2019s lien rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-14\">Mechanic\u2019s liens in California are entirely creatures of statute. <em>Holm </em>v. <em>Bramwell, </em>20 Cal.App.2d 332, 67 P.2d 114 (1937). California Civil Code \u00a7 3268 (West 1974) allows lien rights to be waived and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>Except where it is otherwise declared, the provisions of the foregoing titles of this part, in respect to the [lien] rights and obligations of parties to contracts, are subordinate to the intention of the parties, when ascertained in the manner prescribed by the chapter on the interpretation of contracts; and the benefit thereof may be waived by any party entitled thereto, unless such waiver would be against public policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">Although our research has disclosed no California authority squarely holding that such clauses in construction agreements are consistent with public policy, we have little doubt the Article VII waiver would be held valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">California statutory law does contain a provision, Cal.Civ.Code \u00a7 3262 (West 1974), which generally invalidates construction contract provisions which purport to waive the lien rights of those not party to the agreement. The implication, of course, is that a contractor may, consistent with public policy, agree to waive his own lien rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">Other jurisdictions have considered whether a construction contract clause waiving subsequent lien rights is valid. The majority rule appears to be that such clauses are effective, <em>see, e. g., J. B. Gieri Construction Co. v. Gramercy Construction Corp., </em>13 A.D.2d 901, 215 N.Y.S.2d 994 (App.Div.1961); <em>Bendik v. Uniontown S. R. Co., </em>408 Pa. 66, 182 A.2d 512 (1962); <em>Hammond Hotel &amp; Improvement Co. v. Williams, </em>95 Ind.App. 506, 176 N.E. 154, <em>rehearing denied, </em>95 Ind.App. 506, 178 N.E. 177 (1931); <em>Mitchell v. Wrightstown Community Apartments, Inc., </em>4 N.J.Super. 321, 67 A.2d 203 (App.Div.1949); <em>Capitol Plumbing and Heating Supply Co. v. Snyder, </em>104 Ill. App.2d 431, 244 N.E.2d 856 (1969), and are therefore presumably consistent with public policy. This is so even though the owner has failed to pay all sums owed under the construction agreement for the waiver of the lien is merely a waiver of a particular remedy and not a release of the underlying obligation. <em>J. B. Cieri Construction, supra; Formigli Corp. v. Fox, </em>348 F.Supp. 629 (E.D.Pa.1972) (Pennsylvania law); <em>Mitchell, supra; Hammond Hotel, supra; Capitol Plumbing, supra; cf. </em>Cal.Civ.Code \u00a7 3152 (West 1974) (allowing in personam recovery on a debt notwithstanding any provision relating to liens).</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-8\">The California courts have often enforced similar promises against laborers and suppliers when the promises were required by a surety as a pre-condition to employment or purchase. <em>See, e. g., Giant Powder Co. Consolidated v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. of Maryland, </em>214 Cal. 639, 7 P.2d 1023 (1932); <em>Fraters Glass &amp; Paint Co. v. Southwest Construction Co., </em>200 Cal. 688, 254 P. 1097 (1927); <em>W. R. Spalding Lumber Co. v. Fradkin, </em>68 Cal.App.2d 308, 156 P.2d 450 (1945); <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>National Surety Co., </em>111 Cal. App. 306, 295 P. 359 (1931). We see little reason to distinguish between a waiver required by a surety and one required by the owner, especially in light of <em>Martin v. Becker, </em>169 Cal. 301, 312, 146 P. 665, 670 (1915):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8k\">So far as this examination of authorities has proceeded, we find that the actions are between the contractor and the owner of the property upon which the work was done, to enforce the lien upon that property, and we find that the adjudications are merely to the effect that the courts will consider each of these contracts according to its facts, and that when the contract between the parties is such as to force the conclusion that the intent of the parties was to waive the mechanic\u2019s lien, * * * it is held that these contracts are inconsistent with the conception of a right to a mechanic\u2019s lien. * * * The decision in each case is based upon findings that the nature of the contract under which the security is taken forces the conclusion that there was a waiver of the right to the lien: Of these cases no criticism may be made, and with them no fault may be found.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1118-9\">We therefore hold that Article VII of the construction contract waived Johnson\u2019s right to lien under California law. It follows Johnson had no property interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>which could be taken.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Plaintiffs have no claim within our jurisdiction founded on the mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">OTHER ENTITLEMENT THEORIES</p>\n<p id=\"AoN\">The plaintiffs allege a variety of other jurisdictional theories. All are without merit. Plaintiffs assert 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713(1), <em>supra </em>note 14, authorizes suit in this court. That subsection provides in relevant part that \u201cthe Secretary shall also have power * * * to pay * * * all expenses or charges in connection with * * * and to deal with [and] complete * * * any property acquired by him under this section * Under the plaintiffs\u2019 theory, this provision obligates the United States to repay all costs of a contractor if the United States subsequently acquires the property. Subsection 1713(7) does indeed allow the Secretary to complete a project, but nothing in that subsection mandates completion occur or that any other expense be paid. It follows that plaintiffs have no right to compel completion or payment and therefore can have no claim based on this provision. <em>See Marcus Garvey Square, </em>595 F.2d at 1130. Moreover, that portion of \u00a7 1713(7) is apparently directed to the situation where the Secretary is assigned an incomplete project and then completes it. <em>Id.; </em>see 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713(g) (language after \u201cProvided\u201d). Here Johnson completed the project <em>prior </em>to the Secretary\u2019s acquisition of the property. In any event, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713(7) does not provide plaintiffs a claim.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">The plaintiffs further allege jurisdiction founded on a theory of unjust enrichment/equitable lien, while their petitions also suggest theories of fraudulent misrepresentation and inducement. Whatever else may be said of the fraudulent inducement and misrepresentation allegations,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-8\">[t]he decision of the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Neustadt, </em>366 U.S. 696, 81 S.Ct. 1294, 6 L.Ed.2d 614 (1961), removes any doubt that claims based on negligent misrepresentation, wrongful inducement, or the careless performance of a duty allegedly owed, are claims sounding in tort. * * * <em>[Somali Development Bank v. United States, </em>205 Ct.Cl. 741, 749, 508 F.2d 817, 821 (1974).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1119-9\">Tort claims, of course, are expressly beyond our Tucker Act jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-10\">The claim based on unjust enrichment/equitable lien is also beyond our jurisdiction. Those doctrines, however, are based not on agreement but are equitable in nature. Both proceed from a perception that a party <em>ought </em>to be bound rather than from a conclusion that a party has <em>agreed </em>to be bound. <em>See Cleveland Chair Co. v. United States, </em>214 Ct.Cl. 360, 364, 557 F.2d 244, 246 (1977); <em>J. C. Pitman &amp; Sons, Inc. v. United States, </em>161 Ct.Cl. 701, 704-705, 317 F.2d 366, 368 (1963). Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment/equitable lien theory of recovery is therefore based upon a contract implied in law, over which this court has not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>given jurisdiction. <em>E. g., Merritt v. United States, </em>267 U.S. 338, 341, 45 S.Ct. 278, 279, 69 L.Ed. 643 (1925); <em>Algonac Manufacturing Co. v. United States, </em>192 Ct.Cl. 649, 674, 428 F.2d 1241, 1255-1256 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 citation of <em>Trans-Bay Engineers &amp; Builders, Inc. v. Hills, </em>551 F.2d 370, and related cases <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> does not alter our conclusion that we lack jurisdiction of a claim for unjust enrichment/equitable lien. In those cases, suit was brought against the Secretary of HUD using the limited waiver of sovereign immunity provided by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702. <em>Jurisdiction </em>of the resulting suits was found under various statutes applicable only to district court litigation, as for example 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1332 or 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702 itself. As the <em>Trans-Bay Engineers </em>opinion demonstrates, <em>supra </em>at 378-382, once jurisdiction is proper, the federal district and circuit courts may apply a variety of substantive theories, including those based solely on equitable considerations. Our inquiry here is different for we seek to determine whether these claims are within our narrow jurisdictional statute. As a claim founded solely on equitable considerations is beyond that statute, we are unable to entertain such a suit. Thus, regardless of the <em>substantive </em>application of equitable concerns in <em>Trans-Bay Engineers </em>and related cases to allow recovery, we must nevertheless conclude that there is no jurisdiction in this court over petitions stating such claims. See also note 16 <em>supra. </em>We have fully considered all of plaintiffs\u2019 other arguments, and these petitions must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-8\">Johnson and Aetna\u2019s position is not without substantial equity. They have, at their own expense, completed a housing project which is now owned by the United States. The United States obtained that project by accepting assignment of and eventually foreclosing a mortgage which, in part at the United States\u2019 behest, was never fully disbursed. Under the Tucker Act, as presently drawn, these plaintiffs have no suit cognizable in this court. Litigation with HUD concerning the mortgage insurance provisions arises not infrequently and if held to be in reality against the United States, <em>compare Marcus Garvey Square, supra, with Trans-Bay Engineers, supra, </em>must be brought here.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We invite Congress\u2019 attention to litigants in the position of these plaintiffs. Until the Tucker Act is changed, however, we have no jurisdiction over the claims presented in these petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-10\">For the reasons discussed above, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction over the claims stated in these petitions. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s cross motions for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>judgment against Johnson in 455-79C and Aetna in 454-79C are hereby granted. Johnson\u2019s and Aetna\u2019s respective summary judgment motions are hereby denied. The petitions are hereby dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1109-12\">. The statutory framework, presently codified at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1701 et <em>seq. </em>(1976), was first enacted in 1934 as the National Housing Act, ch. 847, 48 Stat. 1246 (1934). For simplicity\u2019s sake, we refer hereafter to the statutory framework as if it were contained in a single act of Congress. Subsequent references to the United States Code indicate, except as noted, the 1970 version.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1109-13\">. The particular provisions under which this project was built, section 236 of the Act (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-l), were first added by Title II, section 201(a), of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, Pub.L. 90-448, 82 Stat. 476 (1968). Section 236. was added to make rental housing more available to low income families. The section 236 aspects of this project are not directly in issue here. Rather, this litigation is concerned with the rights of the builder and its surety against the United States. Although this controversy focuses on the consequences of default assignment under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713(g) (made applicable to section 236 projects by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-3(a)(2)), similar concerns arise in a variety of HUD housing programs. <em>E. g..

Subparagraphs 4(b) and (e) of the Building Loan Agreement provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-6\">\u201c(b) Upon completion of the improvements, including all landscape requirements and off-site utilities and streets, the Borrower shall furnish to the Lender and the Commissioner satisfactory evidence that all work requiring inspection by municipal or other governmental authorities having jurisdiction has been duly inspected and approved by such authorities and by the rating or inspection organization, bureau, association or office having jurisdiction: and that all requisite certificates of occupancy and other approvals have been issued. The balance due the Borrower hereunder shall be payable at such time after completion as the commissioner authorizes the release of the holdback. However, the Lender may withhold final payment until after the expiration of any period which mechanics and materialmen may have for filing liens.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-7\">\u201c(e) The Borrower agrees that the loan shall at all times remain in balance. The Lender shall, in accordance with the provisions of this agreement, continue to advance to the Borrower funds out of the proceeds of the loan as long as the loan remains in balance and the Borrower is not in default hereunder or under the Note or Mortgage. The loan shall be deemed to be in balance only when the undistributed proceeds of the loan (after provision for reserves, fees, expenses and other deposits required by the Lender or the Commissioner) equal or exceed the amount necessary (based on the Commissioner\u2019s estimate of the cost of construction) to pay for all work completed and all materials delivered, for which payment has not been made, and the cost of completing construction of the project in accordance with the Drawings and Specifications.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1110-12\">. Remaining loan proceeds were apparently $156,652.18. Johnson\u2019s remaining costs are not clear from the record. One affidavit suggests remaining costs were approximately $215,268. The arbitration award of $272,358 (exclusive of costs) suggests the remaining costs were somewhat higher. The plaintiffs appear to concede the loan was in fact out of balance but argue the imbalance was a technicality and should have been disregarded and the loan amount increased.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">. These sums aggregate $150,542. The difference between this sum and the remaining loan proceeds <em>(supra </em>note 4) is apparently attributable to other construction period costs of Hoover. Under our holding, we need not decide whether the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery should be limited to the lesser amount; and we assume <em>ar-guendo </em>that plaintiffs are the only creditors of Hoover. Thus, textual references to the undis-bursed mortgage or loan proceeds indicate the entire $156,652.18, which was committed by Pacific but never paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-13\">No disbursement of either the final progress payment or retainages has ever occurred as the loan has allegedly been out of balance or in default since December 2, 1971. See note 3, <em>supra; </em>note 16, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">. To a large extent, there is an identity of interest between these plaintiffs. Aetna\u2019s rights against the United States (if any) are derived from Johnson through subrogation. Moreover, as the plaintiffs conceded at oral argument, Aetna\u2019s position as judgment creditor of Johnson has the practical effect of making a judgment for Johnson in reality one for Aetna, at least to the extent of $203,958.88. As we dismiss both petitions, we need not apportion recovery between these plaintiffs, nor need we distinguish between the arguments each makes. We therefore refer to Johnson and Aetna simply as the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1112-13\">.

The major difference between the cases was plaintiffs assertion in <em>Correlated Development Corp. </em>that section 13 of the annual contributions contract between HUD and the LHAs allowed the plaintiff contractor a direct action against the United States. The issue had not been raised in <em>Housing Corp. of America. </em>The majority opinion in <em>Correlated Development Corp. </em>held section 13 inapplicable as the changes ordered by LHA were not among the listed contingencies invoking the section. The concurring opinion suggested the changes ordered by LHA were seemingly within a broad reading of section 13 but that other considerations required a more circumspect reading, precluding suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1113-10\">. <em>H. A. Ekelin </em>also rejected the contractor\u2019s contention that it could, as an alleged third-party beneficiary, enforce the Building Loan Agreement. That contention, however, was rejected on the ground that the lender had completely disbursed the mortgage proceeds. Thus, <em>H. A.

The presence of undisbursed mortgage proceeds does not in itself alter our conclusion that these were sovereign acts, especially in light of the explicit recognition in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713(g)(4) that all undisbursed proceeds must be forwarded to HUD as a part of assignment. See also notes 11-16 and accompanying text, <em>infra. </em>Accepting assignment of a mortgage with undisbursed proceeds on these facts is no less a sovereign act than accepting assignment of a mortgage without such proceeds, although the <em>equities of </em>a plaintiffs claim may be thereby increased. Of course, our conclusion that no contract results between the sovereign and these plaintiffs does not necessarily preclude plaintiffs from proceeding on other theories to recover the loan proceeds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713(g) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-7\">\u201c(g) The failure of the mortgagor to make any payment due under or provided to be paid by the terms of a mortgage insured under this section shall be considered a default under such mortgage and, if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon assignment, transfer, and delivery to the Secretary, within a period and in accordance with rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of (1) all rights and interests arising under the mortgage so in default; (2) all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transactions; (3) all policies of title or other insurance or surety bonds or other guaranties and any and all claims thereunder; (4) any balance of the mortgage loan not advanced to the mortgagor; (5) any cash or property held by the mortgagee, or to which it is entitled, as deposits made for the account of the mortgagor and which have not been applied in reduction of the principal of the mortgage indebtedness; and (6) all records, documents, books, papers, and accounts relating to the mortgage transaction.

J., </em>328 F.Supp. 208 (D.N.J.1971), have assumed or concluded that the Secretary can be compelled to disburse unpaid mortgage proceeds by those claiming as third-party beneficiaries to the Building Loan Agreement. The differing result</p>\n<p id=\"au5-dedup-0\">may be explained in part in that none of those cases were concerned with this issue as a jurisdictional matter, <em>i. e., </em>jurisdiction <em>over the Secretary </em>was present under statutes other than the Tucker Act. Those cases, instead, used the statute and the various agreements to define substantive rights of parties properly before those courts. We, of course, must approach the jurisdictional issue with more constraint and therefore decline to follow the reasoning of those cases. See also discussion <em>infra </em>at page 1059.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1116-14\">. Subsequent references to the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) also indicate the 1973 edition, except as noted. The plaintiffs cite 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 207.3(b) as the source of the mortgagee\u2019s duty to completely disburse. The regulations governing section 236 projects are contained in Part 236 of C.F.R. Title 24, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 236.1 <em>et seq. </em>Subpart A covers eligibility requirements and by cross reference in 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 236.1 incorporates (with listed exceptions) 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 221.502-221.749. Subpart B covers contract rights and obligations for mortgage insurance and by cross reference in 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 236.251 incorporates (with listed exceptions) 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 207.251-207.499. Thus, it would appear 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 221.512, not 24 .C.F.R. \u00a7 207.3(b), requires the disbursement of all mortgage proceeds insured under section 236 of the Act. Similarly, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 207.251 provides applicable definitions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">. <em>Compare </em>this holding <em>with J. F. Hodgkins, </em>162 Ct.Cl. at 44, 318 F.2d at 935-936. The <em>J. F. Hodgkins </em>liens attached, under Maine law, when the materials were furnished. Even though such liens had a short duration under Maine law (and would have been unenforceable at the time the <em>J. F. Hodgkins </em>suit was brought), a property interest existed <em>when the Government took possession of the boats </em>upon the prime contractor\u2019s default. Thus, notwithstanding the fact the liens shortly after the taking would have been otherwise unenforceable under Maine law, the critical inquiry is whether the liens were enforceable at the time of taking. <em>See Armstrong, </em>364 U.S. at 41-42, 44, 46, 80 S.Ct. at 1564-1565, 1566, 1567. Here, of course, no such enforceable liens were present when the Government came into possession of the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1119-11\">. Plaintiffs raise two other statutory entitlement arguments, based on 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715r and 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Neither has merit. The former section requires a builder to provide a cost certification. Plaintiffs read the section to implicitly mandate compensation when the Secretary unreasonably rejects a cost certification. The statute does not so provide and thus will not support jurisdiction here. E. <em>g., Tes-tan, </em>424 U.S. at 400, 96 S.Ct. at 954. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument as to 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 has even less merit for that provision merely validates arbitration agreements. It in no sense makes the United States liable for the arbitration award against Hoover as the United States was never a party to that agreement. See notes 7-10 and accompanying text, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">. <em>E. g., F. W. Eversley &amp; Co. v. East N. Y.

A separate opinion asserts that this record is somehow unclear as to whether the Federal Housing Commissioner required Pacific to actually transfer the undisbursed proceeds to HUD. See 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 207.258(b)(4). If that was done, the separate opinion theorizes, the district court may have incorrectly concluded these facts were controlled by Judge Tang\u2019s majority opinion in <em>Marcus Garvey Square. </em>Thus, the separate opinion herein concludes, we should retransfer this case to the district court to \u201creconsider\u201d its understanding and application of the law of the circuit. The record before us discloses, however, that although the original loan amount was $1,746,800, Pacific only claimed benefits for the funds actually disbursed (and not repaid), $1,588,587.53. Had Pacific actually transferred both the undis-bursed <em>and </em>the disbursed portions of the loan, the statute would have entitled Pacific to claim the full amount of the original loan commitment. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713(g) (second sentence). Thus, under the discretion given the Commissioner by 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 207.258(b)(4), an assignment of only the <em>disbursed </em>portion of the loan occurred. The undisbursed proceeds were retained by the mortgagee and never paid to HUD. Those, as the separate opinion indicates, were precisely the facts of <em>Marcus Garvey Square. </em>See 595 F.2d at 1131 &amp; n.3, 1132 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-12\">Whether the undisbursed funds were ever delivered to HUD is, of course, a separate question from whether HUD can be compelled, solely by virtue of its alleged status as successor mortgagee, to pay a like amount in damages to these plaintiffs. The latter proposition is discussed <em>supra </em>at notes 11-16 and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1121-4\">DAVIS, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AA9\">concurring in the result in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">Though I do not join the court\u2019s opinion, I agree with its conclusion that plaintiffs have not shown themselves entitled to monetary relief from the general funds of the Treasury which are necessarily involved in any suit here under the Tucker Act \u2014 and I accept much of the opinion\u2019s reasoning to that effect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">But (as the majority says) \u201cJohnson and Aetna\u2019s position is not without substantial equity,\u201d and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) may be liable to them out of the contract retainages, unpaid progress payments, and other separate funds still in the possession and control of that agency. This suit was originally brought in the District Court against HUD (and private entities). Under the statute, the Secretary of HUD is expressly \u201cauthorized, in his official capacity, to sue and be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702 (1976) (part of the National Housing Act). This is a broad consent-to-suit, <em>F. H. A. v. Burr, </em>309 U.S. 242, 245, 60 S.Ct. 488, 490, 84 L.Ed. 724 (1940); <em>United Electric Corp. v. United States, </em>647 F.2d 1082 at 1083, 1084 (1981), which reaches at least the funds in the possession and control of HUD. <em>F. H. A. v. Burr, supra, </em>309 U.S. at 250, 60 S.Ct. at 492; <em>Marcus Garvey Square, Inc. v. Winston Burnett Const. Co., </em>595 F.2d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir. 1979); <em>Trans-Bay Eng\u2019rs &amp; Builders, Inc. v. Hills, </em>551 F.2d 370, 382-83 (D.C.Cir.1976). As the majority recognizes, in a suit against HUD under this general waiver of immunity the tribunal is authorized to apply principles of non-consensual equitable restitution, of tort law, and of contracts implied-in-law \u2014 all of which are excluded from this court\u2019s jurisdiction under the Tucker Act. <em>See United Electric Corp. v. United States, supra, </em>at 1084-1085; <em>Trans-Bay Engineers, supra, </em>351 F.2d at 380-83. If plaintiffs prove their case, they might well be able to recover from HUD at least the unpaid progress payments and re-tainages, and perhaps more. <em>See Trans-Bay Engineers, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-10\">The District Court in California apparently thought that it had no jurisdiction against HUD under the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Marcus Garvey Square, supra. </em>But that case may well be significantly different on the very point of whether HUD had separate funds of its own from which recovery could be allowed. There, the Secretary of HUD did <em>not </em>take assignment of the undisbursed amounts but specifically directed that the principal of the mortgage be reduced by the undisbursed funds. <em>See Marcus Garvey Square, supra, </em>595 F.2d at 1131. That fact \u2014 that in those circumstances the undisbursed funds no longer constituted separate HUD funds\u2014 was the direct foundation for the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding that that suit could not be maintained against HUD. <em>Ibid. </em>Here, on the other hand, the undisbursed funds (so far as we really know) may well have been assigned to HUD along with the rest of the Building Loan Agreement, the mortgage, all the other credit instruments and the related documents. The record is not at all clear. In my view, therefore, <em>Marcus Garvey Square </em>does not necessarily exclude the District Court from jurisdiction over this case, and the District Court is in a better position to determine the true facts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number><em>Trans-Bay Engineers, supra, </em>the District of Columbia Circuit (per Leventhal J.) assumed jurisdiction and conditionally granted relief against HUD in a case not far from this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">Accordingly, I would retransfer this case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1506 (1976) back to the District Court in the hope that that court will reconsider its jurisdiction against HUD under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702. <em>See Peoples Apparel, Ltd. v. United States and City of Council Bluffs, Iowa, </em>650 F.2d 291 (1980), <em>Nathan Smith v. United States, </em>654 F.2d 50, decided this day.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">. The court correctly holds that Article VII of the construction contract bars the contractor\u2019s claim of a mechanic\u2019s lien for which just compensation might have to be paid. Johnson\u2019s petition makes various claims that he was improperly induced (by others than the Government) to agree to this provision, but I think it clear from his own allegations that he knew that he was agreeing to this clause (and its meaning) even though he may have thought that he would not in the end be monetarily injured by its inclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1121-12\">. In <em>Marcus Garvey Square </em>the Ninth Circuit said: \u201cIf it should appear that the Secretary\u2019s reduction of the principal obligation, either by a general rule of policy or by action in a particular case, was done solely for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>depriving the District Court of jurisdiction, then that action would be ignored for the purpose of determining jurisdiction.\u201d 595 F.2d at 1132, n.3. In the present case we have no knowledge at all why Pacific claimed benefits for less than the original loan amount, and very little information on what funds were actually assigned to HUD.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
