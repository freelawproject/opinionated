After finding Washington guilty, the jury returned a sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-6\">Washington\u2019s conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. <em>Washington v. State, </em>361 So.2d 61 (Miss.1978) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 916, 99 S.Ct. 2016, 60 L.Ed.2d 388 (1979). After the Mississippi Supreme Court rejected additional arguments that Washington raised through a coram nobis petition, he petitioned the court below for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (1976). After holding an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied habeas relief in an unpublished opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-7\">On appeal, Washington asserts a number of grounds for habeas relief; we reach only two. For the reasons set forth below in part II of this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the district court insofar as it held that Washington received effective assistance of counsel at his trial. For .the reasons set forth below in part III of this opinion, however, we reverse the judgment of the district court insofar as it held that the sentencing phase of Washington\u2019s trial comported with the Constitution despite jury instructions that limited sharply the mitigating circumstances which the jury could consider in determining whether Washington should be sentenced to death. Accordingly, we remand the case to the district court with instructions to enter judgment granting appropriate habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-8\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND LEADING TO THIS APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-9\">Washington\u2019s trial was neither lengthy nor especially complicated. The Mississippi Supreme Court\u2019s opinion from Washington\u2019s direct appeal accurately summarizes the evidence presented at the trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1409-10\">Woods Quick Pick, a Columbus, Mississippi, convenience store, was robbed on the night of March 26, 1977, by two men armed with shotguns and wearing stocking masks. During the robbery, one of the bandits, later identified as Johnny Lewis Washington, at close range shot J.K. [Karl] Woods, the proprietor of the store, in the stomach with a long-barrel shotgun loaded with buckshot. Woods died about five hours later in a Columbus hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1409-11\">Booker T. Cole, Jr. testified that between 7:30 and 8:00 P.M. on March 26, 1977, Johnny Washington contacted him and told him to come by his house because \u201che had something up.\u201d Some time \u2022later, when Cole arrived at Washington\u2019s house, the defendant told Cole that they were going to rob [the] Quick Pick. Washington provided Cole with a stocking mask and a sawed-off shotgun, and they took up their station across the street from Woods Quick Pick. After assembling and loading their shotguns, when the coast was clear they ran across the street and into Woods Quick Pick store. J.K. Woods, owner of the store, Roy Thompson, an employee, and a female employee, Elouise Clark, were in the store. [Thompson testified that Woods had been drinking prior to the robbery, and was somewhat intoxicated at the time.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1409-12\">Cole and Washington pointed their shotguns at Woods and Thompson, and told them to open the cash registers and \u201cgive us the money.\u201d Thompson began to put. the money from the first cash register into a brown paper sack. Cole, the smaller and younger of the two robbers, found a bank sack of money in a cabinet drawer, and he fled with that sack.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1409-13\">Washington, in the meantime, ordered Woods to put the money from the second cash register into the same paper sack that Thompson had put the money from the first cash register. Woods misunderstood and reached for another paper sack, whereupon, according to the testimony of Thompson, Washington hit Woods over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>the head with the gun barrel \u201cjust as hard as he could.\u201d In falling, Woods knocked Thompson\u2019s sack of money off on the floor. Washington told Thompson not to move and placed the shotgun about 8 inches from Thompson\u2019s head. Woods went ahead and picked up the sack and sacked the money from the second cash register.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1410-4\">As Woods handed Washington the sack in one hand, he reached for the gun barrel with the other, but missed, and Washington kept the gun on Woods as he, Washington, backed toward the door. Woods moved slowly toward Washington. Just before he left, Washington fired his shotgun into Woods\u2019 stomach. Washington reloaded his shotgun and left. Thompson testified that Washington and Woods were about 10 feet apart when Washington fired, and that Washington could very easily have made his exit with his sack of money without shooting Woods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1410-5\">Cole testified that he was a short distance away when he heard the shot, and Washington came running out of the store telling Cole that he had shot Woods. Cole testified that later that night, about 12:30 or 1:00 A.M., they got together and divided the money (about $600) between them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1410-6\">Washington\u2019s defense was that he was at a party [at his brother Freddie\u2019s apartment], was not at Woods Quick Pick, did not commit the robbery, nor did he kill Woods. [While several of the defense witnesses corroborated Washington\u2019s alibi,] [s]everal people at the party testified that Washington did not arrive there until around midnight ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1410-7\">Ben Hodo of Ethelsville, Alabama, was visiting his grandmother in Columbus, Mississippi, on the night of the robbery. He testified that around 10:00 P.M., as he was going down to Lee\u2019s Restaurant to get something to eat, he saw a man in an alley next to Woods Quick Pick with a long gun and a sack full of money. Hodo testified that he and the man with the long gun looked at each other about 10 seconds and that they were close together. He positively identified Washington as the one he saw in the alley with the sack of money and the long gun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1410-9\">361 So.2d at 63-64. Another prosecution witness, Curtis Cobb, testified that he had seen Washington and Cole retrieve a shotgun and a money bag from some bushes later that night. Through police officers and other investigators, the State also presented some physical evidence that tended circumstantially to link Washington with the crime. The State also presented medical evidence as to the cause and manner of Woods\u2019 death. \u201cAfter a full trial (the Record on the guilt phase consisting of 308 pages in two volumes), the jury returned a verdict of guilty of capital murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-10\">In the separate sentencing hearing, both sides presented evidence as to mitigating and aggravating circumstances, to be considered in addition to the evidence adduced at trial. As additional evidence of aggravating circumstances, the State again called Thompson to the stand to testify as to the pointlessness of the shooting given that Washington could have made good his escape without firing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1410-11\">In mitigation, Washington testified that he was 23 years old, that, while he had been living with a lady for about five years, he was not married but had a three-year-old daughter by her. When asked by his counsel whether he had ever been convicted of a crime, Washington replied that he had been convicted of a \u201cmarijuana crime that same year\u201d for which he had paid a $400 fine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1410-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 64. After receiving the trial court\u2019s charge for the sentencing phase of the trial, the jury returned the death sentence, finding (1) that Washington had committed the crime of capital murder while engaged in the commission of the crime of robbery, a statutory aggravating circumstance under Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 99-19-101(5Xd) (1980 Supp.); (2) that Washington committed the capital murder \u201cin an especially heinous, atrocious or cruel manner,\u201d a statutory aggravating circumstance under Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 99-19-101(5Xh) (1980 Supp.); (3) that these two aggravating factors warranted the imposition of the death penalty; and (4) that there were insufficient mitigat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>ing circumstances to outweigh the aggravating circumstances. Accordingly, the trial court sentenced Washington to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-5\">As noted above, the Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed Washington\u2019s conviction and sentence, rejecting Washington\u2019s arguments that the \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel\u201d language of section 99-19-101(5)(h) was unconstitutionally vague and that the death penalty is unconstitutional per se. 361 So.2d at 65-66. The court also determined that the evidence in the case supported the jury\u2019s imposition of the death penalty, and that this death sentence was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, characterizing the killing of Woods as \u201can especially wanton, willful, useless and cruel killing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66-67. Finally, the court rejected Washington\u2019s contention that his sentence was imposed in violation of <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) . 361 So.2d at 67-68.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari, 441 U.S. 916, 99 S.Ct. 2016, 60 L.Ed.2d 388 (1979) .</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-8\">Washington then sought federal habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (1976). The court below granted a stay of execution pending Washington\u2019s exhaustion of his state remedies as to certain claims that he had not made in his direct appeal. On the same day \u2014 May 25, 1979 \u2014 the Mississippi Supreme Court summarily denied Washington\u2019s request for leave to file a petition for writ of error coram nobis in the state trial court in which Washington was convicted; thus, no hearing was ever held in the state courts on Washington\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The State does not contend on appeal that Washington has failed to exhaust his state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-12\">On recommendation of the United States Magistrate to whom the court below referred the case, the district court held a hearing on November 9,1979, limited solely to Washington\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. After due consideration, the court concluded in an unpublished memo-' randum opinion that Washington had not been denied effective assistance of counsel. The court also rejected Washington\u2019s other asserted grounds for habeas corpus relief with respect to his death sentence. Accordingly, the district court entered judgment denying in its entirety Washington\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus on December 18, 1979. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-13\">II. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF WASHINGTON\u2019S COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-14\">\n<em>A. The Standard by Which We Review a Federal District Court\u2019s Determination on an Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-15\">Every ineffective assistance claim must, at bottom, be founded on allegations of \u201cwhat are termed basic, primary, or historical facts: facts \u2018in the sense of a recital of external events and the credibility of their narrators ...,\u2019\u201d <em>Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 309 n.6, 83 S.Ct. 745, 755 n.6, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963) (quoting <em>Brown v. Allen, </em>344 U.S. 443, 506, 73 S.Ct. 397, 446, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>But every ineffective assistance claim also requires the application of principles of federal law to the \u201cbasic, primary, or historical\u201d facts of the case. In <em>Walker v. Caldwell, </em>476 F.2d 213, 216 (5th Cir. 1973), a panel of this court noted that \u201cthere is a legal standard, by definition normative and prescriptive, which must be applied to a particular set of facts in order to determine whether an accused received effective assistance of counsel.\u201d Accordingly, <em>Walker </em>held that \u201c[t]he precise issue of whether a particular defendant enjoyed \u2018effective\u2019 assistance of counsel, is, in the end, ... a question of <em>law.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis in original). The <em>Walker </em>court determined that even if it accepted the somewhat questionable findings of basic, historical facts made in that case by the federal district court after an evidentiary hearing, the court below had erred in its ultimate conclusion that the defendant had enjoyed effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-4\">When a federal district court conducts an evidentiary hearing in connection with an ineffective assistance claim, it ordinarily does so in order that it may determine disputed issues of basic, historical fact, which frequently hinge on credibility choices. Both before and after the <em>Walker </em>decision, this court has reviewed the district courts\u2019 findings on such issues of basic, historical fact under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard mandated by Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1412-9\">By comparison, a long line of Fifth Circuit cases have held, consistently with <em>Walker, </em>that whether a defendant has received effective assistance of counsel is a \u201cmixed question of fact and law,\u201d rather than purely a question of fact.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>E. g., Harris v. Oliver, </em>645 F.2d 327, 330 n.3 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Norris v. Wainwright, </em>588 F.2d 130, 134-35 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 846, 100 S.Ct. 93, 62 L.Ed.2d 60 (1979); <em>United States v. Gray, </em>565 F.2d 881, 887 &amp; n.18 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 955, 98 S.Ct. 1587, 55 L.Ed.2d 807 (1978); <em>Trahan v. Estelle, </em>544 F.2d 1305, 1314 (5th Cir. 1977) (Goldberg, J., specially concurring); <em>Mason v. Balcom, </em>531 F.2d 717, 721-23 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>Lee v. Hopper, </em>499 F.2d 456,462 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1053, 95 S.Ct. 633, 42 L.Ed.2d 650 (1974).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mixed questions of fact and law are not, as a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>matter, reviewable under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>E. g., Baker v. Metcalfe, </em>633 F.2d 1198, 1201 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 101 S.Ct. 2055, 68 L.Ed.2d 354 (1981) (reviewing district court\u2019s determination on state prisoner\u2019s double jeopardy claim brought through federal habeas corpus); 9 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2589, at 753 (1971). Rather, as to the legal effect to be accorded the district court\u2019s findings of basic, historical fact, the court of appeals is free to substitute its own judgment for that of the district court. <em>Baker, </em>633 F.2d at 1201.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1413-7\">At least four recent Fifth Circuit cases, however, suggest that whether a defendant has received effective assistance of counsel is a purely factual question that is entitled to protection under the clearly erroneous standard of Rule 52(a). <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>635 F.2d 449, 451, 453 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Pollinzi v. Estelle, </em>628 F.2d 417, 418 (5th Cir. 1980) (per curiam); <em>Brown v. Blackburn, </em>625 F.2d 35, 36 (5th Cir. 1980) (per curiam); <em>Jones v. Wainwright, </em>604 F.2d 414, 416-18 (5th Cir. 1979) (per cu-riam). None of these cases cites <em>Walker </em>or the other Fifth Circuit cases that have held that effective assistance is a mixed question of fact and law; rather, <em>United States v. Hughes, Pollinzi v. Estelle, Brown v. Blackburn, </em>and <em>Jones v. Wainwright </em>each relies solely on ineffective assistance cases<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in which we have applied the clearly erroneous standard only to subsidiary questions of basic, historical <em>fact </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>to facts \u201cin the sense of a recital of external events and the credibility of their narrators.\u201d Given the absence of supporting precedent for these four cases, and the presence of a long line of contrary Fifth Circuit precedent, the validity of these four cases must be questioned insofar as they hold<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that a district court\u2019s finding on the ultimate question of whether a defendant received effective assistance of counsel is subject to review under the clearly erroneous standard.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>Faced with this possible conflict, we follow the longer established and more extensive line of precedent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that whether a defendant has enjoyed effective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of fact and law. While subsidiary findings of basic, historical fact that the district court has made after it has conducted an evidentiary hearing are subject to review under the clearly erroneous standard of Rule 52(a), the district court\u2019s ultimate conclusion as to whether the defendant enjoyed effective assistance of counsel is not subject to review under that standard, and the court of appeals must make an independent evaluation based on those subsidiary findings in determining whether counsel\u2019s representation satisfied the qualitative, normative standards dictated by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-9\">\n<em>B. Constitutional Standards for Effective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"aiv-dedup-1\"><em>1. The general legal standards. </em>\u2014 \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d U.S.Const. amend. VI. The Supreme Court has recently reemphasized that its decisions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKl6\">make clear that inadequate assistance does not satisfy the Sixth Amendment right to counsel made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. ... [T]he Sixth Amendment does more than require the States to appoint counsel for indigent defendants. The right to counsel prevents the state from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>conducting trials at which persons who face incarceration must defend themselves without adequate legal assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"arf-dedup-0\"><em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 344, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1716, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-5\">In this circuit, the standard for constitutionally effective assistance of counsel is \u201cnot errorless counsel, and not counsel judged ineffective by hindsight, but counsel reasonably likely to render <em>and rendering </em>reasonably effective assistance.\u201d <em>Herring v. Estelle, </em>491 F.2d 125, 127 (5th Cir. 1974) (quoting <em>MacKenna v. Ellis, </em>280 F.2d 592, 599 (5th Cir. 1960), <em>adhered to in pertinent part on rehearing en banc, </em>289 F.2d 928 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 877, 82 S.Ct. 121, 7 L.Ed.2d 78 (1961) (emphasis by <em>MacKenna </em>panel)).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he methodology for applying this standard involves an inquiry into the actual performance of counsel conducting the defense and a determination of whether reasonably effective assistance was rendered based on the <em>totality </em>of circumstances in the entire record.\u201d <em>Washington v. Estelle, </em>648 F.2d 276, 279 (5th Cir. 1981) (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The standard does not vary in accordance with whether counsel was retained or appointed. <em>Cuyler, </em>446 U.S. at 344-45, 100 S.Ct. at 1716.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1415-13\">Our cases have recognized that whether counsel has rendered reasonably effective assistance cannot be determined solely by reference to his performance at trial. \u201cInformed evaluation of potential defenses to criminal charges and meaningful discussion with one\u2019s client of the realities of his case are cornerstones of effective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Gaines v. Hopper, </em>575 F.2d 1147, 1149-50 (5th Cir. 1978) (affirming grant of habeas relief on grounds that attorney\u2019s failure to conduct adequate investigation, including failure to interview known witnesses, deprived defendant of viable defense that he might otherwise have asserted). \u201cSince \u2018investigation and preparation are the keys to effective representation,\u2019 ... counsel have a duty to interview potential witnesses and \u2018make an independent examination of the facts, circumstances, pleadings and laws involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rummel v. Estelle, </em>590 F.2d 103, 104 (5th Cir. 1979) (per curiam).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>This duty to investigate and prepare is, however, far from limitless, and not every breach thereof will mean that counsel has failed to render reasonably effective assistance. \u201c[Cjounsel for a criminal defendant is not required to pursue every path until it bears fruit or until all conceivable hope withers.\u201d <em>Lovett v. Florida, </em>627 F.2d 706, 708 (5th Cir. 1980). Condemning the inevitable and understandable tendencies to the contrary, our cases uniformly command that counsel\u2019s effectiveness may not be assessed through the finely ground lenses of 20/20 hindsight \u2014 and this command is especially compelling in reviewing claims of ineffective assistance that are grounded in allegations of inadequate investigation and preparation. \u201cReasonably effective assistance\u201d must be judged from the perspective of counsel, taking into account all of the circumstances of the case, but only as those circumstances were known to him at the time in question. Further, even when counsel\u2019s investigation and preparation are determined to have been seriously inadequate, there must be a showing that the habeas petitioner was to some degree prejudiced thereby \u2014 of which more later.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1416-4\"><em>2. The standard for effective assistance of counsel in capital cases. </em>\u2014 Before proceeding further, we must touch briefly upon one of Washington\u2019s purely legal arguments. Washington contends on appeal that the Constitution demands \u201cstricter scrutiny of the performance of an attorney whose client is sentenced to die.\u201d The only arguably direct support that he cites for this proposition is <em>Voyles v. Watkins, </em>489 F.Supp. 901, 910 (N.D.Miss.1980), in which the district court held that \u201cwhen the defendant has been convicted of a capital offense, courts must strictly scrutinize counsel\u2019s conduct.\u201d The <em>Voyles </em>court relied chiefly<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> on the plurality opinion in <em>Gardner v. Florida, </em>430 U.S. 349, 357-58,97 S.Ct. 1197, 1204-05, 51 L.Ed.2d 393 (1977), which emphasized that \u201c[i]t is of vital importance to the defendant and to the community that any decision to impose the death sentence be, and appear to be, based on reason rather than caprice or emotion.\u201d This, however, has no direct correspondence to the constitutional standards for effective assistance of counsel. Insofar as <em>Voyles </em>indicates that the constitutional standards for effective assistance of counsel vary according to the severity of the punishment imposed upon the defendant, we must disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-8\">Washington also relies upon cases such as <em>Beck v. Alabama, </em>447 U.S. 625, 100 S.Ct. 2382, 65 L.Ed.2d 392 (1980), in which the Supreme Court repeated its oft-stated observation that \u201cthere is a significant constitutional difference between the death penalty and lesser punishments,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 637,100 S.Ct. at 2389, and further noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMoM\">[t]o insure that the death penalty is imposed on the basis of \u2018reason rather than caprice or emotion,\u2019 [the Court has] invalidated <em>procedural rules </em>that tended to diminish the reliability of the sentencing determination. The same reasoning must apply to <em>rules </em>that diminish the reliability of the guilt determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1416-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 638, 100 S.Ct. at 2390 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> These cases, however, are inapposite to Washington\u2019s argument. In the first place, they are not ineffective assistance cases. More fundamentally, however, these cases generally relate to <em>procedures </em>that may affect the degree of accuracy with which guilt and sentencing determinations are made. While it is true that an ineffective lawyer may inject a massive risk of inaccuracy into such determinations, that inaccuracy does not come about through a procedural flaw in the system of justice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>Other than the <em>Voyles </em>case, Washington has not cited, and our own research has not revealed, any case in which the legal standards for constitutionally adequate assistance of counsel have been held to vary according to the severity of the punishment imposed upon the defendant. We refuse to so hold today.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1417-5\">This is not to say, however, that the severity of the sentence faced by a criminal defendant is not a fact to be considered in the overall determination of whether counsel has been constitutionally adequate in a given case. While neither in capital nor noncapital cases is a defendant entitled to perfect or error-free representation, the number, nature, and seriousness of the charges against the defendant are all part of the \u201ctotality of circumstances in the entire record\u201d that must be considered in the effective assistance calculus, just as are the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case and the strength and complexity of the defendant\u2019s possible defenses. Nonetheless, while the facts that must be considered will differ in each and every case, the legal standards for constitutionally effective assistance of counsel are constant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-6\">\n<em>C. The Assistance Rendered by Washington\u2019s Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-7\">Washington does not contend that his trial counsel, Darrell Reeves, was not \u201creasonably likely to render ... reasonably effective assistance\u201d; Reeves\u2019 education, experience, and expertise in criminal cases are unassailable.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Rather, Washington contends that Reeves did not <em>render </em>effective assistance <em>in this case. </em>As summarized in his brief, Washington contends that Reeves was ineffective in the following respects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWtv\">[ 1 ] Counsel failed before trial to interview ten of eleven named prosecution witnesses. He did not interview easily accessible witnesses who could and eventually did undercut [Washington\u2019s] alibi defense. [2] He did not investigate the apparent under-representation of blacks on the relevant jury panels, nor at trial did he object to the court\u2019s and prosecutor\u2019s systematic striking of <em>all </em>of the blacks who were on the panel. [3] He did not <em>voir dire </em>the remaining white jurors concerning possible racial prejudice toward a black man accused of killing a white man. [4] Additionally, counsel did <em>no </em>independent investigation of the aspects of petitioner\u2019s character and offense that were relevant to mitigation of sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1417-10\">(Emphasis in original; enumeration added.) We address these arguments in sequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-11\"><em>1. Reeves\u2019 failure to interview witnesses. </em>\u2014 With respect to Reeves\u2019 asserted failure to interview the witnesses named in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>the prosecution\u2019s witness list, the numbers given in the above-quoted excerpt from Washington\u2019s brief are somewhat misleading. Five of those witnesses were police officers who had participated in the investigation of Woods\u2019 death; since local police officers had standing instructions not to talk to defense counsel except through the chief of detectives, Reeves\u2019 decision not to interview them in person can hardly be faulted. Further, Reeves determined through a telephone interview with Roy Thompson (the convenience store clerk who testified about the shooting at trial) that Thompson could not identify or describe the gunmen; given that Washington\u2019s alibi defense did not dispute the events of the hold-up, this telephonic interview was unquestionably adequate. Neither can Reeves be faulted for failing to interview the doctor who testified as to Woods\u2019 cause of death: again, the alibi defense did not deny the prosecution\u2019s version of the shooting, but merely denied that Washington was involved. Finally, although Reeves did not interview the FBI agent through whom the prosecution introduced the hair samples linking Washington to clothing found near the scene of the crime, Reeves had studied the FBI crime lab report prior to trial and was prepared effectively to cross-examine the agent as to possible inaccuracies in this method of identification. Reeves\u2019 representation of Washington was not ineffective by virtue of his failure to interview these witnesses.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1418-13\">Only slightly more troublesome is Reeves\u2019 failure to interview Washington\u2019s alleged accomplice, Booker Cole. At the habeas hearing, Reeves testified that he had talked to Cole\u2019s lawyer, who would not agree to let Reeves interview Cole. Nonetheless, Reeves had heard Cole\u2019s version of events at Washington\u2019s preliminary hearing; he was fully aware of the details of Cole\u2019s plea bargain; and he used Lucy Washington (who was Johnny Washington\u2019s sister and Cole\u2019s girlfriend) as \u201cmore or less a go-between\u201d with Cole.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Washington argues that under Mississippi law,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> he had an absolute right of access to Cole that Reeves should have asserted on his behalf. None<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>theless, there would have been no guarantee that Cole would have cooperated had Reeves forced an interview over Cole\u2019s counsel\u2019s objections. In these circumstances, and without considering the fact that Cole\u2019s actual testimony at trial was entirely consistent with his testimony at the preliminary hearing,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> we cannot agree that Reeves\u2019 representation was ineffective by virtue of his failure to interview Cole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-4\">More serious is Reeves\u2019 failure to interview the two eye-witnesses (other than Cole) who linked Washington to the shooting: Curtis Cobb, who testified that he saw Cole and Washington retrieve a shotgun and money bag from some honeysuckle bushes near Cobb\u2019s house at about 1:00 a. m. following the shooting; and Ben Hodo, who testified that immediately after seeing one masked gunman running across the street from Woods Quick Pick, he saw Washington, unmasked and carrying a shotgun, in the alley behind the building. Washington contends that Reeves\u2019 failure to interview these two witnesses <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> was such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>a serious mistake as to have rendered his assistance ineffective, and that as a result of this failure, Reeves was unprepared to seek the suppression of Cobb\u2019s and Hodo\u2019s eye-witness identifications on grounds of undue suggestiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-4\">We assume for purposes of argument that Washington is correct in this contention \u2014 that is, that given all of the circumstances and the information available to Reeves before the trial, and given the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case and the nature of the defense Washington had chosen to pursue, Reeves\u2019 failure to interview these two prosecution witnesses despite knowing their names and addresses was a clear and grievous breach of his duties as a defense lawyer. Nonetheless, it is clear beyond peradventure that Washington\u2019s rights were in no measure prejudiced by that breach of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-22\">There is no doubt but that Hodo\u2019s eyewitness identification of Washington was extremely \u201cprejudicial\u201d in the sense that it hurt Washington\u2019s case;<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the same is true, albeit to a lesser degree, of Cobb\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> But this is not the sort of prejudice of which a defendant justly may complain. Rather, he may justly complain only of undue and unfair prejudice \u2014 that is, that the harm done to his case would not have come about had his constitutional rights been strictly protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-23\">[II] Washington has suggested only one way<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> in which his trial might have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>different had Reeves interviewed Hodo and Cobb: he suggests that Reeves would have filed a pretrial motion to suppress Hodo\u2019s and Cobb\u2019s in-court identifications on grounds that they were unduly suggestive under Manson v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> After examining the record,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> however, we are satisfied that Washington has failed to establish that such a suppression motion would properly have been granted had it been made: under the totality of the circumstances, as developed by Reeves\u2019 cross-examination of Cobb<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and Hodo <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> at trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>we cannot conclude that there existed at trial the \u201cvery substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 116, 97 S.Ct. at 2254, necessary before an in-court identification need be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax5\">The law of our circuit is as yet unclear as to the precise <em>degree </em>of prejudice that a defendant must demonstrate before he is entitled to habeas corpus relief on grounds that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, although it is clear that <em>some </em>degree of prejudice must be shown.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We need not decide what degree of prejudice is necessary, however, for Washington has failed to demonstrate that <em>any </em>prejudice whatsoever accrued from Reeves\u2019 failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>interview Hodo and Cobb prior to Washington\u2019s trial: given that Reeves would not have been able to suppress the in-court identifications of Washington even had he interviewed them prior to trial, we perceive no way in which Washington\u2019s trial would have differed had Reeves conducted such interviev/s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\">Washington also contends that Reeves \u201cdid not interview easily accessible witnesses [other than those listed on the prosecution\u2019s witness list] who could and eventually did undercut [Washington\u2019s] alibi defense.\u201d With respect to Reeves\u2019 failure to interview additional people who attended the party at which Washington claimed to have been at the time of the shooting,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> the short answer to this argument is that Washington has utterly failed to demonstrate that any of the party-goers other than the witnesses Reeves <em>did </em>call would have supported Washington\u2019s alibi. Our comments in <em>United States v. Guerra, </em>628 F.2d 410, 413 (5th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 934, 101 S.Ct. 1398, 67 L.Ed.2d 369 (1981), are apposite here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcZq\">Complaints concerning uncalled witnesses [require] a heavy showing [by the petitioner] since the presentation of testimonial evidence is a matter of trial strategy and often allegations of what a witness would have testified to are largely speculative. ... None of the alleged witnesses were called at the [federal habeas cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>pus] hearing and no one knows what they would have testified to. All we have is what [the petitioner] says they would have said.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1424-4\">Again, on this record, any inadequacy in Reeves\u2019 representation that is attributable to his failure to interview nontestifying party-goers must be deemed completely nonprejudicial to Washington, given his utter failure to establish at his federal habeas hearing that the nontestifying party-goers would have corroborated Washington\u2019s alibi defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-5\">This is also true with respect to those persons who contradicted Washington\u2019s alibi story, either as prosecution witnesses or as defense witnesses whose testimony surprised Reeves: there has been absolutely no showing that Reeves\u2019 failure to interview some of these witnesses,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> or his failure to interview others of them more thoroughly,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> in any way prejudiced Washington\u2019s defense, despite Washington\u2019s clear opportunity to make such a showing at his federal habeas hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-6\">Accordingly, we must reject Washington\u2019s contention that he should be granted federal habeas corpus relief on grounds that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective by virtue of his failure adequately to interview prospective and actual witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-12\"><em>2. Reeves other asserted </em>failings.\u2014 Washington contends that Reeves\u2019 assistance was constitutionally ineffective by virtue of his failure to investigate the apparent under-representation of blacks on the relevant jury panels, and by his failure to object to the court\u2019s and the prosecutor\u2019s systematic striking of all of the blacks who were on the panel. On this record, we harbor considerable doubt as to whether such challenges would properly have been sustained even had Reeves chosen to make them. However, while Reeves testified at the habeas hearing that he had considered arguing that blacks had been systematically excluded from the petit jury venire, he chose not to pursue this argument as a matter of trial strategy.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Given all of the circumstances of this case, we cannot conclude that such a strategy was so ill-chosen that it made Reeves\u2019 overall representation constitutionally ineffective. Further, Reeves did object, without success, to the court\u2019s striking of black jurors who were excused for cause on grounds that they could not set aside their \u201csympathy.\u201d Reeves also testified that given his understanding of the law and of the facts of Washington\u2019s case, he saw no basis for a challenge to the prosecution\u2019s exercising its peremptory strikes against blacks.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>cannot conclude that Reeves\u2019 representation was inadequate in these regards.</p>\n<p id=\"Aoc\">Neither do we find merit in Washington\u2019s claim that Reeves\u2019 representation was inadequate because he failed during voir dire examination to prove the venire members\u2019 racial attitudes. Reeves\u2019 testimony at the habeas hearing indicates that he made a conscious tactical decision not to expand on the trial court\u2019s and prosecutor\u2019s general questioning of the jury regarding their fairness and impartiality.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> On this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>record, there is no reason to conclude that this strategy was ill-chosen; Reeves\u2019 representation was not inadequate in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">Washington also alleges that had Reeves spent more time consulting with him, Washington would have chosen not to pursue the alibi defense. Washington has failed, however, to suggest any viable defense that he might have pursued in its place,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and Reeves\u2019 efforts to strike a plea bargain with the prosecution were rebuffed. Reeves\u2019 testimony indicates that he conferred with Washington on five or six occasions prior to trial, and that they discussed the nature of the alibi defense in detail. We cannot conclude that Reeves failed adequately to consult with his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">The final respect in which Washington contends that Reeves\u2019 representation was inadequate relates to his alleged failure adequately to prepare for the sentencing phase of Washington\u2019s trial. We need not reach this argument, however, because we conclude below in part III of this opinion that an error of constitutional dimensions in the sentencing phase of Washington\u2019s trial precludes the imposition of the death penalty. Reeves\u2019 alleged ineffectiveness in the sentencing phase of Washington\u2019s trial could not have infected the earlier determination as to Washington\u2019s guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-14\"><em>3. Our conclusions as to Washington's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. </em>\u2014 In parts <em>II </em>\u2014 C\u2014l and <em>II-C-2 </em>of this opinion, <em>supra, </em>we have examined in some detail the specific respects in which Washington contends that his trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance. In each instance, we have concluded either that Reeves\u2019 actions were correct, or that they reflected conscious defense strategies that were not so ill-advised as to justify a con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>elusion that Reeves\u2019 assistance was made inadequate thereby, or that they were completely nonprejudicial to Washington\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-5\">Yet we cannot emphasize too strongly that while this step-by-step method of analysis is, as an initial matter, necessary in order properly to evaluate an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, what is ultimately important is trial counsel\u2019s performance on balance and in the context of the entire case. Our repeated assertions that a criminal defendant is not entitled to perfect or error-free counsel are not mere rhetoric. Given our analysis of each of the respects in which Washington contends that Reeves\u2019 representation was ineffective, the task of balancing the positive aspects of Reeves\u2019 representation against his shortcomings is easy to perform in this case: since in no single respect was his representation both inadequate and prejudicial to Washington\u2019s defense, there is no question but that on balance and in the context of the entire case, his representation of Washington was constitutionally adequate. Further, that the foregoing analysis of Reeves\u2019 effectiveness has concentrated solely on his alleged inadequacies should not obscure the fact that in many respects upon which we have not dwelt, his representation of Washington was far more than adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-6\">III. THE LIMITATION ON THE JURY\u2019S CONSIDERATION OF MITIGATING FACTORS IN THE SENTENCING PHASE OF WASHINGTON\u2019S TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-7\">\n<em>A. The Trial Court\u2019s Charge on Aggravating and Mitigating Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-8\">In the sentencing phase of Washington\u2019s trial, which followed immediately after the jury found Washington guilty of capital murder, counsel for the State presented evidence in aggravation and counsel for Washington presented evidence in mitigation. The trial court then, without objection from either side, instructed the jury in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1427-9\">Members of the jury, as the court explained to you in the beginning of the trial, you have heard some evidence in aggravation put on by the State and you have heard evidence in mitigation put on by the defendant. You must in your sentencing find at least one item present of aggravation before you could impose the death penalty. If you find an item in aggravation present beyond a reasonable doubt, then you must consider any evidence in mitigation. And unless the evidence in mitigation could overcome the aggravation, of course, then you could return the death penalty. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1427-11\">You have found the defendant guilty of the crime of capital murder. You must now decide whether the defendant will be sentenced to death or to life imprisonment. In reaching your decision you must obviously consider the detailed circumstances of the offense for which the defendant was convicted and the defendant himself. To return the death penalty you must find that the aggravating circumstances, those which tend to warrant the death penalty, outweigh the mitigating circumstances, which are those which tend to warrant the lesser [sic] severe penalty. <em>Now consider only the following elements of aggravation in determining whether the death penalty should be </em>imposed: One, the capital murder was committed while the defendant Johnny Lewis Washington was engaged in the commission of the crime of robbery. Two, the defendant Johnny Lewis Washington committed this capital murder in an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner. Those are your elements of aggravation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1427-12\">You must unanimously find beyond a reasonable doubt that one or more of these existed in order to return the death penalty... . Now if one or more of those elements of aggravation is found to exist, then you must consider whether there are mitigating circumstances which outweigh the aggravating circumstances. <em>Now consider the following elements of mitigation in determining whether the death penalty should not be imposed: </em>One, that the defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity and two, the defendant\u2019s age at the time of the capital murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>If you unanimously find from the testimony that <em>one or more of the preceding elements of mitigation </em>existjs], then you must consider whether <em>it </em>outweighs the aggravating circumstances you previously found and you must return one of the following verdicts....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">(Emphasis added.) Washington argues that when taken as a whole, this charge operated to preclude the jury from considering as mitigating factors any of the circumstances surrounding his offense, and any aspects of his character and record other than his age and lack of a significant history of prior criminal activity. Washington contends that jury instructions which have this effect are impermissible under <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">\n<em>B. Washington\u2019s Trial Counsel\u2019s Failure to Object to the Challenged Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ayh-dedup-0\">In its first responding argument, the State contends that because Washington\u2019s trial counsel expressly declined to voice an objection to this jury instruction, Washington\u2019s <em>Lockett </em>argument must be treated as having been waived under Mississippi\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> According to the State, this rule constitutes an independent and adequate state procedural ground that, under <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977), bars our consideration on federal habeas corpus of Washington\u2019s <em>Lockett </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-6\">We find two flaws in the State\u2019s <em>Sykes </em>argument. First, the State did not contend in the district court that Washington\u2019s <em>Lockett </em>claim is barred by Mississippi\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule and <em>Sykes. </em>As such, the State itself is precluded from raising, at this late date any claim that Washington should be barred under a state-law theory of procedural default, for \u201c[a]s a general principle of appellate review, this court will not consider a legal issue or theory that was not presented to the [federal district court].\u201d <em>Noritake v. M/V Hellenic Champion, </em>627 F.2d 724, 732 (5th Cir. 1980). <em>See, e. g., Smith v. Estelle, </em>602 F.2d 694, 708 n.19 (5th Cir. 1979) (State waived its <em>Sykes </em>argument by failing to raise it in the federal habeas hearing prior to its motion for a new trial), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>- U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 1866, 68 L.Ed.2d 359 (1981); <em>LaRoche v. Wainwright, </em>599 F.2d 722, 724 (5th Cir. 1979) (State waived its <em>Sykes </em>argument by failing to raise it in habeas proceedings in federal district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-13\">The second and more fundamental flaw with the State\u2019s <em>Sykes </em>argument lies in the fact that the Mississippi Supreme Court expressly addressed the merits of Washington\u2019s <em>Lockett </em>claim in his direct appeal, rather than applying a contemporaneous objection rule to bar consideration of the merits. <em>See </em>361 So.2d at 67-68. \u201c[I]f neither the state legislature nor the state courts indicate that a federal constitutional claim is barred by some state procedural rule, a federal court implies no disrespect for the State by entertaining the claim.\u201d <em>County Court of Ulster County </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>442 U.S. 140,154, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 2223, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 (1979) (footnote omitted). Accordingly, the <em>Sykes </em>rule is inapplicable to Washington\u2019s <em>Lockett </em>claim despite his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the relevant jury instructions. <em>E. g., Braxton v. Estelle, </em>641 F.2d 392, 394 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Holloway v. McElroy, </em>632 F.2d 605, 617 (5th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 3019, 69 L.Ed.2d 398 (1981).<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1429-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>\n<em>C. The Standard by Which State-Court Trial Instructions are Judged on Federal Habeas Corpus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-5\">When called upon, in the context of a habeas corpus action brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (1976), to evaluate a jury instruction given by the state trial court, we must pay \u201ccareful attention to the words actually spoken to the jury, . . . for whether a defendant has been accorded his constitutional rights depends upon the way in which a reasonable juror could have interpreted the instruction.\u201d <em>Sandstrom v. Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 514, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 2454, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979); <em>see Holloway, </em>632 F.2d at 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-6\">To determine accurately the interpretation that a reasonable juror might give to the instruction in question, we cannot examine bits and pieces of the charge in isolation. <em>E. g., Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 146-47, 94 S.Ct. 396, 400-401, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973). Rather, we must \u201cexamine the entire charge and determine whether, taken as a whole, the issues and law presented to the jury were adequate.\u201d <em>Davis v. McAllister, </em>631 F.2d 1256, 1260 (5th Cir. 1980). <em>See also Stephens v. Zant, </em>631 F.2d 397, 405 (5th Cir. 1980), <em>modified on other grounds on panel rehearing, </em>648 F.2d 446 (5th Cir. 1981) (reviewing instructions in habeas action challenging imposition of death penalty); <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>611 F.2d 614, 619 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-7\">And even when some deficiency is discovered in the language of the charge taken as a whole, \u201cit must be established not merely that the instruction [was] undesirable, erroneous, or even \u2018universally condemned,\u2019 but that it violated some right which was guaranteed to the defendant by the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d and that \u201cthe ailing instruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process.\u201d <em>Cupp, </em>414 U.S. at 146, 147, 94 S.Ct. at 400. <em>See also Bryan </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>588 F.2d 1108, 1110-11 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-10\">\n<em>D. The Effect of the Challenged Instructions in This Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-11\">Having determined that we are not barred from considering the merits of Washington\u2019s <em>Lockett </em>claim, we turn now to an evaluation of the practical effect of the jury instructions \u2014 that is, what these instructions told the jury it should and should not do in deciding whether the death penalty should be imposed.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> After reviewing the entire charge from the sentencing hearing, in addition to that particularly relevant portion quoted above in part III-A of this opinion, we must agree with Washington that a reasonable juror might well have believed that in determining whether any aggravating factors sufficiently outweighed any mitigating factors so as to warrant the imposition of the death penalty, it was his sworn duty to consider <em>only </em>the two mitigating factors specifically enumerated in the trial court\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-12\">We first note that <em>nowhere </em>in the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury in the sentencing phase of Washington\u2019s trial is there any explicit instruction that the jury was free to consider mitigating factors other than Washington\u2019s age and lack of a significant history of prior criminal activity. This, of course, is a very significant point in our determination as to whether a reasonable juror might well have believed that his sworn duty was to consider only those two mitigating factors; yet it is not conclusive, for we must look at the charge as a whole to see if other language therein would have led a reasonable juror to infer that he was not so bound.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-13\">It is true that the trial court prefaced its explanation of the jury\u2019s duty to balance aggravating and mitigating circumstances by pointing out that \u201c[i]n reaching your decision you must obviously consider the detailed circumstances of the offense for which the defendant was convicted and the defendant himself.\u201d By itself, this language would tend to support an inference that the jury\u2019s discretion to consider both mitigating <em>and aggravating </em>circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>was wholly unchanneled. This, of course, is not the law, and the remainder of the instruction was obviously calculated to negate any such inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-4\">In instructing the jury as to the two aggravating factors that were at issue in the case,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> the trial court quite properly made it clear to the jury that it could consider <em>only </em>those two aggravating factors, and no others: \u201cNow <em>consider only the following elements of aggravation </em>in determining whether the death penalty should be imposed .... \u201d (Emphasis added.) Almost immediately thereafter, in language that almost exactly paralleled that in which the trial court circumscribed the jury\u2019s consideration of aggravating factors, the court told the jury to consider the two statutorily prescribed <footnotemark>44</footnotemark> mitigating factors that were at issue in the case: \u201cNow <em>consider the following elements of mitigation </em>in determining whether the death penalty should not be imposed .... \u201d (Emphasis added.) Unquestionably, a reasonable juror might well infer from this parallel syntax that the enumerated factors \u2014 both aggravating and mitigating \u2014 were the sole factors that he was permitted to consider in the discharge of his oath. This inference would be further supported by the trial court\u2019s elaboration on the juror\u2019s duty to balance aggravating against mitigating factors: \u201cIf you find from the testimony that <em>one or more of the preceding elements of mitigation </em>ex-ist\u00eds], then you must consider whether <em>it </em>outweighs the aggravating circumstances you previously found .. .. \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-13\">The State suggests that, to the contrary, the omission of the word \u201conly\u201d from the instruction as to mitigating circumstances would lead a reasonable juror to infer that his consideration of mitigating factors was not limited to those announced by the trial court. Perhaps an extraordinarily attentive juror might rationally have drawn such an inference from the omission of this single word. Indeed, such narrow parsing of language is far from unknown in the related context of judicial interpretation of legislative pronouncements.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Nonetheless, at best the State\u2019s argument suggests that there is more than one reasonable interpretation of the crucial language in the charge; this does not mean the charge is not constitutionally infirm, for the Supreme Court has held that \u201cwhether a defendant has been accorded his constitutional rights depends upon the way in which a reasonable juror <em>could </em>have interpreted the instruction.\u201d <em>Sandstrom, </em>442 U.S. at 514, 99 S.Ct. at 2454 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1430-14\">Accordingly, we must conclude that a reasonable juror might well have been led <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>to believe from the trial court\u2019s charge that in determining whether the aggravating factors sufficiently outweighed the mitigating factors so as to warrant the imposition of the death penalty, it was his sworn duty to consider <em>only </em>the two mitigating factors specifically enumerated in the charge. We now must explore the legal ramifications of this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-5\">\n<em>E. The Merits of Washington\u2019s Lockett Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-6\"><em>1. The Lockett decision. </em>\u2014 In the three years since the Supreme Court decided <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978), there have been surprisingly few occasions for the Court or the lower federal courts to amplify upon that precedent. In evaluating Washington\u2019s <em>Lockett </em>claim, therefore, we must be guided for the most part by that decision alone, although we may profitably draw much from the surrounding context of the Court\u2019s prior and subsequent pronouncements on the subject of capital punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-7\">An Ohio jury convicted 21-year-old Sandra Lockett of capital murder for her role in the armed robbery of a pawnshop.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Under then-current Ohio law, Lockett was to receive a sentence of death unless the trial judge found by a preponderance of the evidence one of three statutory mitigating circumstances: that the victim induced or facilitated the murder; that the defendant acted under duress, coercion, or strong provocation; or that the offense was primarily the product of psychosis or mental deficiency insufficient to constitute legal insanity. Lockett introduced evidence relating to her character and history (e. <em>g., </em>her youth, good character, lack of a prior record of violent crime, and excellent prospects for rehabilitation) and the circumstances of the offense (e. <em>g., </em>that she had had no part in the actual killing and only a minor role in the robbery, and that the shooting appeared to have been accidental); she argued that these factors made the death penalty inappropriate. The trial judge, however, found that none of the statutory mitigating circumstances was present, and sentenced Lockett to death. The conviction and sentence were upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court. The United States Supreme Court reversed Lockett\u2019s death sentence, holding that the Ohio death penalty statute was unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-10\">Although recognizing that the signals sent by the Court\u2019s recent death penalty cases had not \u201calways been easy to decipher,\u201d 438 U.S. at 602, 98 S.Ct. at 2963, Chief Justice Burger\u2019s plurality opinion began by reviewing the plurality opinions of the Court\u2019s 1976 death penalty cases.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The Chief Justice discerned from those cases an intent that sentencing discretion in death penalty cases not be eliminated altogether, but only \u201c \u2018directed and limited\u2019 ... so that the death penalty would be imposed in a more consistent and rational manner and so that there would be a \u2018meaningful basis for distinguishing the ... cases in which it is imposed from .. . the many cases in which it is not.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 601, 98 S.Ct. 2963 (quoting <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 189, 188, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2931, 2932, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-11\">The Chief Justice stressed, however, that the plurality in the 1976 cases had recognized \u201cthat the sentencing process must permit consideration of the \u2018character and record of the individual offender and the circumstances of the particular offense as a constitutionally indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty of death,\u2019 ... in order to ensure the reliability, under the Eighth Amendment standards, of the determination that \u2018death is the appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>punishment in a specific case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. 280, 304, 305, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 2991, 2992, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976) (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-4\">Continuing, the Chief Justice reiterated that the \u201cqualitative difference between death and other penalties calls for a greater degree of reliability when the death sentence is imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 604, 98 S.Ct. at 2964. \u201cGiven that the imposition of death by public authority is so profoundly different from all other penalties,\u201d the Chief Justice found that he could not \u201cavoid the conclusion that an individualized decision is essential in capital cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605, 98 S.Ct. at 2965.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1432-5\">There is no perfect procedure for deciding in which cases governmental authority should be used to impose death. But a statute that prevents the sentencer in all capital cases from giving independent mitigating weight to aspects of the defendant\u2019s character and record and to circumstances of the offense proffered in mitigation creates the risk that the death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors which may call for a less severe penalty. When the choice is between life and death, that risk is unacceptable and incompatible with the commands of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aze-dedup-0\"><em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>49</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Accordingly, Chief Justice Burger concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1432-6\">the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer, in all but the rarest kind of capital case, not be precluded from considering, <em>as a mitigating factor, </em>any aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1432-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 604, 98 S.Ct. at 2964 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Applying this holding, the Chief Justice observed that the Ohio statute at issue allowed the sentencing authority to consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history, character, and conditions of the offender \u2014 but only to the extent that evidence of these factors had a bearing on the three narrowly defined statutory mitigating circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 608, 98 S.Ct. at 2966. Because \u201c[t]o meet constitutional requirements, a death penalty statute must not preclude consideration of relevant mitigating factors,\u201d <em>id., </em>Chief Justice Burger concluded that the statute was incompatible with the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-12\">Only Justices Stewart, Powell, and Stevens joined in the Chief Justice\u2019s opinion in <em>Lockett. </em>In one of the two occasions on which this court has construed <em>Lockett, </em>however, we noted that it would seem that \u201ca death sentence imposed by a sentencer barred from considering mitigating circumstances will be vacated by a six-member majority of the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Chenault v. Stynchcombe, </em>581 F.2d 444, 448 (5th Cir. 1978).<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Accordingly, for present purposes we must treat the Chief Justice\u2019s plurality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>opinion as if it represents the views of a majority of the Court.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1433-5\"><em>2. Lockett's application to the case at bar. </em>\u2014 Given our holding above in part III\u2014 <em>D </em>of this opinion, we must agree with Washington that the challenged jury instructions prevented the sentencer\u2019s consideration of nonstatutory mitigating factors in essentially the same manner as did the Ohio statute struck down by the <em>Lockett </em>court. Washington\u2019s sentencer was precluded from considering as mitigating factors all but two of the aspects of Washington\u2019s character and record and the circumstances of the offense that he proffered as a basis of a sentence less than death. Unless there is some meaningful distinction between Washington\u2019s case and that of Sandra Lockett, then, Washington\u2019s sentence of death cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-6\">The most obvious difference between <em>Lockett </em>and the case at bar lies in the fact that Washington does not challenge on <em>Lockett </em>grounds the facial constitutionality of the state death penalty statute under which he was convicted.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> His challenge is a far more narrow one, reaching only the particular jury instructions given in his case. Nonetheless, we conclude that this distinction does not undercut Washington\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-12\">The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized the importance of proper jury instructions in capital cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1433-13\">Explaining that sentencer awareness of comprehensive, accurate information about the defendant is essential to a reliable and individualized sentencing determination [see <em>Jurek v. Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262, 271 [96 S.Ct. 2950, 2956, 49 L.Ed.2d 929] (1976); <em>Gregg, </em>428 U.S. at 189-92, 96 S.Ct. at 2932-34], the plurality [in the 1976 cases] observed that merely providing the jury with the evidence may not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>sufficient, since jurors have little experience in sentencing and are unskilled in absorbing and applying sentencing information. <em>[Gregg, </em>428 U.S. at 192, 96 S.Ct. at 2934.] The jury must therefore receive \u201cguidance in its decisionmaking,\u201d particularly as to the types of factors that are relevant to the sentencing decision and the proper means for applying these factors to the determination of sentence. <em>[Id. </em>at 192-93, 195, 96 S.Ct. at 2934, 2935.] The plurality concluded that jury instructions are an indispensible mechanism for providing this type of guidance to a capital sentencing jury. <em>[Id. </em>at 193-95, 96 S.Ct. at 2934-35.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1434-4\">Hertz &amp; Weisberg, <em>In Mitigation of the Penalty of Death: Lockett v. Ohio and the Capital Defendant\u2019s Right to Consideration of Mitigating Circumstances, </em>69 Cal.L.Rev. 317, 344 (1981) (footnotes omitted). And the <em>Lockett </em>plurality did not restrict its holding to statutes. Rather, it first announced a general rule \u2014 that \u201cthe senteneer .. . [must] not be precluded from considering, <em>as a mitigating factor, </em>any aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death,\u201d 438 U.S. at 604, 98 S.Ct. at 2964 \u2014 and then applied that rule to the Ohio statute, <em>id. </em>at 606-08, 98 S.Ct. at 2965-67. Accordingly, we recognized in <em>Chenault v. Stynchcombe, </em>581 F.2d at 448, that <em>Lockett </em>\u201cmandate[s] that the judge clearly instruct the jury about mitigating circumstances and the option to recommend against death,\u201d for Lockett\u2019s \u201cconstitutional requirement to allow consideration of mitigating circumstances would have no importance, of course, if the sentencing jury is unaware of what it may consider in reaching its decision.\u201d <footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Thus, there is no doubt but that Washington may properly raise his <em>Lockett </em>argument through a challenge to the instructions given by the trial court to the jury that convicted him.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1434-7\">In rejecting Washington\u2019s <em>Lockett </em>argument, the district court noted that the trial court excluded no evidence that was offered in mitigation, and concluded that \u201cthe jury was free to consider all mitigating evidence which [Washington] saw fit to offer.\u201d Similarly, the State argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>Washington\u2019s counsel introduced some evidence of nonstatutory mitigating factors, and adverted to those factors in his closing argument. Both the district court\u2019s analysis and the State\u2019s argument on appeal, however, completely miss the point of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Lockett. </em>Sandra Lockett also introduced evidence of nonstatutory mitigating factors, and also argued their relevance to the sentencer. The fatal flaw in <em>Lockett </em>was not the exclusion of evidence relating to nonstatutory mitigating factors, but the limitation on the sentencer\u2019s consideration of that evidence except as it related to the statutory mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-5\">Neither should Washington\u2019s <em>Lockett </em>challenge fail because his counsel adverted to nonstatutory mitigating circumstances during closing argument. As the Supreme Court has noted in a related context, \u201carguments of counsel cannot substitute for instructions by the court.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Kentucky, </em>436 U.S. 478, 488-89, 98 S.Ct. 1930, 1936-37, 56 L.Ed.2d 468 (1978) (concluding that trial court\u2019s omission of instruction on presumption of innocence was not remedied by defense counsel\u2019s explanation of the presumption in opening and closing argument). Only an instruction from the trial court can invest a particular concept \u2014 here the jury\u2019s ability to consider nonstatutory mitigating factors \u2014 with the authority of the court. <em>See id. </em>at 489, 98 S.Ct. at 1936-37. Indeed, were a jury to consider nonstatutory mitigating factors despite instructions by the court to the effect that it was duty-bound to consider only the two statutory mitigating circumstances, it would be acting \u201clawlessly,\u201d <em>see Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. at 303, 96 S.Ct. at 2990 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens). \u201cThere is an element of capriciousness in making the jurors\u2019 power to avoid the death penalty dependent on their willingness to accept [an] invitation to disregard the trial judge\u2019s instructions.\u201d <em>Roberts v. Louisiana, </em>428 U.S. 325, 335, 96 S.Ct. 3001, 3007, 49 L.Ed.2d 974 (1976) (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens).</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-8\">The State also contends that the nonstat-utory mitigating circumstances which Washington argues were removed from the jury\u2019s consideration \u201cwere not reasonably likely to generate any sympathetic consideration from the tribunal.\u201d The State argues that \u201cthe fact that [Washington] had carried on a \u2018steady domestic relationship\u2019 with a woman not his wife and had fathered, by her, a three year old female child is not altogether an ironclad or otherwise viable mitigating factor bespeaking [Washington\u2019s] good moral character.\u201d Further, the State argues that evidence indicating that Washington had held no fewer than eight different jobs would have impelled the jury to the same conclusion that was reached by the trial judge in his post-sentencing report \u2014 that \u201cthe defendant had a poor work record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-9\">This argument, however, goes to the <em>weight </em>that the jury would have accorded to the nonstatutory mitigating factors, rather than to whether the jury could properly have considered them in its calculations. The juiy could just as easily have reached diametrically opposite conclusions from those suggested by the State, had it been allowed by the trial court\u2019s instructions to consider nonstatutory mitigating factors. For example, the jury might rationally have concluded that the two statutory mitigating circumstances (Washington\u2019s relative youth and lack of a significant record of prior criminal activity), when combined with various objective, articulable nonstatutory mitigating circumstances<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> (such as Washington\u2019s steady domestic rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>tionship, his role as a father, and his employment history<footnotemark>57</footnotemark>), <em>together </em>sufficiently outweighed the aggravating circumstances So as to make life imprisonment a more appropriate and just punishment for Washington\u2019s crime than death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-4\">In short, under <em>Lockett, </em>the error in the trial court\u2019s proscription of jury consideration of nonstatutory mitigating circumstances was one of constitutional proportions that violated rights secured to Washington under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments; given that the entire purpose of the sentencing proceedings was to determine and balance aggravating against mitigating circumstances, that error unquestionably so infected the sentencing proceedings as to drain them of fundamental fairness. While one may argue about the precise degree to which Washington was prejudiced by this error, we cannot conclude that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Accordingly, the State may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>constitutionally impose upon Washington a sentence of death on the basis of the sentencing proceedings at issue in this case,</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-4\">The practical impact of our holding should be relatively narrow. Counsel for the State indicated in argument in the court below that he has recommended to Mississippi prosecutors that they ensure that the'jury instructions in capital cases do not limit the jury\u2019s consideration to statutory mitigating circumstances.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The use of such nonlimiting instructions has been approved by the Mississippi Supreme Court subsequent to Washington\u2019s trial and direct appeal. <em>See Gray v. State, </em>375 So.2d 994, 1003-04 (Miss.1979) (en banc) (approving instruction that jury was to consider as a mitigating circumstance \u201c[a]ny other matter [besides the statutory mitigating circumstances] brought before you which you deem to be mitigating on behalf of the Defendant\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 988, 100 S.Ct. 2975, 64 L.Ed.2d 847 (1980). And, of course, whether a given set of instructions operates so as to preclude the jury\u2019s consideration of nonstatutory mitigating factors will depend on how a reasonable juror could have interpreted the language of that specific charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-9\">Finally, it bears emphasis that we do not here decide whether constitutional error would inhere in a trial court\u2019s failure specifically to instruct the jury in a capital case that it was free to consider nonstatutory mitigating factors; <footnotemark>60</footnotemark> our holding is limited to the circumstances of the case at bar, in which the trial court\u2019s charge was not silent on the issue, but operated affirmatively to preclude jury consideration of nonstatutory mitigating factors.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1437-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-11\">For the reasons set forth above in part II of this opinion, we conclude that Washington was not denied effective assistance of counsel in the guilt phase of his trial. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment insofar as it declined to grant habeas relief that would have resulted in Washington\u2019s retrial on the issue of his guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>For the reasons set forth above in part III of this opinion, however, we conclude that the process by which the State secured a death sentence for Washington\u2019s crime was constitutionally flawed because the jury was precluded from considering non-statutory mitigating factors in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Lockett </em>decision.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment insofar as it denied Washington habeas corpus relief that would secure him from the execution of the death sentence returned in his 1977 trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-4\">No party has as yet briefed or argued the question of the precise scope of habeas relief necessary, given that- we have found constitutional error only in the sentencing phase of Washington\u2019s trial. In the first instance, Mississippi law would govern the various alternatives available to the state\u2014 <em>i. </em>e., whether Washington could be resen-tenced to a sentence other than the death penalty on the basis of this conviction, or whether the State could seek a new death sentence from a jury convened solely for resentencing, or whether the State could seek a new death sentence only after retrying the issue of Washington\u2019s guilt as well.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> There may, however, be federal constitutional overtones to any such decision based on Mississippi law. Accordingly, while we remand this case with instructions that the district court shall enter judgment granting appropriate habeas relief in accordance with this opinion, we leave it to the district court to determine, after briefing and argument by the parties, the precise form of such relief.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1438-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1411-9\">.

Indeed, Washington concedes in his brief that Reeves \u201cdid not lack either innate ability or experience.\u201d At the federal court hearing, 37-year-old Reeves testified that he had received his undergraduate education at the University of Virginia and his legal education at the University of Mississippi. He estimated that he had practiced law in Columbus for about 11 years; his practice included both civil and criminal litigation in both the state and federal courts. Although Columbus had no public defender program, Reeves testified that he had been one of two local attorneys who was regularly appointed to represent indigent defendants; he estimated that he had tried from 25 to 30 cases involving felony charges, in most of which he had been appointed counsel. In fact, Reeves had obtained a jury verdict of acquittal on armed robbery charges against Johnny Washington some 18-24 months prior to Washington\u2019s capital murder trial. (These charges, of course, were never mentioned at the latter trial). Finally, although neither Reeves, the district attorney, nor the state trial judge had tried a capital murder case under Mississippi\u2019s statutory bifurcation scheme prior to Washington\u2019s trial, the three of them met informally on a number of occasions \u201cjust going over procedure to be sure that we were doing it as best we could.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1418-4\">.

This, too, would be fatal to his ineffective assistance claim with regard to these witnesses.

Cobb testified that he was standing in his back yard, looking for a set of lost keys, when he saw Cole and Washington walk by, search through some nearby honeysuckle bushes, and emerge carrying a shotgun and a money bag. This, of course, directly contradicted Washington\u2019s account of his whereabouts at 1:00 a. m. in the morning following the shooting, although it only circumstantially linked Washington to the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-25\">Cobb testified that although he had been to a lounge earlier that evening, he had not had anything to drink, since he was on his college track team. He testified that although it was dark where he was standing, he could see Cole and Washington very clearly by the light of a streetlight, and that he had recognized Washington and had had a chance to look him over very thoroughly. Cobb denied having seen Washington since that time, and denied that the police had asked him to pick Washington out of a series of photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-26\">Reeves developed through other witnesses, however, that Cobb had initially identified Johnny Washington\u2019s brother, R.L. Washington, as the man he had seen searching through the bushes with Cole; indeed, the police initially arrested R.L. Washington on the basis of Cobb\u2019s misidentification. Reeves stressed this misidentification to the jury in his closing argument in an attempt to impeach Cobb\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1420-27\">. In what is essentially a derivative argument, Washington also suggests that because Reeves was surprised by the nature of Cobb\u2019s and Hodo\u2019s testimony, he was unprepared to probe their testimony through vigorous cross-examination for fear that he might unearth something worse. In fact, Reeves\u2019 cross-examination of both of these witnesses appears to have been quite skillful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-28\">The short answer to Washington\u2019s argument, however, is that he has failed utterly even to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>allege \u2014 much less establish \u2014 that there was anything more for Reeves to establish through cross-examination. There simply does not seem to be anything more that Reeves could have done to discredit these witnesses\u2019 testimony. Particularly with respect to Hodo, Reeves can hardly be faulted for \u201cwanting to get him out of the courtroom as quick as [he] could,\u201d for Hodo was indeed \u201ctoo good a witness for the State.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1421-5\">. <em>Manson </em>reemphasized that the factors which were first stated in <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972), are to be considered in determining whether under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d an identification can be deemed sufficiently reliable to be admissible. 432 U.S. at 107 &amp; n.9, 97 S.Ct. at 2249 &amp; n.9. <em>Biggers </em>emphasized \u201cthe opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of time between the trial and the confrontation.\u201d 409 U.S. at 199, 93 S.Ct. at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-6\">\u201cThe <em>Biggers </em>components govern the admissibility of both in-court and out-of-court identification[s].\u201d <em>United States v.

Washington presumably could have called Cobb, Hodo, or both as witnesses at the habeas hearing in order to amplify upon the circumstances surrounding their identifications of Washington. He did not do so. As a result, virtually the only evidence about these identifications is that which Reeves developed through cross-examination at Washington\u2019s trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1421-11\">. The only respects in which Washington challenges Cobb's identification of him have to do with the facts that Cobb was returning from a bar when he allegedly saw Cole and Washington; that it was dark; and that Cobb originally misidentified R.L. Washington, Johnny Washington\u2019s brother, as the man he had seen with Cole. Cobb\u2019s uncontradicted testimony at trial, however, established that there was adequate light and that Cobb had not been drinking. See note 26 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1421-14\">We assume <em>arguendo </em>that there was something impermissibly suggestive in Cobb\u2019s confrontation with Washington that might have tainted his in-court identification, and that Washington therefore has met the first of this circuit\u2019s two requirements, <em>see e. g., Preacher v. Estelle, </em>626 F.2d 1222, 1223 &amp; n.3 (5th Cir. 1980), cert. <em>denied, </em>450 U.S. 930, 101 S.Ct. 1389, 67 L.Ed.2d 362 (1981), for suppressing an in-court identification. However, Washington has not met the second requirement by demonstrating that under the totality of the circumstances, a very substantial likelihood of misidentification existed <em>at the trial. </em>Only one of the <em>Biggers </em>factors \u2014 \u201cthe accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the criminal\u201d \u2014 cuts in favor of suppression. Based on Cobb\u2019s trial testimony all three of the other factors cut against suppression, and Washington has failed to supplement the trial record with any evidence to-the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-15\">Therefore, we must conclude that Cobb\u2019s in-court identification of Washington, though perhaps rendered somewhat questionable by virtue of the prior misidentification, was merely part of the \u201ccustomary grist for the jury mill. Juries are not so susceptible that they cannot measure intelligently the weight of identification testimony that has some questionable value.\u201d <em>Manson, </em>432 U.S. at 116, 97 S.Ct. at 2254. As we observed above in note 26, Reeves competently brought to the jury\u2019s attention the respects in which Cobb\u2019s testimony was suspect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1421-16\">. Hodo testified on direct examination that he had seen Washington at a distance of seven feet.

Reeves tried to get Hodo to admit that he had been influenced by the arrays:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1422-11\">Q. Let me ask you this: could looking at those photographs enable, having picked Johnny Washington twice in those photographs, are you identifying him now by reference to those photographs or by what you saw in the alley?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1422-12\">A. What I saw in the alley.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1422-13\">Q. You are positive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1422-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1422-15\">At this point, Reeves concluded his cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-16\">There is no suggestion from this record that the photographic arrays were unduly suggestive in the least. But even assuming that there was some impermissible suggestiveness inherent in the photo arrays, or in the circumstances surrounding the in-court identification, Hodo\u2019s uncontradicted testimony established his opportunity to view, his degree of attention, the accuracy of his description, the level of his certainty, and the relatively brief time between the crime and the initial confrontation. There is no question but that under the totality of the circumstances, there was not such a very substantial likelihood of misidentification as to render Hodo\u2019s in-court identification inadmissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1422-17\">.

In that case, the alleged ineffectiveness stemmed from counsel\u2019s failure to object at trial to clearly inadmissible hearsay evidence. The <em>Nelson </em>court noted that erroneous evidentiary rulings by state courts may be grounds for federal habeas corpus relief only if the erroneously admitted evidence sapped the trial of fundamental <em>fairness </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>only if the error was \u201c \u2018material in the sense of a crucial, critical, highly significant factor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 907-08 (quoting <em>Hills v.

Significantly, there was no showing in that case that the erroneously admitted hearsay was inaccurate or otherwise unreliable; thus, even though the petitioner had been \u201cprejudiced\u201d by the hearsay in the sense that its admission was detrimental to his case, that prejudice was not undue or unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-11\">Accordingly, the <em>Nelson </em>court determined that the erroneously admitted evidence did not drain the state-court proceedings of fundamental fairness, 642 F.2d at 907-08, and declined to afford the petitioner greater protection through an ineffective assistance claim than that to which he would have been entitled had he challenged the admission of the hearsay directly. As an alternate ground for its holding, the <em>Nelson </em>court noted that it was not until two months after the petitioner\u2019s trial that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had held inadmissible the hearsay to which the petitioner claimed his counsel should have objected; the court repeated our familiar observation that \u201c[clairvoyance is not a required attribute of effective representation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 908 (quoting <em>Cooks v.

In response to questioning from Washington\u2019s counsel at the habeas hearing, Reeves testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-10\">Q. ... Did you investigate the jury venire to determine whether or not there was a systematic exclusion of black citizens from the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-13\">A. I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-14\">Q. Could you tell me why you did not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-15\">A. Several reasons. One, I had observed the jurors at that time for about eight years. I was personally familiar with a prior case that was, I believe, around 1975 involving black defendants charged with an attack on a white girl. The venires there were challenged. After investigation by the attorneys, ... [they] withdrew their motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-17\">Based on that, based on observing the number of blacks that are on juries, based on the fact that there were many competent attorneys that practice in Columbus court, none had ever made that challenge, and <em>I felt it was totally without merit.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1424-18\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b1424-19\">.

Later in the hearing, Reeves amplified upon this testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-13\">Q. ... Now you earlier testified that the District Attorney, I believe, used out of twelve peremptory strikes ten strikes and those were blacks. Now the other two, if I am not mistaken, one was a woman who voiced some objection to being able to give the death penalty, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-14\">A. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-15\">Q. And the other one was a minister?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-16\">A. A minister who also employed Johnny Washington\u2019s mother in the church.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-17\">Q. I see. And the judge didn\u2019t rule for cause on that one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-18\">A. Not for cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-19\">Q. Did it occur to you to object to the District Attorney\u2019s striking black jurors as a matter of practice and tactics as you mentioned earlier?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-20\">A. No. As far as I understand the law, he has got twelve he can use for any reason. He is picking a jury that he hopes will convict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-21\">Q. Okay. So your understanding of the law is then that if the District Attorney wishes to base his peremptory challenges totally on racial background?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-22\">A. Now, I am not looking into his mind because I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-23\">Q. I am asking your understanding of the law, that he can use or she can use those peremptory challenges for any reason that they desire as a trial tactic?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-24\">A. Yes. He can strike, he has that twelve that he can strike without giving a reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-25\">Q. Even if that reason is just purely race, he or she could still strike for that reason?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-26\">A. Well, now I don\u2019t want to get back into that circle. It is my understanding that he can strike twelve for whatever reason he desires, without giving a reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1425-27\">Reeves was certainly correct in his understanding that a prosecutor generally need not justify his use of peremptory strikes. Washington cites <em>Swain v. Alabama, </em>380.

It is not enough to base such a constitutional claim on the facts of the single case presented to this court.\u201d <em>Easter v. Estelle, </em>609 F.2d 756, 759 (5th Cir. 1980). It can hardly be contended that Reeves general, equivocal comments about the district attorney\u2019s \u201cpattern\u201d of striking blacks is sufficient to establish that there has in fact been systematic exclusion of blacks from juries: indeed, Reeves\u2019 statement that \u201csometimes [the prosecutor] does [strike blacks] and sometimes he doesn\u2019t\u201d would completely undercut such an argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-29\">Further, Reeves\u2019 observations about the district attorney\u2019s \u201cpattern\u201d were based on his experience both before and after Washington\u2019s trial; the record indicates, however, that Washington\u2019s was the first case Reeves had tried against this district attorney, who had been elected to the position only a short time before. There is no evidence in the record that would tend to establish that any other .prosecutor in Columbus participated in such a \u201cpattern\u201d of systematic exclusion of blacks. Given that we must not evaluate counsel\u2019s effectiveness using hindsight, it is difficult in these circumstances to conceive how Reeves could be expected to have objected at Washington\u2019s trial to this prosecutor\u2019s \u201cpattern\u201d of striking blacks, if indeed such a pattern developed after Washington\u2019s trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b1425-30\">.

Washington suggests that the prosecution\u2019s evidence \u2014 specifically, Roy Thompson\u2019s testimony that Woods repeatedly grabbed at the gunman\u2019s gun and followed him to the door\u2014 suggested a \u201cprovocation/accidental shooting\u201d defense. This suggestion, however, ignores the fact that the statute under which Washington was convicted defines the killing of another human being as capital murder \u201c[w]hen done <em>with or without any design to effect death, </em>by any person engaged in the commission of the crime of ... robbery.\u201d Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 97-3-19 (1980 Supp.) (emphasis added). The Mississippi Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of this provision confirms that the defendant\u2019s specific intent to kill is irrelevant under this felony murder provision. <em>Culberson </em>v. <em>State, </em>379 So.2d 499, 507-08 (Miss. 1979) (en banc), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 101 S.Ct. 406, 66 L.Ed.2d 250 (1980); <em>Gray v. State, </em>351 So.2d 1342, 1344-45 (Miss. 1977) (en banc). Thus, any suggestion that Wa$hington might profitably have urged that his shooting of Woods was excusable on provocation or self-defense grounds is frivolous. Further, as a general matter, \u201c[a]cci-dent is, of course, no defense to a homicide committed in the perpetration of, or in the attempt to perpetrate, a felony.\u201d 40 Am.Jur.2d <em>Homicide </em>\u00a7 112, at 407 (1968). <em>See also </em>W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Handbook on Criminal Law \u00a7 71, at 549-50 (1972). In short, under horn-book criminal law, these suggested \u201cdefenses\u201d are inapplicable when the crime charged is felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-16\">In a separate argument, Washington contends that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments forbid imposition of the death penalty in the absence of a finding that Washington deliberately, purposely, or intentionally acted to take a human life, relying chiefly on Justice White\u2019s opinion in <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 624-28, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 2983-85, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (White, J., concurring in part and in the judgment, and dissenting in part). <em>See generally </em>Comment, <em>The Constitutionality of Imposing the Death Penalty for Felony Murder, </em>15 Hous.

We note, however, that this contention would relate only to the imposition of the death penalty \u2014 not to Washington\u2019s guilt or innocence \u2014 and at best could have left him facing a mandatory life sentence with no possibility of parole, <em>see </em>Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 99-19-107 (1980 Supp.). Hence, it can hardly be argued that Reeves should have abandoned the alibi defense that was preferred by his client in favor of a constitutional argument that thus far has been accepted by only one of the Court\u2019s nine Justices, and that at best would have left his client in prison for life without possibility of parole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b1428-7\">.

The constitutional requirement that juries be given instructions detailing their discretionary power to refuse to impose the death penalty stands in sharp contrast to the prevailing law on the topic of \u201cjury nullification\u201d \u2014 that is, the jury\u2019s exercise of its \u201cpower to bring in a verdict [of acquittal] in the teeth of both law and facts,\u201d <em>Homing v. District of Columbia, </em>254 U.S. 135, 138, 41 S.Ct. 53, 54, 65 L.Ed. 185 (1920) (per Holmes, J.). A jury, acting as a \u201ccommunity conscience\u201d in disregarding the strict requirements of the law when it finds that those requirements cannot justly be applied in a particular case, undoubtedly possesses this power each time it determines a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence; that power, of course, is not limited to capital cases, but extends to determinations of guilt or innocence in all criminal cases. The courts that have considered the question, however, have almost uniformly held that a criminal defendant is not entitled to an instruction that points up the existence of that practical power to his jury. <em>Compare United States v. Dougherty, </em>473 F.2d 1113, 1130-37 (D.C.Cir.1972) (eloquent explanation of why a defendant is not entitled to instruction on jury nullification), <em>with id. </em>at 1139-44 (Bazelon, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (eloquent argument as to why a defendant should be entitled to such an instruction, or at least to argue the theory of jury nullification to the jury). <em>See also United States v.

By marked contrast, when a jury declines to impose the death penalty upon one already convicted of a capital crime, the jury\u2019s exercise of community conscience and norms ordinarily will not result in the defendant being set free. In Mississippi, for example, the jury\u2019s sentencing alternatives for a capital offense are limited solely to capital punishment and life imprisonment. <em>See </em>Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 99-19-101(2), 99-19-103 (1980 Supp.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b1434-10\">. The State wisely concedes this point in its brief: \u201cWe concur with petitioner that an instruction emanating from the lips and pen of the trial court could inflict the same fatal trauma that the Ohio statute inflicted in <em>Lockett. </em>Any substantial judicial restraint imposed upon the sentencing authority would appear to be no less decisive on the Eighth Amendment question than a statutory impediment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b1435-6\">.

Specifically, the State contends that the record contains no evidence that Washington\u2019s child and girlfriend were dependent upon him, and that, because of a peculiarity in the trial court\u2019s charge in the guilt phase of the trial, the jury\u2019s verdict conclusively established that Washington acted wilfully with premeditated and deliberate design. Given our disposition above, we need not reach these contentions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b1436-5\">. Equally as important may be the jury\u2019s subjective, unarticulable perceptions of Washington. In their separate opinions in <em>Lockett, </em>Justices White and Rehnquist argued that the plurality was returning to the unguided jury discretion condemned in <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972). <em>See </em>438 U.S. at 622-23, 98 S.Ct. at 2982-83 (White, J., concurring in part and in the judgment and dissenting in part); <em>id. </em>at 631, 98 S.Ct. at 2974-75 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Some commentators have concluded from <em>Lockett </em>that \u201c[t]he concern with capriciousness, the worry that when most offenders receive mercy the condemned few will die senselessly, no longer figures significantly in the Court\u2019s decisions.\u201d <em>The Supreme Court, 1977 Term, </em>92 Harv.L.Rev. 57, 106-07 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-6\">However, the <em>Gregg </em>plurality was careful to note that \u201c[njothing in any of our [death penalty cases] suggests that the decision to afford an individual defendant mercy violates the Constitution.\u201d 428 U.S. at 199, 96 S.Ct. at 2937. The exercise of mercy, of course, can never be a wholly rational, calculated, and logical process. From these premises, other commentators have argued that <em>\u201cLockett </em>is entirely consistent with <em>Furman </em>and the 1976 Cases, because it grants broad sentencer discretion only on the mitigating and not on the aggravating side of the sentencing equation.\u201d Hertz &amp; Weisberg, <em>supra </em>note 51, at 374. To amplify:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1436-7\">The <em>Gregg </em>decision essentially holds that the state cannot execute a defendant unless it establishes, according to constitutionally sufficient criteria of aggravation and according to constitutionally mandated procedures, that capital punishment is appropriate for that defendant. Nothing in <em>Gregg, </em>however, requires the state to execute defendants for whom such a finding is made. The sentencing authority can find that mitigating circumstances established by defense evidence outweigh such aggravating factors. It can also invoke whatever standards it wishes \u2014 objective or otherwise \u2014 to nullify the significance of any state proof of aggravation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1436-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 375 (footnote omitted). In this view, <em>Lockett </em>does indeed create an asymmetry in the channeling of jury sentencing discretion. That asymmetry is offensive, however, only if one assumes that the grant of mercy to some, based on their particularized circumstances, somehow abridges the constitutional rights of others whose particular circumstances do not inspire mercy. It may well be that the <em>Lockett </em>plurality does not share that assumption with Justices White and Rehnquist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-11\">In the case at bar, we need not decide whether the <em>Lockett </em>rule applies when there are no objective, articulable nonstatutory mitigating factors. The factors that Washington <em>has </em>articulated are sufficient to make further inquiry along these lines unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"58\">\n<p id=\"b1436-12\">. We cannot agree with the State\u2019s suggestion that before a habeas petitioner is entitled to prevail on <em>Lockett </em>grounds, the mitigating factors excluded from the jury\u2019s consideration must be as compelling as those excluded from jury consideration in <em>Green v. Georgia, </em>442 U.S. 95, 99 S.Ct. 2150, 60 L.Ed.2d 738 (1979) (per curiam), which represents one of the Supreme Court\u2019s few applications of the <em>Lockett </em>rule. In <em>Green, </em>Georgia\u2019s hearsay rule resulted in the exclusion of hearsay testimony in which the out-of-court declarant, who was an accomplice of Green\u2019s, had said that Green was not present at and had not participated in the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-13\">Relying on both <em>Lockett </em>and <em>Chambers v.

The Court appeared to base its decision solely on the facts that the excluded testimony was highly relevant under <em>Lockett </em>and that substantial reasons existed to assume its reliability. <em>See </em>442 U.S. at 97, 99 S.Ct. at 2152. We find no support in <em>Green </em>for the State\u2019s suggestion that <em>Lockett </em>applies only when the nonstatutory mitigating factors that have been excluded from jury consideration are especially compelling; neither does <em>Green </em>indicate that <em>Lockett </em>is limited to those situations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>in which defense counsel has been precluded from even alluding to the nonstatutory mitigating factors. As the Court\u2019s brief treatment indicates, the facts in <em>Green </em>simply indicated a more egregious violation of the <em>Lockett </em>rule than the facts of <em>Lockett </em>itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"59\">\n<p id=\"b1437-6\">. In .response to questioning from the court below as to whether the Constitution requires that the trial court\u2019s charge in a capital case specifically instruct the jury that it may consider nonstatutory mitigating factors, counsel for the State responded as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-7\">I don\u2019t think that is a constitutional necessity. I have advocated all along, or have been of the belief all along that it would not be unwise for the prosecutors or state to submit an instruction, mitigating circumstances you may consider, something to this effect or consider the following mitigating circumstances and then list the ones that have been brought out by the evidence and <em>add another one to the effect of other mitigating circumstances that you, the jury, feel may be reasonably relevant to the issue of life or death.</em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b1437-8\">. It is true that in <em>Chenault v. Stynchcombe, </em>581 F.2d 441, 448 (5th Cir. 1978), we stated that \u201c[w]e read <em>Lockett </em>and <em>Bell, </em>then, to mandate that the judge clearly instruct the jury about mitigating circumstances and the option to recommend against death.\u201d Nonetheless, that case did not present the question of whether constitutional error would inhere in a trial court\u2019s failure specifically to instruct the jury in a capital case that it could consider nonstat-utory mitigating factors; in fact, the above-quoted language in <em>Chenault </em>does not directly refer to nonstatutory mitigating factors. Accordingly, this question must be considered an open one in the Fifth Circuit, and we expressly and emphatically decline to express an opinion thereupon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b1437-13\">. The Missouri Supreme Court, we note, has taken the position that jury instructions in capital cases should, in addition to listing statutory mitigating factors, indicate simply that the jury may consider all of the evidence relating to the offense in connection with mitigation. While this instruction would, in the Missouri Supreme Court\u2019s view, allow jury consideration of mitigating factors that are not \u201cauthorized by law,\u201d the court has indicated that \u201cno instruction should be given calling the jury\u2019s attention\u201d to this fact. <em>See </em>44 Mo.L.Rev. 359, 368-69 &amp; n. 64 (1979). The Mississippi Supreme Court apparently has not yet addressed this question, and neither do we.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"b1438-5\">. Given our conclusions with respect to Washington\u2019s <em>Lockett </em>argument, we do not reach his other arguments as to why the district court\u2019s judgment with respect to Washington\u2019s sentence should be reversed: that the court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on Washington\u2019s claim that his death sentence was the product of racial discrimination; that the Mississippi courts\u2019 refusal further to define or delimit the \u201cheinous, atrocious or cruel\u201d aggravating circumstance of Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 99-19-101(5)(h) (1980 Supp.) rendered that circumstance unconstitutionally vague and overbroad; and that the death penalty is unconstitutionally disproportionate in this case because there has been no finding that Washington deliberately took the life of another person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"63\">\n<p id=\"b1438-6\">. <em>Cf. </em>Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 99-19-107 (1980 Supp.) (\u201c[i]n the event the death penalty is held to be unconstitutional by the Mississippi Supreme Court or the United States Supreme Court, the court having jurisdiction over a person previously sentenced to death ... shall sentence such person to imprisonment for life, and such person shall not be eligible for work release or parole\u201d); Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 99-19-101(1) (1980 Supp.) (\u201c[i]f, through impossibility or inability, the trial jury is unable to reconvene for a hearing on the issue of penalty, having determined the guilt of the accused, the trial judge may summon a jury to determine the issue of the imposition of the penalty\u201d).

The Supreme Court refused to interfere (441 U.S. 916, 99 S.Ct. 2016, 60 L.Ed.2d 388). Chief District Judge Ready denied habeas corpus relief. Now, this Court marches Washington out of the gas chamber on the entirely untenable argument that the trial judge violated the federal constitution in his Instruction No. C-20 and that a jury <em>might </em>have considered Washington\u2019s irresponsible attitude toward the rules of society, and his violation of the law and his self-indulgent procreation of an illegitimate child as a <em>mitigating factor </em>in prescribing the penalty for- this inexcusable murder committed during the course of a callously planned robbery. With deference, I believe that the majority is bad wrong on both points.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-5\">\n<em>The Instruction was not Unconstitutionally Erroneous</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-6\">In the opening portion of the instruction the jury was told that it must <em>\u201cconsider the detailed circumstances of the offense for which the defendant was convicted and the defendant himself </em>(emphasis added).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-7\">Chief Judge Keady held that the state trial court had committed no error of a constitutional nature:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1439-8\">\u201cSpecifically, the jury was not precluded from considering all mitigating factors shown by the evidence, whether or not they were directly brought to the attention by the court\u2019s instruction C-20. It is to be noted that the court excluded no evidence which was offered in mitigation, and that instruction C-20, while it expressly required the jury to \u2018consider only\u2019 one or more of the two pertinent statutory aggravating circumstances before voting the death penalty, did not restrict the jury to considering <em>only </em>petitioner\u2019s lack of significant history of prior criminal activity and his age as mitigating circumstances. Moreover, this instruction was not objected to at trial, and under it the jury was free to consider all mitigating evidence which petitioner saw fit to offer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1439-9\">This instruction was not given until the juiy had heard every extenuating word offered on behalf of the defendant. None of it was excluded. The majority concedes that, indeed, every bit of it was argued to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-10\">Competent counsel did not object to the instruction or any part of it. It is obvious that everybody understood what the instruction meant and that the issue of mitigation was presented accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-11\">The majority concedes that the law requires that instructions be considered as a whole but nevertheless attempts to separately and individually parse the various parts of this instruction in isolation, all in the attempt to hoist the murderer out of the gas chamber on an invisible non-existent web.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-14\">I cannot agree to thwarting a death penalty in such a manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-16\">\n<em>There was no Mitigation in what the Majority Chooses to Assert \u201cMight Have Been\u201d Mitigating</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-17\">Since April 5, 1956, it has been legally impossible for a person to contract a common law marriage in Mississippi. Such marriages are <em>absolutely void.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>For over a hundred years it has been a violation of Mississippi law for individuals to unlawfully cohabit, whether in adultery or fornication.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Neither society nor Mississippi law has ever favored the procreation of illegitimate children by self-indulgent fathers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-18\">All this being so, I simply cannot understand how the majority holds that violating the law by living together in an illegal relationship and fathering an illegitimate daughter \u201cmight be\u201d a mitigating factor in a coldly planned robbery wherein the defendant chose to shoot the victim\u2019s entrails out and then coolly reloaded his shotgun as if he had done no more than kill a rabbit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-19\">The only sensible conclusion is that the jury of citizens believed that Washington had shown no more regard for human life than he had for the views of society or the laws to which he had theretofore paid no attention, including the law against the possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-20\">This is a sad day for Mississippi\u2019s efforts to adequately punish a fiendish murder. Indeed, it is a sad day for Mississippi\u2019s efforts to enforce any of the criminal laws for which it has exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-21\">I respectfully dissent and I am constrained to express the hope that the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>will seek en banc review of so much of this decision as voids the death penalty.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1439-12\">.
