Appellants, plaintiffs below, are four major oil companies that have challenged these regulations. Defendant-appel-lees are DOE and sixteen intervening public and private users and producers of petroleum substitutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-17\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court held, first, that regulations allocating domestic crude oil entitlements for use of petroleum substitutes are within DOE\u2019s statutory authority to allocate old oil under the Emergency Petroleum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>Allocation Act of 1973 (EPAA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 751-760h (1976), and, second, that the plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 attacks on the procedural validity of the regulations are without merit. App. 554. The summary judgment motions by DOE and the intervenors were granted; plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">The EPAA directs the President to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASX\">promulgate a regulation providing for the mandatory allocation of crude oil, residual fuel oil, and each refined petroleum product, in amounts specified in (or determined in a manner prescribed by) and at prices specified in (or determined in a manner prescribed by) such regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(a) (1976). The statute was passed by Congress \u201cto deal with the present or threatened severe economic hardships caused by shortages of imported and domestically produced crude oil, all of which constituted a \u2018national energy crisis\u2019 and a threat to the public health, safety, and welfare.\u201d <em>Pasco, Inc. v. FEA, </em>525 F.2d 1391, 1394 (Em.App.1975). Congress further directed that the power to allocate and to control the price of oil be \u201cexercised for the purpose of minimizing the adverse impacts of such shortages or dislocations on the American people and the domestic economy,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(b) (1976), and to further certain generally stated objectives. These objectives included</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-7\">(A) protection of public health .. . safety and welfare ... and the national defense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-8\">(B) maintenance of all public services (including facilities and services provided by municipally, cooperatively, or investor owned utilities or by any State or local government or authority ...);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-11\">(D) preservation of an economically sound and competitive petroleum industry; . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-12\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-13\">(F) equitable distribution of crude oil, residual fuel oil, and refined petroleum products at equitable prices among all regions and areas of the United States and sectors of the petroleum industry \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 &gt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-14\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-15\">(H) economic efficiency; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-16\">(I) minimization of economic distortion, inflexibility, and unnecessary interference with market mechanisms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-17\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 753(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-18\">Pursuant to this mandate, the Federal Energy Office (FEO) established price controls on certain kinds of domestic crude oil,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> setting up a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d price system for domestic crude oil. Imported crude oil and \u201cnew\u201d domestic crude oil, defined as oil from properties which were not producing in 1972 and increased production amounts from pre-1973 properties, were permitted to sell at free-market world prices. Old oil, on the other hand, was not. To insure that the benefits of access to this cheaper price-controlled old oil would be shared equitably, the Federal Energy Administration (FEA) adopted the entitlements program, by which it allocated old oil, without requiring its physical transfer, through the exchange of entitlements among refiners and other firms. 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 211.67 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-19\">Under the program, each refiner and other participants in the program are issued a number of entitlements representing their share of the available domestic, price-controlled old oil. Refiners having access to more than their share of old oil must purchase entitlements beyond their initial allocation from other participants in the program. By buying entitlements, refiners with access to more than their share of old oil surrender a portion of the economic ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>vantage conferred by that access. The broad effect of the entitlements program was to confer upon consumers the benefits of reduced prices with a minimum of economic dislocation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">However, the price and allocation system created adverse side effects. By artificially depressing the price of petroleum below world market levels, the program actually encouraged use of petroleum. And, since products made entirely from imported oil were priced as if they were made in part from cheaper price-controlled oil, the program encouraged importation of foreign oil and correspondingly discouraged substitution of otherwise competitive domestic fuels. Thus, the program fostered, rather than decreased, the Nation\u2019s dependence on imported oil. DOE, and FEA before it, viewed this economic distortion \u2014 created by its system of allocation and price controls\u2014 as contrary to the purpose of Congress in enacting the EPAA; to alleviate, to the maximum extent possible, American dependence on high-priced foreign crude oil. <em>See </em>42 Fed.Reg. 38599 (July 29, 1977); 44 Fed.Reg. 63515 (Nov. 5, 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">In the past, the agency has adjusted the entitlements program to reduce or eliminate economic incentives encouraging the use of foreign oil. Thus it has established special entitlements treatment for the use of California crude oil, see 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 211.-67(a)(4) (1980); 42 Fed.Reg. 62897 (Dec. 14, 1977); 43 Fed.Reg. 26540 (June 20, 1978), and crude oil from the Alaskan North Slope, see 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 211.67(b)(2) (1980); 42 Fed.Reg. 41565 (Aug. 17, 1977) as <em>amended </em>45 Fed.Reg. 46752 (July 10, 1980), to assure that refiners would have incentives to use these crudes instead of foreign oil. In 1975 FEA began to allocate entitlements to domestic refiners for processing \u201csynthetic\u201d oil derived from Canadian tar sands on the same basis as foreign crude oil. The agency made this adjustment without objection from the refining industry, even though such \u201csynthetic\u201d oil was itself not subject to allocation or price control by the agency. 10 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 211.67(a)(3) (1980); 40 Fed. Reg. 39847, 39848 (Aug. 29, 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-12\">\u2022 The regulations here challenged were promulgated on October 31 and November 12, 1979, 44 Fed.Reg. 63515 (Nov. 5, 1979); 44 Fed.Reg. 66183 (Nov. 19, 1979), pursuant to rulemaking proceedings commenced in May of that year. 44 Fed.Reg. 32225 (June 5, 1979). They provide for allocation of entitlements to users and producers of a variety of gaseous, liquid, and solid petroleum substitutes on the same basis as foreign crude oil. Specifically, the challenged regulations provide for allocation of entitlements for the use of oil shale crude oil, ethyl alcohol (when mixed with gasoline to make gasohol), municipal solid wastes used as boiler fuel, and methane derived from municipal sewage or landfills. In addition, the regulations provide a framework for DOE to decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether to allocate entitlements for the use of non-municipal solid wastes and liquid fuels derived from biomass, coal, and tar sands.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-13\">The challenged 1979 regulations, still effective, 10 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 211.62, 211.67(a)(5) (1980), purportedly supersede rules promulgated in May 1978, which were the result of a rulemaking proceeding commenced in July 1977. <em>See </em>43 Fed.Reg. 21429 (May 18, 1978). In the July notice of proposed rule-making, FEA proposed to allocate entitlements to refiners for the use of a synthetic liquid fuel oil shale crude oil, and asked interested persons to submit \u201ccomments as to whether any other domestically produced synthetic liquid fuels should be made eligible for inclusion in the entitlements program for the same reasons.\u201d 42 Fed.Reg. 38599, 38600 (July 29, 1977). All comments favored the proposed rule; and all comments addressing the issue, including the comment from appellant Atlantic Richfield Company, favored inclusion of other synthetic fuels in the program. App. 156-235.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>In the May 1978 rule that followed the July 1977 notice, DOE provided that entitlements would be allocated to refiners using shale oil as a feedstock or boiler fuel in a refinery on the same basis as imported crude oil. Additionally, the agency announced that it would decide later on a case-by-case basis whether the use of shale oil outside a refinery, and other synthetic liquid fuels made from biomass coal, solid waste materials, and tar sands would also earn allocations of entitlements. It is on this latter portion of the May 1978 rule that appellants base their procedural attack on the October and November 1979 regulations. They charge that the portion of the rule stating that DOE will later decide on a case-by-case basis whether synthetic liquid fuels other than shale oil are eligible for entitlements \u201cgrossly deviated\u201d from the July 1977 notice of proposed rulemaking, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551 <em>et seq. </em>(1976), the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 (FEAA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 761 <em>et seq. </em>(1976), and the Department of Energy Organization Act (DOEOA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7101 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp. Ill 1979), and that this defect, among others, infects all subsequent regulations governing entitlement allocation to synthetic fuels. As we have noted, however, in October and November 1979, DOE adopted the current regulations, which purportedly supersede the case-by-case portion of the 1978 rule; and DOE currently allocates all entitlements for the use of petroleum substitutes under the 1979 rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">In granting appellees\u2019 motions, the district court upheld the procedural validity of the regulations, and, on the merits, noted that, although the EPAA does not expressly permit DOE to grant entitlements benefits to producers of synthetic fuels, such benefits are <em>\u201cimpliedly </em>authorized by the Act.\u201d App. 569 (emphasis in original). The court held that the regulations merely extend the economic benefits of price-controlled old oil to producers of synthetic fuels and that, indeed, the EPAA mandate that DOE \u201cminimize economic distortion\u201d not only permits but actually may require that DOE allocate the economic benefits of old oil in such a fashion. <em>Id. </em>at 569-70. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-7\">Appellants argue that the EPAA was enacted to deal with the shortage of oil by allocation and price controls; it \u201cwas not intended to provide a comprehensive solution to all energy problems.\u201d Brief of Appellants at 10. By granting entitlements to producers of synthetic fuels, they contend, DOE is \u201cforcpng] a private company to subsidize the activities of other entities without express authorization.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. Thus, \u201cunless the EPAA authorizes the subsidization of the production of synthetic fuels, the regulations granting entitlements subsidies to producers of synthetic fuels are invalid.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-8\">To support their argument, appellants point to the following language from the conference report on the bill that was to become the EPAA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-9\">[T]his bill focuses on the short term objectives of seeing to it that during times of shortages our priority needs are met and that whatever limited supplies we have are equitably distributed throughout the nation to meet the regional needs and preserve competition in the marketplace.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASYm\">Conf.Rep.No.93-628, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1973] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2688, 2690-91. Appellants also suggest that FEA initially interpreted the EPAA as \u201cnot granting authority to deal with synthetic fuels.\u201d Brief of Appellants at 10. FEA documents are quoted stating, \u201c[T]he FEA has concluded that the Congress did not intend these [crude oil substitutes] to be regulated under the EPAA,\u201d 41 Fed.Reg. 25886 (June 23, 1976), <em>quoted in </em>Brief of Appellants at 10, and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ade-dedup-0\">the FEA\u2019s authority and mandate to preserve and foster competition in the refining industry and to encourage new refining capacity is limited to the context of a price and allocation program, and does not allow the agency to go outside that context to create a subsidization program for new refiners no matter how laudable the purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>Letter to Charles Wallace from Frank G. Zarb, Administrator of FEA (May 21, 1976) (rejecting bid for entitlements by company building new refinery).</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">Additionally, appellants argue that recent legislation providing for encouragement of synthetic fuel production \u2014 e. <em>g., </em>the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980, Pub.L. No.96-223, \u00a7\u00a7 231, 232, 94 Stat. 229 (1980) (providing tax credit for domestic production of energy from alternative sources, such as oil from shale, oil from tar sands, natural gas from geopressured brine, coal seams or Devonian shale, liquid gaseous or solid synthetic fuel from coal liquefaction or gasification facilities, gas from biomass, steam from solid agricultural by-products and qualifying processed solid wood fuels), and the Energy Security Act, Pub.L.No.96-294, 94 Stat. 611 (1980) (enabling Synthetic Fuels Corporation to offer loans, etc., to subsidize private synthetic fuels industries) \u2014suggests that the EPAA was not intended to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-6\">Finally, appellants cite the recent decision by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <em>Office of Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>v. <em>FERC, </em>655 F.2d 1132 (D.C.Cir., 1980), for the simple proposition that statutory authority cannot be implied to further a goal not authorized by Congress. Brief of Appellants at 15. This, though, simply begs the question \u2014 is DOE authorized under the EPAA to extend the entitlements program to producers of synthetic fuels?<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-7\">DOE\u2019s position is that it is authorized under the EPAA to allocate price-controlled old oil, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(a) (1976), and to enact regulations furthering the purposes of the Act, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 753(b)(1). Thus, the agency argues, \u201c[i]n allocating crude oil entitlements for the use of petroleum substitutes, DOE has simply exercised its authority to allocate price-controlled crude oil... . The regulations at issue here do not allocate, impose price controls on, or otherwise exercise regulatory authority over petroleum substitutes: the product allocated is price-controlled crude oil, a product expressly subject to DOE\u2019s regulatory power.\u201d Brief of Appellees at 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-10\">Appellees argue that the EPAA mandates that DOE promulgate and adjust regulations to achieve certain broadly stated objectives, among them \u201cminimization of economic distortions\u201d and \u201cunnecessary interference with market mechanisms,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(b)(l)(I) (1976), and \u2014 as appellants concede \u2014 \u201cto alleviate, to the maximum extent possible, American dependence on extremely high priced imported crude oil.\u201d Complaint K 9, <em>reprinted in </em>App. at 6. After Congress set up the two-tier pricing system for domestic and imported crude oil during the Arab oil embargo, DOE found that certain dislocations were being caused by the two-tier system itself: Some refiners and some sectors of the economy had unequal access to price-controlled old oil; others were more dependent on higher-priced imported oil. The original entitlements program was promulgated to correct this situation. By spreading the advantage of access to old oil among all refiners, the program allowed virtually all oil sold in the United States to be priced as though it had been produced in part from old oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-11\">The original entitlements regulations, however, produced dislocations of their own: Because the program had the effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>of \u201cequalizing\u201d the cost of imported oil below world market price levels, it was actually encouraging importation and use of foreign oil while at the same time putting producers of synthetic alternatives to crude oil at a disadvantage. DOE describes the regulations at issue here \u2014 assigning entitlements to producers of synfuels \u2014 as \u201can ingenious solution,\u201d Brief of Appellees at 8, designed to \u201cminimize the disincentives\u201d to the use of synfuels that were attributable to the original entitlements regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">Essentially, appellants\u2019 major complaint is that allocation of entitlements for the use of petroleum substitutes \u201crequire[s] private companies to subsidize producers of synthetic fuels.\u201d Brief of Appellants at 7. Appellees, of course, deny the entitlements program constitutes subsidization, although statements such as, \u201c[tjhese regulations ... do not and were not intended to promote affirmatively the development of the synthetic fuel industry,\u201d Brief of Appellees at 15, have a hollow ring. Indeed, in the same breath, appellees admit that the regulations \u201cpromote the use of petroleum substitutes only in the limited respect of removing the competitive disadvantage suffered by such products (in relation to cost-equalized petroleum) as a direct result of the pre-existing regulatory program.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">It seems clear that, to some extent, the regulations do provide for subsidization of synfuels. But, as the district court found, \u201cThis characterization simply ignores the fact that even though many regulatory</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-12\">programs impose economic burdens, they are not invalid merely because there are some who are dissatisfied with the placement of the burdens or the flow of the \u2018subsidies.\u2019 \u201d App. at 575. Moreover, the subsidy aspect of the entitlements program has been disposed of by the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals on prior occasions, and this court has concluded that allocation of the economic advantage of old oil does not constitute an impermissible subsidy. <em>See Pasco v. FEA, </em>525 F.2d 1391, 1399-1402 (Em.App.1975) (challenge to original program); <em>Condor Operating Co. v. Sawhiii, </em>514 F.2d 351, 361-62 (Em.App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 976, 95 S.Ct. 1975, 44 L.Ed.2d 467 (1975).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-13\">Thus, to the extent the regulations force a subsidy, it is a permissible one, consistent with the purposes of the EPAA. And any regulation of the synfuel industry is minimal, plainly within the EPAA\u2019s mandate to \u201cminimiz[e] economic distortions.\u201d Indeed, it is worth noting that, while appellants insist that Congress in enacting the Energy Security Act, Pub.L.No.96-294, 94 Stat. 611 (1980), and the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980, Pub.L.No.96-223, 94 Stat. 229 (1980), must have intended to limit the field of synfuel regulations to mechanisms contained in those two pieces of legislation, it is clear that (1) Congress was aware of the existence of the DOE regulations challenged here, <em>see </em>Report of Senate Comm, on Finance, Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980, S.Rep.No.394, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 90-91 (1979), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>News 1980, p. 410, and (2) neither piece of legislation purports to limit the entitlements program as presently constituted. As appellees point out, \u201c[i]t would be ironic in the extreme if DOE were held to lack authority to make adjustments in its petroleum regulations that do no more than minimize the adverse effect those regulations have on the very problem Congress directed DOE to resolve.\u201d Brief of Appellees at 20.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">Appellants charge that the final rule adopted by DOE in May 1978 \u201cgrossly deviated\u201d from the notice of proposed rulemak-ing published by FEA in July 1977, thereby contravening the APA, FEAA, and DOEOA. The July 1977 notice proposed \u201cto amend the domestic crude oil allocation program (the \u2018entitlements\u2019 program) so as to permit refiners to include in their crude oil runs to stills (and thereby earn entitlements for) those volumes of synthetic crude oil processed from oil shale found within the United States that they utilize as a refinery feedstock.\u201d 42 Fed.Reg. 38599 (July 29, 1977), <em>reprinted in </em>App. at 163.

Similar arguments were rejected in <em>Cities Service v.

I feel constrained, however, to dissent from Part II, which sustains the district court\u2019s holding that regulations allocating domestic crude oil entitlements for use of petroleum substitutes (synthetic fuels) are within DOE\u2019s statutory authority to allocate old oil under the EPAA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 751-760h (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-8\">The EPAA did not vest express authority in the Department of Energy or its predecessors to regulate synthetic fuels or crude oil substitutes as part of the petroleum allocation and pricing program. Indeed, defendants concede that DOE is without such regulatory authority. Nor can it be reasonably contended in view of the express provision of the Act, its legislative history and the prior decisions of this court, that any implied authority was granted to DOE or its predecessors to indirectly regulate the synfuels industry any more than any other industry involving other non-petroleum products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-11\">The doctrine of implied powers rests upon unexpressed authority necessary or convenient for the exercise of authority expressly granted. As we said in <em>Marathon Oil Co. v. FEA, </em>547 F.2d 1140, 1145 (Em.App.1976), the agency has those powers \u201cnecessarily implied for the exercise of the authority expressly granted over the allocation and pricing of petroleum products or oil.\u201d In <em>Mobil Oil Corp. v. Federal Energy Administration, </em>566 F.2d 87, 93 (Em.App.1977), this court declared that Congress intended to confer authority that was \u201cimperative for the achievement of an agency\u2019s ultimate purpose.\u201d In <em>NAACP v. FPC, </em>425 U.S. 662, 96 S.Ct. 1806, 48 L.Ed.2d 284 (1976), the Supreme Court held that the FPC had no authority to prohibit its regulatees from engaging in discriminatory practices except insofar as these affected the establishment of rates. The Court noted that the \u201cpublic interest\u201d language in the empowering statute was too vague a basis upon which to imply such broader authority. The general \u201cwords take meaning from the purposes of the regulatory legislation,\u201d which were in that case to regulate electricity and natural gas prices. 425 U.S. at 669-70, 96 S.Ct. at 1811-1812. <em>See also FCC v. Midwest Video Corp., </em>440 U.S. 689, 99 S.Ct. 1435, 59 L.Ed.2d 692 (1979). <em>Cf. United States v. Midwest Video Corp., </em>406 U.S. 649, 664, 92 S.Ct. 1860, 1869, 32 L.Ed.2d 390 (1972), where it was stated in upholding certain agency authority that \u201cavoidance of adverse effects is itself the furtherance of statutory policies,\u201d that statement being made, however, in connection with recogni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>tion of jurisdiction on the part of the Commission over CATV transmissions and with reference to the exercise of that authority, <em>id. </em>at 663-64, 92 S.Ct. at 1868-1869, and not concerning an industry not the object of regulatory powers on the part of the agency, as here. Here, the purported justification for allocations of entitlements to members of the synfuels industry does not relate to any authority to regulate that industry but instead rests upon the claimed lessening of the impact of the regulations upon an industry over which it has not been granted regulatory authority. I find the position of DOE as quoted in the majority opinion internally inconsistent, at times a mere play on words, and essentially unsatisfactory (and the majority opinion is somewhat unclear as to what part of this position it has embraced):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-4\">In allocating crude oil entitlements for the use of petroleum substitutes, DOE has simply exercised its authority to allocate price-controlled crude oil.... The regulations at issue here do not allocate, impose price controls on, or otherwise exercise regulatory authority over petroleum substitutes: the product allocated is price-controlled crude oil, a product expressly subject to DOE\u2019s regulatory power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">Moreover, there is here an implicit concession tending to compromise the validity of the claimed authority. If DOE has no regulatory authority over petroleum substitutes, can it accomplish such regulation under the guise of regulating crude oil? If the device for conferring benefits created as part of its authority to regulate crude oil is used to subsidize an industry over which it has no regulatory power and as to which the \u201centitlements\u201d are entirely out of context and cannot be used except as a cash equivalent, would such subsidy be any less justifiable if cash were directly awarded by DOE? Could such an extension of the entitlements program to synthetic fuels properly render the extension a part of a legitimate system for the regulation of crude oil?</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">It seems confusing for the majority opinion to cite <em>Pasco, Inc. v. Federal Energy Administration, </em>525 F.2d 1391 (Em.App. 1975), and <em>Condor Operating Company v. Sawhill, </em>514 F.2d 351 (Em.App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 976, 95 S.Ct. 1975, 44 L.Ed.2d 467 (1975). Those cases held that as part of the allocation authority expressly granted by the EPAA the allocation of economic advantage of old oil through the entitlements program within the petroleum industry does not constitute an impermissible subsidy. This proposition does not support this court\u2019s conclusion that to the extent \u201cthe regulations force a subsidy, it is a permissible one, consistent with the purposes of the EPAA.\u201d Those earlier cases prove only that insofar as DOE\u2019s entitlements regulations require certain crude oil refiners to subsidize certain other crude oil refiners, the regulations do not establish an impermissible subsidy. It does not necessarily follow that other industries not covered by the EPAA can be added to the same program and as to them also the subsidy becomes permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-7\">The open-ended nature of the purported authority in view of the reasons recited in its support is indeed sweeping. If such subsidies can be granted by DOE to industries over which it has been granted no regulatory power merely because this would help achieve some of the broadly stated objectives of the EPAA (e. g., the \u201cminimization of economic distortions\u201d and the avoidance of \u201cunnecessary interference with market mechanisms\u201d), any other industry, whether or not directly involving substitutes for petroleum, could be subsidized through crude oil \u201centitlements\u201d for they too could be shown to be the victims of \u201ceconomic distortions\u201d or \u201cinterference with market mechanisms\u201d occasioned by DOE\u2019s allocation program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-8\">The broad statements of objectives set out in the EPAA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(b)(l)(I) (1976), in my opinion, were intended to guide the agency in the exercise of powers expressly or impliedly granted to it by the Act, not to grant sweeping additional au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>thority of the kind approved by the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">That there is no overpowering public interest commending such an expansive interpretation of DOE\u2019s powers is indicated by its recent proposal to virtually abandon the \u201cstandards and criteria governing the qualification of alternate fuels as petroleum substitutes under the case-by-case determination\u201d because, among other reasons, they \u201chave not best furthered the purposes of the EPAA.\u201d Notice of Proposed Rulemak-ing and Public Hearing, 46 F.R. 19450, 19451 (Mar. 30, 1981).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
