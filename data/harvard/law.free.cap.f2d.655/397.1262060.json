Machinists Non-Partisan Political League, </em>No. 80-1136, 655 F.2d 380, which we decide today. Respondent here is one of the so-called \u201cdraft-Kennedy\u201d groups which in 1979 allegedly received contributions in violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a)(l)(C), (2)(C). <em>See also </em>2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(f) (\u201cNo ... political committee shall <em>knowingly </em>accept any contribution ... in violation of the provisions of this section. No officer or employee of a political committee shall <em>knowingly </em>accept a contribution <em>made for the benefit or use of a candidate </em>... in violation of ... this section\u201d) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">For the reasons stated in our opinion in No. 80-1136, we hold that the Commission has no jurisdiction over allegations that this respondent received contributions for its \u201cdraft-Kennedy\u201d effort in excess of some supposed statutory limit. The subpoena issued to respondent by the Commission was therefore outside the scope of the Commission\u2019s investigative powers, and thus the district court\u2019s enforcement order must be vacated. This case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with our opinion in No. 80-1136.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
