There is no charge of any attempted <em>ex parte </em>communication in the instant case, nor is there evidence of any. Nevertheless, because of the co-pending status of the two actions, and the appearance of potential bias and prejudice,</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-23\">IT IS ORDERED that plaintiff\u2019s motion is granted to the extent that the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>of the court, dated December 17, 1980, is vacated. The case is remanded to the trial division of this court for a de novo determination and report by a trial judge, based on a preponderance of the evidence in the existing administrative record.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
