According to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(a)(4)(B), Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT), a preventive health program for children, must be provided by each state participating in the federal Medicaid program.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>In March 1974, the district court enjoined the defendants from continuing to administer their program in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(a)(4)(B) and the regulations and guidelines thereunder. The defendants were ordered to implement a satisfactory EPSDT program in accordance with federal law. We affirmed that judgment noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnS\">The mandatory obligation upon each participating state to aggressively notify, seek out and screen persons under 21 in order to detect health problems and to pursue those problems with the needed treatment is made unambiguously clear by the 1967 act and by the interpretative regulations and guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">504 F.2d 1246, 1251 (7th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Indiana submitted its proposed plan in March 1975, and in August 1976, the district court found that Indiana\u2019s EPSDT program was in compliance. After the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend the judgment was denied in May 1980, plaintiffs filed this appeal. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">The thrust of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that Indiana still fails to recognize the extent to which Congress in enacting EPSDT imposed additional responsibilities on the states which had not been required under the regular Medicaid program. In our prior opinion, we quoted and endorsed the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) 1973 regulation guidelines for EPSDT, issued as part of the Medical Assistance Manual, Part 5, Sections 5-70-00 <em>et seq. </em>(MSA-PRG \u2014 21), which state: \u201cCongress intended to require States to take aggressive steps to screen, diagnosis and treat children with health problems.\u201d MSA \u2014 PRG\u201421, \u00a7 5-70-20(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">A penalty of one percent of the amount payable by the Government to a state can be assessed for failure to provide the required services. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 603(g). The penalty is imposed if a state fails to inform families of the health screening services, provide or arrange for screening where requested, or arrange for corrective treatment in response to the results of the screening. We previously noted that the failure of the federal administrative agency to assess a penalty did not preclude our court from ordering declaratory and injunc-tive relief. 504 F.2d at 1251.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-13\">In our prior opinion, we considered the extent of Indiana\u2019s 1974 EPSDT program and found that it was inadequate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-14\">[Ljetters were sent to Medicaid recipients which advised that caseworkers would visit the recipient and that \u201cthe caseworkers will want to know if you feel that your children have any health problems.\u201d Medicaid providers were advised that caseworkers would give each recipient a form \u201cwith instructions to contact their choice of appropriate Medicaid providers, should a health problem be reported by the recipient, observed by the caseworker, or should the recipient request any type of medical service . . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-15\">504 F.2d at 1250. We noted that the defendants themselves had summarized the nature of Indiana\u2019s compliance as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqYA\">Any of the eligible children in this state can secure all of the requested services merely by requesting them from their local health provider .... [Recipients] need merely take their children to the health provider of their choice and obtain for their children the required services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-16\">504 F.2d at 1250-51 (quoting from the defendants\u2019 reply brief). In sum, we stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>that Indiana\u2019s \u201csomewhat casual approach\u201d to EPSDT did not conform to the aggressive search for early detection and treatment of child health problems mandated by the 1967 statute and its interpretative regulations and guidelines. 504 F.2d at 1251. The question before us is whether the district judge was clearly erroneous in finding that Indiana\u2019s EPSDT program was in compliance in 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The plaintiffs allege that the program was and is deficient in three major and overlapping respects: failure to define a \u201cscreening package\u201d or conduct \u201cscreens\u201d; failure to identify Medicaid providers willing to perform screens; and failure to monitor screening and the required subsequent diagnosis and treatment where indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">A. Screens</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">It is not disputed that Indiana\u2019s 1976 screening plan required screening for general physical and mental defects, dental care and disease, and vision and hearing problems. The plaintiffs argue, however, that a more comprehensive approach was envisioned by Congress as set out in the HEW regulation guidelines which this court found to describe \u201cwhat is required in the nature of case finding, screening, diagnosis and treatment,\u201d 504 F.2d at 1249. Those guidelines specified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-8\">At a minimum screening should include: a health and developmental history (physical and mental); an assessment of physical growth; developmental assessment; inspection for obvious physical defects; ear, nose, mouth and throat inspection (including inspection of teeth and gums); screening tests for cardiac abnormalities, anemia, sickle cell trait, lead poisoning, tuberculosis, diabetes, infections and other urinary tract conditions; and assessment of nutritional status and immunization status. An assessment of this nature is necessary to identify individuals with potential or apparent physical or mental health and developmental problems requiring diagnosis and, possibly, treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-20\">MSA-PRG-21, \u00a7 5-70-20(B)(l).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-21\">We agree with the plaintiffs that Indiana did not define the contents of its screening package with enough specificity to ensure that needy children in Indiana receive the thorough health screening intended by Congress. In so holding, we do not require that Indiana comply to the letter with every HEW guideline. We are of the view, however, that those guidelines well express the spirit of the statute in terms of the breadth of the screen intended. The special emphasis placed by Congress on a large scale preventive screening and treatment program indicates that Congress believed this health program would produce meaningful results. Without a thorough screening, including for example appropriate laboratory tests and a nutritional assessment, two diseases known to be among the leading health problems of poor children \u2014 malnutrition and lead poisoning \u2014 may well go undetected or unprevented.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-22\">General physical examinations may of course include all of the necessary features. Indiana, however, by requiring only a general physical examination (even with tests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>for vision, hearing, and dental or mental problems) leaves it to the provider to decide what services to perform.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus Indiana cannot \u201cassure that screening ... will be available to all eligible individuals under 21 years of age,\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 249.10(a)(3)(iv) (1975), or that the services are \u201csufficient in amount, duration and scope to reasonably achieve their purpose.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 249.-10(a)(5)(i) (1975).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">B. Medical Providers</p>\n<p id=\"A6o\">Indiana has not discerned which Medicaid providers are willing and able to provide screens. Instead it is assumed that all medical providers can and will provide the necessary service. Defendant Wayne Stanton, Administrator of the Indiana Department of Public Welfare, conceded that no Medicaid providers have explicitly agreed to do EPSDT screening. Although the defendants contend that caseworkers sometimes aid recipients in choosing an appropriate provider, the record shows that recipients may simply be handed a general list of Medicaid providers who have never themselves been assessed for the ability or willingness to perform complete screens.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Pursuant to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.146(c)(ii) (1975), a state must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-6\">[p]rovide or arrange for the provision of such screening services in all cases where they are requested. This means that a State must:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-7\">(A) Inform recipients requesting screening services of the names and locations of providers <em>offering such services....</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">(emphasis added) For that reason, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 249.10(a)(3)(i) requires the \u201cestablishment of administrative mechanisms <em>to identify </em>available screening and diagnostic resources .. .. \u201d (emphasis added)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendants have not complied with those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-14\">C. Monitoring for Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment</p>\n<p id=\"b830-15\">Indiana has no way of knowing whether a child has received a complete screen. The record indicates that statistics are collected only on the basis of responses given on the \u201cMedicaid Request for Payment\u201d form submitted by Medicaid providers. Though question 33 on that form asks, \u201cWas an examination performed for the EPSDT program?\u201d, it does not ask whether a complete screen was performed. An affirmative response is counted as a screen. Question 35 asks, \u201cAs a result of the screening, was further diagnosis and/or treatment required?\u201d and an affirmative answer is also counted as a screen. Even if the answer is negative to both those questions, a \u201cscreen\u201d is counted if the Medicaid provider bills for performing a physical, mental, eye or ear examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-16\">Besides not knowing whether complete screens are being performed, the defendants are not in compliance with the statutory mandate to provide \u201csuch health care, treatment and other measures to correct or ameliorate defects and chronic conditions discovered [from the screening],' as may be provided in regulations of the Secretary.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(a)(4)(B). Pursuant to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.146(c)(iii) (1975), a state must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGm\">[a]rrange for (directly or through referral to appropriate agencies, organizations, or individuals) corrective treatment the need for which is indicated by such screening services.... <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>Regulation 249.10(a)(3)(iv) (1975) mandates that \u201ctreatment of conditions discovered . . . <em>will </em>be available to all eligible individuals . . . . \u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">This court has already recognized the mandatory obligation upon each state to pursue problems detected through screening with the necessary treatment. 504 F.2d at 1250. A failure to implement the treatment aspect of EPSDT unquestionably results in a failure of the entire program. Detection alone is meaningless without the appropriate follow-up.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">For that reason, \u201c[p]rompt transmittal of the results of the screening procedures is necessary so that diagnostic studies and treatment can be instituted without delay.\u201d MSA-PRG-21, 5-70-20(B)(8). By regulation, a state must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-7\">[t]ake steps to assist recipients needing diagnostic and treatment services so that such recipients are able to receive them within a reasonable time period. Initial diagnosis and treatment must be available normally within 60 days of the screening.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">45 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.146(c)(l)(iii)(B). To avoid a penalty, the state must be able to document compliance with these conditions and \u201cshall provide reports thereon as prescribed in this regulation and in Program Regulation Guides and Program Instructions issued by [HEW].\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.146(c)(3). A regulation guideline on the subject of providing or arranging for corrective treatment states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-9\">The report must describe the arrangements made to assist eligible individuals in obtaining treatment, with supporting documentation in the form of State regulations, staff instructions, provider manuals, or written provider agreements, and describe procedures for identification of individuals needing treatment services under EPSDT who did not receive such services, for purposes of (i) assisting them in receiving such service within a reasonable time normally not to exceed 60 days and (ii) demonstrating that State action or inaction is not the cause of such failure to receive services within 60 days of screening date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-13\">MSA \u2014 PRG-32, \u00a7 5-70-30A(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-14\">We have been able to discern no evidence of a form or other means of required or consistent feedback from the Medicaid provider who performs the screen back to the caseworker handling that recipient\u2019s file. In her deposition, Sherry Tollefson, Indiana Department of Public Welfare Supervisor of Program Administration, conceded that there was no such system. Moreover, as noted earlier, data collected on who was screened comes from the \u201cMedicaid Request for Payment\u201d form which can be returned up to twelve months after the screen is performed \u2014 hardly sufficient to assure that needed treatment is actually received within sixty days. It appears that the defendants rely on the providers to perform the treatment or refer the patients, or on the recipient to request help from the caseworker. In our view, the statute requires more. The state must assure that arrangements are made for treating detected health problems.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Without feedback from the Medicaid provider who performs the screen, the caseworker cannot know who needs treatment and who is getting it. Monitoring of this aspect of the program is mandatory in order to prevent future health problems as Congress intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-15\">In short, we conclude that Indiana has still not complied with this court\u2019s mandate that \u201cEPSDT programs must be brought to the recipients.\u201d 504 F.2d at 1251. As we read 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(aX4)(B) and its regulations and guidelines, Indiana cannot assure that it provides a screen sufficiently comprehensive for the purpose intended or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>that it pursues those health problems detected with the necessary treatment. In our view, the defendants have relied too heavily on their previous Medicaid program and have failed to comply with federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">We therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In deciding this case, we have relied on the regulations and guidelines in effect at the time the district judge entered his order in August 1976. Since that time, more detailed regulations have been issued. Because nearly five years have elapsed between the 1976 judgment and the issuance of this opinion, and in the interest of both justice and judicial economy, the district judge on remand should assess Indiana\u2019s resubmitted plan according to currently applicable federal law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b827-5\">. In 1967 Congress amended Title XIX of the Social Security Act to require that each State operating a medical assistance- plan receiving federal financial assistance furnish:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqz-dedup-0\">early and periodic screening and diagnosis of individuals who are eligible under the plan and are under the age of 21 to ascertain their physical or mental defects and such health care, treatment and other measures to cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>rect or ameliorate defects and chronic conditions discovered thereby, as may be provided in regulations of the Secretary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(a)(4)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b828-10\">.

At oral argument defendants\u2019 counsel stated that Indiana now defines a screening package that \u201cword-for-word\u201d tracks the language of the above provision. We have been unable to find that information in the record, but if that change has occurred, Indiana is in compliance insofar as defining for its providers the contents of a screening package.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b830-9\">. The guidelines require that a \u201cscreening package\u201d be defined by the state to insure compliance by Medicaid providers with regulations.

We cannot say on what basis the district judge concluded that Indiana\u2019s program was in compliance because he set out no findings of fact. He did note, however, a June 1976 regional HEW audit which found that Indiana\u2019s EPSDT program met the requirements of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.146(c) and recommended that no penalty be assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">In September 1976, however, after the regional audit was reviewed by the national office, HEW Commissioner Keith Weikel informed Regional Commissioner Clyde Downing: \u201c[W]e have reviewed the above reports and have identified penalty issues in each of the quarters in question. We have referred the reports to the office of General Counsel for opinion... . \u201d Beatrice Moore, Director of the Division of EPSDT, wrote to the Assistant General Counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-8\">A review has been made of the [regional audit] ... We do not concur with the Regional Office\u2019s assessment that the State was in compliance with the penalty regulation. The report indicated obvious penalty liability under 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.146(c) of treatment arrangements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">Finally, in April 1977, the Office of the General Counsel issued its report entitled \u201cIndiana EPSDT Penalty Report \u2014 Second and Third Quarter FY 1976\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-18\">On the basis of a review conducted by the Regional Staff, MSA has concluded that the one percent penalty authorized by section 403(g) of the Social Security Act be assessed against Indiana for its failure to comply with pertinent requirements for treating eligible children.

The defendants point out that the record con-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APFC\">tains no official HEW document showing that Indiana was actually assessed a penalty for the period in 1976 up to and including August 1976. We respond by noting first our prior holding that injunctive relief can issue without an administrative penalty, 504 F.2d at 1251, and second Justice Douglas\u2019s statement in <em>Rosado v.
