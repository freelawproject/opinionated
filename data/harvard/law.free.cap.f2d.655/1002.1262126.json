Casey, its president and sole stockholder, appeal the district court\u2019s entry of adverse summary judgment in their suit against the United States of America, the Secretary of the Interior, the California Director of the Bureau of Land Management, and the Nevada Director of the Bureau of Land Management. <em>See Holland Livestock Ranch, </em>39 I.B.L.A. 272 (1979). The plaintiffs sought to overturn various administrative-level determinations of willful trespass on federal lands which resulted in reduction and revocation of certain grazing privileges under the Taylor Grazing Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 315 to 315o-l (1976). Plaintiffs contest the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1976). Jurisdiction on appeal is based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-12\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-13\">John J. Casey, controlling owner of Holland Livestock Ranch, held grazing permits from the Bureau of Land Management for the Susanville (California) and Winnemucca (Nevada) grazing districts. Using planning unit maps and United States Geological Survey topographical maps where available, Bureau of Land Management employees determined that Casey\u2019s cattle were trespassing on public land. In addition, his cattle were sighted upon private, unfenced land with unrestricted access to adjoining public lands. The Bureau issued numerous trespass notices to Casey and, when he refused to remove them from public lands on which they were not entitled to graze, impounded several of his cattle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-14\">The Bureau initiated two separate administrative proceedings against Casey. In No. 2-75-2, involving fifteen alleged trespasses in the Susanville district and ten alleged trespasses in the Winnemucca district, the administrative law judge reduced Casey\u2019s grazing privileges in both districts by 40% and assessed trespass damages. In No. 2-77-1, involving three trespasses in the Su-sanville district, the administrative law judge revoked Casey\u2019s grazing privileges in that district and assessed damages. In a consolidated appeal, the Interior Board of Land Appeals affirmed the total revocation of the Susanville grazing privileges and the 40% reduction of the Winnemucca grazing privileges and modified the damage computations in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-15\">Casey filed suit in the district court seeking to set aside the Interior Board of Land Appeals decision. On cross-motions for summary judgment and after hearing, the district court granted the government\u2019s mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>tion and entered judgment for the government. Casey appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">Under section 3 of the Taylor Grazing Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 315b (1976), the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to issue permits to graze livestock on federal grazing districts to settlers, residents, and other stock owners. Grazing permits may be reduced or revoked by the Secretary in certain prescribed circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-7\">A grazing license or permit may be suspended, reduced, or revoked, or renewal thereof denied for a clearly established violation of the terms or conditions of the license or permit, or for a violation of the act or of any of the provisions of this part, or of any approved special rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdN\">43 C.F.R. \u00a7 9239.3-2 (1977); <em>accord, Diamond Ring Ranch, Inc. v. Morton, </em>531 F.2d 1397, 1402-03 (10th Cir. 1976). <em>See also </em>43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1752(a) (Supp. III 1979). As against the United States, a permittee can acquire no right or interest in the federal grazing lands.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-8\">So far as consistent with the purposes and provisions of this subchapter, grazing privileges recognized and acknowledged shall be adequately safeguarded, but . . . the issuance of a permit pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter shall not create any right, title, interest, or estate in or to the lands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">43 U.S.C. \u00a7 315b (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-10\">Grazing trespasses appear to be the most common violation resulting in administrative reduction or revocation of grazing permits. A grazing trespass exists when livestock are grazed on federal public land in excess of authorized permit use or without an appropriate permit or license. <em>Eldon Brinkerhoff, </em>24 I.B.L.A. 324 (1976); <em>Eldon L. Smith, </em>8 I.B.L.A. 86 (1972). The Interior Board of Land Appeals has administratively</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-11\">limited severe reductions of a licensee\u2019s or permittee\u2019s grazing privileges to cases involving the following elements: (1) the trespasses were both willful and repeated; (2) they involved fairly large numbers of animals; (3) they occurred over a fairly long period of time; and (4) they often involved a failure to take prompt remedial action upon notification of the trespass.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1065-14\"><em>Eldon Brinkerhoff, </em>24 I.B.L.A. 324, 337 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-15\">Casey contends that access trespass, by definition, is an insufficient basis to establish trespass when the result of that trespass is the revocation and reduction of grazing permits. Access trespass is presumed when cattle are found upon unfeneed private land contiguous to restricted public land. This assumption is based on the principle that \u201cas the boundaries between the federal range and private lands [are] of a legal rather than a physical nature it strains credulity to believe that the animals grazing would respect the same.\u201d <em>Midland Livestock Co., </em>10 I.B.L.A. 389, 402 (1973). The United States contends that access trespasses, together with evidence of actual trespasses, provided substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s decision. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-16\">The finding of trespass is adequately supported by evidence of actual trespasses. Nonetheless, we must decide whether the access trespass theory is valid, since the Board relied on that theory in computing damages. Had it not done so, its damage \u2022figure would have been smaller.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-17\">Administrative agencies are entitled to create evidentiary presumptions. <em>See NLRB v. Baptist Hospital, Inc., </em>442 U.S. 773, 789, 99 S.Ct. 2598, 2607, 61 L.Ed.2d 251 (1979); <em>Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, </em>324 U.S. 793, 800, 65 S.Ct. 982, 986, 89 L.Ed. 1372 (1945). These presumptions are \u201ctraditionally accorded considerable deference.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Baptist Hospital, Inc., </em>442 U.S. at 796, 99 S.Ct. at 2611 (Bren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>nan, J., concurring); <em>NLRB v. Los Angeles New Hospital, </em>640 F.2d 1017, 1020 (9th Cir. 1981); <em>see NLRB v. Local 103, International Association of Iron Workers, </em>434 U.S. 335, 350, 98 S.Ct. 651, 660, 54 L.Ed.2d 586 (1978). The validity of such a presumption depends, in a varying degree, \u201cupon the rationality between what is proved and what is inferred.\u201d <em>Beth Israel Hospital v. NLRB, </em>437 U.S. 483, 493, 98 S.Ct. 2463, 2469, 57 L.Ed.2d 370 (1978) (quoting <em>Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, </em>324 U.S. at 805, 65 S.Ct. at 988). The presumption may be based upon policy as well as probability. <em>NLRB v. Silver Spur Casino, </em>623 F.2d 571, 578 (9th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 1973, 68 L.Ed.2d 294 (1981); <em>NLRB v. Tahoe Nugget, Inc., </em>584 F.2d 293, 303-04 (9th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 921, 99 S.Ct. 2847, 61 L.Ed.2d 290 (1979). The usefulness of a presumption is also a factor to be considered in assessing its validity. <em>NLRB v. Baptist Hospital, Inc., </em>442 U.S. at 789-90, 99 S.Ct. at 2607-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">The presumption at issue rationally infers that livestock with unrestricted access to contiguous public lands will use that access. The inference is supported by evidence that the stock has previously made use of the access. Without the presumption, proving the existence of every trespass by livestock onto public land would be extremely difficult, if not impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">Under the facts here, we need not decide whether unrestricted access will always give rise to a presumption of trespass. But where, as here, there is evidence of actual trespasses in addition to unrestricted access, the Interior Board of Land Appeals may raise a rebuttable presumption of trespass based upon the existence of unrestricted access.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-9\">Casey also argues that the access trespass doctrine is inadequate to show damages. We disagree. Once injury has been proven, the fact that damages are not susceptible to precise measurement does not preclude recovery. <em>E. g., Kissell Co. v. Gressley, </em>591 F.2d 47, 50 (9th Cir. 1979); <em>James </em>v. <em>United States, </em>483 F.Supp. 581, 487 (N.D.Cal.1980) (California law); C. McCormick, <em>Damages </em>\u00a7 27, at 101 (1935). In such cases, the factfinder is allowed to make a reasonable inference of damages from the facts adduced, e. <em>g., Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., </em>282 U.S. 555, 562-63, 51 S.Ct. 248, 250-51, 75 L.Ed. 544 (1931) (tortfeasor\u2019s wrongdoing prevented accurate assessment of damages); <em>Perma Research &amp; Development v. Singer Co., </em>542 F.2d 111, 116 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 987, 97 S.Ct. 507, 50 L.Ed.2d 598 (1976), so long as the damages are not based on speculation or guess, <em>e. g., PSG Co. v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>417 F.2d 659, 663 (9th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 918, 90 S.Ct. 924, 25 L.Ed.2d 99 (1970); C. McCormick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 26, at 99. We find no error in the use of access trespass as a reasonable inference for the computation of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-13\">Casey also contends that the evidence of his willfulness in trespassing was insufficient to support the administrative decisions to revoke and reduce his permits and to impose double damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Unless that choice is arbitrary, courts ordinarily defer to an agency\u2019s choice of sanctions. <em>Diamond Ring Ranch, Inc. v. Morton, supra, </em>at 1407. In the grazing trespass context, the Board has formulated the following standard for willfulness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-14\">Although \u201cwillfulness\u201d is basically a subjective standard of the trespasser\u2019s intent, it may be proved by objective facts. Thus, in determining whether grazing trespasses are \u201cwillful,\u201d intent sufficient to establish willfulness may be shown by evidence which objectively shows that the circumstances did not comport with the notion that the trespasser acted in good faith or innocent mistake, or that his conduct was so lacking in reasonableness or responsibility that it became reckless or negligent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number><em>Eldon Brinkerhoff, </em>24 I.B.L.A. 324 (1976). Casey reviews extensively the evidence on \u201ccircumstances beyond [his] control\u201d and on his efforts to control his cattle. The record, however, contains substantial evidence of Casey\u2019s willfulness, including inadequate employment of control staff, poor fence conditions, a history of trespass and of ignoring the conditions upon his permits, and a failure to remedy trespasses upon notification. <em>See also Diamond Ring Ranch, </em>531 F.2d at 1405-06. Even disregarding the access trespass evidence, the record supports a finding of willfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">Casey\u2019s final contention is that the Interior Board of Land Appeals and the district court committed \u201cerrors of law\u201d by not finding that the government was es-topped from alleging the trespasses and by not holding that it was legally impossible for Casey to have committed trespass. His contentions are based on (1) the government\u2019s failure to maintain and to construct certain fences, which he asserts it was obligated to do by law and by contract and (2) its management plan, which created certain unfenced division lines and which allowed wild burros and horses to roam freely, reducing the value of his permits and precipitating his trespasses. Equitable estoppel is established when it is shown that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-6\">\u201c(1) the party to be estopped must know the facts; (2) he must intend that his conduct shall be acted on or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel has a right to believe it is so intended; (3) the latter must be ignorant of the true facts; and (4) he must rely on the former\u2019s conduct to his injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\"><em>United States v. Wharton, </em>514 F.2d 406, 412 (9th Cir. 1975) (quoting <em>United States v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., </em>421 F.2d 92, 96 (9th Cir. 1970)). When the party against whom estoppel is alleged is the United States, a showing of \u201caffirmative misconduct\u201d rather than \u201cmere neglect\u201d must be made. <em>Id. </em>at 409 \u2014 10. The record fails to establish that the government engaged in affirmative misconduct or had a legal obligation either to fence its lands or to restrain wild horses and burros.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1064-11\">. Because the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment after cross-motions on various grounds did not specify its reasons, Casey also challenges the district court decision on jurisdictional grounds. One of the United States\u2019 arguments for summary judgment was that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the \u201cagency discretion\u201d exception to reviewability of agency decisions. Casey treats the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment to be holdings both on jurisdiction and on the merits but does not explain why the district court would enter summary judgment, rather than a dismissal, if it had based its ruling on jurisdictional grounds. The United States interprets the summary judgment as a ruling against its jurisdictional objections and concedes that cases subsequent to the district court\u2019s summary judgment clearly establish that the court properly denied its jurisdictional claim. We agree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1065-12\">.
