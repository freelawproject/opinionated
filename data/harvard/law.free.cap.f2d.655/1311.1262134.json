Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d) embodies the presumption that prevailing parties will recover. their costs \u201cas a matter of course;\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920 further authorizes courts to tax losing plaintiffs for certain costs which the Secretary indisputably incurred in defending this action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These provisions notwithstanding, the district court summarily denied the Secretary recovery of any and all litigation costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-21\">We hold that the district court abused its discretion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d) by failing to explain its outright denial of costs to the Government. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the question of costs with instructions that the district judge both redetermine the cost award and support his new determination with a statement of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-22\">This case presents many of the same issues as <em>Baez v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>decided 7 May 1981, where the panel majority denied a prevailing Government defendant-appellee recovery of costs in a suit brought under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The three opinions in that case extensively analyze the precedent necessary to resolve the issues before us; furthermore, they highlight the bifurcated standard which now governs judicial discretion to award or deny costs to prevailing parties in this Circuit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus we make frequent reference to <em>Baez </em>throughout this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-23\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-24\">In August 1979 the Secretary of the Navy (\u201cthe Secretary\u201d or \u201cthe Navy\u201d) awarded the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO) a government con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>tract to design and construct a ship, the \u201cT-ARC 7,\u201d capable of retrieving, repairing, and deploying cable on the ocean floor. In October of that year, Sun Ship, Inc. (Sun Ship), a rival shipbuilder who had failed in its bid for the same contract, sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining performance of the contract, alleging that the Secretary had unlawfully and irrationally awarded the contract to NASSCO in violation of the Armed Services Procurement Act of 1947<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the Defense Acquisition Regulations promulgated thereunder.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">NASSCO promptly intervened as a defendant on the side of the Secretary and soon thereafter, the district jduge denied Sun Ship\u2019s motion for a TRO, ordering the parties \u201cto commence discovery forthwith.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> One month later, the district court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, but directed that discovery continue until late 1979.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1373-16\">Plaintiffs then proceeded to depose thirteen Navy officials at length, producing some 3500 pages of deposition transcript in eighteen days.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Neither the Government nor NASSCO noticed or conducted any depositions. Both defendants, however, ordered daily copies of the plaintiffs\u2019 deposition transcripts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1373-17\">In mid-January defendants moved for summary judgment. Four days later, the plaintiffs filed their depositions with the court under seal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The day before trial would have commenced, the district court gave summary judgment to the defendants, ruling in their favor on every issue.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1373-18\">Both the Government and NASSCO then filed timely bills of costs with the district court clerk. The Navy requested that Sun Ship and General Dynamics be jointly taxed $10,547.19, for the total cost of two daily copies of plaintiffs\u2019 deposition transcripts, one copy of each of three court hearings, and one copy of the transcript of questions certified for the court\u2019s use.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> When a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>vailing party submits a bill of costs to the district court, the clerk of the court examines the bill in the first instance to determine which costs, if any, are taxable. While Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920 empower the clerk to decide taxation questions, neither <em>requires </em>him to do so. As a practical matter, then, the clerk routinely. exercises his discretion by awarding costs to the victor when the sums requested are less than a few hundred dollars, and by deferring to the trial judge when sums far in excess of that figure are requested.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On 13 March 1980, however, <em>the clerk </em>denied the Government\u2019s bill in its entirety.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1374-4\">After the clerk had denied costs, the Government then timely moved under rule 54(d) that the district judge review the clerk\u2019s taxation decision. The district judge, stating no reasons, denied that motion and ordered that costs be taxed \u201cas directed by the Clerk.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Government, which consequently recovered no costs, now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-10\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-11\">A. <em>The Two Standards for Discretionary Denials of Costs to Prevailing Government Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1374-12\">[I] Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d) provides that \u201ccosts shall be allowed <em>as of course </em>to the prevailing party <em>unless the [district] court otherwise </em>directs.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Like its appellate analogue, Fed.R.App.P. 39(a),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> rule 54(d) com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>prises two elements: (1) a heavy presumption favoring an award of costs to the prevailing party, and (2) a measure of clerical and judicial discretion to order \u201cotherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">The precise relationship between the presumption and the discretion contained in the rule has recently become a matter of dispute in this Circuit. A long line of precedent in this and other circuits<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> had suggested that the strength of the presumption favoring cost awards to the victors narrows the scope of trial court discretion to reduce or deny costs to the prevailing party.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Furthermore, because cost awards to the winners had traditionally been regarded as the fair price which losers must pay for using the judicial system,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> many courts had suggested that there are \u201crelatively few cases in which special circumstances may persuade the district judge to exercise his discretion to deny costs to the prevailing party.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1375-6\">In the leading case of <em>Chicago Sugar Co. v. American Sugar Refining </em>Co.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the Seventh Circuit held that \u201cin the absence of some showing of bad faith [on the part of the prevailing party] or the deliberate adoption of a course of business dealings calculated to render litigation pertaining thereto unnecessarily prolix and expensive,\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> trial judges properly exercise their discretion under rule 54(d) by awarding prevailing parties their costs \u201cas a matter of course.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> As refined by later case law, the <em>Chicago Sugar </em>rule directs that courts deny costs to the victors \u201conly when there would be an element of injustice in a cost award.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1375-14\">In the recent case of <em>Baez v. United States Dep\u2019t of </em>Justice<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> however, a divided panel of this court recently held that, at least in FOIA suits, \u201ccosts should be denied to the Government if the plaintiff\u2019s claim has been pursued without confessed commercial self-interest, in a suit that is not frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Although the <em>Baez </em>standard was expressly created to govern awards of costs in <em>FOIA </em>cases under <em>Fed.R.App.P. 39(a), </em>the majority\u2019s reasoning was clearly broad enough to encompass cost awards sought under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> for lawsuits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>brought under other federal statutes.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> As a threshold matter, then, we must decide whether the traditional standard or the <em>Baez </em>standard applies to the cost award in this case.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">Although there are superficial analogies between this case and <em>Baez, </em>we conclude that the traditional standard governing judicial discretion over cost awards controls this case. Despite language throughout <em>Baez </em>suggesting that courts have broad discretion to reject \u201cclaims for costs made by prevailing defendants <em>under the federal rules\u201d </em>in order to \u201cavoid discouraging the prosecution of public interest litigation,\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> in. the end the <em>Baez </em>majority explicitly chose \u201cto highlight the limited reach of [its] holding.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Arguing that \u201cthe public interest incorporated in the Freedom of Information Act, in part demonstrated by the special attorneys fees and costs section of that statute, militates in favor of [its] standard,\u201d <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> the <em>Baez </em>panel held that the \u201cstandard of <em>Chicago Sugar </em>should not be applied <em>in FOIA actions in which the Government is the prevailing </em>party.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1376-9\">Here plaintiffs brought their unsuccessful lawsuit under the Armed Services Procurement Act of 1947, which contains no special attorneys\u2019 fees and costs provision. Thus Congress has not attempted in the Procurement Act, as it did in the FOIA, \u201cto encourage individuals to pursue statutorily-created rights\u201d by adopting statutory fee and cost incentives.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Furthermore, while <em>legitimate </em>challenges to unlawful and irrational government contracts certainly serve the public iilterests embodied in the Procurement Act, plaintiffs\u2019 suit here was unsuccessful in every respect. It seems highly unlikely, therefore, that awarding the Government its costs in this case would chill contractors with legitimate claims from challenging irrational or unlawful government contract awards. Finally, although the unsuccessful plaintiffs here relied on a federal statute as the basis of their claim, the remedy they sought was a traditional one: an injunction against the performance of a contract. Likewise, their motivation was traditional commercial self-interest. <em>Baez </em>held only that a new standard should guide judicial discretion over cost awards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>when litigants are not \u201cengaged in traditional civil litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> While the Government is indeed a party here, the nature of the underlying suit remains more analogous to \u201ca case of private litigants engaged in traditional civil litigation\u201d than to a case where private citizens seek disclosure of government information under FOIA.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that the traditional standard for denying costs laid down in <em>Chicago Sugar </em>and its progeny continues to govern the cost award before us.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\">B. <em>The Proper Standard Applied</em></p>\n<p id=\"ASK\">Under traditional rules, the presumption found in rule 54(d) favoring a cost award to the victor is accorded heavy weight.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> At a minimum, then, the traditional interpretation of rule 54(d) requires that district courts should neither deny nor reduce a prevailing party\u2019s request for costs without first articulating some good reason for doing so. Every circuit court that has analyzed the issue has concluded that the trial court commits reversible error when it denies the prevailing party costs without explanation.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> As the Tenth Circuit recently noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1377-6\">The apparent intendment of Rule 54(d) is that the prevailing party is presumptively entitled to costs, and that it is incumbent on the losing party to overcome such presumption, since the denial of costs is in the nature of a penalty. Accordingly, when a trial court refuses to award costs to the prevailing party, it should state its reasons for such disallowance. Unless an appellate court knows <em>why </em>a trial court refused to award costs to the prevailing party, it has no real basis upon which to judge whether the trial court acted within the proper confines of its discretion.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"axf-dedup-0\">Here the district court clerk offered no reasons for awarding none of $10,547.19 requested by the prevailing Government defendant; indeed, the only clerical notations on appellant\u2019s bill suggest that the clerk expected the district judge to examine the bill and make discretionary allowance of some or all of the cost items.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Nor did the district judge give any explanation either for his refusal to review the clerk\u2019s taxation order, or for his ratification of the $0 cost award.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> We find that by so doing the trial judge abused his rule 54(d) discretion. We therefore reverse and remand so that the district judge may properly review the clerk\u2019s taxation decision and determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>costs appropriately awarded, supporting that determination with a statement of reasons.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1378-4\">The record presented on appeal further convinces us that on remand the trial judge should not simply reiterate his previous order. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Farmer v. Arabian Am. Oil </em>Co.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> requires that the district judge determine first which, if any, of the costs requested by the prevailing party are statutorily authorized. The costs of the hearing transcripts and the transcript of certified questions appear to us plainly authorized by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920(2) &amp; (4).<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Whether the costs of two copies of daily deposition transcripts are similarly authorized turns on whether or not the Government \u201cnecessarily obtained [them] for use in the case,\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> an issue of fact to be determined by the district judge based on either the existing record or the record supplemented by additional proof.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1378-12\">A finding that some or all of the costs requested are statutorily authorized would give rise to the rule 54(d) presumption favoring their award to the Government. Under <em>Chicago Sugar </em>and subsequent cases, the district judge would then be obliged to determine whether the prevailing party engaged in any misconduct during the lawsuit \u201crendering the] litigation ... unnecessarily prolix and expensive.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Such a finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>would dissolve the presumption and render a denial or reduction of the Navy\u2019s cost recovery appropriate. Finally, whether or not the trial judge finds that the victor engaged in misconduct, he retains broad discretion under rule 54(d) to disallow any <em>non </em>statutory cost items on the victor\u2019s bill which seem excessive under the circumstances.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1379-4\">Subject to these directives, the district court\u2019s 18 March 1980 order denying review of the clerk\u2019s $0 taxation order is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-5\">\n<em>Reversed and Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1372-10\">.

It should be noted that this case comes to us in a different stage of the appellate process than <em>Baez. </em>In both cases a private plaintiff had sued the Government under a federal statute and lost at summary judgment. In <em>Baez, </em>however, the losing plaintiff then appealed and lost, and the Government defendant-appellee sought recovery of its <em>appellate </em>litigation costs. In denying those costs, the <em>Baez </em>majority formulated a rule to guide future exercises of appellate court discretion under Fed.R.App.P. 39(a) when confronted by a prevailing Government appellee in a FOIA suit. The precise issue before us on this appeal is whether the same standard should guide a <em>district </em>court\u2019s discretionary decision under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d) <em>not </em>to review a <em>clerical </em>denial of costs to a prevailing Government defendant in a <em>non-FOIA, i. e., </em>usual commercial, case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1376-11\">. <em>Baez </em>majority at 21 (emphasis in the original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b1376-12\">. <em>Id. </em>at 23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b1376-13\">. <em>Id. </em>at 26-27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b1376-14\">. <em>Id. </em>at 27 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b1376-15\">. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 26.
