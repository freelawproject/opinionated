The Commission concluded: (1) that Granite City, Illinois and St. Louis, Missouri, one and one-third miles apart and separated by the Mississippi River and a land area, were not \u201cadjoining\u201d communities as required by the Commission\u2019s rule governing conforming call signs; and (2) that in view of the potential for public confusion as to station location which conforming call signs would create, there was no public interest justification for departing from the rule in this instance. <em>Doubleday Broadcasting Co., Inc., </em>FCC 79-361 (June 22, 1979) (J.A. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-16\">The Commission is authorized by 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(o) (1976) to designate the call letters of radio devices under Title III of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 <em>et seq. </em>(1976). In the case of AM, FM, and television broadcast stations, Commission rules permit licensees to apply for the call sign of their choice, <em>see </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.-3550(j) (1980),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> subject however to certain limitations designed to standardize such choices to some degree <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and to avoid public confusion regarding station ownership and location.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>One such limiting rule, at issue in this case, governs the issuance of conforming call signs to stations in different broadcast service areas. Adopted in 1973 as part of a comprehensive revision of Commission rules governing the assignment of call signs, <em>see Report and Order in Docket </em>17477, 41 FCC 2d 481 (1973), this rule, section 73.3550(1), 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.3550(1) (1980) (formerly 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.550(i) (1978)), permits such stations to request the same call sign if they meet two basic qualifications: (1) they are commonly owned; and (2) they are licensed to \u201cthe same or adjoining communities.\u201d The Commission adopted this rule based on its finding that the use of conforming call signs, unless in the same or adjoining communities, unnecessarily confuses the public as to station location. <em>Report and Order in Docket </em>17477, 41 FCC 2d at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">On November 16, 1978 Doubleday, the proposed assignee of the license of Station WGNU-FM, Granite City, Illinois,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> filed a letter application with the Commission requesting that the WGNU-FM call sign of the Granite City station be changed to KWK-FM to conform it with the call sign of AM Station KWK, already owned by Doubleday and licensed to St. Louis, Missouri. (J.A. 4) Doubleday stated in its letter that its request was consistent with section 73.3550(1) (then section 1.550(i)) of the Commission\u2019s rule governing conforming call signs \u201csince Granite City adjoins St. Louis.\u201d (J.A. 4)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Objections to the requested call sign assignment were filed by four licensees of broadcasting stations assigned to the St. Louis area.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The gravamen of all four objections was that St. Louis and Granite City are not \u201cadjoining\u201d communities as contemplated by section 73.3550(1). (J.A. 6, 15, 18, 23) \u201cAdjoining\u201d, they averred, means being in actual contact, touching or bounding at a point or line. (J.A. 6, 18) St, Louis and Granite City, they said, are one and one-third miles apart, separated by the Mississippi River and certain land areas. (J.A. 1, 6, 15, 18, 23) In its reply, Doubleday contended that Granite City\u2019s close proximity to St. Louis was sufficient to qualify it as \u201cadjoining\u201d under the Commission\u2019s rule, as interpreted and applied by the Commission, notwithstanding that the two communities did not actually touch. (J.A. 31 \u2014 33)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">A request to conform call signs under 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.3550 is not unusual when two or more stations are commonly owned and are located in the same or adjoining communities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although most requests to conform call signs go unchallenged, the Doubleday request, as we have said, was met with four opposition pleadings. The objections are (1) that St. Louis and Granite City are not \u201cadjoining communities\u201d as defined in <em>Southwestern Broadcasting Corp., </em>- FCC2d -, 38 Rad.Reg.2d (P&amp;F) 39, 40 (1976), where the Commission held that \u201c \u2018adjoining\u2019 is understood to mean \u2018contiguous,\u2019 i. e., in actual contact or very close by dictionary definition\u201d; and (2) that the conformance would violate the W/east and K/west call sign rule. 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.-3550(h) (1980). To these objections Doubleday responds that although the cities are not physically adjoining \u201cGranite City\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>close proximity to St. Louis, in the absence of actual contiguity, nonetheless qualifies it as an adjoining community under the call sign regulation.\u201d (Br. for Doubleday at 7) The company argues that the adjoining communities requirement was adopted to preclude call sign conformances between widely separated stations, as in <em>Eastern Oklahoma Television Co., Inc., </em>28 FCC2d 31 (1971), where the conformance was denied for stations in communities 45 miles apart. The Commission and the objecting stations rely on the Commission\u2019s ruling in <em>Southwestern Broadcasting </em>and <em>Eastern Oklahoma.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">In the <em>Eastern Oklahoma </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the adjoining communities requirement was applied to broadcast properties in two southeast Oklahoma communities: Ada, 65 miles southeast of Oklahoma City, and Atoka, 45 miles southeast of Ada. It was clear that Ada and Atoka did not adjoin nor were they even in \u201cvery close\u201d proximity, but the licensee argued that the stations had substantially the same service areas and that the wide distribution of small communities in the southeastern part of the state constituted a \u201czone of inter-dependency\u201d that should be viewed by the Commission as a \u201csingle, homogenous unit.\u201d 28 FCC2d at 31. The Commission found that not only are Ada and Atoka \u201cseparated by about 45 miles, [t]hey are not even in contiguous counties, and therefore can hardly be characterized as \u2018adjoining.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32. The Commission also rejected the homogenous unit service area argument by concluding that the stations did not serve substantially the same areas and populations.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Two years later the Commission addressed the conformance issue in its amendment of the call sign assignment rule, and declined \u201cto relax existing requirements for the issuance of conforming call signs, i. e., that qualifying stations be under common control . . . and be assigned to the same or adjoining communities.\u201d <em>Report and Order in Docket No. </em>17477, 41 FCC2d 481, 483 (1973) (Assignment of Call Signs, \u00a7 1.550(i)). Rejecting the use of Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA\u2019s) \u201cor like standards\u201d as a substitute for the \u201csame or adjoining communities,\u201d the Commission cited <em>Eastern Oklahoma </em>and reaffirmed the requirement that the communities be \u201cadjoining\u201d. 41 FCC2d at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">In the <em>Southwestern Broadcasting Corp. </em>case, 38 Rad.Reg.2d (P&amp;F) 39 (1976) a request to conform an AM call sign to an FM facility in Puerto Rico presented the Commission with the opportunity to review the amended rule. The communities involved were separated by six miles; the Commission denied the request, ruling that \u201cadjoining\u201d means \u201ccontiguous\u201d. 38 Rad.Reg.2d (P&amp;F) at 40. The Commission reiterated that the reason for the strict application of the rule was the \u201cavoidance of public confusion as to station location,\u201d and it further defined \u201cadjoining\u201d to mean \u201cin actual contact or very close, by dictionary definition.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Commission found that although the two stations served substantial areas in common, a divergence of those service areas created a potential for public confusion as to station location. The decision was based primarily on a finding that the pueblos (towns) where the stations are located are six miles apart and therefore ineligible under a strict geographic application of the conformance rule. The petitioners urged the Commission to accept the adjoining municipios (counties of the same names as the pueblos) as consistent with the rule<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but the Commission found that \u201c[cjounties [municipios], as such, are geographically too extensive to qualify as licensed communities for broadcast stations .... \u201d 38 Rad. Reg.2d (P&amp;F) at 41 n.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Reading the <em>Eastern Oklahoma </em>and <em>Southwestern Broadcasting </em>cases together we learn that \u201cadjoining communities\u201d must be closer than 45 miles apart; in fact, closer than 6 miles; but we are not told just how close \u201cvery close\u201d is when the phrase is used to define \u201cadjoining\u201d, as it was in the <em>Southwestern Broadcasting </em>case. <em>Id. </em>at 40. We are somewhat enlightened by the Commission\u2019s attempted explanation of its order in the <em>Doubleday </em>case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">Where, as here, the factual situation <em>does not precisely meet the nearness criteria ... we </em>are required to evaluate <em>all relevant local circumstances </em>in determining whether favorable action on the proposal would be in the public interest. (J.A. 2) [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">For further enlightenment we turn to the case of KDWB-AM, St. Paul, Minnesota, and KDWB-FM, Richfield, Minnesota, and the case of KSGM-AM, St. Genevieve, Missouri and KSGM-FM, Chester, Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">KDWB-AM, St. Paul, Minnesota, is the Doubleday \u201cflagship\u201d station for a Doubleday acquisition WYOO-FM in Richfield, Minnesota. A call sign conformance of WYOO-FM in Richfield to KDWB-FM was granted. The two St. Paul area stations are on opposite sides of the Mississippi River and Richfield in no way adjoins, touches, or borders upon St. Paul; in fact the communities are over 2.5 miles apart and separated by the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport and the Fort Snelling Military Reservation in addition to the river. Notwithstanding these factors that seemingly would preclude conformance, the Commission found there was not sufficient likelihood of public confusion as to station location to prevent the grant of conformance requested by Doubleday; and this was so even though conformance required a change of the longstanding \u201cW\u201d call sign \u2014 WYOO, as Richfield is east of the river \u2014 to a \u201cK\u201d designation\u2014 KDWB-FM. The Commission rules provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">Call signs beginning with the letter \u201cK\u201d will not be assigned to stations located east of the Mississippi River, nor will call signs beginning with the letter \u201cW\u201d be assigned to stations located west of the Mississippi River, except where necessary to conform the call sign assignment of stations which otherwise qualify for common call signs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.3550(h) (1980). Thus the \u201cW\u201d and \u201cK\u201d distinction between stations east and west of the Mississippi River is overcome whenever the Commission determines that an exception is necessary to conform call signs that <em>\u201cotherwise qualify </em>...\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.3550(h) (1980). [Emphasis added] Moreover, just as WWWK is allowed by the Commission to identify itself hourly as a \u201cGranite City-St. Louis\u201d station, so too is KDWB-FM allowed to identify itself as a \u201cRichfield-Minneapolis-St. Paul\u201d station.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">The Commission granted a conformance for stations in St. Genevieve, Missouri (KSGM-AM), and Chester, Illinois (KSGM-FM), although the two towns are on opposite sides of the Mississippi River and neither adjoin nor face each other; Chest\u00e9r is about ten miles down river from St. Genevieve. Also, Chester and St. Genevieve are in different states and by their geographical locations violate the \u201cW\u201d and \u201cK\u201d call sign rule.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">If the Commission bases its denial of the St. Louis conformance request on a strict application of geographical boundaries then it is difficult to explain the outcome in the nearly identical St. Paul-Richfield situation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The only answer offered by the Commission is that there was no opposition to the St. Paul KDWB conformance in 1976, and the Commission looks more closely at contested requests: \u201cSince Doubleday\u2019s request was not opposed in [the St. Paul case] it is perhaps not surprising that a busy agency failed to realize something that is retrospect, it probably should have perceived \u2014 /. e., that Richfield and St. Paul do not in fact adjoin.\u201d (Comm\u2019n Br. at 10 n. 13) At oral argument the Commission maintained that it is difficult to tell from a map what is included in purportedly adjoining areas, so that reliance on the applicant\u2019s representation is justified. Yet there is no mystery about what lies between St. Paul and Rich-field, and what separates St. Louis and Granite City. In both cases a glance at a map plainly reveals the separation \u2014 geographic data perceived by the Commission only after the four opposition pleadings were filed in the St. Louis Doubleday case. What is also clear is that the Commission does not apply its strict geographic standard with any exactitude or consistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The only distinguishing factor advanced by the Commission for the St. Genevieve/Chester conformance is that the communities are of the same size (about 4,400 persons) while Granite City is a suburban community of about 40,000 and the population of St. Louis is 600,000. The Commission contends that considering all the relevant local circumstances the difference in the relative size of the communities \u201cis sufficient to distinguish the Chester/St. Genevieve situation from the one presented here\u201d. (Comm\u2019n Br. at 13 n.14) The rationale of the attempted distinction eludes us.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">In the last analysis, the Commission\u2019s decision rests upon the conclusion, expressed in its memorandum opinion (J.A. 2), that a grant of Doubleday\u2019s request for conformance would result in public confusion. The Commission\u2019s explanation is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">Since Granite City, Illinois is located east of the Mississippi River, Section 1.550(e) of the Rules [47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.3550(h)] ordinarily proscribes assignment of call signs beginning with the letter \u201cK\u201d to such a station, unless it would otherwise qualify for conforming call signs. The risk of public confusion as to station location is heightened where, as here, we are asked to conform the basic call sign of the only full-time broadcast facility licensed to a suburban community in one state with a long-established station licensed to a central city in another state (St. Louis, Missouri). The people of Granite City (population 40,440) expect their stations to have \u201cW\u201d call signs. If the Granite City FM and St. Louis AM adopt a St. Louis basic call sign, the chances are too great that listeners will mistakenly believe that the Granite City FM is licensed to the St. Louis central city.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">We think however that the Commission\u2019s reasoning will not withstand analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">In 1973, five years before Doubleday acquired Station WGNU-FM, the Commission authorized that station to identify itself on the air as \u201cWGNU-FM, Granite City \u2014 St. Louis\u201d. The authorization stated \u201cThis action does not modify your existing license or affect your primary obligation to the community to which station WGNU-FM is assigned (Granite City). This letter or a photocopy thereof should be posted with the station license as evidence of dual-city identification authority.\u201d (Comm\u2019n letter, January 26, 1973, Br. for Doubleday Addenda) Thus for five years before Doubleday acquired the station, WGNU, located in \u201ca suburban community in one state\u201d had been coupled with a \u201ccentral city in another state\u201d, with the approval of the Commission. In these circumstances it would strain credulity to believe that a change from a \u201cW\u201d call sign to a \u201cK\u201d sign would cause listeners to think the location of the licensee had changed. In any event, as we have seen, the Commission in other almost identical cases has not found that change from \u201cW\u201d to \u201cK\u201d has produced public confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">The Commission contends in its brief (p. 10) that its decision in other cases \u201ccannot serve as binding precedent\u201d here. We do not understand the Commission\u2019s argument. If the Commission in other almost identical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>cases has granted applications for conformance why should those cases not have prece-dential value? We think they do. We think further that by disregarding those precedents the Commission in this case has acted arbitrarily and capriciously. The Commission may not decide a case one way today and a substantially similar case another way tomorrow, without a more reasonable explanation than is offered here. Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s order is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-17\">.
