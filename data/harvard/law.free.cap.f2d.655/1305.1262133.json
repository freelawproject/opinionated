To secure the just and effective processing of similar cases filed <em>in forma pauperis </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we present in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>this opinion guides for district court adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-4\">Salvatore Crisafi, currently a federal penitentiary inmate, complains in this action of alleged deprivations of his constitutional right to meaningful access to courts. He asserts, <em>inter alia, </em>that correction officials arbitrarily curtailed his use of a law library, and denied his requests for writing paper, envelopes, and stamps. The district court granted him leave to file his <em>pro se </em>complaint without prepayment of costs. Simultaneously, the court dismissed the complaint, endorsing on the pleading \u201cDismissed 28 USC 1915(d).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court noted in the margin the civil action numbers of six cases Crisafi had filed in the past three years. No further explanation was provided. The district court then denied leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis, </em>certifying without a statement of reasons that Crisafi\u2019s challenge was \u201cfrivolous and not taken in good faith.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1366-5\">We conclude that Crisafi has stated a claim for relief not susceptible to threshold dismissal. We therefore grant him leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis, </em>reverse the dismissal of his complaint, and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-10\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a) permits federal courts to authorize the maintenance of an action without prepayment of fees and costs <em>(\u201cin forma pauperis\u201d) </em>by a person \u201cwho makes [an] affidavit that he is unable to pay such costs or give security therefor.\u201d This provision<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cis intended to guarantee that no citizen shall be denied an opportunity to commence, prosecute, or defend an action, civil or criminal, \u2018in any court of the United States\u2019 solely because his poverty makes it impossible for him to pay or secure the costs.\u201d <em>Adkins v. E. I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>335 U.S. 331, 342, 69 S.Ct. 85, 90, 93 L.Ed.2d 43 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-11\">At the same time, Congress stipulated that a court may dismiss an <em>in forma pau-peris </em>proceeding if satisfied that the action is \u201cfrivolous or malicious.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d). Section 1915(d), however, provides no basis for \u201ccursory treatment of meritorious complaints.\u201d <em>McTeague v. Sos-nowski, </em>617 F.2d 1016, 1019 (3d Cir. 1980). Discretion to dismiss \u201cmay not be exercised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>arbitrarily and is limited ... in every case by the language of the statute itself which restricts its application to complaints found to be \u2018frivolous or malicious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boyce v. Alizaduh, </em>595 F.2d 948, 951 (4th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-4\">The district court did not state on what basis it found Crisafi\u2019s complaint frivolous or malicious and did not supply the statement of reasons required by Rule 24(a), Fed.R.App.P., in denying leave to proceed on appeal <em>in forma </em>pauperis.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We therefore set out below illustrative situations in which an <em>in forma pauperis </em>pleading properly may be dismissed as \u201cfrivolous or malicious,\u201d and state why immediate dismissal of Crisafi\u2019s complaint was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-5\">\u201cIn determining whether a particular ... complaint is frivolous or malicious under Section 1915(d), the threshold issue for the trial court is an assessment of the substance of the claim presented, i. e., is there a factual and legal basis ... for the asserted wrong, however inartfully pleaded.\u201d <em>Watson v. Ault, </em>525 F.2d 886, 892 (5th Cir. 1976). <em>See Collins v. Hladky, </em>603 F.2d 824, 825 (10th Cir. 1979). A complaint must indicate facts in support of its conclusions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 292, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), for example, the Supreme Court held that \u201c[i]n order to state a cognizable claim [of medical mistreatment under the Eighth Amendment], a prisoner must allege acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\u201d A court may dismiss as frivolous complaints reciting bare legal conclusions with no sug-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>gesti\u00f3n of supporting facts, or postulating events and circumstances of a wholly fanciful kind.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Similarly, \u201c[a] complaint conflicting with facts of which the district court may take judicial notice might also properly be dismissed under Section 1915(d).\u201d <em>Taylor v. Gibson, </em>529 F.2d 709, 717 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">A <em>pro se </em>complaint, like any other, must present a claim upon which relief can be granted by the court. For example, prisoner complaints alleging only \u201cextremely minor inconveniences without any allegations of purposeful discrimination, malicious intent or denial of process seriously believed to be due\u201d do not state a claim of cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. <em>Sparks v. Fuller, </em>506 F.2d 1238, 1239 (1st Cir. 1974) (complaints requesting injunctive relief to prevent eviction of prisoners\u2019 pet cats, to require certain kinds and quantities of clothing, and to direct repair of a toilet out of order for three days properly dismissed as frivolous). For further illustrations, <em>see French v. Butterworth, </em>614 F.2d 23 (1st Cir.) (complaint alleged constitutionally protected property interest in running health food dealership in prison), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 942 (1980); and <em>Pitts v. Griffin, </em>518 F.2d 72 (8th Cir. 1975) (complaint against prison authorities for confiscation of multifrequency radio pursuant to prison regulations limiting radio use to AM frequency). Complaints of this genre, while they may be voiced within</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-7\">the prison system, are not appropriate fare for federal court resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-8\">The named defendant must be amenable to suit. An <em>in forma pauperis </em>complaint is properly dismissed as frivolous pri- or to service of process if it is clear from the face of the pleading that the named defendant is absolutely immune from suit on the claims asserted. <em>See Moore v. Burger, </em>655 F.2d 1265 (D.C.Cir. 1981) (complaint against four Justices of Supreme Court for creating judicial precedents alleged to deny plaintiff his constitutional rights properly dismissed as frivolous); <em>Johnson v. Reagan, 524 </em>F.2d 1123 (9th-Cir. 1975) (claims against legislators and judges properly dismissed as frivolous).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-9\">However, a unanimous Supreme Court has admonished that <em>pro se in forma pau-peris </em>complaints must be read with tolerance: Dismissal is impermissible unless the court can say \u201cwith assurance that under the allegations of the <em>pro se </em>complaint, which we hold to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers, it appears \u2018beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 595-96, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), quoting <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 101-02, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957), reaffirmed in <em>Estelle, </em>429 U.S. at 106, 97 S.Ct. at 292.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Fifth Circuit has cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>[J]udges must balance their misgivings and skepticism about the usual \u00a7 1983 prisoner suit against the cold knowledge that in certain instances injustices to prisoners occur in jails and prisons, some of which violate constitutional mandates .... [I]t is the responsibility of the courts to be sensitive to possible abuses in order to ensure that prisoner complaints, particularly <em>pro se </em>complaints, are not dismissed prematurely, however unlikely the set of facts postulated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1369-4\"><em>Taylor, </em>529 F.2d at 713. It has been held improper to dismiss, prior to service of process, a complaint that alleges violation of a prisoner\u2019s right to protection from assault by other prisoners, <em>Cline v. Herman, </em>601 F.2d 374 (8th Cir. 1979); inaction that would constitute deliberate indifference to serious medical needs, <em>United States ex rel. Walker v. Fayette County, </em>599 F.2d 573 (3d Cir. 1979); and punishment of a prisoner, without a hearing or notice of charges, by placement in isolation, denial of access to religious services, recreational activities, the law library, and his law books, denial of correspondence and visitation privileges, and confiscation of personal property, <em>Ibar-ra v. Olivarri, </em>587 F.2d 677 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">Section 1915(d) also authorizes immediate dismissal of a complaint appropriately characterized as malicious. A complaint that threatens violence or that contains disrespectful references to the court falls in this category. <em>Cf. Theriault v. Silber, </em>574 F.2d 197 (5th Cir. 1978) (striking notice of appeal containing disrespectful and impertinent references to the trial judge), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 917, 99 S.Ct. 918, 59 L.Ed.2d 468 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-6\">A complaint plainly abusive of the judicial process is properly typed malicious. \u201c[N]o one, rich or poor, is entitled to abuse the judicial process.\u201d <em>Hardwick v. Brinson, </em>523 F.2d 798, 800 (5th Cir. 1975). A complaint that merely repeats pending or previously litigated claims may be considered abusive, and a court may look to its own records to determine whether a pleading repeats prior claims. <em>See, e. g., Van Meter v. Morgan, </em>518 F.2d 366 (8th Cir.) (affirming dismissal based on finding by district court that a prior complaint, then pending, was based on same conduct by same defendant), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>423 U.S. 896, 96 S.Ct. 198, 46 L.Ed.2d 129 (1975); <em>Duhart v. Carlson, </em>469 F.2d 471 (10th Cir. 1972) (approving trial court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint, prior to service of process, on the ground that the plaintiffs sought to relitigate issues already litigated), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 958, 93 S.Ct. 1431, 35 L.Ed.2d 692 (1973). For flagrant examples of abusive resort to the courts, <em>see Carter v. Telectron, Inc., </em>452 F.Supp. 944 (S.D.Tex.1977) in which the plaintiff (who had commenced 178 actions across the country in 15 years) had filed duplicative suits simultaneously in several courts, varied his citizenship allegations to invoke federal diversity jurisdiction, failed to serve defendants, made untrue allegations of poverty, and submitted papers raising the spectre of forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-8\">But a complaint filed <em>in forma pauperis </em>is not subject to dismissal simply because the plaintiff is litigious. The number of complaints a poor person files does not alone justify peremptory dismissal. In each instance, the substance of the impoverished person\u2019s claim is the appropriate measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-9\">Turning to Crisafi\u2019s complaint, and applying the standard presented in <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>it does not appear \u201cbeyond doubt that [Crisafi] can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d Crisafi alleged that in September 1980 he was transferred from the federal penitentiary at Lewisburg to the D. C. Jail, that legal materials he brought along were taken from him at the jail, that he was denied reasonable access to the law library, and that his requests for writing paper, envelopes, and stamps were not granted. He attached to the complaint copies of several forms indicating requests made to officers at the jail. He also attached a response received from a jail authority; according to Crisafi it was the sole response to his multiple requests. The response stated: \u201cRecords show that the resident has been afforded opportunity to contact his attorney. Due to circumstances beyond our control writing paper and envelopes are in short supply throughout the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>jail, making it impossible to supply items that we do not have.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">In <em>Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 824-25, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 1496, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977), the Supreme Court declared it \u201cindisputable that indigent inmates must be provided at state expense with paper and pen to draft legal documents, with notarial services to authenticate them, and with stamps to mail them.\u201d The Court reaffirmed <em>Younger v. Gilmore, </em>404 U.S. 15, 92 S.Ct. 250, 30 L.Ed.2d 142 (1971), holding that access to law libraries or, alternatively, to professional or quasi-professional legal assistance is constitutionally mandated. <em>Bounds, </em>430 U.S. at 828-29, 97 S.Ct. at 1498.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-5\">We therefore discern no apparent justification for a threshold decision that Crisafi\u2019s complaint is bereft of a factual and legal basis for relief. The defendants are amenable to suit, and we detect no abuse of the judicial process on the face of the pleading, no apparent duplicity or lack of good faith.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1370-6\">We offer no view as to the ultimate merits of Crisafi\u2019s complaint, nor do we suggest that a trial will be necessary. We have no doubt, however, that the instant unexplained dismissal of his action was incompatible with the governing statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-7\">This case illustrates the value of a clear statement of reasons by the district court when dismissing a complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d). Such a statement serves twin purposes: it insures that the district court has fully considered the complaint and the applicable law, and it informs the court of appeals and the parties of the grounds on which an action was found \u201cfrivolous or malicious.\u201d Mindful of the heavy workload of the district court, we do not at this time require a statement of reasons in every instance in which a case is dismissed under \u00a7 1915(d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We do expect, however, that district court judges will endeavor to avoid unnecessary remands by supplying a cogent statement of reasons when the basis for a section 1915(d) dismissal is not evident on the face of the complaint, and by complying with Rule 24(a) when denying leave to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1370-11\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1365-19\">.

Barnes, </em>618 F.2d 988 (2d Cir. 1980), the Second Circuit, reversing the dismissal of a state prisoner\u2019s complaint, emphasized that it had repeatedly cautioned against sua <em>sponte </em>dismissals of complaints alleging facts supporting a claimed civil rights violation, in advance of service on the adverse party and in the absence of answering papers. The Ninth Circuit, by contrast, held in a series of cases before <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Kerner </em>that a district court has \u201cespecially broad discretion\u201d to dismiss a state prisoner\u2019s complaint seeking to prosecute <em>in forma pauperis </em>a civil rights claim against prison offici\u00e1ls. <em>See, e. g., Shobe v. California, </em>362 F.2d 545 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 887, 87 S.Ct. 185, 17 L.Ed.2d 115 (1966). The Ninth Circuit has repeated this language since <em>Haines v. Kerner, see Milton v. Nelson, </em>527 F.2d 1158, 1160 (9th Cir. 1975), and the \u201cespecially broad discretion\u201d formulation has been quoted in other circuits. <em>See, e. g., Daye v. Bounds, </em>509 F.2d 66, 68 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 1002, 95 S.Ct. 2404, 44 L.Ed.2d 671 (1975); <em>Flowers v. Turbine Support Division, </em>507 F.2d 1242, 1244 (5th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-11\"><em>Haines v. Kerner </em>was itself a civil rights action brought <em>in forma pauperis </em>by a state prisoner against prison officials. Nothing in that decision, or in the language of section 1915(d), justifies the position that prisoners\u2019 <em>pro se </em>complaints are to be treated in a fashion different from those of other litigants who seek to proceed <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1370-8\">. Crisafi submitted this complaint after his return to Lewisburg.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1370-9\">. The claims Crisafi now attempts to present are not repetitive of the six prior complaints noted by the district court. Two of those complaints, Nos. 78-1450 and 80-0122, attempted to state tort claims against attorneys who formerly represented Crisafi, and another No. 78-2362, was directed against government officials and others whose alleged wrongful actions were claimed to have caused Crisafi\u2019s conviction. Two others, Nos. 79-2909 and 80-1853, were Freedom of Information and Privacy Act complaints. With the exception of the FOIA complaint, for which the filing fee was paid and which was transferred to the district court here at the request of the government, all of these prior complaints were dismissed <em>sua sponte </em>by the district court simultaneously with their filing. A sixth complaint, No. 81-0031, also unrelated to the instant action, was transferred to the Middle District of Pennsylvania.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1370-13\">. <em>But cf.

It is therefore imperative that denial of leave to file the petition, or denial of the writ itself, be accompanied by an expression of the reasons for the denial either by informal memorandum, by recitals in an order, or by findings.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1370-15\">. As Judge Tamm stated in <em>Davis, </em>404 F.2d at 1358, \u201c[s]uch a requirement is not onerous if the matter was dealt with in a conscientious manner in passing on the merits.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
