It also denied the Town\u2019s motion for stay of the Department\u2019s decision and granted Mr. Doe\u2019s and the Department\u2019s motions that the Department\u2019s decision be enforced during the pendency of the action. The Town appeals all three judgments. We vacate the first and third judgments and affirm the second judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">The parties to this suit agree that John Doe, Jr. has special educational needs justifying some type of publicly financed service. <em>See generally </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401-20 (providing federal aid for education of handicapped); Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 71B (West Supp.1981) (providing for education of children with special needs). The Town proposed that he attend the special education program at the Pine Glen School, a public school that provides both regular elementary and special educational curricula. Mr. Doe preferred the private Carroll School. As state law provides, Mr. Doe sought review of the Town\u2019s decision by the state Department of Education. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 3 &amp; 10; 603 C.M.R. \u00a7 401.0 (Code of Massachusetts Regulations). <em>See also </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(b)(2) &amp; (c). The Department held hearings on this matter from September to November 1979. At the beginning of his child\u2019s fourth grade year in September 1979, Mr. Doe enrolled his son in the Carroll School. In January 1980, the Department ruled that the Carroll School was the appropriate program and ordered the Town to pay for the child\u2019s education there. In its decision the Department advised that the Town could \u201cfile a petition for review in the Superior Court or the Federal District Court\u201d. <em>Cf. Ezratty v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, </em>648 F.2d 770, at 776 (1981) (no express consent by Puerto Rico to suit in federal court).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-16\">The Town then sought judicial review of the Department\u2019s decision. It filed suit against the Department and Mr. Doe in federal district court on a two count complaint. Jurisdiction for the first court [\u201cthe federal count\u201d] was founded upon 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e)(2), which provides for judicial review for \u201c[a]ny party aggrieved by the findings and decision made\u201d pursuant to state procedures required of state and local agencies receiving federal assistance by the federal aid-to-the-handicapped scheme.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 1415(a), (c) &amp; (e). The second count [\u201cthe state count\u201d] claimed to be a pendent matter under a Massachusetts law establishing judicial review for \u201cany person. . .aggrieved by a final decision of any agency. .. . \u201d Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 30A, \u00a7 14 (West 1979).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The Town moved on May 26, 1980 for a stay of the Department\u2019s order that the Town pay for the Carroll School education. It sought only to avoid payment to the Carroll School and to Mr. Doe at that time; it did not seek and has not sought to have John Doe, Jr. transferred from his ongoing education at the Carroll School. In connection with this motion, the Town requested an evidentiary hearing. After hearing oral argument on July 7, 1980, but without taking evidence, the district court denied the requested stay on July 24, 1980. The Town appealed to us from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment on the state count, which the district court decided in favor of the defendants on November 19,1980. The district court certified this judgment as final under Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 54(b), and set the federal count for future trial. The Town appealed from the summary judgment decision. We consolidated this appeal with that already pending from the district court\u2019s July 24 decision to constitute No. 80-1527.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">We heard oral argument in No. 80 \u2014 1527 on March 4, 1981. Meanwhile, the posture of the case had continued to change. The Department moved for a preliminary injunction on December 11,1980 to enforce its order requiring the Town to pay tuition and to reimburse the Does. This motion supplemented Mr. Doe\u2019s pending motions to similar effect. On December 15, 1980, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Education wrote to the Town threatening to freeze <em>all of </em>its special education assistance unless the Town complied with the Department\u2019s or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>der. After a hearing on this matter, a state hearing officer concluded on January 30, 1981 that the Department properly could withhold fiscal year 1981 funds from the Town. On February 9, 1981, the district court held a hearing at which the Town stated that it was now \u201cprepared to keep this child in school until this case can be decided.\u201d The Town also made clear that it would also pay for the child\u2019s school transportation \u201cfrom here on in ... without any problem to Mr. Doe.\u201d We were informed at oral argument that the Town has made good on these commitments.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The Town persisted, however, in refusing to reimburse Mr. Doe for his <em>past </em>expenses for the 1979-1980 academic year. On February 12, 1981, the district court issued an order requiring the Town, <em>inter alia, </em>to reimburse Mr. Doe in the amount of $8837.97 for past educational expenses. The Town appealed this order, which we docketed as No. 81-1112 and in which we heard oral argument on June 3, 1981.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">We therefore have before us in No. 80-1527 (1) an appeal from the district court\u2019s November 19, 1980 grant of summary judgment for the Department and Mr. Doe on Count II of the Town\u2019s complaint, and (2) an appeal from the district court\u2019s July 24, 1980 denial of the Town\u2019s motion for stay of the Department\u2019s order pending final resolution of the case. In No. 81-1112 we are presented with the Town\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s February 12, 1981 order of 1979-1980 reimbursement. We consider these issues in that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">We hold that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for the defendants under state law because we conclude that state law cannot be applied when review under federal law is sought. By its terms 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e)(1) provide that decisions by the state educational agency \u201cshall be final, except that any party\u201d has judicial appeal rights under 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e)(2). That subsection provides for review <em>in state or federal court. </em>It also sets forth the procedure and standards for this review: \u201cIn any action brought under this paragraph the court shall receive the records of the administrative proceedings, shall hear additional evidence at the request of a party, and, basing its decision on the preponderance of the evidence, shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">This federal specification for review, when invoked, seems to us designed to occupy the field over an inconsistent state provision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here the arguably applicable state review provision \u2014 part of the state\u2019s general administrative procedure legislation\u2014 calls for, <em>inter alia, </em>judicial review governed by the substantial evidence standard. Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 30A, \u00a7 14. This standard does conflict with the federal standard; we can imagine many judicial reviews that would uphold an agency decision as based on substantial evidence but that would reach a different result were new evidence to be taken and judged under the more rigorous \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">This conflict could lead to results that should be avoided. For instance, the Department might have ruled in this suit that the Town\u2019s proposed plan was faulty but that appropriate relief was something other than what Mr. Doe sought. One aggrieved party might have selected a state forum for review under state law while the other filed in federal court claiming review under the federal standard. If both review provisions legitimately coexisted, the resolution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>controversy could inspire an unseemly race to judgment. Even this would not dependably produce consistency. A decision based simply on substantial evidence would not be res judicata for an issue to be decided by the more probing preponderance of the evidence standard. The converse situation would often be more settled, since a finding under the preponderance standard would generally control the substantial evidence question. But inconsistencies could appear here as well. The federal provision directs that the reviewing court \u201cshall hear additional evidence at the request of a party\u201d, while the state provision normally confines its review to the record developed by the agency. <em>See </em>Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 30A, \u00a7 14(6) (West 1979). A preponderance-of-the-evidence holding based on an expanded record could present a different legal issue than that faced on a substantial evidence review of a limited record, thus again presenting the specter of inconsistent federal and state judgments, one which might attempt to affirm and enforce the Department\u2019s ruling while the other sought to overturn it.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s decision concerning state law that does not apply in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This will leave the scheduled trial on the federal count as the sole mechanism of judicial review in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The Town appropriately styled its motion that the district court stay the Department\u2019s enforcement of its order as a request, for a preliminary injunction. Therefore, the Town \u201cfaces a heavy burden in attempting to convince us to upset the judgment of the district court in this matter.\u201d <em>Manning v. Trustees of Tufts College, </em>613 F.2d 1200, 1202 (1st Cir. 1980). We resolve the question on the narrow ground that the Town has not shown a danger of immediate irreparable injury. <em>See Automatic Radio Mfg. Co. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>390 F.2d 113, 116 (1st Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">The Town\u2019s only asserted injury is the payment of money it fears will not be returned should it prevail in this suit. This sum is the Town\u2019s share of the added cost of the private Carroll School over the public Pine Glen School,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which the Town claimed was at least $3691 a year.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Apparently assuming that the litigation would last two years, the Town thus argued that it faced an irreparable injury of $7400.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">Normally the fact of a relatively small and precisely quantifiable injury is sound evidence that preliminary equitable relief is not warranted since just such injuries can be remedied adequately by final judgment. In this case the Town attempted to escape this general guide by pointing to Mr. Doe\u2019s statement, appended to his \u201cMotion to Require Plaintiffs to Honor Decision of the Department of Education of the Commonwealth\u201d, that he would \u201cnot have the full liquidity needed to litigate this case against a governmental body with comparatively unlimited financial assets.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>commented that it was \u201chardly necessary to read between the lines; if the town pays out the money to pay for John\u2019s education at the Carroll School, its chances of ever seeing that money back if it prevails on either or both counts of the present action are slim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">We do not think that Mr. Doe\u2019s statement \u2014 the sole contemporaneous substantiation that the Town offered for a threat of immediate irreparable injury \u2014 was sufficient to discharge the Town\u2019s burden in requesting an injunction here. We take Mr. Doe\u2019s lament regarding \u201cliquidity\u201d in its ordinary sense, as referring to a condition in which assets are not liquid, but are not necessarily wanting. The reference to litigation \u201cagainst a governmental body with comparatively unlimited financial assets\u201d we understand to imply either that the Does expected that their ability to match the Town\u2019s conduct of this litigation would be hindered by their own more pressing resource constraints, or that they would be forced to make undue sacrifices (such as liquidating major capital assets, like their home) to keep pace with the Town. Neither of these possibilities would necessarily hamper the Town\u2019s ability, in the event of its ultimate victory, to collect a $7400 judgment against an individual that the record shows to be employed by the federal government as a professional in a supervisory position. A cynical observer might remark that these impediments to the Does\u2019 capacity to finance spirited litigation could even <em>increase </em>the chances of the Town\u2019s final recovery. We therefore cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in denying the Town\u2019s request for preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The Town also complains that the district court ruled without holding an evidentiary hearing. We observe that the Town exercised its ample opportunity to brief its position, and again presented its arguments in a substantial oral hearing before the district court. The sole asserted basis for the threat of irreparable injury in each instance was Mr. Doe\u2019s statement. Although the Town made clear its desire to provide evidence on its probability of success on the merits, at no time did it submit affidavits or make offers of proof on the matter of irreparable injury. Under these circumstances the district court could fairly conclude that further hearings to take evidence were unnecessary to decide the motion before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">We now come to the February 12, 1981 order that the Town reimburse the Does for their 1979-1980 expenses according to the Department\u2019s decision \u201cpending a final determination on the merits\u201d. The district court explained that this payment was required since 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e)(3) (\u201cthe child shall remain in the then current educational placement of such child\u201d during review proceedings) had \u201cbeen held in this case to require that John, Jr. be maintained at the Carroll School during the pendency of this litigation. Judgment and Memorandum of Decision November 19, 1980.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">We think the district court misinterpreted the intent of 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e)(3). As we read this section, it provides only that children shall remain \u201cin the then current educational placement\u201d (emphasis added) during placement disputes. Here no one proposed to change Doe Jr.\u2019s placement at the Carroll School; rather the dispute was over who should bear a portion of the expenses of that placement until final judgment could be rendered. We therefore think that the district court should have handled the petition for reimbursement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the Does as a petition for preliminary injunction and applied the traditional criteria. Had it done so, we believe that neither the Department nor Mr. Doe could be found to have made a showing of irreparable harm after the Town undertook on February 9 to pay all but the Does\u2019 first year expenses. Mr. Doe had displayed his ability to pay these sums. The record before us contains no demonstration of impending injury that final judgment, should it be in his favor, would be unable to redress.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">If by its reference to its decision of November 19, 1980 the district court meant to make a finding that the Does and the Department had a likelihood of success on the merits, we think that this also was error. We have vacated this November 19 judgment in part II of this opinion. Moreover, that judgment purported only to consider state law and thus had not determined what the different federal provisions might dictate in this case. Any finding on the likelihood of success would have required a hearing on the evidence that the parties proposed to introduce in the \u00a7 1415(e)(2) review.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Our result in this case might be thought anomalous because we have affirmed a refusal to stay the Department\u2019s order but have reversed an order to enforce it. Any anomaly is superficial. The refusal to apply interim judicial powers of equity on either side leaves the field open to extrajudicial resolution. Here that resolution has produced an apparently fair division of the burdens of delay, in that neither side to date has shown the threat of irreparable injury that provides the rationale for interim relief. <em>See </em>Leubsdorf, <em>The Standard for Preliminary Injunctions, </em>91 Harv.L.Rev. 525, 540-48 (1978). If on remand further questions as to preliminary relief arise, we are confident that the district court will expedite trial on the federal count so that the underlying merits of this suit may be clarified. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 65(a)(2). <em>See also id. </em>65(c) (requiring appropriate security be posted should preliminary injunction issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\n<em>The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is vacated, as is its order of February 12, 1981. Its denial of preliminary injunction is affirmed. The case is remanded with instructions that the second count of the Town\u2019s complaint be dismissed and that trial proceed on the first count.

The Town\u2019s original complaint satisfied this requirement only indirectly \u2014 by appending and incorporating the Department\u2019s decision, which indicates that the federal statute, P.L. 94-142, and its accompanying regulations apply in this case. <em>See </em>45 C.F.R. \u00a7 121a.2 (1979) (\u201cApplicability [of regulations] to State, local, and private agencies\u201d). The fact of federal funding is confirmed by the subsequently filed papers in No. 81-1112. They show that the Town has amended its complaint to add a count reciting that a Department official \"held a hearing on whether to freeze federal funds for aid to the handicapped to Plaintiff under Title 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(b)(2)(A).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">A more direct statement of jurisdiction from the outset would have been preferable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b490-16\">. This count also asserted jurisdiction based on \u201cthe provisions of Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 and Title 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331____\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b491-9\">. The Town moved that this order be stayed pending our decision. Since we rule on the merits of this issue in part IV of this opinion, the question of stay is now moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b491-10\">. We need not decide whether the federal review provision would have preemptive force when the only aggrieved party seeks relief <em>solely </em>under state law since here the Town <em>has </em>invoked 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415. It is possible that an aggrieved party might for financial or other reasons be satisfied with the more limited judicial review available under state law; conceivably the federal policy embodied in \u00a7 1415 would not be infringed when willingly waived by its beneficiary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\"><em>. </em>Mr. Doe urges that the Town should not be allowed to invoke 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e)(2) as \u201can[ ] aggrieved party\u201d since an earlier section, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 1415(a), refers only to \u201chandicapped children and their parents and guardians .. . . \u201d The district court rejected this narrow construction of \u00a7 1415(e)(2)\u2019s \u201cany party aggrieved\u201d language as ignoring \u201cthe explicit and unambiguous language of the statute .. .. \u201d We affirm this reasoning. We also note that to confine a town to review under state law could lead to one-sided results if the town\u2019s opponents could race to a federal review that is preemptive or otherwise normally controlling as res judicata by virtue of its more scrutinizing character.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b492-11\">. The Town asserts that the net marginal cost of withdrawing John Doe, Jr. from the regular public program and enrolling him in the special public program at Pine Glen is negligible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b492-12\">. According to the Town, the Carroll School costs a total of $6486 a year, of which the state will reimburse to a maximum of $2795. The Town stated that this maximum reimbursement is \u201crarely if ever reached\u201d but did not disclose the extent of the typical shortfall. Since the burden of establishing irreparable injury rests with the party seeking the injunction, from this lack of allegation we presume that the shortfall typically is not significant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b492-13\">. Mr. Doe also stated that he \u201ctook the financial risk\u201d of transferring Doe, Jr. to the Carroll School.
