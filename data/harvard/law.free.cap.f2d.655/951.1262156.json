They appeal from a partial summary judgment in the district court granting Burlington Northern a right of access to its totally enclosed timberlands. <em>Montana Wilderness Association v. United States Forest Service, </em>496 F.Supp. 880 (D.Mont.1980). The district court held that Burlington Northern has an easement by necessity or, alternatively, an implied easement under the Northern Pacific Land Grant of 1864. <em>Id. </em>at 883-88. The defendants argue that the Alaska National Interest Lands Act of 1980, passed subsequent to the district court\u2019s decision, also grants Burlington Northern assured access to its land. The appellants contend that the doctrine of easement by necessity does not apply to the sovereign, that there was no implied easement conveyed by the 1864 land grant, and that the access provisions of the Alaska Lands Act do not apply to land outside the state of Alaska. We conclude that the Alaska Lands Act does grant access to Burlington Northern. We therefore affirm the partial summary judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-17\">Defendant-Appellee Burlington Northern, Inc. owns timberland located within the Gallatin National Forest southwest of Bozeman, Montana. This land was originally acquired by its predecessor, the Northern Pacific Railroad, under the Northern Pacific Land Grant Act of 1864,13 Stat. 365. The Act granted odd-numbered square sections of land to the railroad, which, with the even-number sections retained by the United States, formed a checkerboard pattern.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-18\">To harvest its timber, Burlington Northern in 1979 acquired a permit from defendant-appellee United States Forest Service, allowing it to construct an access road across national forest land. The proposed roads would cross the Buck Creek and Yellow Mules drainages, which are protected by the Montana Wilderness Study Act of 1977, Pub.L. 95-150, 91 Stat. 1243, as poten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>tial wilderness areas. The proposed logging and road-building will arguably disqualify the areas as wilderness under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">The plaintiffs, Montana Wilderness Association, The Wilderness Society, and Nine Quarter Circle Ranch, having contested the granting of the permit, filed suit after it was granted, seeking declaratory and in-junctive relief. A temporary restraining order was granted. Before the scheduled preliminary injunction hearing, the Forest Service suspended the permit and submitted the legal question of Burlington Northern\u2019s right of access to the Attorney General. The case lay dormant until Attorney General Civiletti issued his opinion. Op. Att\u2019y Gen., slip at 1 (June 23,1980). Of the three theories given in support of Burlington Northern\u2019s right of access, the Attorney General rejected two \u2014 that there is a right of access under the Forest Service Organic Administrative Act of 1897, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 478, and that Burlington Northern has an easement by necessity \u2014 but left open the issue whether Burlington Northern has an implied easement under the Northern Pacific Land Grant of 1864.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">After the Attorney General\u2019s opinion was issued, the Forest Service reconsidered the case, and reinstated the permit on the grounds that Burlington Northern had an assured right of access under the 1864 land grant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties immediately filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the assured access issue. The district court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion and granted the defendants\u2019 partial summary judgment motion. The order for partial summary judgment was designated as final for purposes of appeal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">During the pendency of this appeal, construction of an access road through the Buck Creek drainage has proceeded to such an extent that it is unclear whether completion of the road will cause any more environmental damage than has occurred already.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In any case, the appeal is not moot because the construction of access roads through the Yellow Mules drainage has not yet begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">The sole issue on appeal is whether Burlington Northern has a right of access across federal land to its inholdings of timberland. Appellees contend that the recently enacted Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (Alaska Lands Act), Pub.L. No. 96-487, 94 Stat. 2371 (1980), establishes an independent basis for affirming the judgment of the district court. They argue that \u00a7 1323(a) of the Act requires that the Secretary of Agriculture provide access to Burlington Northern for its enclosed land.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-13\">Section 1323 is a part of the administrative provisions, Title XIII, of the Alaska Lands Act. Appellees argue that it is the only section of the Act which applies to the entire country; appellants argue that, like the rest of the Act, it applies only to Alaska. Section 1323 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-14\">Sec. 1323. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary of Agriculture may prescribe, the Secretary shall provide such access to nonfederally owned land within the boundaries of the National Forest System as the Secretary deems adequate to secure to the owner the reasonable use and enjoyment thereof: <em>Provided, </em>That such owner comply with rules and regulations applicable to ingress and egress to or from the National Forest System.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-16\">(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and subject to such terms and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>conditions as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe, the Secretary shall provide such access to nonfederally owned land surrounded by public lands managed by the Secretary under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701-82) as the Secretary deems adequate to secure to the owner the responsible use and enjoyment thereof: <em>Provided, </em>That such owner comply with rules and regulations applicable to access across public lands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">This section provides for access to non-federally-owned lands surrounded by certain kinds of federal lands. Subsection (b) deals with access to nonfederal lands \u201csurrounded by public lands managed by the Secretary [of the Interior].\u201d Section 102(3) of the Act defines \u201cpublic lands\u201d as certain lands \u201csituated in Alaska.\u201d Subsection (b), therefore, is arguably limited by its terms to Alaska, though we do not find it necessary to settle that issue here. Our consideration of the scope of \u00a7 1323(a) proceeds under the assumption that \u00a7 1323(b) is limited to Alaska.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">Subsection (a) deals with access to non-federally-owned lands \u201cwithin the boundaries of the National Forest System.\u201d The term \u201cNational Forest System\u201d is not specifically defined in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">The question before the court is whether the term \u201cNational Forest System\u201d as used in \u00a7 1323(a) is to be interpreted as being limited to national forests in Alaska or as including the entire United States. We note at the outset that the bare language of \u00a7 1323(a) does not, when considered by itself, limit the provision of access to Alaskan land. We must look, however, to the context of the section to determine its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">Elsewhere in the Act, Congress used the term \u201cNational Forest System\u201d in a context which refers to and deals with national forests in Alaska. Title V of the Act is entitled \u201cNational Forest System.\u201d Section 501(a) states: \u201cThe following units of the National Forest System are hereby expanded . . . . \u201d It is not unreasonable to read Section 1323(a) as referring to the \u201cNational Forest System\u201d in the context in which it is used in Title V of the Act, rather than to all national forests in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">Congress did, however, supply us with a general definition of the term in another statute. Pub. Law 93-378, 88 Stat. 480 (1974). 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1609(a) states <em>inter alia </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-11\">Congress declares that the National Forest System consists of units of federally owned forest, range, and related lands throughout the United States and its territories, united into a nationally significant system dedicated to the long-term benefit for present and future generations, and that it is the purpose of their section to include all such areas into one integral system. The \u2018National Forest System\u2019 shall include all national forest lands reserved or withdrawn from the public domain of the United States, ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQhi\">Application of this definition to \u00a7 1323(a) would necessarily yield the conclusion that the section was intended to have nationwide effect. This seems especially so when Congress uses the term \u201cNational Forest System\u201d in \u00a7 1323(a) without limitation or qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-12\">As the parties agreed at oral argument, however, \u00a7 1323(b) is <em>in pari materia </em>with \u00a7 1323(a). The two subsections are placed together in the same section, and use not only a parallel structure but many of the same words and phrases. The natural interpretation is that they were meant to have the same effect, one on lands controlled by the Secretary of Agriculture, the other on lands controlled by the Secretary of the Interior. Since we assume that \u00a7 1323(b), by definition of public lands in \u00a7 102(3), applies only to Alaskan land, we face a presumption that \u00a7 1323(a) was meant to apply to Alaska as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-13\">That interpretation is supported by a review of the entire Act which discloses no other provision having nation-wide application.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>guage of the Act provides tentative support for the view that \u00a7 1323(a) applies only to national forests in Alaska. Bearing in mind that \u201c[ajbsent a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary, [the statutory] language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive,\u201d <em>Consumer Product Safety Com</em>mission v. <em>GTE Sylvania, </em>447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980), we turn to the legislative history,</p>\n<p id=\"a0h-dedup-0\">The legislative history concerning \u00a7 1323 is surprisingly sparse.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The report 0f the Senate committee which drafted the section is ambiguous.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At times when the Senate could have been expected to comment on its intention to make a major <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>change in current law, it did not.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The only expression of intent that \u00a7 1323 apply nation-wide came from a single senator eight days after the Alaska Lands Act was passed by Congress.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the House debates, three representatives suggested that \u00a7 1323 did apply nation-wide, but the chairman of one of the responsible committees said it did not.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Two chairmen of House subcommittees responsible for the bill did state in a letter to the Attorney General that they believed that \u00a7 1323 applied nation-wide, but there is no indication that the contents of this letter were generally known by members of the House, and so the letter carries little weight in our analysis.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> All <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>this gives only slight support at best to the appellees\u2019 interpretation that \u00a7 1323 applies nation-wide.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">The appellees, however, have uncovered subsequent legislative history that, given the closeness of the issue, is decisive. Three weeks after Congress passed the Alaska Lands Act, a House-Senate Conference Committee considering the Colorado Wilderness Act interpreted \u00a7 1323 of the Alaska Lands Act as applying nation-wide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlaL\">Section 7 of the Senate amendment contains a provision pertaining to access to non-Federally owned lands within national forest wilderness areas in Colorado. The House bill has no such provision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1s\">\n<em>The conferees agreed to delete the section because similar language has already passed Congress in Section 1S23 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">H.R.Rep.No.1521, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., 126 Cong.Rec. H11687 (daily ed. Dec. 3, 1980) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">This action was explained to both Houses during discussion of the Conference Report. <em>See </em>126 Cong.Rec. S15571 (daily ed. Dec. 4, 1980) (remarks of Sen. Hart); <em>Id. </em>at S15573 (remarks of Sen. Armstrong); <em>Id. </em>at H11705 (daily ed. Dec. 3, 1980) (remarks of Rep. Johnson). Both houses then passed the Colorado Wilderness bill as it was reported by the Conference Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">Although a subsequent conference report is not entitled to the great weight given subsequent legislation, <em>Consumer Product Safety Commission v. GTE </em>Sylvania, <em>477 </em>U.S. 102, 118 n.13, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2061 n.13, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980), it is still entitled to significant weight, <em>Seatrain Shipbuilding Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., </em>444 U.S. 572, 100 S.Ct. 800, 814, 63 L.Ed.2d 36 (1980), particularly where it is clear that the conferees had carefully considered the issue. <em>See Consumer Product Safety Commission, supra, </em>at 120, 100 S.Ct. at 2062; <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 164, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944). The conferees, including Representatives Udall and Sieberling and Senator Melcher, had an intimate knowledge of the Alaska Lands Act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, the Conference Committee\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1323 was the basis for their decision to leave out an access provision passed by one house. In these circumstances, the Conference Committee\u2019s interpretation is very persuasive. We conclude that it tips the balance decidedly in favor of the broader interpretation of \u00a7 1323.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We therefore hold that Burlington Northern has an assured right of access to its land pursuant to the nation-wide grant of access in \u00a7 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-14\">The federal appellees argue that the passage of the Alaska Lands Act moots this appeal and that this court is accordingly required to dismiss it and vacate the partial summary judgment of the district court. <em>See Great Western Sugar Co. v. Nelson, </em>442 U.S. 92, 93-94, 99 S.Ct. 2149, 2150, 60 L.Ed.2d 735 (1979). The private appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>argue that the Alaska Lands Act is at most an alternate ground for upholding the partial summary judgment, and so would not moot the appeal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">We conclude that the Alaska Lands Act did not moot this appeal, but is merely an alternate ground for upholding the district court. The enactment of new law during an appeal \u201cordinarily calls simply for application of the new law.\u201d Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction \u00a7 3533 at 276. The exception is that an attack on a statute will be mooted by new legislation which eliminates the aspects of the old law which gave rise to the challenge. <em>Id. </em>at 276-78. <em>See, e. g., Allee v. Medrano, </em>416 U.S. 802, 94 S.Ct. 2191, 40 L.Ed.2d 566 (1974); <em>Diffenderfer v. Central Baptist Church, </em>404 U.S. 412, 92 S.Ct. 574, 30 L.Ed.2d 567 (1972). Here the new legislation, the Alaska Lands Act, did not render pointless the resolution of the access issue raised by Montana Wilderness in its complaint below, as happens when an attacked statute is repealed. The new legislation in this case merely provided a new ground for resolving the access issue on appeal. We therefore find that this appeal is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">The partial summary judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED and the case REMANDED to the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1012-14\">.

If Burlington Northern does not have an enforceable right of access, the protected status of the federal land may remove the Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s usual discretion to grant access over Forest Service land. Section 3(a), Montana Wilderness Study Act, Pub.L. 95-150, 91 Stat. 1243 (1977). Burlington Northern\u2019s remedy would be the eventual exchange of its in-holdings for other federal land of comparable value. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1134(a); H.R.Rep.

The appellees concede that no other section of the Act applies nationwide. They argue, however, that because another provision of the Act, \u00a7 1110(b), gives access rights to all Alas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>kan inholders, \u00a7 1323(a) is superfluous unless it is interpreted to apply to the entire country. Section 1110(b), they argue, like \u00a7 1323(b), applies only to Alaska because it uses terms, \u201cpublic lands\u201d and \u201cconservation system unit,\u201d which are defined to include only Alaskan land.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">The flaw in appellees\u2019 argument is that however \u00a7 1323(a) is interpreted, \u00a7 1110(b) essentially duplicates the protection given Alaskan lands by \u00a7 1323 as a whole. Section 1110(b) overlaps \u00a7 1323(b) just as much as it overlaps \u00a7 1323(a). If, as appellees claim, \u00a7 1110(b) gives access to all Alaskan inholders and \u00a7 1323(a) gives access to holders of land surrounded by land administered by the Secretary of Agriculture, the inclusion of \u00a7 1323(b) in the Act makes no sense at all. Section 1323(b), after all, gives access to holders of Alaskan land surrounded by land administered by the Secretary of the Interior. Under this view, not only is \u00a7 1323(b) superfluous in light of \u00a7 1110(b), it is paired with a provision, \u00a7 1323(a), of parallel structure but widely different scope. We do not see how the existence of \u00a7 1110(b) gives much support to the appel-lees\u2019 position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">.

The Energy Committee report discussed it in its section-by-section analysis, S.Rep.No.96-413 at 310, [Feb. 1981] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News at 9314. (The Committee analysis mixes up \u00a7\u00a7 1323 and 1324. Thus, the analysis entitled \u00a7 1324 is really concerned with \u00a7 1323 and vice versa.) Although the appellees contend that the language of the Energy Committee report makes perfectly clear the Committee\u2019s intent that \u00a7 1323 apply nationwide, we do not find their interpretation of the report\u2019s language persuasive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-8\">This section is designed to remove the uncertainties surrounding the status of the rights of the owners of non-Federal lands to gain access to such lands across Federal lands. It has been the Committee\u2019s understanding that such owners had the right of access to their lands subject to reasonable regulation by either, the Secretary of Agriculture in the case of national forests, or by the Secretary of the Interior in the case of public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. However, a recent District Court decision in Utah <em>(Utah v. Andrus et al., </em>C79-0037, October 1, 1979, D.C. Utah) has cast some doubt over the status of these rights.

The problem raised in the first paragraph \u2014 the differing interpretations of the law of access \u2014 is not confined to Alaska, but the scope of the remedy as set forth in the last paragraph could be so confined. As with \u00a7 1323 itself, the report uses indiscriminately terms defined in the Act as applying only to Alaskan land (\u201cpublic land\u201d) and terms not so defined (\u201cNational Forests\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-13\">The absence of any reference to Alaska is not of much import. The report\u2019s discussion of other access provisions such as \u00a7 1110 and \u00a7 1111, which all parties agree apply only to Alaska, fails to mention Alaska and is as ambiguous about whether \u00a7 1110 and \u00a7 1111 apply nationwide as is the discussion of \u00a7 1323.

The Alaska Lands bill was discussed endlessly on the Senate floor. There are numerous occasions when one would expect a change in current laws of access of the magnitude of the appellees\u2019 proposed interpretation of \u00a7 1323 to be discussed, mentioned or at least alluded to. Yet we have not found in the Senate debates, and appellees have not called to our attention, one single suggestion that anything in the Alaska Land Bill would affect access rights in the rest of the country. In Senator Tsongas\u2019 long, detailed comparison of his substitute bill with the Energy Committee bill, \u00a7 1323 is not mentioned. 126 Cong.Rec. SI 1193 (daily ed. Aug. 19, 1980). In discussion about the adequacy of the substitute bill\u2019s access provisions (which include \u00a7 1323) no mention is made of a change in the law of access for the rest of the country. 126 Cong.Rec. SI 1061-62 (daily ed. Aug. 18, 1980) .</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">Neither did Senator Tsongas remark on \u00a7 1323 when it was first proposed in the Energy Committee bill, even though in his statement in the Committee report he spends several pages criticizing the bill\u2019s overbroad provisions on access. S.Rep.No.96-413 at 422-24, [Feb. 1981] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 9422-23 (additional views of Senators Metzenbaum and Tsongas). Yet the extension of \u00a7 1323(a) to the entire country would certainly have a greater impact than the other measures he discusses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">. Senator Melcher, the author of the section, discussed it on the floor of the Senate, 126 Cong.Rec. S14770-71 (daily ed. Nov. 20, 1980). The remarks of Senator Melcher, however, were made on November 20th, eight days after Congress passed H.R. 39. His remarks clearly demonstrate that his personal understanding of the section is that it applies nationwide, but because they are the remarks of but one senator made subsequent to the passage of the bill they do not provide a reliable indication of the understanding of the Senate as a whole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1016-9\">. On October 2, 1980, Representative Udall, chairman of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs which had joint responsibility for the bill, introduced an amendment one section of which was to \u201cmake clear that [the bill] applies only to Alaska.\u201d 127 Cong.Rec. 10376 (daily ed. October 2, 1980). This amendment was never adopted. Representative Udall subsequently declared in prepared remarks inserted into the Congressional Record that although the final version of the bill was \u201cambiguously drafted and not expressly limited to Alaskan lands, the House believes that, as with all the other provisions of the bill, the language of the section applies only to lands within the State of Alaska.\u201d 126 Cong.Rec. H10549 (daily ed. Nov. 12, 1980). Representative Weaver stated that the section granting access rights to in-holders on national forest and BLM lands \u201capparently applies not only to Alaska but also to the entire United States.\u201d 126 Cong.Rec. H8638 (daily ed. September 9, 1980). Representative Sieberling inserted into the record a summary of proposed amendments, which refers to Section 1323 as the \u201cnationwide access amendment.\u201d 126 Cong.Rec. H10350 (daily ed. October 2, 1980). Representative AuCoin stated that one of the flaws of the final bill is that it \u201cgrants private inholders carte blanche access across national forest and public lands nationwide.\u201d 126 Cong.Rec. H10529-30 (daily ed. Nov. 12, 1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1016-12\">. Appellees rely heavily upon an exchange of letters between Representatives Sieberling and Weaver, chairmen of the subcommittees responsible for the bill (Public Lands of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and Forest of the Committee on Agriculture), and the Attorney General\u2019s office. In their letter, the representatives express concern over \u00a7 1323, which they state applies nationwide, and ask for a clarification of how different the \u00a7 1323 access language is from existing access provisions. It is indeed clear from their letter that they believed that \u00a7 1323 applies nation-wide.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-13\">Appellees argue, on the basis of the September 5, 1980 return letter from Assistant Attorney General Alan Parker, that the Department of Justice confirmed this interpretation of \u00a7 1323. We interpret the letter differently. As we read the letter, the Assistant Attorney General assumed without analysis that the representatives\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 1323 was correct, and proceeded to discuss in detail the effect of such a change in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-14\">The exchanged letters are entitled to little weight. In general, off-the-record views of congressmen are not attributed to Congress as a whole. See <em>T. V. A. v. Hill, </em>437 U.S. 153, 190-91, 98 S.ct. 2279, 2299-30, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978). This is particularly true where, as here, there is no indication that the House as a whole was aware of the correspondence. <em>Id. </em>at 191-92, 98 S.Ct. at 2300.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">. The participation of Representative Udali is particularly noteworthy since he was the one congressman to proclaim in the legislative history of the Alaska Lands Act that \u00a7 1323 applied only to Alaska.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1017-11\">. We recognize a facial problem or tension between 1323(a) and a portion of \u00a7 5(a) of the Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1134(a). We need not decide in this case whether there is repeal by implication. In passing, we note only that it is arguable that the two can stand together. \u00a7 1134(a) deals specifically with right of access \u2018[i]n any case where State-owned or privately-owned land is completely surrounded by national forest lands <em>within areas designated by this chapter as wilderness </em>.. .. \u2019 (emphasis added). \u00a7 1323(a), on the other hand, deals with \u2018... access to non-federally owned land within the boundaries of the National Forest System ... \u2019 \u00a7 1134(a) is addressed specifically to an area designated as \u2018wilderness,\u2019 while \u00a7 1323(a) is addressed to National Forest System lands in general. In cases involving wilderness areas, the Secretary has the option of exchanging land of equal value so that the wilderness area may be preserved. Thus, \u00a7 1134(a) could be construed to apply in the specific case of a wilderness area, and \u00a7 1323(a) could be construed to apply in all other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-16\">Whether or not they are in fact irreconcilable we leave to another case when the issue is squarely presented for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">. The private appellees also claim that this court should decide the land grant issue. A right of access under the 1864 land grant is \u201cbroader\u201d than a right of access under the Alaska Lands Act, they contend, because it could not be rescinded. We need not decide the issue whether Burlington Northern has access under the 1864 land grant. Burlington Northern has not identified any respect in which its current right of access under the land grant would be any different than access under the Alaska Lands Act. Since this appeal arose on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the issue whether Burlington Northern has a current right to access, the question of access upon a hypothetical future event, the repeal of the statutory right of access, is not before us for decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
