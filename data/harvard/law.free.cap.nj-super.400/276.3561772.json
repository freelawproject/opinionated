Under those policies, \u201can insured\u201d included others for whom American Wrecking was \u201cperforming operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">These consolidated declaratory judgment actions concern claims for insurance coverage by American Wrecking and these additional insureds for whom American Wrecking was performing demolition: DSM Nutritional Products, Inc. (\u201cDSM\u201d), Torcon, Inc., New Jersey Economic Development Authority (\u201cNJEDA\u201d), and Technology Center of New Jersey (\u201cTCNJ\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">The underlying personal injury claims were filed by three workers who alleged that they were injured while employed by Island Scrap Metal (\u201cIsland\u201d) or SECO American Wrecking Corp. (\u201cSECO\u201d), both sister companies of American Wrecking, and both also additional insureds under the policies. Two of the workers alleged they were injured on DSM\u2019s worksite due to the negligence of DSM and American Wrecking. The other worker alleged that he was injured at the NJEDA/TCNJ worksite, where Torcon was the general contractor, as a result of the negligence of those parties and American Wrecking.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">The insurance polices in force when the accidents occurred contained a \u201ccross liability\u201d coverage exclusion for, among other things, personal injury to an \u201cemployee of any insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, orders were entered requiring Burlington to provide coverage despite the \u201ccross liability\u201d exclusion. The trial court found the exclusion unambiguous but inconsistent with the insureds\u2019 reasonable expectations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>public policy. We reverse and remand for entry of summary judgment in favor of Burlington.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">American Wrecking is a New Jersey corporation involved in high-risk demolition projects. Burlington is a surplus lines insurer. In 2001, Burlington issued a comprehensive general liability (\u201cCGL\u201d) policy to American Wrecking. This insurance was obtained by American Wrecking\u2019s agent, NIA Insurance Group (\u201cNIA\u201d), a licensed insurance broker in New Jersey, through a surplus lines agent, Partners Specialty Group (\u201cPSG\u201d), that represented Burlington. Coverage under this policy, which did not include the \u201ccross-liability\u201d exclusion, ended on November 14, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">On October 14, 2002, NIA sent an application to PSG for renewal of the CGL policy. On November 18, 2002, PSG provided NLA with a \u201cQUOTE\u201d for issuance of the policy which listed a number of exclusions, including an exclusion for \u201ccross suits.\u201d Negotiations ensued during which NIA asked for a number of changes, including deletion of the \u201ccross suits\u201d exclusion. Although PSG agreed to a number of NLA\u2019s requested changes, ultimately reducing the premium from about $138,000 to $85,000, it refused to delete the \u201ccross suits\u201d exclusion. The \u201cQUOTE\u201d emphasized that copies of all of the insurance company\u2019s forms would be made \u201cavailable upon request.\u201d Had NLA requested the \u201ccross suits\u201d form it would have received the form entitled \u201ccross liability.\u201d After the policy was issued, NLA continued to negotiate for and obtain changes in the coverage provided. This policy provided coverage, with a subsequent extension, from November 24, 2002 to December 24,2003.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The \u201ccross liability\u201d exclusion reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">EXCLUSION \u2014 CROSS LIABILITY</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">This endorsement modifies insurance provided under the following:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE PART</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">This insurance does not apply to any actual \u201cbodily injury\u201d, \u201cproperty damage\u201d, \u201cpersonal injury\u201d, or \u201cadvertising injury\u201d to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">3. A present, former, future or prospective partner, officer, director, stockholder <em>or employee of any insured',</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-11\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">The CGL form includes the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-13\">7. Separation of Insureds</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-14\">Except with respect to the Limits of Insurance, and any rights or duties specifically assigned in this Coverage Part to the first Named Insured, this insurance applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-15\">a. As if each Named Insured were the only Named Insured; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-16\">b. Separately to each insured against whom claim is made or \u201csuit\u201d is brought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-17\">The policy also contains this provision defining additional insureds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoe\">ADDITIONAL INSURED \u2014 OWNERS, LESSEES OR CONTRACTORS \u2014 AUTOMATIC STATUS WHEN REQUIRED IN CONSTRUCTION AGREEMENT WITH YOU</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-18\">This endorsement modifies insurance provided under the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeD\">COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE PART</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As\">A.

Such person or organization is an additional insured only with respect to liability arising out of your ongoing operations performed for that insured. A person\u2019s or organization\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>status as an insured under this endorsement ends when your operations for that insured are completed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">These provisions appear without change in the third policy, which provided coverage from December 24, 2003 to December 24, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">American Wrecking\u2019s contracts with Torcon and DSM required American Wrecking to obtain liability insurance coverage for them from an insurance company licensed to do business in New Jersey, not from a surplus lines insurer, such as Burlington.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The underlying personal injury claims arose from accidents occurring on the following dates: November 1 and 17, 2003 (both at the DSM site), and July 1, 2004 (at the NJEDA/TCNJ site). The injured parties alleged that their injuries resulted from negligent maintenance of the sites and that at the time of the accidents they were employees of Island or SECO, both sister corporations of American Wrecking, and both additional insureds under the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">We consider first the insureds\u2019 claim, which was rejected by the trial court, that the exclusion was ambiguous and ought to be construed so as to provide coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"AZW\">In general, insurance policies are liberally construed to afford coverage that any fair interpretation will allow. <em>Longobardi v. Chubb Ins. Co. of N.J., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>530, 537, 582 A.2d 1257 (1990) (citation omitted). But \u201cthe words of an insurance policy should be given their ordinary meaning, and in the absence of ambiguity, a court should not engage in a strained construction to support the imposition of liability.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted). Thus, our role does not include writing \u201cfor the insured a better policy of insurance than the one purchased.\u201d <em>Walker Rogge, Inc. v. Chelsea Title &amp; Guar. Co., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>517, 529, 562 A.2d 208 (1989) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">When considering an exclusion of coverage, any ambiguity \u201cmust be strictly construed against the insurer so that reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>ably anticipated coverage is provided.\u201d <em>Argent v. Brady, </em>386 <em>N.J.Super. </em>343, 351, 901 A.2d 419 (App.Div.2006) (citations omitted). And \u201cthe burden is on the insurer to bring the case within the exclusion.\u201d <em>Princeton Ins. Co. v. Chunmuang, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>80, 95, 698 A.2d 9 (1997) (citation omitted). But \u201cexclusions are presumptively valid and will be given effect if specific, plain, clear, prominent and not contrary to public policy.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The context in which the issue arises is important, and our review must take into account that we are dealing with policies \u201ccovering commercial risks procured through a broker, and thus involving parties on both sides of the bargaining table who were sophisticated with regard to insurance.\u201d <em>Werner Indus., Inc. v. First State Ins. Co., </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>30, 38, 548 A.2d 188 (1988). Nor can we lose sight of the fact that the insureds were engaged in high risk enterprises for which insurance could only be obtained from a surplus lines carrier. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>17:22-6.40 to 6.65; <em>R .R. Roofing &amp; Building Supply Co., Inc. v. Fin. Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>384, 389, 427 A.2d 66 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">With those principles in mind, we turn to the \u201ccross liability\u201d exclusion at issue, which states, in pertinent part, that the insurance does not apply to personal or bodily injuries suffered by an \u201cemployee of any insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Standing by itself, the phrase \u201cemployee of any insured\u201d is crystal clear. In short, \u201cany\u201d does not mean \u201cthe\u201d insured, it means \u201cany\u201d insured, which, of course, is its ordinary meaning. In <em>Argent v. Brady, supra, </em>386 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 351-52, 901 A.2d 419, we construed an exclusion that referred to \u201can insured\u201d as meaning \u201cany insured\u201d and found it to be fully enforceable \u201cas it was doubtlessly intended, to exclude from coverage any liability resulting from the business pursuits of a covered person, regardless of whether the person sued was engaged in those business pursuits.\u201d In rejecting the insured\u2019s construction of \u201can\u201d insured, we made the following observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>That the use of the word \u201cany\u201d could be perceived by some as making the exclusion clearer, does not make the language that was chosen [\u201can\u201d] ambiguous. Language in a policy of insurance is genuinely ambiguous only if the phrasing of the policy is so confusing that the average policyholder cannot make out the boundaries of coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-4\"><em>[Id. </em>at 353, 901 A.2d 419 (quotation and citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">And in <em>Rena, Inc. v. Brien, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>304, 321, 708 A.2d 747 (App.Div.1998), we held that the phrase \u201cany insured\u201d was unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The insureds claim that ambiguity was introduced into the policy by the clause entitled \u201c7. Separation of Insured,\u201d which is quoted above. In essence that clause, more generally referred to as a \u201cseverability clause,\u201d provides that \u201c[e]xcept with respect to the Limits of Insurance ... this insurance applies ... [a]s if each Named Insured were the only Named Insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">In <em>Argent, supra, </em>386 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 353-55, 901 A.2d 419, we considered the effect of a severability clause on a policy exclusion that applies to the acts of \u201can\u201d or \u201cany\u201d insured. After thoroughly reviewing the decisions in other jurisdictions, we concluded that a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN\">severability clause is not denominated a \u201ccoverage provision,\u201d and it would be unreasonable to find that it operated independently in that capacity to increase the insurance afforded under the insuring provisions of the policy, or to partially nullify existing coverage exclusions. The purpose of severability clauses is to spread protection, to the limits of coverage, among all the ... insureds. The purpose is not to negate bargained-for exclusions which are plainly worded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 355, 901 A.2d 419 (quotation and citations omitted)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Consequently, we reject the insureds\u2019 contention that this policy exclusion was ambiguous, and turn to the question of whether it failed to meet the insureds\u2019 reasonable expectations or otherwise violated public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">In <em>Nunn v. Franklin Mutual Insurance Co., </em>274 <em>N.J.Super. </em>543, 549-50, 644 A.2d 1111 (App.Div.1994), we considered application of the reasonable expectations doctrine in the context of commercial policies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-11\">There is some authority for the proposition that \u201cif an insured\u2019s \u2018reasonable expectations\u2019 contravene the plain meaning of a policy, even its plain meaning can be overcome.\u201d <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>165, 175, 607 A.2d 1255 (1992) (quoting <em>Werner Indus. v. First State Ins. Co., </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>30, 35-36, 548 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>A.2d 188 (1988)). On the other hand, the same Court held in <em>State v. Signo Trading Intern., Inc., </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>51, 612 A.2d 932 (1992), that \u201ccourts should resort to the doctrine of reasonable expectations only when \u2018the phrasing of the policy is so confusing that the average policyholder cannot make out the boundaries of coverage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 612 A.2d 932 (quoting <em>Weedo [v. Stone-E-Brick, Inc.], supra, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>[233J at 246-47, 405 A.2d 788 [(1979)]). The two concepts are not easily reconcilable. The <em>Signo </em>Court did not attempt to distinguish <em>Voorhees.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-4\">However, we believe the distinction between the holdings in the two eases is explained by the type of policy being scrutinized by the Court in each case. In <em>Voorhees, </em>the Court was interpreting a homeowners policy, whereas the <em>Signo </em>Court was interpreting a commercial policy. The justification for treating the former more liberally than the latter is based upon the relative sophistication of the insureds: a homeowner is a less sophisticated consumer than a commercial insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We find <em>Nunn </em>persuasive, and therefore conclude that since we are dealing with a commercial policy and since the cross-liability exclusion is unambiguous, the insureds\u2019 reasonable expectations were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">We also reject the insureds\u2019 claim that the cross-liability exclusion violates public policy. For, as the Court noted in <em>State, Department of Environmental Protection v. Signo Trading International, Inc., </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>51, 66, 612 A.2d 932 (1992), \u201cpublic policy considerations alone are not sufficient to permit a finding of coverage in an insurance contract when its plain language cannot fairly be read to otherwise provide that coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The remaining arguments raised by the insureds are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Reversed and remanded for entry of summary judgment dismissing with prejudice all of the coverage claims against Burlington.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\"> NIA's brief argues that the \"cross liability\u201d endorsement was not a negotiated term and is different from a \"cross suit\u201d endorsement. At argument, NIA put it more forcefully, saying that this endorsement was \u201csnuck\u201d into the policy. Even assuming the endorsements differ, NIA was still bound by the terms of the policy, as was American Wrecking. <em>Edwards v. Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Co., </em>357 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>196, 204, 814 <em>A.2d </em>1115 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>278, 822 A.2d 608 (2003). Since NIA continued to negotiate after receiving the policy with the \"cross liability\u201d endorsement, and since the accidents happened quite some time later, there was no prejudice and the policy terms govern. We note that NIA's argument on this point included no citation to any authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\"> The trial court did not rule on DSM's claim that Burlington's denial of coverage constituted bad faith. Since we have sustained the exclusion on which Burlington relied, the bad faith claim must also be dismissed with prejudice. <em>Pickett v. Lloyd's &amp; Peerless Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>457, 473, 621 A.2d 445 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
