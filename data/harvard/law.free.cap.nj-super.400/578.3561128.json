The Board adopted a written decision of the Commissioner of Education dated March 15, 2007. The Commissioner concluded that the Golden Door Charter School, and not the School District of the City of Jersey City, was responsible for paying the cost of a regular course of home instruction offered to a handicapped student enrolled in the char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>ter school. For the reasons stated in the Commissioner\u2019s decision, we affirm the Board\u2019s final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">The decision under review is supported by the record and consistent with the plain language of the controlling statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:36A-11b. <em>See Dore v. Bd. of Educ. of the Twp. of Bedminster, </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>447, 453, 449 A.2d 547 (App.Div.1982). The pertinent paragraph provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">A charter school shall comply with the provisions of chapter 46 <em>[N.J.S. </em>18A:46-1 to -53] of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes concerning the provision of services to handicapped students; <em>except </em>that the fiscal responsibility for any student currently enrolled in or determined to require a <em>private day or residential school </em>shall remain with the district of residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>18A:36A-11b (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">The Commissioner and the Board correctly concluded that this statute requires a charter school to bear the cost of educating a disabled child. There is a limited exception that applies to the cost of a \u201cprivate day or residential school,\u201d but that exception is not implicated in this case. Golden Door\u2019s child study team recommended a program of in-home instruction for this student. He was neither \u201ccurrently enrolled in [nor] determined to require a private day or residential school.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:36A-11b.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b610-9\"> An amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:36A-11b, enacted to take effect after the Commissioner\u2019s decision in this case, gives a school district an opportunity to challenge a \u201cprivate day or residential placement.\" <em>L. </em>2007, c. 260, \u00a7 57 (effective Jan. 13, 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
