After carefully considering plaintiffs arguments in light of the applicable law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">The following is a summary of the facts relevant to this appeal. Plaintiff began working as Security Operations Manager for New Jersey Transit (NJT) in August 2001. Defendant Frank Fittipoldi, the Director of Organization Services for NJT, hired and supervised plaintiff. After she was hired, plaintiff learned that Gateways Security, Inc., the contract provider of security services for NJT, was actually her employer, although Fittipoldi had represented that the job was \u201ca Transit position,\u201d meaning that she would be an NJT employee. Plaintiff maintains that she would not have left her previous job if she had known she would not be an NJT employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Under its contract, Gateway provided NJT with a security manager, but that position did not include a pension or health benefits. Fittipoldi recommended that plaintiff be hired but claimed that it was Gateway\u2019s decision to hire her, not his. Gateway paid plaintiffs salary. Kurus Elavia, CEO of Gateway, corroborated Fittipoldi\u2019s testimony, stating that under Gateway\u2019s contract with NJT, he (Elavia) \u201chad the right to decide on the identity\u201d of the NJT security manager, but that NJT could veto his choice or request a replacement. Plaintiff testified that after she learned she was actually a Gateway employee, Fittipoldi assured her the job would be \u201cmoving under\u201d NJT in three to six months and that she would have NJT benefits. Fittipoldi disputed that statement and recalled that plaintiff said she did not need benefits because she had them from her prior employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Regardless of who was her actual employer, plaintiff worked in an office that was owned, controlled, operated, decorated and managed by NJT. She used NJT equipment and telephone service and was directly supervised by Fittipoldi.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">When she was hired, plaintiffs responsibilities included supervision of twelve security personnel in Newark and Maplewood. She instituted training, raised standards, enhanced and updated guidelines and manuals, established a tiered pay scale to attract and retain better employees, terminated workers who did not improve their performance, upgraded equipment and prepared a business plan for the security office. Her responsibilities were expanded to include NJT\u2019s Kearny facility and the NJT concourse in New York\u2019s Penn Station. During her tenure, plaintiff hired additional personnel, increasing her staff to forty-five employees. Plaintiff testified that she \u201cdiscussed everything\u201d with Fittipoldi and that he participated in and approved plaintiffs assignments and proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Fittipoldi acknowledged that plaintiff worked in NJT\u2019s offices, using NJT\u2019s equipment and that he controlled her work. He indicated that although he commented on her performance, he never gave her a formal evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>In September 2001, Fittipoldi formally proposed converting plaintiffs position to NJT. In October 2001, he recommended to his supervisor, Frank Hopper, Assistant Executive Director for Procurement, that NJT establish \u201can in-house security operations manager.\u201d Hopper agreed but noted that there was \u201ca formal process of establishing jobs\u201d at NJT.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In November 2001, plaintiff inquired about the status of the NJT position. Fittipoldi assured her that \u201ceverybody was on board\u201d and that the transfer was \u201ca formality.\u201d By February 2002, however, Fittipoldi was equivocal about the transfer of the position and it became \u201ca constant topic of discussion\u201d between Fittipoldi and plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In the Spring of 2002, Fittipoldi told plaintiff that the Board had approved the job but that it \u201chad to pass the budget\u201d and \u201cwas in Mr. Hopper\u2019s hands.\u201d Fittipoldi explained that when he added the position to the budget in 2002, he was \u201cfairly confident that it would be done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">In the summer of 2002, however, Hopper told Fittipoldi that he could not recommend the new position because of \u201csignificant budgetary problems.\u201d In August 2002, Fittipoldi told plaintiff that NJT was discussing downsizing and it was not a good time to push for the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">On August 15, 2002, shortly after plaintiff learned that her position would not be transferred to NJT, plaintiff was advised by the Newark building supervisor that he saw some schematics that were discarded in a bin on the loading dock of the Newark building. Dan Sattazahn, the security operations supervisor who reported to plaintiff, accompanied plaintiff to the area where they found four recycling bins loaded with blueprints or schematics for bridges, tunnels, a new rail operations center, underground gas lines, and building specifications, including HVAC, electrical and plumbing schematics.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">Plaintiff was \u201coutraged that this could just be sitting around with nobody there.\u201d She testified that \u201cit was a serious situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>to have these documents there and available to anyone____ [I]t had to at least be some kind of an infraction or violation of policy and some kind of threat to public safety and security____ [T]he documents should not be left where anyone can get them.\u201d Because NJT shared this area with other building tenants, plaintiff was concerned that anyone could enter the loading area and retrieve the discarded plans and schematics. Sattazahn believed that \u201cthis was a disturbing display of gross negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Neither Fittipoldi nor Hopper were at work on the day plaintiff discovered the discarded plans and schematics on the loading dock. Consequently, plaintiff contacted Gwen Watson, NJT\u2019s Executive Secretary, who was acting as Executive Director that day. When Watson learned of the discarded documents, she called Peter Saklas, Assistant Executive Director of Engineering and Construction. Saklas looked at the documents and said they were \u201cold drawings that we\u2019re throwing out.\u201d Watson believed that \u201cSaklas knew what he was talking about\u201d and was \u201cnot concerned any more.\u201d Sattazahn took custody of the documents and inventoried them.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">The next day, when Fittipoldi returned, plaintiff informed him of the discarded documents. She claimed that he was \u201clivid\u201d and \u201cfurious\u201d that she went to Watson and that he told her, \u201cIf anything ever happens like this again, you come right to me and don\u2019t go to anyone else.\u201d Plaintiff claimed that \u201cthe way he said it was very direct, very loud ... and very mean spirited.\u201d Later that day, plaintiff said Fittipoldi told her that \u201cif somebody wanted to blow up New York Penn Station, they only had to walk in with bombs strapped to them, they didn\u2019t need plans.\u201d Plaintiff claimed that thereafter Fittipoldi did not talk to her for weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">A day or so after plaintiff reported finding the plans and drawings on the loading dock, Hopper asked Fittipoldi to follow up on the complaint and meet with members of Saklas\u2019s staff. Fittipoldi and Saklas asked two members of Saklas\u2019s staff to investigate the issue. Fittipoldi testified that at that meeting</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>we discussed what was depicted on the drawings. One of the things that we discussed was that some of the drawings showed architectural plans of certain train stations, bus depots, platforms, park and rides, and the like, train tracks and so forth. There were a multitude of different things shown on the drawings. We discussed whether any of these items or any of this information might be safety sensitive. No one really knew what that meant. That meant possibly that someone had an opinion that there might be safety implications. We agreed on one thing, that we didn\u2019t know for sure which of the drawings would be safety sensitive. However, many of the drawings that were looked at depicted public areas of public facilities. And the information on the drawings such as structural elements, position[s] of columns, gas pipes entering the facility, ventilation duets for outside air intake and so forth could be \u2014 this information could be ascertained simply by walking through the public areas of these public facilities and observing with the naked eye. So that was something that was prevalent in our discussion, that is we thought what was found in these dumpsters [were] not trade secrets. It was details that could be observed in person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">We talked about the fact that many of these drawings were in the public domain. They were in the hands of various contractors, bidders, subcontractors, railroad historians and train rail fans and buffs that collected drawings of train stations. We also talked about the fact that our procurement department makes those drawings available whenever there is a construction project[,] new or rehab job or something like that[,] in one of these facilities that these drawings are given to bidders, in fact, sold to bidders. We charge them for the copy cost. To any bidder that comes up with a $50 or $100 check any bidder that is willing to come to the facility and pay for the drawings. They also freely copy the drawings and send them out to a multitude of subcontractors to prepare sections of their bids, different elements of the job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">So one of the prevalent sentiments in this meeting was that the drawings put in the dumpster in a secured area was not the most serious part of a potential problem of public safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">We all agreed that there was a larger concern that should be eventually dealt with and that was determining which information and it\u2019s not just drawings, it\u2019s also printed material information about our sites, our operations that might be safety sensitive. This was a matter for police, not building management and not an engineering group and not even exclusively for a procurement and contracts group that provides these drawings to bidders. There would have to bo some kind of collective approach on a much broader scale. So I provided that information to the Transit police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">Fittipoldi testified that he gave information about the drawings and their potential safety risk to Len Diamond, the \u201cDirector of System Intelligence\u201d in NJT\u2019s own police department. \u201c[H]e is the person [in] the police department who is trained on facility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>property threat assessment. So he was the right person to talk to on an issue like this.\u201d Fittipoldi indicated that Diamond \u201cwas satisfied that the loading dock was kept locked up and secured and wasn\u2019t available for public access.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Plaintiff claimed that after Fittipoldi\u2019s meeting with Saklas\u2019s staff, Fittipoldi \u201cstopped by [her] office again to tell [her] that under no circumstances was [she] to go above him in the future.\u201d She testified that his demeanor was \u201ccontrolled\u201d and that \u201che did not raise his voice at me, but I could tell from the look on his face, and from the glint in his eye, that he was deeply angry with me.\u201d Thereafter, plaintiff claims that Fittipoldi stopped talking to her and issued orders directly to the security desk, instead of going through her. She maintained that he excluded her from meetings and began to criticize and embarrass her in public. When she needed a requisition to pay a trainer, she claimed that Fittipoldi misdirected her, sending her to the NJT website and various other departments, when he had the requisition forms in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Some time during the summer of 2002, upper management decided to give plaintiff responsibility for fifty fleet vehicles used by NJT employees. Plaintiff was not happy about the decision and, in a conversation with Fittipoldi, \u201cobjected to security being assigned to the fleet vehicles,\u201d explaining that the \u201cfront desk was overwhelmed right now.\u201d Fittipoldi told her \u201cit was a done deal. He didn\u2019t have any choice about it. It was going to save the company a lot of money.\u201d Plaintiff testified that she \u201cagreed that it was a great idea\u201d but \u201cjust wanted to have some input in[to] how it was implemented.\u201d She claimed that Fittipoldi deliberately excluded her from meetings planning for the transfer of the fleet supervision to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">In the Fall of 2002, Fittipoldi held a meeting to discuss implementation of the fleet transfer program. Plaintiff claimed that Fittipoldi asked her and Sattazahn for feedback about the program and they prepared for the meeting, but that Fittipoldi would not allow her to speak during the meeting. When plaintiff became upset and complained that she was not being permitted to speak, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Fittipoldi called her \u201cobstructionist\u201d and indicated that her \u201cperformance had been slipping of late.\u201d Fittipoldi denied that he commented on plaintiffs performance and testified that plaintiff \u201ccontinued insist[ing] that we do not move ahead with this program because A, she hadn\u2019t been consulted. B, it was inappropriate to use security guards for this function and C, she wasn\u2019t able to hire a driver anyway.\u201d Fittipoldi testified that plaintiff was \u201c[disrespectful, unprofessional, belligerent and obstructionist\u201d at the meeting. He stated that \u201cshe was absolutely refusing to move ahead with the implementation of the fleet program\u201d and her behavior \u201cwas borderline insubordination.\u201d Fittipoldi testified that the \u201cmeeting was a pivotal part of my decision to separate us from Massarano.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In October 2002, plaintiff tape recorded a conversation with Fittipoldi. During that conversation, plaintiff told him that she \u201cneedfed] to know where I am in the organization ... I need to know if I\u2019m in jeopardy, I need to try to plan ---- what I\u2019m supposed to do____\u201d They discussed plaintiffs position being transferred to NJT and Fittipoldi\u2019s budgetary concerns with the transfer approval. During the conversation, Fittipoldi told plaintiff that he thought she was \u201cvery obstructionist\u201d at the meeting, as if she \u201cjust had a chip on [her] shoulder about everything.\u201d He added that when plaintiff continued to resist, he \u201chad enough of it after a while.\u201d Nevertheless, he stated that her \u201cperformance [was] more than acceptable\u201d but that he did not \u201clike the mentality\u201d she had \u201cright now.\u201d Plaintiff continued the discussion, stating that she had \u201clife decisions\u201d to make, that she was \u201coverqualified for the job\u201d and that her \u201cresume was pretty decent.\u201d Ultimately, Fittipoldi told plaintiff \u201c[yjou\u2019ve got the job as long as you want it. [You] [a]lso need, I think to continue to approach [the job] every day as if you\u2019re going to be here forever. I know it\u2019s really hard if you don\u2019t really feel it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">By December of 2002, plaintiffs job transfer to NJT still had not been approved. Plaintiff believed that Fittipoldi \u201cstarted bullying [her] after August\u201d and that he was not actively pursuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>the transfer of her position to NJT. She believed the transfer had been approved \u201c[a]nd it was just a budget issue.\u201d In December 2002, she had a conversation with Fittipoldi in which she told him that she \u201cdidn\u2019t think that he cared about the security, that it was more of a political impression and decisions that he was making rather than security.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Plaintiff testified that Fittipoldi had \u201ca sign in his doorway that alludes to the fact that if you can\u2019t be loyal to your boss, then you should find someone else to be your boss or something like that.\u201d During the December 2002 conversation, plaintiff pointed to the sign and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can agree with this\u201d and that she \u201cwas having a hard time being loyal and respecting him.\u201d She then \u201casked him for some consideration if he felt that I couldn\u2019t work for him that he would give me the courtesy of time to find another position.\u201d Plaintiff claimed \u201che said that there was no need to look for another job ... I would have a job for the next eight and a half years because that\u2019s when he planned on retiring.\u201d She believed that they had reached a \u201ctentative ... agreement of sorts\u201d because \u201cwe basically buried the hatchet over the incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Fittipoldi had a different view of the December 2002 conversation. He testified that \u201c[plaintiff\u2019s comments on this day did poison my relationship with her\u201d and he decided to replace her at that time. He waited, however, \u201cto see if she would just leave in the natural course of things.\u201d After the December 2002 meeting, Fittipoldi testified that plaintiff \u201cbecame increasingly combative with me on many different issues.\u201d She repeatedly told him \u201cif you\u2019re trying to provoke me to resign, I\u2019m not going to do it\u201d or \u201c[i]f you don\u2019t like what I\u2019m doing then you\u2019ll have to fire me.\u201d According to Fittipoldi, plaintiff\u2019s disappointment about the failure to transfer her position to NJT \u201cturned to bitterness and even contempt for [the] company.\u201d Plaintiff \u201ctotally shut down and failed to communicate with me,\u201d Fittipoldi said.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">In January 2003, plaintiff argued with Fittipoldi after she saw that her position remained in the Gateway contract. She request<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>ed a transfer to a management position in NJT that was vacant due to a retirement. That position, however, had been eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">On January 17,2003, plaintiff taped a conversation with Fittipoldi during which he told her that she was being terminated. He offered her the opportunity to resign with four weeks severance pay or be laid off in four weeks with no severance pay but having the opportunity to collect unemployment insurance. Plaintiff chose to resign and Fittipoldi assured her that he would give her a good reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In January 2004, plaintiff filed her complaint alleging violations of CEPA and seeking reinstatement to her prior position with all fringe benefits, seniority rights and accumulated sick and vacation time; compensation for lost wages \u201cand other remuneration inclusive of humiliation and emotional distress damages;\u201d an injunction restraining NJT from further violations of CEPA; reasonable costs and attorneys fees; and punitive damages. Defendants answered the complaint and, after extensive discovery, moved for summary judgment in April 2006. Plaintiff cross-moved for partial summary judgment seeking a ruling that she was an NJT employee and that she had identified a clear mandate of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">During the course of discovery, plaintiff produced an expert report by Harry Smith, a security consultant, former director of security for Lowe\u2019s Corporation and a retired New York City police lieutenant. Smith noted that the documents plaintiff discovered on the loading dock on August 15, 2002 included full plans for New York Penn Station\u2019s upper and lower levels, plus bridge and tunnel information, and depots and garages where substantial amounts of fuel were stored. Smith opined that this information \u201cwould be a terrorist bonanza\u201d because it could enable \u201ca great loss of life,\u201d as well as \u201cmassive structural damage that could disrupt mass transit in the New York metropolitan area for an extended period of time.\u201d Smith stated that Fittipoldi should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>have had the documents stored in locked metal containers on the premises until they could be shredded. He further noted that Watson\u2019s \u201cconcern regarding the blueprints,\u201d based upon her deposition, was clearly to ensure the documents were not being discarded in error. When she was assured by Mr. Saklas that the documents were \u2018garbage,\u2019 she considered the matter closed. In Smith\u2019s view, both Fittipoldi and Watson \u201cfailed to see the overriding security issue of the incident: Not whether or not the materials should be discarded, but how it should be discarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">In Smith\u2019s \u201cprofessional opinion, based upon [his] experience and a reasonable degree of certainty,\u201d Fittipoldi\u2019s and NJT\u2019s failure \u201cto destroy (shred) the blueprints and engineering plans, etc., as described in this case, was a departure from the generally accepted standards and practices within the security industry, especially in the post 9-11 era of Homeland Security awareness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">After hearing argument and considering the papers submitted, the trial judge indicated initially that she was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aad9\">really [...] at a loss as to why anybody should be able to come in contact with structural drawings of \u2014 of the New Jersey Transit facilities, including means of emergency access and egress, for obvious reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">But, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m here to deal with. I\u2019m here to ascertain whether or not, with all inferences on the record drawn in favor of Ms. Massarano, this is a case which should survive summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">Could a reasonable juror determine under the facts as presented to me on this record that retaliatory action has occurred to Barbara Massarano because of her whistle-blowing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">The court noted that plaintiff was an at-will employee, \u201c[a]nd it doesn\u2019t matter whether you have cause to terminate someone\u2019s employment. They are your employee at will and you can ask them to leave, fire them, at any time, for any reason, no matter how stellar their performance.\u201d The judge indicated that she could not find \u201ca clear public policy concerning public safety or health, safety and welfare\u201d that was violated by the placement of the plans and drawings in the bin on the loading dock even \u201cunder the circumstance of an extremely security conscious environment we should still have.\u201d In the court\u2019s view, when plaintiff called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Watson, it was \u201cnot to report a violation of a clear mandate of public policy, but to say, I don\u2019t think this is right---- [W]hen she called Ms. Watson[ ] she was merely calling somebody who could give her the okay to do something with what she found.\u201d The court further found that \u201cthere obviously is no law, rule or regulation that was being violated. And I cannot see a clear mandate of public policy. So the first tine of CEPA Ms. Massarano cannot surmount.\u201d Accordingly, the court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab3\">there was no whistle-blowing on August 15th. [This] was simply a plea for help. A request for an authority to allow her to take possession of these papers and categorize them. And that\u2019s all I see on the record____ Her job was to find security problems. And \u2014 and to fix them. And in an attempt to fix them going to somebody who allows her to take possession of the object that she believes is the source of the problem is hardly whistleblowing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">The court observed that \u201cthere has to be a causal connection between the whistle-blowing activity and the adverse employment action or the retaliation.\u201d With respect to the deterioration of the relationship between plaintiff and Fittipoldi, the court noted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-11\">that these unpleasant, uncivil, in some instances really obnoxious interactions\u2014 obnoxious primarily on the part of Mr. Fittipoldi, between Mr. Fittipoldi and Ms. Massarano \u2014 took place as a result ... of apparently Mr. Fittipoldi being upset because Ms. Massarano had gone above his head to somebody who was Executive Secretary to the Board of Trustees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-12\">This is not an unreasonable action. It was the only thing that she could have done under the circumstances because she couldn\u2019t get ahold [sic] of him____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-14\">And when you are forced to go over somebody\u2019s head, a \u2014 an employee is \u2014 is\u2014very uncomfortable with it. And you kind of expect that your \u2014 your boss is going to be upset, even though you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-15\">The judge considered \u201cthat what happened here based on this record is that the relationship and the trust by Mr. Fittipoldi of Ms. Massarano deteriorated. And to \u2014 to the extent that everything that she did to oppose him \u2014 including everything that took place with regard to ... the car fleet incident \u2014 he was just not going to [accept].\u201d With respect to the change in plaintiffs responsibilities, the court did not believe that it was \u201ctotally unreasonable to think that a security person would have charge of distribution ... retention and acceptance of New Jersey Transit property such as automobiles.\u201d Moreover, the court noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>terms and conditions of employment can be readily changed by the employer; \u201c[tjhey\u2019re changed all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">In short, the court found no violation of CEPA. The court did, however, find that plaintiff was an NJT employee for the purposes of the CEPA statute. Summary judgment was granted in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">In this appeal, plaintiff argues that (1) the trial court\u2019s analysis is legally flawed with respect to identifying a law, rule, regulation or public policy that was violated by the documents being dumped in a recycling bin; (2) the trial court erred in determining that plaintiff was not a whistle-blower within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:19 \u2014 3(c)(1) and (2); (3) the trial court erred in finding that a reasonable juror could not determine retaliation toward plaintiff from the facts presented; (4) the trial court failed to adhere to the standards for granting summary judgment; (5) the causal connection between plaintiff\u2019s claims of retaliation and her objection to the disposal of the building plans was a fact question for the jury; and (6) plaintiff was an employee of NJT entitled to CEPA protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">We begin our analysis of this CEPA claim by stating the essential elements plaintiff must demonstrate to maintain a cause of action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">A plaintiff who brings a CEPA action pursuant to N.J.S.A 34:19-3c must demonstrate that (1) he or she reasonably believed that his or her employer\u2019s conduct was violating either a law, rule, or regulation promulgated pursuant to law, or a clear mandate of public policy; (2) he or she performed a \u201cwhistle-blowing\u201d activity described in N.J.S.A 34:19-3c; (3) an adverse employment action was taken against him or her; <em>and </em>(4) a causal connection exists between the whistle-blowing activity and the adverse employment action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-10\"><em>[Dzwonar v. McDevitt, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>451, 462, 828 A.2d 893 (2003) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">Plaintiff first argues that the trial court erred in failing to find that disposal of the documents in the loading dock bin violated a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>law, rule, regulation or public policy. In support of this argument, plaintiff relies on <em>Executive Order No. 21, </em>34 <em>N.J.R. </em>2487(a) (August 5, 2005), reprinted in L. 2002 at 1222-25 (2002), the New Jersey Public Transportation Act of 1979, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:25-1 to -34, the New Jersey Domestic Security Preparedness Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>App. A:9-64 to -78, and her expert\u2019s report. Plaintiff complains that the trial judge failed to cite or discuss these legal authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Defendants respond that the statutes and Executive Order cited by plaintiff are \u201cunrelated to [defendants\u2019 trash disposal practices\u201d because they do not pertain to disposal of documents. Defendants correctly maintain that an expert\u2019s opinion is not a source of public policy. The expert report could, however, provide evidence of the reasonableness of plaintiff\u2019s belief that public policy had been violated. <em>Abbamont v. Piscataway Twp. Bd. of Educ., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>405, 424-25, 650 A.2d 958 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">In <em>Maw v. Advanced Clinical Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>439, 444, 846 A.2d 604 (2004), the Court explained that a \u201cclear mandate of public policy\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(c)(3)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">conveys a legislative preference for a readily discernible coarse <em>of </em>action that is recognized to be in the public interest. A \u201cclear mandate\u201d of public policy suggests an analog to a constitutional provision, statute, rule or regulation <em>promulgated pursuant to law </em>such that, under Section 3e(3), there should be a high degree of public certitude in respect of acceptable versus unacceptable conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">In <em>Mehlman v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>163, 188, 707 A.2d 1000 (1998), addressing whether the CEPA plaintiff had identified a clear mandate of public policy, the Court explained that \u201cthe offensive activity must pose a threat of public harm, not merely private harm or harm only to the aggrieved employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Plaintiff points further to the Attorney General\u2019s proposed regulations to implement the Executive Order, which were circulated on October 18, 2004 \u2014 more than two years <em>after </em>plaintiff discovered the documents on the loading dock \u2014 excluding public access to any record relating to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">building plans, blueprints, schematic drawings, diagrams or operational records where disclosure would reveal specific location of life safety and support systems, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>load bearing structural elements, surveillance techniques, alarm or security systems or technologies, operational and transportation plans or personal deployment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axm\"><em>[N.J.AC. </em>13:1F-1.4 Published in 36 <em>N.J.R. </em>4630(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Again, neither the proposed regulations nor the OPRA public access provisions govern disposal of documents by a governmental agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">As the Court noted in <em>Mehlman, </em>\u201cthe purpose of CEPA is \u2018to protect and encourage employees to report <em>illegal </em>or <em>unethical </em>workplace activities and to discourage public and private sector employers from engaging in such conduct.\u2019\u201d <em>Mehlman, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 179, 707 A.2d 1000 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Abbamont, supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 431, 650 A.2d 958). The significant element under CEPA is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">that the objecting employee must have an <em>objectively </em>reasonable belief, at the time of objection or refusal to participate in the employer\u2019s offensive activity, that such activity is either illegal, fraudulent or harmful to the public health, safety or welfare <em>and </em>that there is a substantial likelihood that the questioned activity is incompatible with a constitutional, statutory or regulatory provision, code of ethics, or other recognized source of public policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\"><em>[Mehlman, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 193, 707 A.2d 1000 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Moreover, plaintiff has presented no evidence to counter defendants\u2019 assertion that the documents were readily available to contractors and subcontractors bidding on NJT projects. In short, we agree with the trial court that NJT\u2019s disposal of the documents in a bin on the gated loading dock was not a clear violation of a statute, regulation or public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Plaintiff contends further that the trial court erred in determining that she was not a whistle-blower under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(c)(l) and (2). The statute provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-11\">An employer shall not take any retaliatory action against an employee because the employee does the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-12\">(c) Objects to, or refuses to participate in any activity, policy or practice which the employee reasonably believes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>(1) is in violation of a law or a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law or, if the employee is a licensed or certified healthcare professional constitutes improper quality of patient care; <em>[orj</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\"><em>(2) </em>is fraudulent or criminal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Even if we were to find that the disposal of the documents violated public policy, plaintiffs reporting the disposal to Watson did not make her a whistle-blower under the statute. We agree with the trial court\u2019s analysis that plaintiff was merely doing her job as the security operations manager by reporting her findings and her opinion to Watson. It is clear from the record that Fittipoldi\u2019s anger at plaintiff resulted from her going over his head, not for reporting the disposal of the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">We have carefully reviewed the record before us and we are satisfied that plaintiff has presented no evidence to demonstrate that her deteriorating relationship with Fittipoldi resulted from the August 15 incident, other than his annoyance at her going over his head. Nothing in this extensive record leads us to conclude that Fittipoldi or NJT retaliated against plaintiff for reporting the disposal of the documents on August 15, 2002. Rather, the record presents a picture of a supervisor who was annoyed with a subordinate, at-will employee who went over his head to report an incident. Had plaintiff simply taken custody of the documents in her capacity as security operations manager and reported the incident to Fittipoldi the following day, the situation may have been entirely different. Instead, plaintiff took an adversarial position to her supervisor and continued to do so through the Fall of 2002, when she strenuously and publicly objected to having NJT\u2019s fleet of fifty vehicles transferred to her responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">Plaintiff has provided transcripts of two conversations with Fittipoldi that she recorded in an effort to persuade us that he retaliated against her. The transcript of the October 2002 conversation gave no indication that Fittipoldi was retaliating against plaintiff for the August 15 report. Rather, the conversation focused on the October fleet meeting. Fittipoldi told her that he thought she was \u201cbeing very obstructionist\u201d and that she \u201chad a chip on [her] shoulder about everything.\u201d Indeed, nothing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>lengthy October 2002 transcript indicates that plaintiffs August 15 report to Watson was affecting her relationship with Fittipoldi or that there was any retaliation against her. The conversation was simply one between a disaffected employee and her supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Plaintiff, herself, escalated the situation when she told Fittipoldi in December 2002 that she did not respect him and could not be loyal to him. Any reasonable employer would have doubts about an employee who expressed such sentiments. The only reason Fittipoldi did not fire plaintiff on the spot was because he hoped that she would leave voluntarily. When she did not, he gave her the choice of resigning with four weeks severance pay or being laid off with the opportunity to collect unemployment benefits. Plaintiff chose to resign.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">yi</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Even if plaintiff had established a prima facie case for retaliation under CEPA \u2014 which she has not \u2014 she has not met her burden to show that the stated reasons for her termination were pretextual. The \u201cburden shifting analysis under the Law Against Discrimination (LAD) should be applied to CEPA cases.\u201d <em>Zappasodi v. New Jersey, Dept. of Corrections, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 89, 761 A.2d 96 (App.Div.2000) (citing <em>Kolb v. Burns, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 479, 727 A.2d 525 (App.Div.1999)). \u201c[O]nce plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliatory discharge, the defendant must then come forward and advance a legitimate reason for discharging plaintiff.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, defendant demonstrated that plaintiffs demeanor was \u201cobstructionist\u201d and \u201cinsubordinate\u201d and justified her termination. We agree with the trial court\u2019s observation that, although the relationship between plaintiff and Fittipoldi deteriorated after August 15 because plaintiff went over Fittipoldi\u2019s head, the relationship became virtually adversarial after the October 2002 meeting regarding the transfer of the vehicles to plaintiffs responsibility. In short, we find no basis in the record to support plaintiff\u2019s allegations that Fittipoldi and NJT retaliated against her for the August 15,2002 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>VII</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Finally, plaintiff argues that the trial court failed to determine that she was an NJT employee for CEPA purposes. The record clearly indicates, however, that the trial judge stated that she \u201cmight be hard pressed to find that [plaintiff] was not an employee of New Jersey Transit for the purposes of the CEPA statute.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Although plaintiff was paid by Gateway, it is clear that NJT supervised and controlled her employment. An employee is \u201cany individual who performs services for and under the control and direction of an employer.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-2. The definition of employee under CEPA could \u201cinclude workers who may be classified at common law as independent contractors.\u201d <em>D\u2019Annunzio v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>270, 280, 891 A.2d 673 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>608, 897 A.2d 1062 (2006).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">[T]he primary focus is on the employer\u2019s \u201ccontrol and direction\u201d of the worker\u2019s performance of services for the employer, and not on (1) the terms of compensation, (2) the extent to which the employer provides benefits to the worker, or (3) whether the worker provides services for a full week or only part of a week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 277, 891 A.2d 673.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">We have carefully considered all of plaintiff\u2019s arguments in light of the applicable law and we are satisfied that they lack sufficient merit to warrant further discussion in this opinion. <em>B. </em>2:11\u2014 3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
