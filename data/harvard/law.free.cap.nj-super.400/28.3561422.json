Baker, Sr. was charged in Indictment 2003-06-809 with robbery in the first degree, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-l(a), and using a juvenile to commit a crime in the first degree, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-9(a). The juvenile in question was his son, M.B., thirteen years old at the time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant was found guilty of both counts after a jury trial and the State moved for an extended term of imprisonment pursuant to the \u201cThree Strikes Act,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.1. After granting the State\u2019s motion, the trial judge imposed a mandatory life sentence without parole on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>first-degree robbery, and a concurrent sentence of fifteen years, seven and one-half years without parole, on the second count. The judge ordered these sentences to run consecutively to a federal sentence defendant was already serving. All appropriate fines and penalties were also imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">On appeal, defendant raises the following issues for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">\n<em>POINT i</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN DENYING i. ] DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION TO DISMISS THE CHARGES, AS THE VIOLATION OF THE INTERSTATE ACT ON DETAINERS MANDATED DISMISSAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-10\">THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN ADMITTING EVIDENCE OF UNRELATED ROBBERIES. IN ADDITION, THE CURATIVE CHARGE TO THE JURY WAS INADEQUATE (Partially Raised Below) .<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0N\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-11\">THE DEFENDANT\u2019S SENTENCE IS EXCESSIVE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">We have considered these contentions in light of the record and applicable legal standards. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-14\">At approximately 4:00 p.m. on June 29, 2002, Matilda Dodson, the assistant manager of the Rite Aid store in Mount Laurel, was near the cash register when she was approached by a teenage boy who removed a gun from under a newspaper and announced a robbery. Dodson told him to take what he wanted from the register as she moved to the back of the store to tell the other employees what was occurring. The young man took approximately $200 from the register and left. Dodson called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-15\">The robbery went unsolved for several months until M.B., in the company of his aunt and uncle, came to the Mount Laurel police station. M.B. was advised of his Miranda<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> rights and provided a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>detailed statement implicating himself and defendant in the robbery. M.B. claimed that defendant gave him the gun and threatened him with death unless he committed the robbery. He also implicated defendant in other unsolved bank robberies in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">A federal arrest warrant was issued for defendant, and a search warrant was also issued for his residence, his mother\u2019s residence, and his car. The search of the vehicle resulted in the seizure of a fake mustache, a bank card in defendant\u2019s name, and a .45 caliber pellet gun that was described at trial as \u201cvery realistic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested defendant and questioned him at their Cherry Hill offices. After defendant was administered his <em>Miranda </em>rights, he admitted that on June 28, 2002, while his son was in the car, he robbed the Equity Bank in Cherry Hill. He further claimed that he returned to the car with a pillowcase full of money and gave it to M.B. to hold. However, a dye pack in the money exploded, and defendant told M.B. to throw the pillowcase and the proceeds of the robbery out of the vehicle, which he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Members of the Mount Laurel police department also questioned defendant about the robbery of the Rite Aid. Although he initially told the police he did not tell his son to rob the store, defendant later acknowledged that \u201che may have dared him to do it, but he d[id] not recall telling him, or ... threatening him to go commit the robbery.\u201d Defendant also acknowledged knowing that M.B. had in fact committed the Rite Aid robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">At trial, M.B. testified that defendant told him as they drove to the Rite Aid that they \u201cdidn\u2019t have any money and [they] needed money.\u201d Defendant told M.B. that he should \u201cgo in and rob the Rite Aid,\u201d and told him where he would be waiting with the ear. M.B. claimed defendant gave him the gun and the newspaper, that he felt threatened by defendant, was afraid of him, and believed he had to commit the robbery. After leaving the Rite Aid, M.B. testified that he returned to the waiting car and gave defendant the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Based upon the judge\u2019s earlier ruling that we discuss in greater detail below, M.B. was permitted to testify about his knowledge of defendant\u2019s robbery of the Equity Bank the day before the Rite Aid robbery. According to M.B., he drove <em>to </em>the bank with his father who was wearing some sort of disguise and was carrying the same gun M.B. was to use the following day. Defendant entered and robbed the bank, returned to the car and gave M.B. a pillowcase full of money. As they drove away, a red dye pack exploded, M.B. began to cough and sneeze, and defendant told him to throw the bag out of the car window. He did.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Defendant did not testify at trial, however, his mother was called as a defense witness. She testified that defendant\u2019s three children lived with her sporadically, described M.B.\u2019s troubled relationship with his father and noted that on occasion M.B., who had impulse control problems, had taken his father\u2019s car -without permission. Defendant\u2019s fifteen year-old daughter, B.B., and his fourteen year-old son, E.B., were also called as defense witnesses, though neither provided any relevant or exculpatory information. Both denied telling defendant\u2019s investigator that M.B. had admitted committing the Rite Aid robbery by himself. The defense rested after calling investigator Annie Prochorencko, who testified that she interviewed B.B. and the girl told her that M.B. 1) \u201chad done [the robbery] himself\u2019; 2) had taken defendant\u2019s car \u201cwhile [he] was sleeping\u201d; and 3) had \u201cblamed defendant because he was afraid of the consequences to himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Defendant first argues that the trial judge erred in denying his pre-trial motion to dismiss the indictment based upon the State\u2019s alleged violation of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (the IAD), codified in New Jersey at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:159A-1 to -15. Alternatively, he argues we should remand the matter to the trial court for a plenary hearing on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">At oral argument on his pre-trial motion, defendant claimed that during the months after he commenced his federal sentence, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>was \u201cshuttled back and forth between the federal prison and the Burlington County Jail, where he was facing the[se] state charges[.]\u201d He claimed he would periodically be returned to the federal facility \u201cto await the next state proceeding, whether for a plea discussion or motions.\u201d He argued that this conduct violated <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:159A-4(e) and required dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The State argued that the IAD had never been \u201ctriggered.\u201d It noted that defendant did not request to be brought before the court for disposition of the charges as permitted by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:159A-3. More importantly for purposes of this appeal, the prosecutor argued below \u201cthat each time [defendant] was brought in he was brought in on a writ at the request of the [e]ourt not at the request of the [executive [b]ranch or the [p]rosecuting agency____ The IAD simply was not implicated there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The judge concluded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">The IAD was not triggered here____ [Although he\u2019s on a Federal reservation, he\u2019s still within the jurisdiction of this Court, so, therefore, there is no need for an IAD. I can reach out and touch him any time I want to as long as he\u2019s physically in New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">The judge denied the motion to dismiss and reaffirmed the scheduled trial date of January 6, 2006. Thereafter, defendant was produced for his trial pursuant to the court\u2019s order to produce him, was apparently returned to federal custody to await his sentence date, and once again produced before the trial judge on February 17, 2006 for the imposition of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-13\">Defendant has reiterated this argument on appeal. Before turning to its merits, we dispatch with the alternative suggestion defendant has made, specifically that the matter be remanded for a plenary hearing to determine exactly how he was produced from the federal facility for the several appearances he made before his trial commenced. We view the request as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">The undisputed record reveals that on July 16, 2003, defendant pled guilty to five federal bank robbery charges and was sentenced on November 25, 2003, to an aggregate sentence of seventy-eight months. On January 6, 2004, he began serving that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>sentence at the federal correctional facility at Ft. Dix in Wrights-town.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The State asserts that defendant was produced before the trial judge on each occasion as the result of the judge\u2019s \u201corders to produce.\u201d In its brief, the State attached sixteen such orders, the first dated July 28, 2003, while defendant was housed in the federal detention center in Philadelphia, the last ordering that defendant be produced for his sentence on February 17, 2006. Each order was requested by the criminal ease manager and signed by the judge. Defendant does not offer any proof to the contrary and acknowledges in a detailed pro se certification he filed in support of the motion that he was produced before the trial judge by use of a \u201cWrit of Habeas Corpus ad Prosequendum.\u201d In short, the record that exists indicates clearly that defendant was repeatedly brought before the judge based upon the court\u2019s orders to produce him. We discern no requirement for a more extensive record on the issue and we turn instead to the merits of defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Initially, we agree with defendant that the trial judge was mistaken in his belief that the IAD was inapplicable because defendant was a federal prisoner housed in New Jersey and not another state. The definitional portion of the statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:159A-2(a), makes it clear that as used in the IAD, \u201cstate\u201d means \u201ca State of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">In <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>the Third Circuit concluded that the IAD applies \u201cwhere the Federal Government is trying a state prisoner serving his state sentence within the geographical limits of the state in which the federal district court is located.\u201d 562 F.2d 232, 234 n. 2 (3d Cir.1977) (citing <em>United States v. Sorrell, </em>413 <em>F.Supp. </em>138, 140-41 (E.D.Pa.1976), cert. <em>den., </em>436 <em>U.S. </em>949, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2858, 56 L.Ed.2d 793 (1978)); <em>see also United States v. Schrum, </em>504 <em>F.Supp. </em>23, 25 (D.Kan.1980) (holding \u201cthat the strictures of the [IAD] are applicable to \u2018interjurisdietional trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>fers\u2019 of prisoners from state to federal custody, and vice-versa, once a detainer has been lodged even though there may be no transfer across any state boundary\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>638 F.2d 214 (10th Cir.1981). Therefore, it did not matter that defendant was in federal custody in New Jersey and not physically in another state for purposes of the IAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">However, the State argues, as it did below, that the IAD was never \u201ctriggered\u201d because it never lodged a detainer against defendant nor moved pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A-.159A-4 to have him produced in state court for his trial. That section of the IAD provides in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">(a) The appropriate officer of the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment, information or complaint is pending shall be entitled to have a prisoner against whom he has lodged a detainer and who is serving a term of imprisonment in any parly State made available ... upon presentation of a written request for temporary custody or availabilily to the appropriate authorities of the State in which the prisoner is incarcerated____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">\u00a1k <em>-jf $\u00a1 </em>#</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">(c) [T]rial shall be commenced within 120 days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving State, but for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">* \u00bbk * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-10\">(e) If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner\u2019s being returned to the original place of imprisonment ..., such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">Defendant contends that even if the State never initiated the process of securing defendant\u2019s presence in state court by lodging a formal detainer and proceeding in accordance with \u00a7 4 of the IAD, the court\u2019s orders were the functional equivalent of a detain-er and the remedy accorded by the statute \u2014 dismissal of the indictment \u2014 was appropriate since it is undisputed that defendant was not tried within the time limits of \u00a7 4(c) and the State never sought any extension of those limits for \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>2A:159A-5(e) (providing for dismissal of any indictment if the time limits contained in \u00a7 4 are not met).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>New Jersey, forty-seven other states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the United States are all signatories to the IAD. <em>State v. Pero, </em>370 <em>N.J.Super. </em>203, 206, 851 A.2d 41 (App.Div.2004) (citing <em>Carchman v. Nash, </em>473 <em>U.S. </em>716, 719, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>3401, 3403, 87 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>516, 520 (1985)). Since the IAD is a \u201ccongressionally sanctioned interstate compact,\u201d the interpretation of the IAD \u201cpresents a question of federal law.\u201d <em>Cuyler v. Adams, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>433, 442, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>703, 709, 66 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>641, 650 (1981). Therefore, \u201c[fjederal court interpretations of the IAD ... [are] binding upon state courts.\u201d <em>Pero, supra, </em>370 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 214, 851 A.2d 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The IAD undoubtedly serves several laudable goals from the perspective of an inmate in custody in another jurisdiction. We have noted that \u201c[t]he intent and rationale\u201d behind the act \u201cwas to counter the perceived evil when prosecutorial delay or inattention fail to provide a defendant incarcerated in another jurisdiction an opportunity for prompt disposition of charges\u201d thereby \u201cpotentially prejudicing] a prisoner\u2019s opportunities and even his potential for concurrent sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221, 851 A.2d 41. Additionally, focusing on the inmate\u2019s status within his own correctional facility, we have noted that \u201c[t]he purpose of the IAD is to expedite outstanding charges in order to protect prisoners from the adverse consequences of detainers.\u201d <em>Van Winkle v. New Jersey Dep\u2019t of Corr., 370 N.J.Super. 40, 46, 850 A.2d 548 </em>(App.Div.2004) (citing <em>Johnson v. Cuyler, </em>535 <em>F.Supp. </em>466, 473 (E.D.Pa.1982), <em>aff'd, </em>714 <em>F.2d </em>123 (3d Cir.1983) (applying New Jersey law)). One such adverse consequence is the \u201cuncertaint[y]\u201d produced by detainers \u201cwhich obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:159A-1; <em>see Adams, supra, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>at 449, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 712, 66 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 654; <em>United States v. Mauro, </em>436 <em>U.S. </em>340, 360, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>1834, 1847, 56 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>329, 347 (1978) (noting that \u201c[b]ecause a detainer remains lodged against a prisoner without any action being taken on it, he is denied certain privileges within the prison, and rehabilitation efforts may be frustrated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Whether that was the specific purpose behind the enactment of the \u201canti-shuttling\u201d provisions of \u00a7 4 of the IAD, however, is less clear. In rejecting the state of Alabama\u2019s argument that a one-day shuttle from federal prison to state court was de minimis because it did not interrupt any rehabilitative efforts, and thus did not violate the purpose of \u00a7 4, the United States Supreme Court noted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">[T]he [IAD\u2019s] drafters may have thought that the \u201cshuttling\u201d itself, i.e., the movement back and forth among prisons, adds to the \u2018uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation\u2019 And they may have sought to minimize the number of \u201cshuttles\u201d for that reason alone____ But we need not decide precisely what led Congress and the many other legislatures to agree to [\u00a7 4]\u2019s anti[-]shuttling remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-10\"><em>[Alabama v. Bozeman, </em>533 <em>U.S. </em>146, 155-56, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>2079, 2086, 150 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>188, 197 (2001) (emphasis omitted)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">We, too, need not determine whether \u00a7 4\u2019s purpose was to assure that any rehabilitative efforts taking place in defendant\u2019s federal institution were not thwarted, or that defendant did not suffer the denial of privileges as a result of his frequent appearances before the trial judge. We note, however, that defendant has certainly brought no such consequences to our attention.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">The reason why defendant\u2019s argument is unavailing is found in the express language of the IAD. We have held that the statute is only triggered if the State has filed a detainer with the custodial state in the first instance. <em>State v. Burnett, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>222, 226, 798 A.2d 96 (App.Div.2002). Here, since the State never filed a detainer with the federal correctional authorities, our inquiry would seem ended. Defendant asserts, however, that the judge\u2019s orders to produce him from federal custody were the functional equivalent of a detainer under the IAD and therefore triggered \u00a7 4\u2019s protections against \u201cshuttling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Although the term \u201cdetainer\u201d is not defined in the IAD, the United States Supreme Court has held that it is \u201ca request filed by a criminal justice agency with the institution in which a prisoner is incarcerated, asking the institution either to hold the prisoner for the agency or to notify the agency when release of the prisoner is imminent.\u201d <em>Carchman, supra, </em>473 <em>U.S. </em>at 719, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3403, 87 L.Ed.2d at 520. In <em>Mauro, supra, </em>the Court held unequivocally that \u201ca writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum is not a detainer for purposes of the [IAD].\u201d 436 <em>U.S. </em>at 361, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1848, 56 L.Ed.2d at 347; see <em>also Diggs v. Owens, </em>833 F.2d 439, 443 (3d Cir.1987) (holding that prisoner\u2019s transfer of custody to state prosecuting authorities pursuant to writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum did not trigger the provisions of the IAD), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 <em>U.S. </em>979, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>1277, 99 L.Ed.2d 488 (1988); <em>United States v. Marzgliano, </em>588 <em>F.2d </em>395, 397 (3d Cir.1978). In part, the Court\u2019s ruling was based upon the fact that the statutory authority for the federal courts to issue such writs, 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>2241(c)(5), existed long before Congress adopted the IAD, thereby implicitly excluding writs of habeas corpus ad prosequendum from the <em>term </em>\u201cdetainer.\u201d <em>Mauro, supra, </em>436 <em>U.S. </em>at 357-61, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1846-48, 56 L.Ed.2d at 345-47. New Jersey similarly has provided courts with long-standing statutory authority to produce prisoners for purposes of standing trial, at least within the jurisdictional bounds of the issuing court. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:67-4(d) (permitting removal of prisoner \u201cfor his trial or discharge in due course of law\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">However, in <em>Mauro, </em>the Court also noted that if a detainer has in fact been lodged against a prisoner, the use of a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum to produce him was the equivalent of the government\u2019s \u201cwritten request for temporary custody\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 4 of the IAD, thus triggering the statute\u2019s time limits. <em>Mauro, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number><em>supra, </em>436 <em>U.S. </em>at 362, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1848, 56 L.Ed.2d at 348. Since <em>Mauro, </em>it would appear that the federal courts have unanimously followed this \u201cwrit plus\u201d test to determine whether the provisions of the IAD are triggered, though there exists some debate as to whether the additional law enforcement action taken in the particular factual circumstances presented was the functional equivalent of a detainer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The decisions of the courts in our sister states also support the conclusion that the production of a prisoner before a state court pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum, standing alone, is insufficient to trigger the provisions of the IAD\u2019s anti-shuttling provision. For example, in <em>People v. McLemore, </em>411 <em>Mich. </em>691, 311 <em>N.W.2d </em>720 (1981), a ease that is factually similar to the one at hand, the defendant was produced from a federal detention center in Michigan for an appearance on state charges in Detroit pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum. <em>Id. </em>at 721. The Michigan Supreme Court concluded that a decision by federal authorities to honor a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum as a matter of comity does not trigger the IAD. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Likewise, in <em>People v. Hines, </em>817 P.2d 559 (Colo.Ct.App.1991), another factually similar case, the defendant sought dismissal of his state charges after being produced from a federal correctional facility in Colorado, and returned three times, prior to final disposition. <em>Id. </em>at 560. Finding <em>Mauro </em>to be \u201cdispositive,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>court denied the defendant\u2019s challenge. <em>Id. </em>at 561. <em>See also Shanks v. Commonwealth, </em>574 S.W.2d 688, 690 (Ky.Ct.App.1978) (holding a writ is not a detainer).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">However, like their federal counterparts, some state courts have utilized the \u201cwrit plus\u201d test and concluded that the anti-shuttling provisions of the IAD were triggered despite the lack of any formal detainer. <em>See Runck v. State, </em>497 N.W.2d 74, 80 (N.D. 1993) (holding a writ plus other documents used to transfer federal prisoner to state court were sufficient to trigger IAD); <em>Finley v. State, </em>295 <em>Ark. </em>357, 748 S.W.2d 643, 645 (1988) (holding that court order requiring sheriff to make arrangements for the transfer of the defendant from federal to state custody constituted a detainer for purposes of the IAD); <em>Commonwealth v. Wilson, </em>399 <em>Mass. </em>455, 504 N.E.2d 1060, 1065 (1987) (holding the issuance of a writ after the lodging of a detainer on other charges was sufficient to trigger the IAD); <em>but compare State v. Williams, </em>253 <em>Neb. </em>619, 573 N.W.2d 106, 111-12 (1997) (concluding a state writ used to produce a defendant <em>from federal </em>custody was not a detainer triggering the IAD despite the federal institution\u2019s receipt of a state arrest warrant and forms utilized under the IAD).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">In this case, it is undisputed that the State never filed an actual detainer against defendant while he was housed in any of the federal correctional facilities. Additionally, defendant has not marshaled any evidence that would support the conclusion that anything other than the trial court\u2019s orders were ever used to produce him in court in Burlington County, or that any other document was ever \u201cfiled\u201d with the federal authorities to preserve the opportunity to do so in the future. Therefore, we find the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Mauro </em>to be dispositive of the issue presented here. The orders to produce were not the functional equivalents of detainers for purposes of the IAD and defendant\u2019s pre-trial motion to dismiss for an alleged violation of \u00a7 4 of the IAD was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Defendant\u2019s next point is actually two-fold. First, he contends the judge erred when he permitted the State to introduce any evidence of the prior bank robbery over defendant\u2019s objection. Second, defendant contends that the judge\u2019s limiting instruction was not given when the evidence was admitted, and that the instruction given in the final jury charge was inadequate and erroneous. In this regard, defendant neither requested an interim instruction, nor objected to the final charge as given. Therefore, as to this sub-issue, we must review the contention and assess whether it was plain error. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Before the jury was selected, the judge conducted a hearing to determine the admissibility of defendant\u2019s statement to the FBI and his subsequent statement made the same day to Mount Laurel police personnel. Neither statement was recorded nor reduced to writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">FBI agent Kevin Burton testified that defendant admitted committing the Equity Bank robbery on June 28, with M.B. present, and he acknowledged that the dye pack exploded and he told M.B. to discard the money and pillowcase. Investigator Edward Pincus of the Mount Laurel police department testified that defendant admitted being present at the Rite Aid with M.B., but denied having anything to do with the robbery. Defendant did not recall threatening M.B. to commit the crime, but said he \u201cmay have dared his son to do it.\u201d Defendant claimed that M.B. came out of the store with the money, returned to the car with it, but that he did not know what M.B. did with the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">After ruling the statements were admissible under <em>Miranda, </em>the judge inquired whether the State intended to offer any other evidence in support of its <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) application to admit testimony regarding the earlier bank robbery. The prosecutor noted \u201cthere is a statement by the juvenile____ If your honor is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>inclined I could call that witness.\u201d Before breaking for lunch, the judge responded, \u201cthat\u2019s your call as to whether ... you want to supplement the testimony that was ... given here.\u201d After the recess, the prosecutor advised the judge that he \u201cwould rely on the testimony of [the FBI agent] regarding the comments that defendant made to him about that June 28th robbery.\u201d M.B. was not called as a witness at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In seeking to admit the evidence of the prior robbery, the prosecutor contended</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">Any argument regal-ding that the defendant did not know that the juvenile was going in to commit the robbery at the Rite Aid is certainly connected to the fact that the very day before the juvenile was in the car with the father when he committed a robbery and a die (sic) pack exploded. It\u2019s very demonstrative, very unique situation. The theory is ... I\u2019m showing you the ropes, son, and tomorrow is your turn____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Defendant argued the evidence was not admissible to any \u201cmaterial issue\u201d in the case, was not \u201cclear and convincing,\u201d and its probative value was clearly outweighed by it prejudicial effect upon defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">The judge considered the issue in light of <em>State v. Cofield, </em>127 <em>N.J. 328, </em>605 A.2d 230 (1992). He found the evidence of the prior bank robbery to be relevant to the \u201cmaterial issue\u201d of defendant\u2019s intent and whether \u201cthere was knowledge or a plan in the robbery of the Rite Aid.\u201d The judge found the two robberies to be \u201csimilar in kind,\u201d both being first-degree robberies involving defendant and M.B., and \u201cclose in time,\u201d being one day apart. The judge found the evidence of the prior robbery to be \u201cclear and convincing\u201d because defendant had been convicted of the bank robbery. Lastly, the judge determined the evidence of the prior robbery was \u201cvery prejudicial\u201d to defendant, however, he concluded that its probative value outweighed that prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">We note first that defendant lodged no objection to M.B.\u2019s testimony regarding the June 28 bank robbery. Therefore, we consider the argument solely as it has now been raised \u2014 that any testimony regarding the prior robbery was inadmissible under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number><em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b). We reject this contention substantially for the reasons expressed by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Defendant contended in his statement to the police that he did not know M.B. was going to commit the robbery; he implied that though he may have dared M.B. to do so, he did not intend for him to rob the Rite Aid. He also claimed that he did not know what M.B. did with the proceeds of the robbery certainly implying that he had no intention himself of committing the robbery. Through the defense witnesses, defendant sought to support this claim by asserting that M.B. had essentially committed the crime himself without the support, or possibly even the presence, of defendant. Thus, a material issue in dispute was defendant\u2019s knowledge of M.B.\u2019s actions and his intent to participate in the Rite Aid robbery. Therefore, evidence that tended to prove that one day earlier the same father and son were together committing another robbery, utilizing the same weapon and the same vehicle, was highly probative because it demonstrated a shared purpose and negated defendant\u2019s claims of lack of knowledge and intent. We therefore find no error in its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Defendant\u2019s second argument regarding the <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) evidence is that the judge erred in not providing an immediate limiting instruction when the evidence was received by the jury, and that the judge\u2019s final limiting instruction was erroneous because it allowed the jury to use the evidence for an impermissible purpose. Since defendant never requested an immediate limiting instruction, and did not object to the charge as given, we consider whether the alleged error amounts to plain error. <em>State v. Afanador, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>41, 54, 697 A.2d 529 (1997); <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">\u201cIn the context of a jury charge, plain error requires demonstration of \u2018[l]egal impropriety ... prejudicially affecting the substantial rights of the defendant sufficiently grievous to justify notice by the reviewing court and to convince the court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>of itself the error possessed a clear capacity to bring about an unjust result.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Burns, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>312, 341, 929 A.2d 1041 (2007)(quoting <em>State v. Jordan, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>409, 422, 688 A.2d 97 (1997) (citations omitted)). The allegation of error must be assessed in light of \u201cthe totality of the entire charge, not in isolation.\u201d <em>State v. Chapland, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>275, 289, 901 A.2d 351 (2006). While an erroneous jury charge has been held to be a \u201c \u2018poor eandidate[ ] for rehabilitation\u2019 under the plain error theory,\u201d <em>Jordan, supra, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 422, 688 A.2d 97 (citation omitted), we nonetheless consider the effect of any error in light \u201cof the overall strength of the State\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Chapland, supra, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>at 289, 901 A.2d 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">We have already noted that a judge should give a limiting instruction on the permissible uses of the <em>N.J.B.E. </em>404(b) evidence when it is admitted. <em>State v. Angoy, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>79, 89-90, 746 A.2d 1046 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>138, 754 A.2d 1214 (2000); <em>see also State v. Blakney, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>88, 93, 912 A.2d 140 (2006)(noting \u201cthe better practice is to give limiting instructions not only at the time that other-crimes evidence is presented, but also in the final jury charge\u201d). However, if the final charge is \u201caccurate, clear and comprehensive,\u201d we have concluded any delay, even if two weeks have elapsed between the introduction of the evidence and the final instruction, is not plain error. <em>Angoy, supra, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 89, 746 A.2d 1046. Here, the final jury charge was given one week after admission of the other crime testimony. Delay in giving the limiting charge, therefore, was not in and of itself plain error. We turn our attention to the adequacy of the final instructions since that is determinative of whether reversal is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The judge\u2019s instruction tracked the model jury charge and began by advising the jurors that evidence of the prior bank robbery would normally be excluded if it was introduced to show defendant \u201chas a disposition or a tendency to do wrong and, therefore, must be guilty of the charged offense.\u201d He then proceeded to tell the jurors that if \u201csatisfied that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>committed the other crime,\u201d they were permitted to use the evidence for \u201ca certain specific narrow purpose.\u201d He continued</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">In this case, the evidence was introduced as to the issues of intent and motive. There was testimony presented that the defendant did not receive any proceeds from the bank robbery. There was also testimony that the Rite Aid Store was robbed so that the defendant and his son could get money. You may find that this evidence relates to the issues of intent and motive and may assist you in determining the issue of why the Rite Aid robbery took place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">Whether this evidence does, in fact, demonstrate intent and motive is for you to decide. <em>*&lt; </em>* * \u00ab</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">However, you may not use this evidence to decide that the defendant has a tendency to commit crimes or that he is a bad person____ I have admitted the evidence only to help you decide the specific question of intent and motive. You may not consider it for any other purpose____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">The judge distributed his charge in writing to the prosecutor and defense counsel before hand. The prosecutor specifically requested that the judge include \u201cknowledge\u201d as a permissible purpose for which the jury could use the evidence. As the prosecutor noted, \u201c[p]art of the reason why [the evidence] was let in ... is also for knowledge in that [in] defendant\u2019s statement to the investigators ... [he] says I don\u2019t really have knowledge of what [M.B.] was about to go in and do____\u201d Defense counsel objected and stated, \u201cI think the charge as written by the Court and as reviewed previously] is sufficient.\u201d Thus, not only did defendant not object to the charge, he requested the judge not provide any instruction that the evidence could be permissibly used by the jury to demonstrate defendant\u2019s knowledge of what was about to occur at the Rite Aid store on the day of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-15\">Defendant takes issue not with the propriety of the charge in a general sense. Rather, he argues that the judge told the jury it could consider the evidence as to \u201cintent and motive,\u201d despite ruling earlier that it was admissible to demonstrate defendant\u2019s intent and knowledge of the plan to rob the Rite Aid. Relying upon our decision in <em>State v. Mazowski, </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>275, 766 A.2d 1176 (App.Div.2001), defendant argues that by telling the jury they could use the evidence of the bank robbery to assess defendant\u2019s motive in robbing the Rite Aid store \u2014 so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>\u201cdefendant and his son could get money\u201d \u2014 the judge permitted speculation as to defendant\u2019s \u201cneed for cash,\u201d thus fueling the jury\u2019s conclusion that defendant had a propensity for crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In <em>Mazowski, </em>we reversed defendant\u2019s burglary conviction because the repeated \u201creference to defendant\u2019s drug use violated the prohibition of <em>N.J.R.E. 404(b) </em>against using evidence of \u2018other crimes\u2019 to demonstrate a propensity to commit further crime, and [ ] the evidence was not admissible as \u2018proof of motive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278, 766 A.2d 1176. We concluded that evidence of defendant\u2019s drug use and addiction as a motive for his constant need for money</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">[pjosed [an] extremely broad definition of \u2018motive,\u2019 [ ] that [ J does not relate to the particular crime with which defendant is charged, or to any other particular crime. Rather, it is ... a reason why defendant commits crime in general. It is an undifferentiated \u2018motive\u2019 to steal. As such, except for its label, it is indistinguishable from a claim that defendant has a \u2018disposition,\u2019 or general propensity to commit crimes, which is precisely what <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) prohibits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 282, 766 <em>A.2d </em>1176.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">While the better course may have been not to charge \u201cmotive\u201d as a permissible use of the evidence in this case, we conclude it was not plain error to do so for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">First, we think the facts of this case are amply distinguishable from <em>Mazowski </em>There, the trial judge permitted repeated and non-specific references to defendant\u2019s admitted drug abuse as evidence of his motive for committing the crime charged. Here, the other crime evidence was limited to just one incident, the bank robbery the day before, thus providing more focus for the jury and making it much less likely that the other crime evidence would lead to a conclusion that defendant had a \u201cpropensity\u201d to commit crime. Additionally, the judge told the jury that the evidence could not be used for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">Second, given all the evidence adduced, the unusual facts of the bank robbery provided some context for the motive in robbing the Rite Aid. We acknowledge, as defendant argues, that every robbery has as its motive the desire to acquire money or other things of value. However, because the bank robbery committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>one day earlier in nearby Cherry Hill failed, defendant\u2019s desire to have his son rob the Rite Aid, as opposed to doing it himself, becomes more understandable. In a sense, under these unusual facts, the line between defendant\u2019s intent, clearly a material issue in dispute for which the <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) evidence was permissible, and his motive, for which its use was more questionable, begins to blur. <em>See State v. Hernandez, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>106, 129, 784 A.2d 1225 (2001) (noting permissible use of \u201ctemporally proximate drug sales ... to counter [defendant\u2019s] suggestion that [witness\u2019s] \u2018motive\u2019 or \u2018state of mind\u2019 in giving him money and his \u2018motive\u2019 or \u2018state of mind\u2019 in receiving it\u201d were innocent and not criminal).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Lastly, given defendant\u2019s objection to the State\u2019s request to include in the charge \u201cknowledge\u201d as a permissible use of the other crime evidence, his failure to object to the charge as given, the judge\u2019s proper instruction that the evidence could be used to prove defendant\u2019s intent, and the overall strength of the State\u2019s case, we cannot conclude the charge was plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Defendant\u2019s final argument is that the sentence imposed upon him was excessive. In particular, he contends the trial judge erred by ordering the sentence to run consecutively to his federal sentence because the string of bank robberies that were the subject of the federal charges and the Rite Aid robbery all occurred in close temporal proximity and while defendant was addicted to painkillers. We deem this argument to be of insufficient merit to warrant extensive discussion in this opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). We add only the following brief comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">In imposing the consecutive sentence, the judge noted he was doing so \u201cpursuant to <em>State v. </em>Yarbough\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which \u201csays that the sentence should be consecutive.\u201d While this analysis may have been cursory, we nonetheless conclude that the consecutive sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>tence was justified under <em>Yarbough\u2019s </em>analytical framework and was not \u201ca clear error of judgment that [ ] shocks the conscience.\u201d <em>State v. Megargel, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>484, 493, 673 A.2d 259 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Defendant committed this crime with his son who was not involved in the other robberies, save the one committed at the Equity Bank. The bank robberies involved occurred over a six-month period which we view as hardly being in temporal proximity to each other. Each robbery involved a different victim. In short, we find no abuse by the judge of the wide discretion accorded in determining the appropriate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-13\"> Because of his age, we refer throughout the opinion to defendant's son by the use of initials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b63-16\"> Although defendant uses the plural, \u201crobberies,\u201d in his point heading, it is clear that the judge permitted evidence of only one other crime as we discuss below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b63-17\"> <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. </em>1602, <em>16 </em>L.Ed.2d 694(1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b70-13\"> In the \u201cdeclaration\" he filed pro se in support of his motion to dismiss, defendant claimed, without any detail, his \"rehabilitation efforts ...
