We conclude that the <em>Federal Rules </em>pre-empt the statute and regulations, and therefore a deposition taken in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>with federal litigation may be transcribed by a reporter who is not certified by the New Jersey State Board of Court Reporting. However, we also conclude that the <em>Federal Rules </em>do not preempt a claim against a shorthand reporting company under the Consumer Fraud Act that is not dependent upon the statute and administrative regulations governing shorthand reporting.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Plaintiff Joseph Quigley was a party to litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. During the course of that litigation, plaintiffs adversary took his deposition in New Jersey. Plaintiffs adversary contracted with defendant Esquire Deposition Service to transcribe the deposition. Since the <em>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure </em>do not require a reporter who transcribes a deposition to furnish a copy to the other parties, plaintiff through his attorney ordered a transcript of his two-day deposition from defendant, which charged him a total of $1,251.55. Plaintiff paid this amount and received the transcript. Subsequently, the federal litigation to which plaintiff had been a party was settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Plaintiff brought this action claiming that defendant violated the New Jersey statute and administrative regulations governing shorthand reporting and the Consumer Fraud Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to -20, in transcribing his deposition and charging him for a copy. Plaintiff claimed that defendant\u2019s use of a non-certified shorthand reporter to transcribe his deposition violated the statute and administrative regulations requiring use of a certified shorthand reporter to transcribe a deposition. Plaintiff also claimed that defendant violated the administrative regulation governing the number of lines per transcript page, the number of letters per line and the format of questions and answers. In addition to these alleged violations of the state statute and administrative regulations governing shorthand reporting, plaintiff claimed that defendant violated the Consumer Fraud Act by unconscionable and fraudulent practices in billing him for a copy of his deposition. Plaintiff sought class certification of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Defendant moved to dismiss plaintiffs complaint for failure to state a claim. The motion judge concluded in a written opinion that the statute and administrative regulations requiring a deposition to be transcribed by a certified shorthand reporter and the regulations prescribing formatting standards for deposition transcripts do not apply to depositions taken in connection with federal litigation because they are pre-empted by the <em>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. </em>Consequently, the judge dismissed plaintiffs claims predicated on the statute and regulations. In addition, the motion judge, apparently conceiving that plaintiffs Consumer Fraud Act claims were entirely dependent upon the applicability of the statute and regulations governing shorthand reporting, also dismissed those claims. Accordingly, the judge entered judgment dismissing plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Plaintiff appeals from the dismissal. We granted motions by the State Board of Court Reporting and the Certified Shorthand Reporters Association of New Jersey to participate as amicus curiae in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">We agree with the motion judge\u2019s conclusion that, as applied to depositions taken in connection with federal litigation, the statute and regulations governing shorthand reporting are pre-empted by the <em>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. </em>However, the judge erred in concluding that plaintiffs Consumer Fraud Act claims are entirely dependent upon the statute and regulations. Therefore, we affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs claims based on the statute and regulations governing shorthand reporting but reverse the dismissal of plaintiffs Consumer Fraud Act claims that are not dependent on the statute and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Pre-emption under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">occurs 11] when Congress, in enacting a federal statute, expresses a clear intent to pre-empt state law, [2] when there is outright or actual conflict between federal and state law, [3] where compliance with both federal and state law is in effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>physically impossible, [4] where there is implicit in federal law a barrier to state regulation, [5] where Congress has legislated comprehensively, thus occupying an entire field of regulation and leaving no room for the States to supplement federal law, or [6] where the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full objectives of Congress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\"><em>[Louisiana Pub.

The party who notices the deposition must state in the notice the method for recording the testimony. Unless the court orders otherwise, testimony may be recorded by audio, audiovisual, or stenographic means. The noticing party bears the recording costs. Any party may arrange to transcribe a deposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">(B) Additional Method. With prior notice to the deponent and other parties, any party may designate another method for recording the testimony in addition to that specified in the original notice. That party bears the expense of the additional record or transcript unless the court orders otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The <em>Federal Rules </em>do not impose any requirement regarding the qualifications of a person who may stenographically record a deposition. The <em>Federal Rules </em>also do not contain any regulation of the manner in which transcripts of depositions must be formatted.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">We are satisfied that, in adopting the <em>Federal Rules, </em>the Supreme Court intended to deal comprehensively with the taking of depositions in connection with federal litigation, \u201cthus occupying [the] entire field of regulation and leaving no room for the states to supplement [that] federal law[.]\u201d <em>Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>at 368, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1898, 90 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 382. Those rules specifically address before whom a deposition may be taken and how it may be recorded. The application to a deposition taken in connection with federal litigation of the New Jersey statute and administrative regulations, which generally prohibit the stenographic transcription of a deposition by anyone other than a certified court reporter, would conflict with the provisions of the <em>Federal Rules </em>that allow the parties to decide the official before whom a deposition shall be taken and how it shall be recorded. The requirement that only a certified court reporter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>may transcribe a deposition or, if one is unavailable, that the time-consuming procedures set forth in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:43-2.2 must be followed, also would have the potential to add to the costs of depositions taken for federal litigation, contrary to the intent of the <em>Federal Rules </em>to reduce discovery costs. <em>See Fed.R.Civ.P. 29 advisory committee\u2019s notes </em>(commenting that one purpose of the 1993 Amendment to <em>Rule </em>29 was to encourage parties \u201cto agree on less expensive and time-consuming methods\u201d of discovery); <em>see also Hudson v. Spellman High Voltage, </em>178 <em>F.R.D. </em>29, 31 (E.D.N.Y.1998) (noting that \u201c[t]he Advisory Committee Notes to the 1993 Amendment to <em>Rule </em>30(b)(2) reflect [an] ... intent that law office personnel, rather than an independent stenographer, will most likely prepare the typed transcript of those portions of the audio or video depositions which counsel intends to introduce at trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The <em>Federal Rules </em>also deal with the charge a reporter may impose for a deposition transcript. <em>Rule </em>30(f)(3) provides that \u201c[w]hen paid reasonable charges, the officer [before whom a deposition was taken] must furnish a copy of the transcript or recording to any party or the deponent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The <em>Federal Rules </em>do not set forth any specific limit on the amount that may be charged for a copy of a deposition transcript. However, the Judicial Conference of the United States has adopted a schedule of rates that official court reporters may charge for transcribing proceedings in federal court. 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 753. Some federal courts have used this schedule to determine what constitutes a \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d cost of a deposition transcript for purposes of taxing litigation costs pursuant to <em>Rule </em>54, <em>see, e.g., Cengr v. Fusibond Piping Sys., Inc., </em>135 F.3d 445, 455-56 (7th Cir.1998), and at least one federal district court has adopted a local rule which provides that in making an award under <em>Rule </em>54, the costs of a deposition transcript \u201cshall not exceed the regular copy rate as established by the Judicial Conference of the United States and in effect at the time the transcript or deposition was filed unless some other rate was previously provided for by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>order of court[,]\u201d <em>N.D. Ill. R. </em>54.1(b) (2007). The district courts\u2019 rule-making authority extends to any subject relating to \u201cthe conduct of their business[,]\u201d provided the rule is \u201cconsistent with Acts of Congress and rules of practice and procedure\u201d adopted by the Supreme Court. 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2071(a); <em>see Frazier v. Heebe, </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>641, 645-46, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2607, 2611, 96 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>557, 565 (1987). Although we do not decide the issue, it is possible that the judges in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey could adopt a local rule establishing a specific ceiling on charges for deposition transcripts in order to implement the mandate of <em>Federal Rule </em>30(f)(3) that the charge for a copy of a transcript must be \u201creasonable.\u201d But even in the absence of such a local rule, <em>Federal Rule </em>30(f)(3) limits the amount a stenographic reporter may charge for a copy of a deposition transcript to what is \u201creasonable,\u201d and any party contesting such a charge may urge the court to consider the maximum rates established by the Judicial Conference in determining what is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that the <em>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure </em>comprehensively regulate the taking of depositions in connection with federal litigation, leaving no room for supplementation by state law. Therefore, the <em>Federal Rules </em>that allow a non-certified stenographic reporter to transcribe a deposition pre-empt the New Jersey statute and regulations that require a deposition to be transcribed by either a certified court reporter or a non-certified reporter under the stringent requirements set forth in the statute and regulations. <em>Cf. Sperry v. Florida, </em>373 <em>U.S. </em>379, 83 <em>S.Ct. </em>1322, 10 L.Ed.2d 428 (1963). Similarly, <em>Federal Rule </em>30(f)(3), which requires the charge for a copy of a transcript to be \u201creasonable,\u201d pre-empts any supplementary state regulation of the price a stenographic reporter may charge for a deposition transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The regulations adopted by the State Board of Court Reporting regarding the formatting of transcripts apply only to transcripts prepared by New Jersey certified court reporters. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:43-5.9. Because plaintiffs deposition was not pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>pared by a certified court reporter and we have concluded that the <em>Federal Rules </em>authorize a non-certified reporter to transcribe a deposition taken in connection with federal litigation, defendant was not required to comply with the New Jersey formatting regulations in preparing the transcript of plaintiffs deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Although plaintiffs claims based on the statute and regulations governing shorthand reporting are pre-empted, we conclude that his complaint states claims under the Consumer Fraud Act that are not dependent upon the statute and regulations and are not pre-empted.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">This case was brought before the trial court by a motion under <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e) to dismiss for failure to state a claim. On such a motion, \u201ca reviewing court \u2018searches the complaint in depth and with liberality to ascertain whether the fundament of a cause of action may be gleaned even from an obscure statement of claim, opportunity being given to amend if necessary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>739, 746, 563 A.2d 31 (1989) (quoting <em>Di Cristofaro v. Laurel Grove Mem\u2019l Park, </em>43 <em>N.J.Super. </em>244, 252, 128 A.2d 281 (App.Div.1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">The Consumer Fraud Act prohibits any</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-10\">act, use or employment by any person of any unconscionable commercial practice, deception, fraud, false pretence, false promise, misrepresentation, or the knowing, concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact with intent that others rely upon such concealment, suppression or omission, in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise or real estate, or with the subsequent performance of such person as aforesaidf]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-11\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>56:8-2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">\u201cMerchandise\u201d is defined as \u201cany objects, wares, goods, commodities, <em>services </em>or anything offered, directly or indirectly to the public for sale.\u201d N.J.S.A 56:8-l(c) (emphasis added). Under this expansive definition of \u201cmerchandise,\u201d the provision of shorthand reporting services and sale of transcripts of depositions is subject to the Consumer Fraud Act. Any person who suffers \u201cascertain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>able loss of money or property\u201d as a result of a violation of the Act may maintain a private action for treble damages. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-19. Consequently, any \u201cdeception\u201d or other violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>56:8-2 in the conduct of the shorthand reporting business could support a claim under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Plaintiffs complaint alleges that defendant\u2019s \u201cbilling rate for ... transcripts was fraudulent\u201d and that defendant engaged in a \u201cdeceptive practice\u201d in determining its billings. The complaint further alleges that defendant charged an undisclosed \u201cadministrative fee\u201d in addition to the \u201cstated page rate\u201d for the transcript of his deposition. We are satisfied that these allegations are sufficient to state a claim for relief under the Consumer Fraud Act that is not dependent upon the statute and regulations governing shorthand reporting.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Moreover, there is no basis for concluding that the <em>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure </em>were intended to pre-empt application of state consumer fraud statutes to fraudulent or deceptive business practices of a shorthand reporting company. There is a presumption that federal law \u201cdoes not cavalierly pre-empt state-law causes of action.\u201d <em>Bates v. Dow Agrosciences, LLC, </em>544 <em>U.S. </em>431, 449,125 <em>S.Ct. </em>1788,1801,161 L.Ed.2d 687, 706 (2005) (quoting <em>Medtronic v. Lohr, </em>518 <em>U.S. </em>470, 485, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>2240, 2250, 135 L.Ed.2d 700, 715 (1996)). We perceive nothing in the <em>Federal Rules </em>relating to the taking of depositions in connection with federal litigation that suggests an intent to pre-empt the application of state statutes prohibiting fraudulent or deceptive business practices. Therefore, to the extent plaintiffs complaint may be read to state claims under the Consumer Fraud Act that are not dependent upon the New Jersey statutes and administrative regulations governing shorthand reporting, it is not subject to federal pre-emption.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">We reject defendant\u2019s argument that their business operations are exempt from the Consumer Fraud Act because they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>engaged in a \u201cquasi-professional\u201d activity. The cases upon which defendant relies, such as <em>Macedo v. Dello Russo, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>340, 345-46, 840 A.2d 238 (2004) and <em>Plemmons v. Blue Chip Insurance Services, Inc., </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>551, 560-65, 904 A.2d 825 (App.Div.2006), involved professional activities that were subject to comprehensive regulation under statutes other than the Consumer Fraud Act. Defendant\u2019s primary argument in this appeal, which we have accepted, is that their shorthand reporting services provided in connection with depositions for federal litigation are not subject to regulation under the statute and regulations governing shorthand reporting. Therefore, defendant cannot claim the exemption from the Consumer Fraud Act that our cases have recognized for regulated professional activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Plaintiff concedes that count one of his complaint is not maintainable, and counts two and three rest solely on the statute and regulations governing shorthand reporting. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of those counts. Counts four through six of plaintiffs complaint state claims that rest partly on the statute and regulations governing shorthand reporting but also may be read to state claims that can stand independently of those statutes and regulations. Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of those counts and remand the case to the trial court. Plaintiff is granted leave to file an amended complaint that restates counts four to six in a form that conforms with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b530-8\"> This statute provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Nothing in this act shall be construed to prohibit the temporary employment or retention of any person not holding a certificate until a certified court reporter is available, provided that such temporary employment shall be permitted only in such circumstances as the board may specify through regulation consistent with this section.
