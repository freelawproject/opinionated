Defendant was acquitted of counts two through five of Indictment No. 06-01-00003: first-degree robbery by threatening another with bodily injury or purposely putting another in fear of immediate bodily injury while armed with or threatening the immediate use of a deadly weapon, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1(a)(2) (count two); second-degree aggravated assault by attempting to cause serious bodily injury, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:12-1(b)(1) (count three); third-degree aggravated assault by attempting to cause bodily injury with a knife, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1(b)(2) (count four); and third-degree possession of a knife with intent to use it unlawfully, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4(d) (count five). While the jury was deliberating, defendant pled guilty to the single count of Indictment No. 06-01-00002, fourth-degree possession of a weapon by a convicted person, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-7(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>At sentencing, count six was merged into count one and defendant was sentenced to a twelve-year state prison term on the first-degree robbery conviction, subject to an eighty-five percent parole ineligibility period under the No Early Release Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2. She was also sentenced to a concurrent eighteen-month prison term for fourth-degree possession of a weapon by a convicted person.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">On appeal, defendant presents the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">\n<em>POINT i</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CHARGING THE JURY THAT DEFENDANT\u2019S INTENT WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF A WEAPON IS IRRELEVANT FOR DETERMINING WHETHER DEFENDANT IS ARMED WITH A DEADLY WEAPON FOR PURPOSES OF FIRST[-]DEGREE ROBBERY; THEREFORE, DEFENDANT WAS DEPRIVED OF DUE PROCESS OF LAW AND THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL. <em>U.S. CONST. </em>AMEND.

Accordingly, defendant\u2019s robbery conviction must be reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Shortly before 9:00 a.m. on Monday, September 12, 2005, defendant entered Kalamio restaurant located at 847 Second Avenue in the City of Elizabeth. Defendant testified she went into the restaurant to get something to eat. The restaurant was empty, however, and no one was present to serve her. According to defendant: \u201cI went ... around the counter area and I said hello but no one came out and there was an open cabinet door____And I saw a purse, I went in the purse ____ [to see] if there was money.\u201d As defendant was removing money from the purse, Anna Padilla, owner of the restaurant, emerged from the kitchen. According to Padilla, when defendant saw her, defendant \u201ctried to escape,\u201d but Padilla \u201cgrab[bed] her to take the money [a]way from her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">Padilla testified that during the ensuing struggle, which lasted for \u201cfive [or] ten minutes,\u201d defendant pulled her necklace off. According to Padilla, she grabbed defendant by her wrists because defendant had Padilla\u2019s necklace \u201cin one hand and the money in the other hand.\u201d Padilla testified that after letting go of the necklace and money, defendant \u201ctook out her knife.\u201d Padilla said she was \u201cscared\u201d because defendant \u201cwanted to hurt me like this with the knife.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At trial, Padilla identified a folding knife recovered from the restaurant floor as the knife defendant was holding during the struggle.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">Defendant\u2019s version of the struggle with Padilla was entirely different. According to defendant, after she took the money from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Padilla\u2019s purse, Padilla grabbed her and would not let go. Defendant denied taking Padilla\u2019s necklace, and she denied punching or hitting her. Defendant testified she was trying to leave, and she kept telling Padilla \u201cto let me go, to let me go, and I was just waving my hands.\u201d Defendant admitted she had a knife in the front pocket of her jeans, which fell out during the struggle, but she said the blade was not open before the knife hit the floor. Defendant also testified she never held the knife in her hand, never threatened Padilla with the knife, and never intended to use the knife against Padilla.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Maria Ramirez, a restaurant employee who had been working in the kitchen, observed part of the struggle and telephoned the police. Ramirez testified she \u201csaw both of them fighting,\u201d and she saw defendant holding \u201cAnna\u2019s chain,\u201d but she never witnessed defendant with a knife in her hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">When Detective Clarence Cunningham of the Elizabeth Police Department arrived on the scene, he apprehended defendant as she was \u201crunning out of the store, a restaurant type of a store.\u201d According to Cunningham, \u201c[t]he restaurant was in disarray ... the tables were flipped over, there was money on the floor, the owner\u2019s pocketbook was thrown on the floor, tables and chairs were thrown on the floor.\u201d Cunningham recovered a \u201cfolding knife\u201d from the restaurant floor and, when asked if \u201cthe blade was open or shut,\u201d he testified the blade was open.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Following the testimony of Padilla, Ramirez, Detective Cunningham, and defendant, the court charged the jury, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">Now a section of our statute provides that robbery is a crime of the second degree, except that it becomes a crime and is a crime of the first degree if the robber is armed with or uses or threatens immediate use of a deadly weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">Now the words armed with [are] distinguishable from mere possession. Armed with means possessing an implement in a way that makes it available for use as a weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-10\">So in this case, the defendant \u2014 it\u2019s alleged the defendant was armed with [a] knife, a deadly weapon in the course \u2014 while in the course of committing the robbery. In order for you to determine the answer to the question, in this question, you must understand the meaning of the term deadly weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>A deadly weapon is any firearm or other weapon, device, instrument, material or substance which in the manner it is used ... or is intended to be used, is known to be capable of producing serious bodily injury or which in the manner it is fashioned would lead the victim to reasonably believe it could be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">In this case the State alleges that the defendant was armed with a knife and that is an item that was produced into evidence. You must determine if this object qualifies as a deadly weapon and if the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was in the course of committing a robbery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">After the jury began deliberating, it sent the court the following note: \u201cDefinition of armed?\u201d Prior to responding to the jury\u2019s inquiry, the court advised counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">I intend to read to the jury the information as contained in the case of <em>[State v. Clark, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>130, 799 A.2d 679 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>545, 810 A.2d 65 (2002) ]. The term is not defined by the code but it\u2019s distinguishable from mere possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-9\">\u201cArmed means possessing an implement in a way that makes it available for use as a weapon. The defendant\u2019s intent with respect to the object is irrelevant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apc\">That\u2019s the [Clark case], it was decided in 2002, and it seems to be the most recent statement of armed, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ll tell the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">Defendant\u2019s attorney objected to the proposed charge, arguing mere possession of the knife would not warrant a conviction for first-degree robbery without \u201csome sort of use of that weapon or display [of] that weapon.\u201d Nevertheless, relying on <em>Clark, </em>the court charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-11\">I have some good news and bad news-the code does not define the word armed. However, the cases distinguish armed from mere possession. It\u2019s different than mere possession and the case law seems to indicate that being <em>armed means possessing an implement in a way that makes it available for use as a weapon. The defendant\u2019s intent with respect to the object is irrelevant. </em>So it\u2019s something more than possession, it means possessing an implement in a way that makes it available for use as a weapon. I hope that helps you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-12\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">This language, which is notably absent from our decision in <em>Clark, </em>may have been taken from Cannel, <em>New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, </em>comment 6 on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1 (2005) (emphasis added), which states: <em>\u201c[Clark </em>] appears to find that being <em>armed means possessing an implement in a way that makes it available for use as a weapon; the defendant\u2019s intent with respect to the object is irrelevant.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>The issue in <em>Clark, </em>however, was whether defendant, who admitted to unlawfully entering premises with a folding knife attached to the belt loop of his pants, could be convicted of second-degree \u201carmed\u201d burglary, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:18-2(b)(2), rather than third-degree \u201cunarmed\u201d burglary, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:18-2. <em>Clark, supra, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 137-38, 799 A.2d 679. Under the burglary statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:18-2, if a defendant \u201c[i]s armed with <em>or displays </em>what appear to be explosives or a deadly weapon,\u201d he may be convicted of second-degree armed burglary. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:18-2(b)(2) (emphasis added). Because \u201cthe statute manifestly establishes as an element the mere possession of such an implement,\u201d we held it was \u201cof no consequence ... that the article in question might also have innocent uses.\u201d <em>Clark, supra, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 138-39, 799 A.2d 679. Thus, defendant\u2019s possession and display of the folding knife on his belt loop was sufficient to elevate the crime to a second-degree offense, regardless of his intent with respect to the knife. <em>Id. </em>at 139, 799 A.2d 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The <em>Clark </em>court relied on <em>State v. Merritt, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>425, 428, 589 A.2d 648 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>336, 598 A.2d 893 (1991), a case in which the defendant was convicted of second-degree armed burglary after entering a residence and stealing, among other things, seven firearms. The defendant argued the firearms were \u201cproceeds of the theft and that he was not \u2018armed\u2019 because he did not use or intend to use firearms in connection with the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429, 589 A.2d 648. The <em>Merritt </em>court disagreed and upheld defendant\u2019s burglary conviction, stating that an individual \u201cmay be found to have been armed, without showing that he actually used or intended to use the weapon, so long as he had immediate access to the weapon during the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430, 589 A.2d 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In contrast to <em>Clark </em>and <em>Merritt, </em>which involved the armed burglary statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:18-2, the present appeal involves defendant\u2019s conviction for first-degree armed robbery. The circumstances here are therefore more closely akin to our decisions in the two robbery cases of <em>State v. Riley, </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>141, 703 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>A.2d 347 (App.Div.1997), and <em>State v. Brown, </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>447, 739 A.2d 975 (App.Div.1999), <em>certif. denied, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>76, 747 A.2d 285 (2000). In <em>Riley, supra, </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 145-46, 703 A.2d 347, we affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction for second-degree robbery, but we found the evidence was insufficient to convict defendant of first-degree robbery because \u201c[t]here was no evidence that defendant used or intended to use his pocket knife during the course of the robbery. Nor did the victim himself have knowledge of defendant\u2019s possession of the knife.\u201d Under those circumstances, we concluded defendant was not armed with a deadly weapon \u201csimply by reason of the pocket knife having been on his person during the course of the robbery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 703 A.2d 347. In distinguishing <em>Merritt, </em>the <em>Riley </em>court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">We reasoned [in <em>Merritt </em>] that mere possession o\u00ed those firearms met the statutory element of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:18-2b(2) of being armed with a deadly weapon because they wore accessible for use by defendant while committing the crime [of burglary] whether or not he actually used or intended to use them. We fully concur in that reasoning but nevertheless think it clear that this ease is different. Firearms are <em>per se </em>deadly weapons. Here, the implement with which defendant may be regarded to have been armed can be deemed to have been a deadly weapon \u2014 the other half of the \u201carmed with a deadly weapon\u201d formulation \u2014 only if the implement was, in fact, a deadly weapon. And this implement \u2014 the pocket knife \u2014 can only be found to have been a deadly weapon if it was used or intended to be used as such.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abi\">[Riley, <em>supra, </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 149-50, 703 A.2d 347.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">In a case such as this, where the knife was not a per se deadly weapon, the <em>Riley </em>court recognized that \u201carmed with a deadly weapon\u201d is comprised of two components, and the \u201cdefendant\u2019s actual or presumed state of mind in possessing the implement is critical to the determination of whether the implement is a weapon at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150, 703 A.2d 347. Thus, in the present matter, defendant\u2019s intent regarding the knife was not irrelevant. <em>See State v. Blaine, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>66, 70, 533 A.2d 980 (App.Div.1987) (holding that \u201ca folding knife with a four-inch blade\u201d was \u201csusceptible to both lawful and unlawful uses, [therefore] its status as a weapon whose possession is capable of subjecting its possessor to criminal liability is entirely dependent on the circumstances attending the possession\u201d); <em>see also State v. Lee, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>156, 162, 475 A.2d 31 (1984) (explaining that \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>determine whether the purpose of an actor was to use an otherwise innocent object \u201cas a weapon\u201d) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">We relied upon the holding in <em>Riley </em>in the factually similar case of <em>State v. Brown. </em>In <em>Brown, supra, </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 450, 739 A.2d 975, defendant struck an elderly woman in her back as she was walking home from a Pathmark supermarket, and he took her shopping bag and purse after she fell to the ground. When defendant was apprehended a short time later, he had \u201can ordinary kitchen knife with a five-inch long blade\u201d in his right front pocket. <em>Ibid. </em>Although he was subsequently found not guilty of first-degree robbery, defendant argued his motion for acquittal of the first-degree charge should have been granted and we agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">As in <em>Riley, </em>the knife was neither held by defendant nor seen by the victim. The only evidence was that [the knife] was immediately available to defendant during the robbery. While that establishes that defendant was armed, <em>[Merritt, supra, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 429-30, 589 A.2d 648], it is not sufficient evidence that the weapon was a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d as defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-1c.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\"><em>[Brown, supra, </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 454, 739 A.2d 975.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Of course, \u201crobbery, as an aggravated form of theft is a specific intent crime----In other words, without the intention to steal evidenced by a theft or attempted theft, there can be no robbery.\u201d <em>State v. Lopez, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>91, 98, 900 A.2d 779 (2006) (internal citations omitted). Moreover, both <em>Riley </em>and <em>Brown </em>stand for the proposition that in a robbery case, where the potential weapon is not per se a deadly weapon, like a firearm, a defendant cannot be considered to have been \u201carmed with a deadly weapon\u201d unless he had immediate access to the potential weapon as well as an intent to use it in a way that is \u201ccapable of producing death or serious bodily injury or which in the manner it is fashioned would lead the victim reasonably to believe it to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-1(c) (defining deadly weapon).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">\u201cAn essential ingredient of a fair trial is that a jury receive adequate and understandable instructions.\u201d <em>State v. Afanador, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>41, 54, 697 A.2d 529 (1997). In this case, the jury was told: \u201cArmed means possessing an implement [the knife] in a way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>that makes it available for use as a weapon. The defendant\u2019s intent with respect to the object is irrelevant.\u201d This instruction was inadequate because it was incorrect. It was incorrect because the jury was told it could convict defendant of first-degree robbery even if it believed defendant never actually used, threatened to use, or intended to use the knife. Consequently, defendant\u2019s first-degree robbery conviction must be reversed. <em>See Lopez, supra, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>at 101, 900 A.2d 779 (stating that \u201cerroneous instructions on material issues are presumed to be reversible error\u201d) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">We therefore reverse defendant\u2019s first-degree robbery conviction and remand that charge for a new trial. In light of our disposition, it is unnecessary to address defendant\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-14\"> The record does not reveal the gestures Padilla apparently made simultaneously with this testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
