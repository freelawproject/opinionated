The motion judge summarily dismissed plaintiffs complaint finding that defendant qualified for \u201cseller\u201d immunity under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">The essential issue on appeal concerns the distinction between \u201cseller\u201d and \u201cmanufacturer\u201d and presents the question whether a product packager or labeler is a \u201cseller\u201d entitled to statutory protection from strict liability or instead is a part of the \u201cmanufacturing\u201d process otherwise subject to account for a product defect under New Jersey\u2019s Products Liability Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-1 to -11. We adhere to the latter view based on the facts of record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>and therefore reverse the summary judgment dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s complaint. We also hold that under New Jersey\u2019s choice-of-law rules, the State\u2019s procedural and substantive law governs plaintiff\u2019s claims, including those under the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to 8-20, over Alabama\u2019s counterparts.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The facts material to resolution of these issues are largely undisputed. Plaintiff was a 52-year old Army helicopter pilot residing in Alabama when the incident occurred on October 3, 1999. A few weeks earlier, he had been on temporary duty in Philadelphia where he purchased a small amount of Acutrim to help suppress his appetite. Following his routine, while at home in Alabama on the afternoon of October 3, plaintiff ingested one pill before his daily workout. After exercising for about forty-five minutes, plaintiff fell ill and entered the shower. He has no recollection of what transpired next.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Plaintiff was found unconscious in the shower by emergency personnel who transported him to the local hospital where, appearing \u201ccomatose,\u201d he was intubated. A CT scan revealed a large intraparenehymal hematoma of the right posterior parietal occipital area. Plaintiff was transferred the next day to South Alabama Medical Center, where he underwent surgery for an emergency \u201cright parietal occipital craniotomy [for] evacuation of intracerebral hematoma.\u201d He was eventually discharged on October 21,1999 with a prognosis of likely permanent injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Plaintiffs expert opined that plaintiff suffered a hemorrhagic stroke \u201cdue to the ingestion of Acutrim containing PPA\u201d At the time, plaintiff had been in reasonably good health and had no known risk factors, including hypertension, for stroke.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Acutrim is an over-the-counter weight loss product that was advertised as providing maximum strength appetite control. On the front of the Acutrim package were the words \u201cSafe, Effective Weight Loss-Works All Day.\u201d According to the label on the rear of the package, the active ingredient in Acutrim is PPA</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>\u201cPhenylpropanolamine [PPA] is a synthetic sympathomimetic amine commonly found in appetite suppressants and cough and cold remedies.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cSympathomimetic\u201d means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtO\">that it shares many of the same effects as stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight response) including cardiovascular effects (elevation of blood pressure and force of contraction of the heart) and central nervous system effects (increased alertness, anxiety).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">There have been studies, reports, and articles dating back more than twenty years warning of the grave risks of PPA, such as (1) high blood pressure; (2) hemorrhagic stroke due to PPA\u2019s tendency to elevate blood pressure and narrow the cerebral vessels; and (3) seizures. Medical studies have concluded that PPA\u2019s risk-benefit ratio does not justify its clinical use, as it is \u201cnot an essential or irreplaceable medication because alternatives are available to treat each of its indications (nasal congestion, obesity), and have been for several decades.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Based on these reports, particularly a large scale epidemiologic study, known as the Yale Study, concluded in 1999, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which earlier declined to categorize PPA as safe and effective in 1985<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, and again in 1994<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, published a Proposal to Withdraw Approval in the Federal Register on August 14, 2001, declaring its intention to withdraw approval of all PPA containing products.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Notwithstanding these reports, the labels of products containing PPA failed to warn of the associated risks of increased blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>pressure, hypertension and the potential for strokes. No such warnings were included on the Acutrim label.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Acutrim was manufactured by Michigan-based J.B. Laboratories (J.B. Labs), which shipped the finished tablets in bulk to Steritek, a New Jersey contract packager of a variety of healthcare, beauty and pharmaceutical products for packaging, labeling, and distribution. The packaging was actually provided by another Acutrim manufacturer, Heritage Consumer Products (Heritage).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Once received at its Moonachie plant, Steritek packaged the Acutrim tablets in \u201cblister\u201d packaging, placed the labeling on the boxes, put the boxes into cartons, and shipped the packaged Acutrim to an out-of-state distribution center designated by Heritage. Steritek\u2019s Executive Vice-President emphasized, however, that at no time during the period of its contract services \u2014 from 1999 to prior to the FDA\u2019s recall of PPA products \u2014 did Steritek maintain or exercise significant control over \u201cthe labeling, directions for use, warnings, or other consumer information placed or intended to be placed on the Acutrim product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Plaintiffs original complaint named a number of defendants involved in the manufacture, packaging, and distribution of products containing PPA and alleged causes of action grounded in negligence, products liability for defective design and failure to warn, breach of express and implied warranty, and violations of New Jersey\u2019s Consumer Fraud Act, among others. The complaint was later amended to include Steritek.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Following discovery, Steritek moved for summary judgment arguing that under Alabama\u2019s statute of limitations, which does not recognize the \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d plaintiffs action is time-barred and, alternatively, that defendant was a \u201cseller,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-8, and therefore entitled to seller\u2019s immunity, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9. The motion judge, applying the \u201cgovernmental interests\u201d test, concluded that New Jersey procedural law applied, but that Steritek qualified for the statutory \u201cproduct seller\u201d exemption inasmuch as it did not \u201cexert significant control over the manufacture of the product to hold them [sic] strictly liable.\u201d The judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">In this ease, the Court finds that Steritek was indeed a \u2018product selier\u2019, because they distributed the product as recognized at oral argument, and packaged and labeled the product according to Heritage\u2019s specifications. The fcjourt further finds that Steritek failed to exert the requisite control relative to the alleged delect, which would prevent them from utilizing the [AT./.SA] 2A:58C-9 escape provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Accordingly, the judge dismissed plaintiffs complaint.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Plaintiff appeals, maintaining Steritek is a non-selling \u201cmanufacturer\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-8, and therefore not entitled to seller\u2019s immunity under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9. Defendant disagrees, and cross-appeals, arguing that plaintiffs complaint should be dismissed as time-barred under Alabama\u2019s procedural law and as not viable under that state\u2019s substantive law of products liability and breach of warranty. We hold that New Jersey law applies and that defendant is not entitled to statutory immunity under our law.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">We address these points in the order presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">\u201cProduct liability actions in New Jersey are governed by our Products Liability Act [ (PLA) ], <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-1 to-11.\u201d <em>Ban</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number><em>ner v. Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., </em>388 <em>N.J.Super. </em>364, 375, 891 A.2d 1229 (App.Div.2006), <em>certif. denied, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>393, 921 A.2d 447 (2007). Liability under the PLA is limited to manufacturers and \u201cproduct sellers.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">A <em>manufacturer </em>or <em>seller of a product </em>shall be liable in a product liability action only if the claimant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the product causing the harm was not reasonably fit, suitable or safe for its intended purpose because it: a. deviated from the design specifications, formulae, or performance standards of the manufacturer or from otherwise identical units manufactured to the same manufacturing specifications or formulae, or b. failed to contain adequate warnings or instructions, or c. was designed in a defective manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">[N.J.S.A 2A-58C-2 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The distinction between a manufacturer and a \u201cproduct seller\u201d is of great import because \u201c[i]n 1995, the Legislature enacted <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-8 to-9 <em>(L. </em>1995, <em>c. </em>141), which allows a seller of an alleged defective product to be relieved of liability under certain circumstances by filing an affidavit correctly identifying the manufacturer of the product.\u201d <em>Claypotch v. Heller, Inc., </em>360 <em>N.J.Super. </em>472, 483, 823 A.2d 844 (App.Div.2003). Thus, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">a. In any product liability action against a product seller, the product seller may file an affidavit certifying the correct identity of the manufacturer of the product which allegedly caused the injury, death or damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-9\">b. Upon filing the affidavit pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the product seller shall be relieved of all strict liability claims, subject to the provisions set forth in subsection d. of this section. Due diligence shall be exercised in providing the plaintiff with the correct identity of the manufacturer or manufacturers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-10\">' c. The product shall be subject to strict liability if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-11\">(2) The manufacturer has no known agents, facility, or other presence within the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-12\">(3) The manufacturer has no attachable assets or has been adjudicated bankrupt and a judgment is not otherwise recoverable from the assets of the bankruptcy estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-13\">d. A product seller shall be liable if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-14\">(1) The product seller has exercised some significant control over the design, manufacture, packaging or labeling of the product relative to the alleged defect in the product which caused the injury, death or damage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>At issue here is whether Steritek, the packager and labeler of Acutrim, qualifies as a \u201cproduct seller,\u201d as defined by the statute, and thus is eligible for exemption from liability under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:58C-9, or is instead a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d not cloaked with statutory immunity. Under the PLA, a manufacturer is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4-\">(1) any person who designs, formulates, produces, creates, makes, <em>packages, labels </em>or constructs any product or component of a product; (2) a product seller with respect to a given product to the extent the product seller designs, formulates, produces, creates, makes, packages, labels or constructs the product before its sale; (3) any product seller not described in paragraph (2) which holds itself out as a manufacturer to the user of the product; or (4) a United States domestic sales subsidiary of a foreign manufacturer if the foreign manufacturer has a controlling interest in the domestic sales subsidiary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A-.58C-8 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">A \u201cproduct seller,\u201d on the other hand, is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al2\">any person who, in the course of a business conducted for that purpose: sells; distributes; leases; installs; prepares or assembles a manufacturer\u2019s product according to the manufacturer\u2019s plan, intention, design, specifications or formulations; biends; <em>packages; labels; </em>markets; repairs; maintains or otherwise is involved in placing a product in the line of commerce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(emphasis added) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">The likely purpose of including the definition of \u201cmanufacturer\u201d in the 1995 legislation \u201cwas to distinguish between manufacturers and sellers for the purposes of application of the seller immunity provisions.\u201d Dreier, Keefe, <em>&amp; </em>Katz, <em>Current N.J. Products Liability &amp; Toxic Torts Law, </em>\u00a7 2:21 at 19 (2008 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">While these definitions appear to overlap somewhat, there must nevertheless be a clear distinction drawn lest the Section 9 exemption be devoid of any meaning. <em>See State v. Reynolds, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>559, 564, 592 A.2d 194 (1991) (\u201cA construction that will render any part of a statute inoperative, superfluous, or meaningless, is to be avoided.\u201d) Or, stated differently, if every packager or labeler qualifies for the \u201cproduct seller\u201d immunity, their inclusion in the definition of \u201cmanufacturer,\u201d to whom strict liability may attach, would be rendered inoperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">Clearly, packaging and labeling activity falls within the scope of the manufacturing function defined in Section 8. What Section 9 does, however, is to exempt those entities that package or label <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>incidental or ancillary to their primary business of selling the product at issue. Thus, Section 9 defines a \u201cproduct seller\u201d as \u201cany person who, <em>in the course of a business conducted for that purpose ... </em>[,]\u201d <em>i.e. </em>selling a product, may also engage in certain other incidental activities. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:58C-9 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The plain meaning of the underscored language is to exempt from the strict liability of the PLA only those entities in the business of selling the allegedly defective product. Irrespective of whatever other activities a seller may be engaged in, the sale of the product is the defining characteristic for qualification as a \u201cproduct seller.\u201d The statutory distinction, therefore, is between a manufacturer who may also sell its product and a seller who may perform functions otherwise encompassed within the broad definition of \u201cmanufacturing,\u201d but which are merely incidental to its business of selling the product. As to the latter, the performance of some \u201cmanufacturing\u201d activities does not necessarily render the seller a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d subject to strict liability. Indeed, this distinction is highlighted in Section 9(d), which relieves a \u201cproduct seller\u201d of liability only if it had no significant responsibility for the alleged product defect and the \u201cmanufacturer\u201d is amenable to service of process and is likely to be able to satisfy any judgment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9(c), (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">No reported decision by a New Jersey court has yet analyzed the strict liability of an entity whose activities are limited exclusively to product packaging or labeling. It remains clear, however, that the purpose of the product seller immunity provisions was \u201c \u2018to reduce litigation costs borne by innocent <em>retailers </em>in product liability actions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Claypotch, supra, </em>360 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 485, 823 A.2d 844 (emphasis added) (quoting Sponsor\u2019s Statement to <em>S. </em>1495 of 1995, enacted as <em>L. </em>1995, c. 141). And, the cases in which Section 9 has been implicated have consistently involved either retailers or wholesalers, <em>i.e. </em>those engaged in the selling of products in one form or another. <em>See Agurto v. Guhr, </em>381 <em>N.J.Super. </em>519, 529, 887 A.2d 159 (App.Div.2005) (reversing trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the basis that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>qualified as a \u201cproduct seller,\u201d and remanding for trial to resolve material disputes of fact on the issue of whether selling glue machines <em>was part of defendant\u2019s </em>business); <em>Becker v. Tessitore, </em>356 <em>N.J.Super. </em>233, 251, 812 A.2d 369 (App.Div.2002) (trucking company which initially retread its truck tires on its own was not a product seller because it did not place the product into the stream of commerce, <em>i.e. </em>the product itself (the retread tire) had not been \u201cpresently and physically sold, leased or its possession exchanged\u201d); <em>D.J.L. v. Armour Pharm. Co., </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>61, 89 n. 25, 704 A.2d 104 (Law Div.1997) (indicating that \u201cthose in the wholesale and retail chain of distribution\u201d may qualify for the \u201cproduct seller\u201d exemption.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">By limiting the application of Section 9\u2019s immunity to retailers and wholesalers who have no significant responsibility for the alleged product defect, we thereby reconcile any overlap with Section 8 and avoid rendering the statutory distinction meaningless. Such construction also fully accords with the legislative purpose and design of the PLA, which is to impose strict liability upon entities within the chain of distribution. <em>See Becker, supra, </em>356 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 247, 812 A.2d 369 (the statutory definition \u201cencompasses entities within a product\u2019s chain of distribution and is consistent with most prior New Jersey case law\u201d.) <em>See also Magrine v. Krasnica, </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>228, 234, 227 A.2d 539 (Cty.Ct.1967), <em>aff'd sub nom, Magrine v. Spector, </em>100 <em>N.J.Super. </em>223, 241 A.2d 637 (App.Div.1968), <em>aff'd, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>259, 250 A.2d 129 (1969) (the reason for imposing strict liability is to make those who put the product \u201cin the stream of trade and promote its purchase by the public\u201d accountable for injuries arising from the promotion and use of the product.) Section 9 carves out a very limited exception to the PLA\u2019s overarching principle of imposing strict liability upon all entities in the chain of distribution, exempting only those whose exclusive role is to make the finished, packaged and labeled product available to consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Here, there is no evidence that Steritek ever sold Acutrim. Nor did defendant ever obtain title to the product throughout the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>entire manufacturing or distribution process so as to be considered a seller who exchanged ownership or passed title to the product in issue. <em>See Becker, supra, </em>356 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 251, 812 A.2d 369. On the contrary, defendant packaged, labeled and shipped the product in bulk to distribution centers for ultimate sale. While these activities are integrally connected to the manufacturing process, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-8, and represent the penultimate step in creating a finished product for sale, they nevertheless do not constitute the final act of \u201csale.\u201d As such, we conclude that defendant does not qualify as a \u201cproduct seller\u201d entitled to immunity from liability under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">On cross-appeal, defendant contends that Alabama rather than New Jersey law applies to the procedural and substantive issues of this case. Its argument is essentially based on the claim that since plaintiff is an Alabama resident and ingested the Acutrim pill in that state, Alabama has \u201cthe overriding governmental interest.\u201d For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Because plaintiff filed his action in New Jersey, the choice-of-law issue is analyzed in accordance with New Jersey rules. <em>See Gantes v. Kason Corp., </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>478, 484, 679 A.2d 106 (1996). Importantly, New Jersey has rejected the mechanical rule that the location of the injury determines the choice of law. <em>See Veazey v. Doremus, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>244, 247, 510 A.2d 1187 (1986). Rather, New Jersey \u201capplies a flexible \u2018governmental-interest\u2019 standard, which requires application of the law of the state with the greatest interest in resolving the particular issue that is raised in the underlying litigation.\u201d <em>Gantes, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 484, 679 A.2d 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">\u201cIn applying the governmental-interests analysis, two steps are involved.\u201d <em>Rowe v. Noffman-La Roche, Inc., </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>615, 621, 917 A.2d 767 (2007). The initial step entails an inquiry into whether there is an actual conflict between the laws of the interested states, a determination made on an issue-by-issue basis. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number><em>Gantes, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 484, 679 A.2d 106; <em>Veazey, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 248, 510 A.2d 1187. Absent any conflict, the forum state applies its own law to resolve the disputed issues. <em>Rowe, supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>at 621-22, 917 A.2d 767. If such a conflict exists, however, the next step is to determine \u201cthe state with the greatest interest in governing the particular issue.\u201d <em>Veazey, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 251, 510 A.2d 1187. To do this, the court must \u201cidentify the governmental policies underlying the law of each state and how these policies are affected by each state\u2019s contacts to the litigation and to the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248, 510 A.2d 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">\n<em>(a) Procedural Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Unquestionably, there is an actual conflict between New Jersey\u2019s and Alabama\u2019s statute of limitations. New Jersey follows the discovery rule for all tort claims, <em>see R.A.C. v. P.J.S., Jr., </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>81, 97-98, 927 A.2d 97 (2007), while, at the time of the motion judge\u2019s decision in this matter, Alabama applied the discovery rule only to fraud claims. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 6-2-3 (1975); <em>Cline v.

Fu, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>108, 119, 738 A.2d 1133 (1999)). The <em>Rowe </em>Court further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">If the contacts of a state do not \u201calign with the policies\u201d relating to the disputed issue, then that state generally will not be found to have the greatest interest in governing the issue. So, for example, if a particular policy is designed to enhance a specific group and that group is neither a party to nor potentially affected by the litigation, then that state\u2019s interest is not aligned with its policy and it would be unlikely that that state would have the strongest governmental interest in deciding the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The public policy underlying Alabama\u2019s statute of limitations may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">Statutes of limitations are founded in part at least on general experience that claims which are valid usually are not allowed to remain neglected, and that the lapse of years without any attempt to enforce a demand creates a presumption against its original validity or that it has ceased to exist. The basic principle most generally relied on by the authorities is that statutes of limitations are statutes of repose, the object of which is to prevent fraudulent and stale claims from springing up after long periods of time and surprising the parties or their representatives when evidence has become lost or the facts have become obscure from the lapse of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-9\">[Travis <em>v. Ziter, </em>681 So.2d 1348,1352 (Ala.1996) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">The policies underlying New Jersey\u2019s statute of limitations are quite similar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-11\">(1) to stimulate litigants to pursue a right of action within a reasonable time so that the opposing party may have a fair opportunity to defend, thus preventing the litigation of stale claims, and (2) to \u201cpenalize dilatoriness and serve as a measure of repose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-12\"><em>[Rivera v.

Both the practice and the rule emanate from our attempt to balance the defendant\u2019s interest in repose with the plaintiffs interest in a just determination of his or her claim.

In <em>Gantes, supra, </em>a products liability action filed in New Jersey by the representative of a Georgia decedent who was killed at work in Georgia allegedly by a defective product that had been manufactured in New Jersey thirteen years prior, the Court was faced with a similar choice-of-law issue as here. 145 <em>N.J. </em>at 481-83, 679 A.2d 106. Under Georgia law, the plaintiffs lawsuit would have been time-barred because of a statute of repose that, in order to stabilize insurance underwriting and eliminate stale claims, prohibited products liability actions from being filed more than ten years after the original sale of the product. <em>Id. </em>at 485, 679 A.2d 106. New Jersey law, however, contained no such limitation and thus the plaintiff would be permitted to proceed because the suit was filed within New Jersey\u2019s two-year statute of limitations. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Because of this conflict, the Court analyzed whether the policies that underlie the contrasting laws gave rise to a governmental interest, <em>id. </em>at 487, 679 A.2d 106, which depended, in turn, on \u201cthe nature of the contacts that the state has to the litigation and to the parties.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Applying this principle, the Court concluded that New Jersey had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">a strong interest in encouraging the manufacture and distribution of safe products for the public and, conversely, in deterring the manufacture and distribution of unsafe products within the state. That interest is furthered through the recognition of claims and the imposition of liability based on principles of strict products-liability law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 490, 679 A.2d 106.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">New Jersey\u2019s interest in deterrence then had to be \u201ccompared and weighed against any governmental interest that Georgia ha[d] in applying its statute of repose in light of Georgia\u2019s contacts with the litigation and the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 493, 679 A.2d 106. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Court held that Georgia\u2019s interest in applying its statute of repose did not outweigh New Jersey\u2019s interest in deterrence because defendant was not a Georgia resident, nor had any contacts with Georgia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">The answer is clear. Georgia has no contacts with the defendant manufacturer or with this lawsuit. Hence, its special policy concerns over the impact of \u201copen-ended liability\u201d on its insurance industry and stale claims on its courts do not, in the context of this litigation, give rise to a governmental interest that must be protected by applying its statute of repose to foreclose this suit in New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">Here, although the plaintiffs are Georgia residents, that contact with the State of Georgia does not implicate the policies of its statute of repose, which is intended only to unburden Georgia courts and to shield Georgia manufacturers from claims based on product defects long after the product has been marketed or sold. Consequently, the application of Georgia\u2019s substantive law in these circumstances does not dictate the inclusion of its statute of repose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">Application of New Jersey law will not undermine Georgia\u2019s interest in compensating its injured residents because that interest is not actually implicated or compromised by allowing a products-liability action brought by Georgia residents to proceed against a non-Georgia manufacturer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 494, 496, 497-98, 679 A.2d 106]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">The Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Gantes </em>clearly has pertinence here. Alabama\u2019s interest in eliminating stale claims and protecting against open-ended liability of its domestic manufacturers will be neither fostered by applying that state\u2019s law, nor frustrated by the failure to apply it to non-resident entities such as Steritek, incorporated and operating in a foreign jurisdiction. In comparison, New Jersey has a substantial and distinctive governmental interest based on a strong policy of deterrence that seeks to discourage domestic entities from the manufacture and distribution within this State of unsafe products through the allowance of a products liability action. <em>See Gantes, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 494, 679 A.2d 106. Contrastingly, however, as comparable as Alabama\u2019s concern with deterrence may be, it is simply not advanced by application of its statute of limitations to a non-resident entity neither incorporated nor operating within its borders. And while incorporation <em>alone </em>may not be sufficient, <em>see Heavner v. Uniroyal, Inc., </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>130, 140, 305 A.2d 412 (1973), Steritek indisput<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>ably has \u201ca significant presence in New Jersey by virtue of its doing business here[,]\u201d sufficient to implicate the State\u2019s public policy and interest, which clearly prevail over that of Alabama. <em>Gantes, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 488, 679 A.2d 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Steritek seeks to challenge this conclusion by arguing that it is not the actual manufacturer, but merely used packaging and labeling provided by another entity. We have already addressed this so-called distinction. Suffice it to say, packagers and labelers clearly fall within the definition of \u201cmanufacturer\u201d under New Jersey\u2019s PLA. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-8; <em>see also </em>Dreier, Keefe &amp; Katz, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12:1-1 at 333. As such, they are subject to strict liability, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-2, notwithstanding the fact that Steritek may not have had any control over the contents and design of the labeling. <em>See Beshada v. Johns-Manville Prods. Corp., </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>191, 204, 447 A.2d 539 (1982) (noting that \u201cin strict liability cases, culpability is irrelevant\u201d); <em>Shackil v. Lederle Labs., Div. of Am. Cyanamid, Co., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>155, 204, 561 A.2d 511 (1989) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s next argument, nothing in <em>Rowe </em>diminishes the preeminence of New Jersey\u2019s interest here. There, a Michigan resident sued a New Jersey corporation in New Jersey, alleging failure to warn of the health risks associated with Accutane, 189 <em>N.J. </em>at 617, 917 A.2d 767, a drug that was FDA approved. <em>Id. </em>at 618, 917 A.2d 767. The issue before the Court was whether to apply Michigan law, which provided that FDA approval of a drug resulted in a conclusive determination that the health risk warnings issued by a corporation regarding the drug were adequate, or New Jersey law, which only created a rebuttable presumption of adequacy under such circumstances. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">The Court held that under New Jersey choice-of-law rules, Michigan law applied. The Court distinguished <em>Gantes, supra, </em>noting that \u201cNew Jersey\u2019s interest in allowing Rowe\u2019s suit to proceed is not as strong as our interest was in <em>Gantes.\u201d Id. </em>at 625, 917 A.2d 767. Notably, unlike the Georgia statute of repose in <em>Gantes </em>and Alabama\u2019s statute of limitations here, the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the Michigan statute implicated in <em>Rowe </em>was not limited to protecting domestic corporations. On the contrary, the Michigan law was also enacted to make \u201cprescription drugs more available to [its] residents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 627, 917 <em>A.2d </em>767. The Court elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">[c]ommenting on section 600.2946(5) [the Michigan law at issue], its proponents stated that \u201c[d]rug companies spend large sums of money and expend enormous energy getting approval for their products. Many valuable products never reach the market or are withdrawn because of successful lawsuits (or the threat of future lawsuits) even though there is no medical evidence that they are harmful.\u201d Supporters in the Michigan State Senate recognized that \u201c[c]onsumers ... suffer when they are denied new products that would increase public safety or improve their quality of life____[P]roduet liability litigation ... has added substantially to the cost and unavailability of many goods and services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa2\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(citations omitted) (alterations in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">Based on the preceding, the Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-10\">[i]n this instance, where the challenged drug was approved by the FDA and suit was brought by an out-of-state plaintiff who has no cause of action in his home state, this State\u2019s interest in ensuring that our corporations are deterred from producing unsafe products-which was determinative in <em>Gantes </em>and however weighty in other contexts-is not paramount. Our interest in deterring local manufacturing corporations from providing inadequate product warnings, within the context of an FDA approved drug, must yield to Michigan\u2019s interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 629-30, 917 A.2d 767 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-12\"><em>Rowe </em>is clearly distinguishable. Here, the Alabama statute of limitations does not have the consumer-protectionist feature considered dispositive to the application of Michigan law in <em>Rowe. </em>In fact, we are at a loss to identify any governmental interest \u2014 much less a substantial one \u2014 that would be advanced by the application of Alabama\u2019s procedural law to the facts of this case. In contrast, given defendant\u2019s material connection to New Jersey by virtue of the fact that the allegedly defective product was packaged and labeled here and then shipped from this State, New Jersey\u2019s substantial governmental interest in deterring the manufacture and distribution within its borders of unsafe products amply justifies application of its discovery rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">\n<em>(b) Substantive Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">As with their statutes of limitations, there is also a conflict in the two states\u2019 substantive law of products liability. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Alabama law, when an injured party sues a manufacturer for a defective product, Alabama follows the Alabama Extended Manufacturer\u2019s Liability Doctrine (AEMLD), which \u201crejects the adoption of the pure strict tort liability theory.\u201d <em>Atkins v. Am. Motors Corp., </em>335 So.2d 134, 137 (Ala.1976); <em>see also Spain v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>872 So.2d 101, 106 (Ala.2003); <em>Entrekin v. Atl. Richfield, Co., </em>519 So.2d 447, 449 (Ala.1987). In other words, \u201c[Alabama] has specifically declined to adopt in total the strict liability concept of <em>[Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>] \u00a7 402A, preferring instead to retain the fault-based concepts associated with traditional negligence actions.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Cutler Hammer, Inc., </em>646 So.2d 573, 576 (Ala.1994); <em>Casrell v. Altec Indus., Inc., </em>335 So.2d 128,132 (Ala.1976). According to the Alabama Supreme Court, a no-fault rule</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">puts the test of culpability in the quality of the product rather than in a standard of conduct resulting in the quality of the product; and it fails to distinguish between one whose conduct has contributed to its defective condition and one whose conduct has not so contributed. Indeed, candor requires a forthright admission that culpability in the traditional sense is lacking and any justification of the new tort theory must be founded on broader moral notions of consumer protection and on economic and social grounds, placing the burden to compensate for loss incurred by defective products on the one best able to prevent the distribution of those products.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">[Atkins, <em>supra, </em>335 So.2d at 139.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">In accordance with the concept of fault retained in Alabama products-liability jurisprudence, it is an affirmative defense to liability under AEMLD that \u201cthere is no causal relation in fact between [a defendant\u2019s] activities in connection with handling the product and its defective condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-9\">For example, the defendant may show that he is in the business or either distributing or processing for distribution finished products; he received a product already in a defective condition; he did not contribute to this defective condition; he had neither knowledge of the defective condition, nor an opportunity to inspect the product which was superior to the knowledge or opportunity of the consumer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOA\"><em>Ubid. </em>(footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Alabama\u2019s rule clearly conflicts with New Jersey products liability law, which deems culpability as irrelevant in a cause of action based on strict liability. <em>See Greenway Dev. Co. v. Borough of Paramus, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>546, 556, 750 A.2d 764 (2000) (In \u201ca products <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>liability manufacturing defect case ... the plaintiff ... is not required to prove fault.\u201d) For example, unlike New Jersey, under Alabama law, Steritek would be permitted to raise as a defense that they merely packaged Acutrim in packaging and labeling received from Heritage and thus, Steritek did not contribute to the defectiveness of the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">We therefore next identify the policies underlying these substantive differences to determine whether those policies are affected by the \u201cstate[s\u2019] contacts to the litigation and the parties.\u201d <em>See Rowe, supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>at 623, 917 A.2d 767 (quoting <em>Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 119, 733 A.2d 1133). The policy underlying Alabama\u2019s rejection of the no-fault concept is to afford business entities certain defenses not available under traditional no-fault strict liability.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">The only real difference between strict tort liability and the traditional, negligence theory in products liability cases is that those courts which have adopted the rule of strict liability look to the dangerous characteristics of the end product, rather than the methods or processes by which it was produced. This represents a shift in emphasis from the manufacturer\u2019s or retailer\u2019s conduct to the performance of his product. <em>While the results may be the same when applied to the liability of any given defendant </em>\u2014 meaning <em>simply a defendant must pay the consequences of placing an unreasonably dangerous product on the market </em>\u2014 it <em>does not preclude a defendant from asserting as a defense against such claims the lack of any causal relationship between his conduct and the defective condition of the product</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AN_\"><em>[Atkins, supra, </em>335 So.2d at 140-41 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">On the other hand, New Jersey\u2019s adherence to a no-fault theory of strict liability stems from encouraging the safe production of products among manufacturers. <em>See Stephenson v. R.A. Jones &amp; Co., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>194, 216, 510 A.2d 1161 (1986) (\u201c[T]he central focus of this Court\u2019s strict products liability decisions has been to minimize accidents by encouraging the optimum investment in safety. \u2018Unquestionably, it is in the public interest to motivate individuals in the context of commercial enterprise to invest in safety.\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also Coffman v. Keene Corp., </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>581, 598, 628 A.2d 710 (1993). For these reasons, New Jersey has declined the opportunity to intertwine negligence concepts with strict liability. <em>See Beshada, supra, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>at 208, 447 A.2d 539; <em>Freund v. Cellofilm Props., Inc., </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>229, 239-40, 432 A.2d 925 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>We are satisfied, as we were in the application of New Jersey\u2019s procedural law, that the nature of the State\u2019s contacts to the litigation and to the parties, and the strength of its underlying policies, are such to establish New Jersey\u2019s superior governmental interest in applying its law of products liability. As noted, Steritek is a New Jersey corporation operating a business here that packaged and labeled Acutrim in New Jersey and shipped the product from this State. Defendant has no contacts with Alabama. Moreover, the conduct allegedly causing the injury occurred outside Alabama. As such, other than plaintiffs residency, Alabama has no discernable interest in extending its products liability law to defendant, which actually may operate as a hindrance to its resident obtaining full compensation for his injuries. New Jersey, on the other hand, has a strong interest in applying its no-fault strict liability law to Steritek to encourage the manufacture and distribution of safe products for the public and, conversely, to deter the manufacture and distribution of unsafe products within the State. Accordingly, on remand, New Jersey\u2019s substantive law of products liability should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">\n<em>(c) New Jersey\u2019s Consumer Fraud Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Lastly, defendant argues that under New Jersey\u2019s choice-of-law rules, Alabama\u2019s Deceptive Trade Practices Act (ADTPA) applies rather than the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act (NJCFA). We disagree for reasons previously mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">There is a distinction between the two. Under the NJCFA, treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees are mandatory, <em>see Sheer v. EMK Motors, Inc., </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>465, 470, 455 A.2d 508 (App.Div.1982), while under the ADTPA, punitive damages are discretionary. <em>See Ala. </em>Code \u00a7 8-19-10(a)(2). New Jersey courts have concluded that this distinction is an actual conflict. <em>See, e.g., Meshinsky v. Nichols Yacht Sales, Inc., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>464, 476 n. 5, 541 A.2d 1063 (1988); <em>Huffmaster v. Robinson, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>315, 319, 534 A.2d 435 (Law Div.1986); <em>see also Heindel v. Pfizer, Inc., </em>381 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>364, 374 (D.N.J.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Although different in effect, the two statutes share similar legislative policies. The NJCFA</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">was enacted to \u201cprotect the consumer against imposition and loss as a result of fraud and fraudulent practices by persons engaged in the sale of goods and services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\"><em>[Scibek v. Longette, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>72, 77, 770 A.2d 1242 (App.Div.2001) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Similarly, the legislature in enacting the ADTPA, declared: \u201c[t]he public health, welfare and interest require a strong and effective consumer protection program to protect the interest of both the consuming public and the legitimate businessperson.\u201d Ala.Code \u00a7 8-19-2. Thus, while the laws of both states are premised on similar legislative goals of consumer protection, New Jersey\u2019s mandatory treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees provision provides a heightened level of protection. Nevertheless, the similarity of the underlying policies of both laws suggests application of the forum\u2019s law.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">As does the nature of the contacts involved, qualitatively and quantatively. New Jersey is the site of the alleged deceptive practice and, as noted, has a substantial interest in deterrence. <em>See Gantes, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 490, 679 A.2d 106. Alabama, on the other hand, although home to plaintiff, was not the situs where plaintiff purchased the Acutrim and has no direct relationship with defendant. Under the circumstances, because plaintiff purchased the Acutrim in Pennsylvania, he was thus not a consumer as defined under the statute. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 8-19-3(2) (defining consumer as \u201c[a]ny natural person who buys goods or services for personal, family or household use.\u201d) Indeed, any interest Alabama may have in compensating its domiciliary, <em>see Marinelli v. K-Mart, Corp., </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>554, 566, 724 A.2d 806 (App.Div. 1999), <em>aff'd, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>516, 745 A.2d 508 (2000), is better served by the NJCFA, which mandates punitive damages. Accordingly, New Jersey\u2019s interest in applying the NJCFA outweighs Alabama\u2019s interest, if any, in applying the ADTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">Reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-9\"> Walter N.

Because Heritage was only a sales and marketing company, it had not only to find a manufacturer for the product but also another time release technology. Heritage thereafter contracted with J.B.
