Defendant filed a motion seeking to suppress a statement he gave to the police. The State does not dispute defendant\u2019s assertion that it has no other evidence to place him at the scene of the homicide other than this statement. After conducting several days of hearings, the trial court concluded that defendant had voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Miranda </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number><em>v.

The Trial Court Erred In Determining That Law Enforcement Never Made Any Untrue Statements, Threats, or Misleading or False Promises</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-10\">POINT II THE \u201cINTERROGATION: ADVICE OF RIGHTS\u201d FORM USED IN THIS CASE IS PER SE UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS IT REQUIRES DECLARANTS TO SIMULTANEOUSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE FIFTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND NEW JERSEYS COMMON-LAW PRIVILEGE AGAINST SELF-INCRIMINATION</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">Before analyzing the facts of the instant matter, we set forth the legal principles which must guide our analysis of these facts. In <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>our United States Supreme Court set forth the rule that \u201cthe prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 444, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1612, 16 L.Ed.2d at 706. It held that a statement taken in the absence of those procedural safeguards could not \u201ctruly be the product of [a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>defendant\u2019s] free choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1619, 16 L.Ed.2d at 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Thus, prior to any custodial interrogation, an individual must be informed of his right to remain silent. <em>Id. </em>at 467-68, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1624, 16 L.Ed.2d at 720. This warning is \u201can absolute prerequisite in overcoming the inherent pressures of the interrogation atmosphere,\u201d because it dispels the idea \u201cthat the interrogation will continue until a confession is obtained or that silence in the face of accusation is itself damning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1624, 16 L.Ed.2d at 720. This warning is designed \u201cto insure that the individual knows he is free to exercise the privilege at that point in time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1625, 16 L.Ed.2d at 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In addition, to assure that the individual understands and can make an intelligent choice whether to exercise the privilege, the individual must also be told \u201cthat anything said can and will be used against the individual in court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1625, 16 L.Ed.2d at 720-21. It is only upon being advised of the <em>Miranda </em>rights that an individual may make a reasonable decision whether to proceed. A decision to proceed, however, is not irrevocable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">If the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease. At this point he has shown that he intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege; any statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise. Without the right to cut off questioning, the setting of in-custody interrogation operates on the individual to overcome free choice in producing a statement after the privilege has been once invoked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqq\"><em>[Id. </em>at 473-74, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1627-28, 16 L.Ed.2d at 723 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">An individual may, of course, waive the privilege against self-incrimination, but the prosecution must show that the waiver was made \u201cvoluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1612, 16 L.Ed.2d at 707.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\">[A]ny evidence that the accused was threatened, tricked, or cajoled into a waiver will, of course, show that the defendant did not voluntarily waive his privilege. The requirement of warnings and waiver of rights is a fundamental with respect to the Fifth Amendment privilege and not simply a preliminary ritual to existing methods of interrogation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>[Id. at 476, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1629, <em>16 L.Ed.2d </em>at 725.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Although New Jersey\u2019s constitution does not contain an explicit statement of the privilege against self-incrimination, our courts have long recognized it as being subsumed within our constitution\u2019s guarantee of due process. \u201cNew Jersey\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination is so venerated and deeply rooted in this state\u2019s common law that it has been deemed unnecessary to include the privilege in our State Constitution.\u201d <em>State v. O\u2019Neill, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>148, 176, 936 A.2d 438 (2007). New Jersey\u2019s privilege is \u201ctreated ... as though it were of constitutional magnitude,\u201d and it is informed by the principles contained in <em>Miranda. Id. </em>at 168\u201469, 176-77, 936 A.2d 438. Indeed, our courts have interpreted our privilege as \u201coffering] broader protection than its Fifth Amendment federal counterpart.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176-77, 936 A.2d 438. Before a confession can be admitted into evidence against a defendant, the State must prove that it was made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently. As a matter of state law, the prosecution must carry its burden in this regard beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Burris, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>509, 534, 679 A.2d 121 (1996); <em>State v. Gerald, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>40, 118, 549 A.2d 792 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">In <em>State v. Hartley, </em>our Supreme Court addressed the question whether law enforcement had \u201cscrupulously honored\u201d an individual\u2019s right to remain silent. 103 <em>N.J. </em>252, 255-56, 511 A.2d 80 (1986). The defendant in that case was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings both at the time of his arrest and in an interview room, where he was presented with a form containing the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and waiver language almost identical to the waiver language on the form in this matter. <em>Id. </em>at 258, 511 A.2d 80. And, like the present matter, the signature line was located under the waiver language. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, as the <em>Hartley </em>Court noted, \u201cthe only purpose of the signature was not to acknowledge receipt of one\u2019s rights but, rather, to indicate a waiver of those rights.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Hartley reviewed the form and said he understood it. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>hesitated and when asked what the problem was, responded, \u201cI don\u2019t believe I want to make a statement at this time.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The officer replied, \u201cPine. If you don\u2019t want to make a statement at this time, strike that particular item and initial it.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Hartley did so; he was fingerprinted and photographed but not questioned. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">A few hours later, however, the officer returned and asked the defendant to reconsider, saying \u201c[N]ow is the time if you are going to make a statement. Now is the time to do it.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Hartley responded, \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 259, 511 A.2d 80. The officer proceeded to question the defendant, who ultimately gave a confession. <em>Ibid. </em>He would not, however, sign a typed statement. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The defendant was again questioned at a later point and again advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Ibid. </em>He again refused to sign a typed statement and would not agree to be tape-recorded. At trial, his oral statements were held admissible as evidence against him. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Our Supreme Court, however, reversed. It commenced its analysis by noting the distinction between scrupulously honoring the right to remain silent and an individual\u2019s waiver of that right. The question whether an individual has waived the right to remain silent cannot be addressed, the Court stated, without first determining \u201cwhether the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent has been properly respected in the first instance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260, 511 A.2d 80. The Court noted that the Miranda Court had \u201cmade clear that the requirement that the police \u2018scrupulously honor\u2019 the suspect\u2019s assertion of his right to remain silent is independent of the requirement that any waiver be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261, 511 A.2d 80. It is critical that the questions be analyzed separately. When the police fail to scrupulously honor the right to remain silent, that failure \u201crenders unconstitutionally compelled any resultant incriminating statement made in response to custodial interrogation [and] there can be no question of waiver.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Hartley Court concluded after reviewing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>chronology and the context that the officer\u2019s conduct had been \u201ccoercive\u201d and that the officer had not scrupulously honored the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right to remain silent. <em>Id. </em>at 267-71, 511 A.2d 80. The Court, therefore, held that any statements made by the defendant were \u201cinvoluntary by definition\u201d and inadmissible at his trial. <em>Id. </em>at 278, 511 A.2d 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">A person can assert the right to remain silent by \u201cindicating] in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent.\u201d <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 473-74, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1627, 16 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 723. New Jersey courts have recognized that even an ambiguous indication of a desire to remain silent is sufficient to require that questioning cease. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>263, 281-82, 576 A.2d 834 (1990); <em>State v. Bey, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>45, 64-65, 548 A.2d 846 (1988) <em>(\u201cBey </em>I\u201d) (\u201ca request to terminate an interrogation must be honored \u2018however ambiguous\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>278, 288, 478 A.2d 723 (1984)). If the police are reasonably uncertain whether the person is asserting the right to remain silent, they may only ask questions directed to resolving that uncertainty. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 283, 576 A.2d 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">On the other hand, the police may continue their questioning so long as the person\u2019s words or conduct could not reasonably be viewed as invoking the right to remain silent. <em>State v. Bey, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>123, 136-38, 548 A.2d 887 (1988) <em>(\u201cBey II\u201d). </em>In <em>Bey II, </em>the defendant had been interrogated for two to three hours when he said he \u201cwanted to lie down so that he could think about what happened.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133, 548 A.2d 887. The Court concluded that defendant\u2019s statement, given the circumstances, could not reasonably be viewed as an assertion of the right to remain silent. <em>Id. </em>at 141-42, 548 A.2d 887. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">Defendant merely communicated his desire to spend some time thinking about the events that were the subject of the interrogation. He did not ask for an attorney <em>or refuse to sign a waiver of his rights. </em>Similarly, he did not refuse to continue the questioning, and <em>did not indicate in any manner that he wanted to end the interrogation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 138, 548 A.2d 887 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">We turn now to the record before us. Defendant was charged with the killing of Sonja Svenson, who was found stabbed to death in her Bayonne apartment on December 18, 2005, by defendant\u2019s mother and sister. Detectives from the Hudson County Prosecutor\u2019s Office noted that her jewelry box was open and that her dresser drawers had been opened and the contents dumped on her bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">For reasons that are not apparent from the record before us, the initial investigation by detectives from the prosecutor\u2019s office led them to consider defendant a \u201cperson of interest\u201d in connection with this homicide. On December 20, 2005, detectives from the prosecutor\u2019s office learned that defendant was being held in the Hudson County Administration Building, where he was waiting to appear before the trial court. Defendant was in custody because he had been arrested by Bayonne police on December 18 on unrelated charges of possession of narcotics and contempt of court; this arrest led to defendant being charged with violating the terms of his probation. The record before us does not reveal the underlying offense which resulted in defendant receiving a probationary sentence. Before defendant appeared before the trial court on the charge of violating his probation, however, a detective from the prosecutor\u2019s office went to the Administration Building and brought defendant to the office of the prosecutor\u2019s homicide unit, located in a separate building approximately two miles away from the Administration Building.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">When they arrived, defendant was placed in a small, windowless interrogation room. Defendant had been handcuffed during the trip from the Administration Building, but once in the interrogation room, the handcuffs were removed. Defendant was initially questioned by Detectives Jeffery and Pastrana of the prosecutor\u2019s office. This interrogation room is equipped with video and audio recording systems and defendant\u2019s entire interrogation was recorded. We have been supplied with both a copy of the videotape of the interrogation and a transcript in connection with this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>appeal, and we have reviewed both several times in our consideration of the merits of this appeal. We will set forth extensive portions of that interrogation during the course of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Early on, Detective Jeffery told defendant he was going to read to him his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Defendant asked if he were being charged with something and Detective Jeffery said no. He explained to defendant that he was reading his rights because defendant was \u201calready under arrest,\u201d presumably referring to the charge of violating probation. Detective Pastrana said to defendant it was \u201cjust a formality,\u201d and Detective Jeffery echoed that thought, saying, \u201cFormality that\u2019s all it is. It\u2019s nothing okay?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Detective Jeffery then read defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and defendant indicated that he understood them. Detective Jeffery then asked, \u201cYou ah you want to talk to us?\u201d and handed a waiver form to defendant for his signature. The form was headed \u201cInterrogation: Advice Of Rights,\u201d and contained the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Your Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Before we ask you any question, you must understand your rights.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">1. You have the right to remain silent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">2. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-11\">3. You have the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before you ask we ask you [sic] any questions, and to have him/her with you during questioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-12\">4. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be appointed for you, before any questioning. If you wish [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-13\">5. If you decide to answer questions now, without a lawyer present [sic]. You will still have the right to stop answering at any time. You also have the right to stop answering at any time until you talk to a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-14\">WAIVER OF RIGHTS</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-15\">I HAVE BEAD THIS STATEMENT OF MY RIGHTS, AND UNDERSTAND WHAT MY RIGHTS ARE. I AM WILLING TO MAKE A STATEMENT AND ANSWER QUESTIONS. I DO NOT WANT A LAWYER AT THIS TIME. I HAVE UNDERSTAND [sic] AND KNOW WHAT I AM DOING. NO PROM<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>ISES OR THREATS HAVE BEEN MADE TO ME AND NO PRESSURE OR COERCION OF ANY KIND HAS BEEN USED AGAINST ME.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Near the top of the form were lines for the interviewing officer to enter the place, date, and time. At the bottom, below the \u201cwaiver of rights\u201d clause, were signature lines for the person being interviewed and for two witnesses, as well as a line to record the time at which the form was signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Defendant spent a little more than a minute reading the waiver form. Detective Jeffery asked, \u201cYou ah, you gonna sign it?\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cUh-uh.\u201d When asked why not, defendant replied, \u201cThis says I am willing to make this statement and answer questions,\u201d referring to the second sentence in the waiver of rights clause. The two detectives tried to reassure defendant that he was not being charged with anything. Defendant said, \u201cIt\u2019s got \u2018interrogation\u2019 up there,\u201d referring to the title on the form. Detective Pastrana told defendant that \u201cinterrogation\u201d just meant asking him questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">For the next twenty-two minutes, defendant resisted signing the form. Including the initial refusal we just noted, he indicated a total of eleven times that he would not sign the form. He also clearly indicated that he did not want to talk to the detectives. After refusing for the fourth time to sign the form, Detective Jeffery asked, \u201cYou want to talk to us though?\u201d Defendant answered, \u201cUh-uh.\u201d The conversation continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">Q: Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-11\">A: I want to know what you wanna talk about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-12\">Q: Well we can\u2019t tell you till you say you\u2019ll, you agree to talk to us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-13\">A: I ain\u2019t going to sign.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-14\">Q: Will you agree to talk to us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-15\">A: About what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-16\">Q: Once, once we get rid of this silly piece of paper we\u2019re on our way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-17\">A: I ain\u2019t gonna sign it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-18\">Q: Will you talk to us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-19\">A: I\u2019m not gonna sign it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-20\">Q: Okay. Will you talk to us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-21\">A: You just said I got to sign this to talk to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Q: No, you, you, you really don\u2019t have to sign it but you can talk to us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">A: What do you want to talk about?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The detectives persisted in their attempts to persuade defendant to talk to them and answer their questions. They continued to ask if he were willing to talk to them; defendant inquired several times what they wanted to talk to him about; they responded they would tell him if he agreed to talk to them. On that basis, defendant finally agreed to talk to the detectives but he persisted in his refusal to sign the waiver form.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">When the detectives nonetheless continued to seek to have defendant sign the form, defendant said he did not want to talk to the detectives at all. At that point, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">Q: (Det. Jeffery): We\u2019re going to talk to you. Had you not been in Kearny [presumably a reference to the Hudson County Correctional Facility] we probably wouldn\u2019t have to read these things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">Q: (Det. Pastrana): See being that you\u2019re locked up we have to read you your rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-10\">Q: (Det. Jeffery): That\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-11\">Q: (Det. Pastrana): But if you were still on, on, by, Bayonne we would have scooped you up on Bidwell we would have scooped you up and we didn\u2019t have to go through this. Believe me we were gonna scoop you up until you were arrested Bayonne Sunday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-12\">A: For what though?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-13\">Q: Well. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-14\">Q: (Det. Jeffery): You gonna talk? Yes or no. We need you to say yes. If you \u25a0 say yes I write refuse to sign and that\u2019s it and we talk, we just, we just go our way, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-16\">A: I still go to court though, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-17\">Q: For what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-18\">A: I don\u2019t go to court today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-19\">Q: (Det.

Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">A: Cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">Q: Why don\u2019t you want to talk to us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">A: I want to know what you want to talk about. I don\u2019t really have anything to talk about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">Q: Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-10\">A: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-11\">Q: Let\u2019s make believe we\u2019re just regular guys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-12\">A: I don\u2019t really want to talk to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-13\">Q: We\u2019ve talked to your mom, we\u2019ve talked to Sharleese. We\u2019ve talked to ah, Tracey,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we\u2019ve talked to Mike Williams, who\u2019s your uncle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">At that point, a sergeant from the prosecutor\u2019s office entered the interrogation room and joined the conversation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-15\">Q: (Sgt. Kolieh): All right, let me explain what is going on, okay. I understand that you got arrested by Bayonne Police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-16\">A: Um-hm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-17\">Q: Okay we don\u2019t want to talk to you about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-18\">A: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-19\">Q: Okay so anything we talk about got nothing to do with that arrest, all right. We\u2019re investigating a homicide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-20\">A: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-21\">Q: And we have information that you, that you may be able to help us with our homicide and that\u2019s what we want to talk to you about. Just like anybody else we bring in here we want to talk to we read them their rights. It\u2019s just a formality. On the rights it says at anytime you want to stop talking you can stop talking to us. Okay? But we can\u2019t begin the conversation till you agree to talk to us and we start going. Anytime you feel uncomfortable you say listen, I don\u2019t want to talk anymore and it ends. You understand? Okay? We\u2019re asking you to help us out. All right, we\u2019re not charging you with anything? We\u2019re not going to talk to you Tabout] anything related to the other crime. This is just to help us out with a homicide investigation. Fair enough?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-22\">A: My mother still locked up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-23\">Q: (Det. Pastrana): No, I got her released.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-24\">Q: (Det. Jeffery): We took care of your mother, like, like, like she was our relatives [sic].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>After explaining that the detectives had arranged to have defendant\u2019s mother released on her own recognizance (the record does not reveal why she was being held), the conversation continued.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">Q: (Sgt. Kolich): My guys read this to you right? Did you get a chance to read it? And you said, it says right here, um, if you decide to answer questions now without a lawyer present you\u2019ll still have the right to stop answering at anytime. You also have the right to stop answering at anytime until you talk to a lawyer. Do you understand what that says? Yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">A: Um-hm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">Q: When you shake your head I don\u2019t know what that means, that\u2019s why.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">A: Yeah, I know what it means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">Q: Okay. So that\u2019s why, now, they read each one of these and you, you understood each one of these?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">A: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-11\">Q: Okay, see, see we\u2019re not trying to trick you. We\u2019re being straight up front with you. We need your help in a homicide investigation and that\u2019s why we\u2019re asking you to talk to us, simple as that. Is that fair enough? So if you can sign that____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-12\">A: I\u2019m still not going to sign that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-13\">Q: Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-14\">A: Cause I\u2019m being interrogated by you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-15\">Q: Listen to me, okay. There\u2019s no interrogation going on it\u2019s a question. All right, this is a formality that we do and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen it on T.V. hundreds of times. When they talk to people they read them their rights. You\u2019re not being charged ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-16\">Q: (Det. Pastrana): You\u2019re being interviewed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-17\">Q: (Sgt. Kolich): You\u2019re not being charged by us with a crime. You\u2019ve got something to hide here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-18\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-19\">Q: Then why won\u2019t you want to talk to us if you got nothing to hide?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-20\">A: Because man, y\u2019all just snatched me up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-21\">Q: How did we snatch you up when you were in Court? Do you understand why we snatched you up? Because we have, your name came up in a homicide investigation and you may be able to help us. So yeah, are we gonna snatch you up, we\u2019re gonnna snatch up anybody that can help us. Eight? Doesn\u2019t that make sense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-22\">A: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-23\">Q: (Det. Jeffery): You just happened to be in court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-24\">A: How can I help y\u2019all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Q: (Sgt. Kolich): If we were, if we were going to trick you would we read you this and tell you, you can stop us at any, stop talking at anytime? We\u2019re putting it right out in front of you, being right up front saying this is your rights and this is why we want to talk to you. We\u2019re not trying to trick you. Now, I looked at your rap sheet you\u2019ve been arrested before, right? And every time you were arrested you were given your rights, weren\u2019t you? So you know what the system is about. We\u2019re not trying to trick you we\u2019re being right up front with you. I would think if it was a homicide investigation you\u2019d want to help out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">A: Hell no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Faced with defendant\u2019s continued unwillingness to sign the waiver form, the sergeant tried another tack.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">Q: Do you understand you\u2019re not here under arrest for anything (inaudible). You\u2019re under arrest because of Bayonne. They locked you up ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">A: I know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">Q: for possession I believe, right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">A: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-12\">Q: Okay that\u2019s what you were arrested for. We don\u2019t want to talk to you about that. We don\u2019t care about that. Don\u2019t care about that. In fact maybe some of the information you give us we may be able to help you with that charge. But I don\u2019t know until you talk to us. You know one hand may be able to help the other here. And I understand the person that\u2019s involved in this may be a family friend of yours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-13\">A: In what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-14\">Q: And that\u2019s why we want to talk to you about this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-15\">A: (Mumbles.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-16\">Q: All right the victim in this may be a family friend of your family and that\u2019s why we want to talk to you about this. I\u2019m just trying to be straight and fair with you. I\u2019ve never seen anybody give us this much (inaudible) this much trouble trying to sign this and talk to us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-17\">A: No but like um, I ain\u2019t no snitch____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-18\">Q: Listen, look at me, look at me right now. First of all, first of all what were you arrested what [sic] narcotics and bullshit stuff. You\u2019re in the big leagues now, this is homicide. Okay? It\u2019s not about snitching.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-19\">A: How, how I\u2019m in the <em>big </em>league?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-20\">Q: It\u2019s not, it\u2019s not, no this investigation is about a homicide. This is the big leagues. It\u2019s not about snitching right now. It\u2019s about trying to do the right thing for an innocent victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-21\">A: Yeah I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-22\">Q: I know that and the only way we can talk to you is if you sign this and say okay and then if it reaches a point where you feel uncomfortable you say I don\u2019t want to talk anymore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-23\">A: I feel uncomfortable right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Q: Why? Are you getting accused of anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">Q: So why does it make you uncomfortable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">Q: (Det.

That was some lady my mother used to clean up for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-14\">Q: Okay. Okay, so we want to talk to you about her. Do you have something to hide on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-15\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-16\">Q: Then why don\u2019t you want to talk to us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-17\">A- Just like____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-18\">Q: (Det.

Pastrana): Then when we pick you up the next time it\u2019s not going to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUn\">A: She was just somebody that my mother cleaned up for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-21\">Q: All right. That\u2019s why we wanted you to sign the papers so that we could talk to you and ask you questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-22\">Q: (Det. Jeffery): It\u2019s a friend of your mother\u2019s. As a matter of fact, your mother was in tears yesterday. Like she went through a whole roll of this stuff because of what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-23\">Q: (Det. Pastrana): Why you afraid talking about us like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-24\">Q: (Det. Jeffery): You know ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-25\">A: I\u2019m not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-26\">Q: and we did the right thing by your mother. We bought her lunch.

Again, the victim in this is a family friend of yours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-q\">A: She ain\u2019t, she not really a family friend. She\u2019s just a lady that my mother used to clean up for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-13\">Q: Okay. Well, it was enough that your mother was very upset about her death. And I would think that if your mother is that close to somebody that you would want to help out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-14\">A: That don\u2019t mean I was close to her. Or anybody else. My sisters didn\u2019t never talk to her like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-15\">Q: Listen to me I understand that, okay. But we have some specific questions that we want to ask you, all right. But until you sign that we can\u2019t ask them, right. And to me that\u2019s so silly cause it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re trying to hide something but yet what do you have to hide?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-16\">A: You keep saying that but I don\u2019t got to hide nothing all right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-17\">Q: All right then ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-18\">Q: (Det.

I\u2019ll go, I\u2019ll go get one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-34\">At that point, promised a cigarette, defendant finally signed the waiver form.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>According to the executed form, the detectives informed defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and initially asked him to sign the waiver form at 11:50 a.m. Defendant did not sign the form until nearly one-half hour later, at 12:18 p.m., after repeatedly telling the detectives he did not want to talk to them and did not want to sign the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">He proceeded to tell the detectives that he had, indeed, gone to the victim\u2019s apartment but that when he arrived, he found her stabbed to death. He admitted that he pilfered several items and then left. Defendant was subsequently indicted for the killing and moved to suppress this statement as having been taken in violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Here, in contrast to the situation in <em>Bey II, supra, </em>defendant refused on eleven separate occasions to sign a waiver of his rights. We recognize that defendant\u2019s refusal to sign a waiver form does not necessarily equate to an assertion of the right to remain silent; it is one factor to be considered. <em>State v. Warmbrun, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>51, 62-64, 648 A.2d 1153 (App.Div.1994), <em>certif. denied, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>277, 658 A.2d 300 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The defendant in <em>Warmbrun </em>was convicted of reckless manslaughter after striking and killing a pedestrian while driving under the influence of alcohol. Although the defendant refused to sign the proffered waiver form, he \u201cwillingly discussed his drinking\u201d that evening. <em>Id. </em>at 64, 648 A.2d 1153. The totality of the circumstances in that ease \u201cindicated a knowing and intelligent waiver given defendant\u2019s continued discussion of the matter.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The record here, however, contains no such indication.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">\u201cThe voluntariness of defendant\u2019s waiver is tested by the totality of all the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 648 A.2d 1153. In <em>Warmbrun, </em>the defendant refused to sign a waiver form, but was nonetheless willing to answer questions. <em>Id. </em>at 61, 648 A.2d 1153. In that case, we concluded that defendant, despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>refusing to sign the form, had not asserted his right to remain silent. <em>Id. </em>at 64, 648 A.2d 1153.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Here, however, defendant did not merely refuse, repeatedly, to sign the form presented to him. He also explained that he would not sign the form because he did not want to make a statement. Here, in contrast to the procedure that was followed in <em>Hartley, </em>defendant was not initially given the option of crossing out and initialing that portion of the form which indicated a waiver of his rights. 103 <em>N.J. </em>at 258, 511 A.2d 80. And when that option was finally presented to him, he clearly refused it. Defendant was pressed continually by the officers for nearly one-half hour to execute the form and talk to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">He was told by one of the officers that the form was merely a \u201csilly piece of paper.\u201d He was told that signing the waiver form (an action tantamount to relinquishing his right to remain silent) was \u201cjust a formality we have.\u201d He was repeatedly urged to sign the waiver form on the basis that he was not under arrest for and charged with homicide. The officers told him that the only reason that he had been read his <em>Miranda </em>rights was the fact that he had previously been arrested for a drug-related offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Defendant, moreover, on several occasions, explicitly said he did not wish to talk to the officers. After his first refusal to sign the waiver form, one of the detectives said to him, \u201cYou want to talk to us though?\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cUh-uh.\u201d That the detectives clearly understood this answer to be a refusal to answer any questions is indicated by the detective\u2019s response, \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Faced with a clear statement from defendant that he did not wish to answer any questions from the officers, their questioning should have ceased. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 280-82, 576 A.2d 834. And yet the questioning did not cease; rather, it continued for almost one-half hour more until defendant finally relented and signed the form as the detectives had pressed him to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Not only did the detectives continue to press defendant to execute the waiver form and to speak to them, they challenged his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>motives in refusing to accede to their requests. In <em>Hartley, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 278, 511 A.2d 80, the Supreme Court referred approvingly to <em>Anderson v. Smith, </em>751 <em>F.</em>2d 96 (2d Cir.1984), which held that it violated a defendant\u2019s right to remain silent to ask why he refused to talk.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">The interrogator never needs to know why a suspect wants to remain silent; once it is clear that the suspect wants to remain silent, the interrogation should cease. After all, the Fifth Amendment assumes that the suspect invokes his right in order not to be a witness against himself; that is reason enough. An interrogator would only want to probe beyond the suspect\u2019s presumed desire to avoid self-inerimination if he expected either to evoke an incriminating response or to get a clue as to how the suspect might be persuaded to abandon his rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\"><em>[Anderson v. Smith, </em>751 F.2d 96, 105 (2d Cir.1984), <em>overruled on other grds., Maleng v. Cook, </em>490 <em>U.S. </em>488, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1923, <em>104 L.Ed.2d </em>540 (1989).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">We recognize the principle upon which the State relies, that we should defer to the trial court\u2019s factual findings underlying the trial court\u2019s decision so long as they are \u201csupported by adequate, substantial and credible evidence\u201d in the record. <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co. of Am., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974). We are satisfied that it is inapplicable in the present matter, however, because we have concluded that the trial court\u2019s legal analysis was not entirely correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Within the course of its extensive oral opinion, the trial court made certain credibility findings after hearing the testimony of the several witnesses. Those credibility findings dealt with the subjective intent of the officers during this entire exchange. Based upon those findings, the trial court concluded that the officers did not intend to mislead defendant, and defendant did not intend to assert his right to remain silent. The trial court concluded that defendant\u2019s statement was thus admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">The critical question, however, is not whether defendant intended to assert his right to remain silent or whether the officers intended to mislead defendant into waiving his rights. Rather, the critical question is whether defendant\u2019s words or conduct could reasonably be viewed as an assertion of his right to remain silent; if they could be, the officers were obligated to cease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>their questioning or limit their questions solely to clarify that issue. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 283, 576 A.2d 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Both the trial court in its oral opinion and the State in its brief on appeal merge together the analyses of two separate questions: did the State \u201cscrupulously honor\u201d defendant\u2019s right to remain silent and did defendant make a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of that right? It is only when the first question is answered in the affirmative that it is necessary to deal with the second.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">[W]here the right to remain silent is invoked, an inquiry must be made as to the scrupulous honoring of that invocation____ It is only if these rights have not been exercised, that the State then has just the \u201cheavy but lesser burden\u201d of demonstrating a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver. <em>See State v. Hartley, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 260-61, 511 A.2d 80; <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>278, 286, 478 A.2d 723 (1984). <em>And see Oregon v. Bradshaw, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>1039, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2830, 77 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>405 (1983).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">We first consider defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent. Once that has been asserted, it must be \u201cscrupulously honored.\u201d <em>Michigan v. Mosley, </em>423 <em>U.S. </em>96, 102-03, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>321, 325-26, 46 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>313, 320-21 (1975); <em>Miranda v. Arizona, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 467, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1624, 16 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 719; <em>State v. Johnson, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>263, 282, 576 A.2d 834 (1990); <em>State v. Fuller, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>75, 81, 570 A.2d 429 (1990); <em>State v. Bey (I), </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>45, 66, 548 A.2d 846 (1988); <em>State v. Hartley, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 260-61, 511 A.2d 80; <em>State v. Kennedy, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 288, 478 A.2d 723. Further, in <em>Hartley, </em>the Supreme Court cautioned that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"An7\">[cjare must be taken ... that there be no blurring of the separate lines of analysis that are followed in respect of the \u201cscrupulously honor\u201d requirement on the one hand and the waiver issue on the other. The distinction between the two concepts stands out in bold relief in this case: <em>given our holding that the failure scrupulously to honor a previously-invoked right to silence renders unconstitutionally compelled any resultant incriminating statement made in response to custodial interrogation, there can he no question of waiver.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">[103 <em>N.J. </em>at 261, 511 A.2d 80 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">[State <em>v. Mallon, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>139, 145-46, 671 A.2d 1115 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>497, 683 A.2d 200 (1996).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">The answer to the first question, whether the detectives scrupulously honored defendant\u2019s right to remain silent, is objective, resting as it does upon a review of the videotape and the transcript; the subjective intent of the participants is immaterial. Thus, the credibility findings of the trial court do not circumscribe our determination of this issue, and it is unnecessary for us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>decide whether we concur in the trial court\u2019s assertion that the references to defendant\u2019s bail and his pending violation of probation merely represented the officers\u2019 attempt to assist defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Here, it is apparent to us from our review of the videotape and its accompanying transcript that the detectives did not scrupulously honor the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent. Defendant\u2019s words and conduct were at the very least ambiguous. Because the right to remain silent is so fundamental, an equivocal assertion of the right to remain silent should \u201cbe interpreted in a light most favorable to the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Chew, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>30, 63, 695 A.2d 1301 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 <em>U.S. </em>1052, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>593, 145 L.Ed.2d 493 (1999).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In that posture, the officers could do no more than to attempt to clarify his position, and could not proceed to their extended attempts to persuade defendant to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights and agree to speak to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">We are satisfied the order denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress must be reversed and the matter remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Because we have concluded that the trial court\u2019s order should be reversed because the detectives did not scrupulously honor defendant\u2019s right to remain silent, we deem it unnecessary to address defendant\u2019s second argument, in which he contends that the form utilized is unconstitutional per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-25\"> Sharleese and Tracey are defendant\u2019s sisters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b637-10\"> In <em>Chew, </em>the Court was considering an equivocal request for counsel. There is no distinction, however, in analyzing the consequences of failing to honor scrupulously an assertion of the right to remain silent and a failure to honor a request for counsel. <em>Hartley, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 277, 511 A.2d 80. We, therefore, consider it appropriate to view an equivocal assertion of the right to remain silent through the same lens we would employ in considering an equivocal assertion of the right to counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
