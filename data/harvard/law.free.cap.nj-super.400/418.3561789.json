We reverse that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>decision because the instruction issued by the agency governing her and similarly situated families is effectively a rule and it was not promulgated in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-1 to -15.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Appellant B.H. received benefits from the TANF segment of the WFNJ/TANF welfare program<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> under the Work First New Jersey Act (WFNJ Act). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-55 to -70; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:90-1.1 to -20.13.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The WFNJ/TANF program is administered at the local level by county welfare agencies pursuant to regulations and directives of the Department of Human Services (DHS), Division of Family Development (DFD). <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:90-1.1(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">B.H. is a single mother with two adopted children. B.H received WFNJ/TANF benefits in the amount of $322 per month. B.H. filed a Redetermination/Recertifieation For Assistance application with DFD on November 21, 2005. In this application, B.H. certified that she received Social Security in the amount of $512 per month and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) in the amount of $118.25 per month. In addition, B.H. reported that she received $683.29 for her adopted daughter and $527.31 for her adopted son, a total of $1,210.60 per month from SAP administered by the New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS). B.H. also reported that her adopted daughter had part-time employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Initially, the local county welfare agency found B.H. eligible for continuing WFNJ/TANF benefits. In June 2006, DFD issued Instruction No. 06-6-4. It declared that a WFNJ/TANF grant could not be provided for a child receiving a DYFS grant during the same period. The instruction noted that \u201can eligible child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>cannot be included in the WFNJ/TANF cash payment for any month in which he or she receives a DYFS grant.\u201d The DFD explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\"><em>N.J.AC. </em>10:90-3.19(a) provides that grants provided through DYFS such as DYFS Kinship Program payments, monies received through the DYFS [SAP], and monies received on behalf of a foster child are exempt as income in the calculation of the TANF grant. However, there must not be any duplication between such aid and the public assistance grant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Pursuant to this instruction, the local county welfare agency notified B.H. that her WFNJ/TANF assistance would be terminated effective July 1, 2006. According to the notice, B.H.\u2019s WFNJ/ TANF benefits were terminated because her unearned income exceeded the maximum benefit payment level. B.H.\u2019s total unearned income was listed as $0. The local agency further noted that the adverse action was taken in accordance with <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:90-3.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Thereafter, B.H. requested a hearing, and the matter was transmitted to the Office of Administrative Law. The initial decision issued by the administrative law judge (AL J) found that DFD Instruction No. 06-6-4 and the county welfare agency\u2019s decision to terminate previously approved benefits \u201cconstitutes a material and significant change from [DFD\u2019s] prior position,\u201d because <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:90-3.19(a)15vii specifically exempts SAP benefits. Accordingly, the ALJ held that DFD was required to adopt a rule reflecting this change.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">In its final agency decision dated December 18, 2006, DFD rejected the ALJ\u2019s conclusion. DFD characterized Instruction No. 06-6-4 as \u201cclarification and guidance in implementing an existing policy.\u201d DFD explained further that \u201c[tjhere must be no duplication between such aid and the WFNJ grant.\u201d Thus, the Director found that B.H.\u2019s \u201cchildren\u2019s DYFS subsidies exceed the amount of the assistance unit\u2019s WFNJ/TANF limit\u201d and that Burlington County properly terminated B.H.\u2019s WFNJ/TANF eligibility pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:90-2.7(a) and -3.19(a)15.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Since 1959, New Jersey has engaged in a cooperative effort with the federal government to provide aid to families in need of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>assistance. <em>Sojourner A. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>318, 326, 828 A.2d 306 (2003). In 1996, Congress enacted the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA). <em>Pub.L.

These welfare reforms are subject to a mandatory national welfare-to-work feature, which is designed to motivate welfare recipients to become self-sufficient. <em>Id. </em>at 326-27, 828 A.2d 306. Two of the purposes of TANF are State implementation of programs designed to \u201cprovide assistance to needy families so that children may be eared for in their own homes\u201d and cessation of \u201cthe dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting job preparation, work, and marriage.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 601(a)(l)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">In response to the PRWORA, New Jersey enacted the WFNJ Act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-55 to -70; <em>Sojourner, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 327, 828 A.2d 306. In its legislative findings and declarations, the WFNJ Act stated that \u201c[wjorking individuals and families needing temporary assistance should have the transitional support necessary to obtain and keep a job in order to be able to avoid cycling back onto public assistance.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-56c.

The WFNJ Act provides for cash assistance payments and the DHS Commissioner is required to establish regulations determining eligibility for benefits. <em>M.F., supra, </em>395 <em>N.

It provides that DYFS will make payments to adoptive parents on behalf of a child placed for adoption by DYFS whenever the child is hard to place due to physical or mental condition, race, age, or membership in a sibling group. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:40-46; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:121-1.2 to -1.3. The program encourages adoption when appropriate adoptive families are willing to adopt such hard-to-place children and the only impediment to the adoptions is the inadequate financial circumstances of the prospective adoptive families. <em>County of Middlesex, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 3, 455 A.2d 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:40-47 outlines the scope of the payments; it provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">Payments in subsidization of adoption shall include but are not limited to the maintenance costs, medical and surgical expenses, and other costs incidental to the care, training and education of the child.

Maximum income levels have been set for each assistance unit by size. <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:90-3.3. Income is either countable or exempt. <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:90-3.9(a). \u201cExempt income is not considered in determining eligibility for assistance or in computing the amount of WFNJ cash assistance payments.\u201d <em>N.JAC. </em>10:90-3.19(a). Exempt income includes SSI benefits for WFNJ/TANF and Kinship Subsidy Program payments. <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:90-3.19(a)10,12. It also includes \u201c[m]onies received through the Subsidized Adoption Program of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>the Division of Youth and Family Services pursuant to <em>N.J.SA </em>30:40-45 through 49.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:90-3.19(a)15vii. These monies are also identified as exempt resources designated for special purposes by <em>N.J AC. </em>10:90-3.20(a)14vii. In addition to the specific provision referring to SAP benefits, <em>N.J AC. </em>10:9Q-3.19(a)15vi lists the following as exempt income:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">Supplemental aid by other agencies or organizations, whether public or private, provided that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">(1) There is no duplication between such aid and the public assistance grant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">(2) Such aid is for a special purpose not within the function of the public assistance agency (for example, vocational rehabilitation); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">(3) Such aid is to any undergraduate student for educational purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-9\"><em>SeeNJAC. </em>10:90-3.20(a)14vi.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">In her decision, the program director found that the SAP grant from DYFS and the WFNJ/TANF grant were duplicative. In support of this decision, the director cited <em>N.J AC. </em>10:90-2.7(a) and -3.19(a)15. As noted, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:90-2.7(a) identifies who may and may not be part of an assistance unit. This rule does not address receipt of SAP or other DYFS benefits. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:90-3.19(a)15vi addresses supplemental aid from other public or private agencies. This type of income is exempt unless it is duplicative of the public assistance grant. <em>N.JAC. </em>10:9 \u2014 B.19(a)15vi(l). The director also referenced DFD Instruction No. 06-6-4, noting that the intent of the instruction was only to provide clarification and guidance in the implementation of existing policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">B.H. argues that the DFD instruction is inoperative because it effects a clear and substantial change to existing DFD regulations without utilizing the administrative rule adoption procedure of the APA. Therefore, B.H. contends that even if the DFD was correct in determining that SAP and WFNJ/TANF benefits are duplicative, the final decision must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">An administrative rule means \u201ceach agency statement of general applicability and continuing effect that implements or interprets law or policy, or describes the organization, procedure or practice requirements of any agency.\u201d <em>N.J.SA. </em>52:14B-2(e). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>The term does not include \u201c(2) intraageney and interagency statements; and (3) agency decisions and findings in contested cases.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, \u201c[t]he APA itself recognizes that an agency action or determination \u2018that implements or interprets law or policy\u2019 can constitute an \u2018administrative rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>313, 330, 478 A.2d 742 (1984) (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-2(e)). An agency determination may be considered a \u201crule\u201d for APA purposes if it \u201ceffects a material change in existing law\u201d or alters the status quo. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, an administrative rule may encompass the issuance of an agency \u201cinstruction\u201d or an adjudication of a particular person\u2019s ease if it contains the characteristics of a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">The Court in <em>Metromedia </em>held that an agency action should be considered an administrative rule when all or most of the relevant features of an administrative rule are present. <em>Id. </em>at 331, 478 A.2d 742. Therefore, an administrative rule is usually present when the determination or instruction</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">(1) is intended to have wide coverage encompassing a large segment of the regulated or general public, rather than an individual or a narrow select group; (2) is intended to be applied generally and uniformly to all similarly situated persons; (3) is designed to operate only in future cases, that is, prospectively; (4) prescribes a legal standard or directive that is not otherwise expressly provided by or clearly and obviously inferable from the enabling statutory authorization; (5) reflects an administrative policy that (i) was not previously expressed in any official and explicit agency determination, adjudication or rule, or (ii) constitutes a material and significant change from a clear, past agency position on the identical subject matter; and (6) reflects a decision on administrative regulatory policy in the nature of the interpretation of law or general policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 331-32, 478 A.2d 742.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Often an agency determination may be a hybrid \u201cpartaking of both the rule-making and the adjudicatory mode.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332, 478 A.2d 742. Furthermore, \u201c[i]f the several relevant features that typify administrative rules and rule-making weigh in favor of action that is quasi-legislative in character, rather than quasi-judicial or adjudicatory, that balance should determine the procedural steps required to validate the ultimate agency action.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>The DFD argues that its instruction only serves as an informal intra-agency document designed to clarify existing policy. \u201cIntra-agency statement\u201d is not defined in the APA. In <em>Woodland Private Study Group v. New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>62, 75, 533 A.2d 387 (1987), the Court defined an intra-agency statement as \u201c(1) a communication between agency members that (2) does not have a substantial impact on (3) the rights or legitimate interests of the regulated public.\u201d The appropriate inquiry of whether an action is exempt as an intra-agency statement is \u201cwhether the agency action has a \u2018substantial impact\u2019 on the rights or interests of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74, 533 A.2d 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The standard adopted in <em>Woodland </em>is the same that has been adopted by the federal courts. <em>Ibid. </em>Federal courts have noted that the intra-agency exemption covers actions \u201c \u2018that do not themselves alter the rights or interests of parties, although it may alter the manner in which the parties present themselves or their viewpoints to the agency.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 533 <em>A.2d 387 </em>(quoting <em>Batterton v. Marshall, </em>648 <em>F.</em>2d 694, 707-08 (D.C.Cir.1980)). In short, the intra-agency statement exemption does not apply when the agency action trenches on substantial private rights and interests, such as modification of approval procedures for a specific benefit. <em>Id, </em>at 71, 533 A.2d 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Here, the DFD instruction more closely resembles an administrative rule rather than an intra-agency statement. The DFD instruction has wide coverage, as it applies to all recipients of both SAP and WFNJ/TANF benefits. The policy was not explicitly expressed previously. Indeed, it is contrary to the DFD\u2019s previous approval of B.H. for WFNJ/TANF benefits, despite her receipt of SAP benefits. <em>See Univ. Cottage Club of Princeton N.J. Corp. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>38, 54-55, 921 A.2d 1122 (2007) (finding administrative rule making where a statement of an administrative position was enforced, which had not previously been expressed and which constituted a material change from a clear, past agency position on the subject).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Instruction No. 06-6-4 is very similar to the situation in <em>Metromedia, supra, </em>in which the Division of Taxation Director commenced use of a method of tax calculation that had not been previously utilized. 97 <em>N.J. </em>at 319-20, 337, 478 A.2d 742. Although the method was not prohibited by the agency\u2019s regulations, its application represented a material change from the Division\u2019s past procedures and, thus, constituted rule making. <em>Id. </em>at 332-37, 478 A.2d 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Additionally, in <em>Maticka v. City of Atlantic City, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>434, 456, 524 A.2d 416 (App.Div.1987), we held that an agency instruction similar to the DFD instruction before this court required rule-making procedures. In <em>Maticka, </em>an agency instruction was issued that defined a term contained within the agency\u2019s regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 438, 524 A.2d 416. The agency claimed that the instruction purportedly codified a long-standing policy. <em>Ibid. </em>This court held that further interpretation of the regulation with the intention to bind the administration of emergency assistance throughout the State can only be effectuated through formal rule making. <em>Id. </em>at 452-53, 524 A.2d 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The change advanced by DFD Instruction No. 06-6-4 is not merely an internal instruction that imposes a procedure an agency must follow in implementing its regulations or that reiterates a policy already in place. <em>See, e.g., Bullet Hole, Inc. v. Dunbar, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>562, 583-84, 763 A.2d 295 (App.Div.2000) (finding that charging a fee for the processing of criminal history as required by regulation is not rule making, in part, because it does not embody a detailed set of eligibility requirements). The change substantially impacts the right of B.H. and others to receive public assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Although we have not been asked by B.H. to hold that SAP benefits are not duplicative, the instruction changes, rather than interprets, existing regulations. That is, the instruction effectively amends the existing regulation. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:90-3.19(a)15 lists the various sources of income that are exempt or non-countable. SAP benefits are expressly enumerated as exempt income. <em>N.J.AC. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>10:90-19(a)15vii. Notably, only \u201c[s]upplemental aid by other agencies or organizations, whether public or private\u201d may lose its exemption because it duplicates the aid received from the public assistance grant. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:90-3.19(a)15vi(l). The effect of the instruction is to conflate SAP grants and other specifically identified grants with the supplemental aid referenced in <em>N.J.A.G. </em>10:90-3.19(a)15vi. This is an alteration of the plain language of the regulation that is meant to have uniform applicability throughout the State. Such an alteration may not be effected by an instruction. Such an alteration is subject to the formal rule-making provision of the APA and cannot form the basis to deny B.H. the benefits for which she applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-15\"> SAP is regulated by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:121-1.1 to -1.7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b453-9\"> WFNJ/TANF encompasses families with children, while WFNJ General Assistance encompasses single adults and couples without children. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:90-1.1(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b453-10\"><em> N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-34 to -43, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-44 to -54, and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-71 to - 78 were enacted as additional welfare reforms and to establish the WFNJ program.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
