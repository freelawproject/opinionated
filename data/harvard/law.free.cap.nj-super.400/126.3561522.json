We conclude the motion judge erred in interpreting the notice requirements of the Fair Foreclosure Act (FFA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:50-53 to -68, and incorrectly imposed an obligation on plaintiff to provide actual notice of the recorded assignment of mortgage to the mortgagors prior to initiating foreclosure. We also determine that sufficient factual disputes are present, making entry of summary judgment improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b160-14\">Defendants Ishaque and Claudia Chaudhri (the Chaudhris) purchased a home in Chester Township (the property). On March 6, 1998, the Chaudhris executed a mortgage note and a purchase money mortgage to secure payment of $168,000, borrowed from Security Atlantic Mortgage Co., Inc. (Security). The mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>was recorded in the county recording office on April 20,1998. On May 20, 1998, Security assigned its interest to Unicor Mortgage, Inc. (Unicor). The assignment agreement was recorded. The Chaudhris defaulted on the mortgage obligation, and on October 28, 1999, Unicor commenced foreclosure under docket number F-17629-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Unicor then sought protection under the Bankruptcy Code. Plaintiff EMC Mortgage Corporation (EMC) purchased the Chaudhris\u2019 mortgage at a bankruptcy sale. EMC received an assignment of the mortgage and proceeded on Unicor\u2019s behalf to prosecute the foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">On September 11, 2002, after presentation of proofs at trial, the Chancery Division judge (the trial judge) dismissed Unicor\u2019s complaint, without prejudice, citing three reasons. First, Unicor failed to properly comply with the notice provisions of the FFA. Second, Unicor did not present evidence of the recorded assignment agreement to EMC. Third, Unicor failed to prove that notice of the assignment to EMC was given to the Chaudhris. Thereafter, on October 8, 2002, EMC recorded the assignment of the Security mortgage it had received from Unicor.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">After dismissal of Unicor\u2019s complaint, the Chaudhris filed a motion to discharge Unicor\u2019s lis pendens and mortgage. Counsel\u2019s certification of service stated that the motion was filed with the Clerk\u2019s office and mailed to \u201cChristopher Fox, Esq., located at East Cooper Avenue, Moorestown, New Jersey.\u201d We note that the pleadings reveal Mr. Fox <em>was </em>designated trial co-counsel in the Unicor foreclosure and was associated with the law firm of Mark J. Udren &amp; Associates of Cherry Hill.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>On October 25, 2002, after review of the unopposed motion, the trial judge ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">(1) That the Lis Pendens!,] which was filed on the property located at 43 Pleasant Hill Road, in the Township of Chester, also known as Block 40, Lot 9, which was received and filed on November 17,1999, and the Mortgage!,] which was duly recorded in Book 7563, Page 209 &amp; c, of the Morris County Register\u2019s Book of Mortgages by Security Atlantic Company are hereby discharged; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">(2) That title to the property be quieted in defendants and their successors and against any and all persons claiming under plaintiffs; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">(3) A copy of this Order be served upon counsel of record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">On October 28, 2002, the Chaudhris recorded the October 25, 2002 order with the county Register of Deeds. The record does not state whether EMC was sent a copy of the filed order.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">On December 4, 2002, EMC filed a foreclosure complaint, in its own name, under docket number F-21886-02. EMC also filed and recorded a lis pendens on December 31, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">On January 15, 2003, the Chaudhris sold the property to their daughter, defendant Shazia Chaudhri-DeWit, for stated consideration of $170,000. The deed was recorded on February 13, 2003. On that same date, DeWit borrowed $136,000, executed a note, and granted a purchase money mortgage on the property to defendant Gateway Funding Diversified Mortgage Services, L.P. (Gateway).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">EMC discovered the October 25, 2002 order, which discharged its mortgage and filed an emergent application to vacate the order and for other relief. On February 24, 2003, the trial judge vacated the October 25, 2002 order stating: \u201cThrough inadvertence by the court the order entered on October 25, 2002 did not reflect accurately the decision of the court and must be vacated.\u201d The Chaudhris\u2019 2002 motion, along with newly filed motions, were listed for oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">On March 12, 2003, the trial judge entered disposition on all pending applications. The court considered the Chaudhris\u2019 motion to discharge the Unicor mortgage and to quiet title, which originally had been filed in 2002. The motion was denied and the court ordered the prior order of October 25, 2002, \u201cSTRICKEN OF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>RECORD.\u201d The trial judge further ordered deleted the \u201chandwritten notation\u201d placed on the recorded mortgage discharging it by court order. The trial judge stated: \u201cIn dismissing the complaint ... the court was not adjudicating that the mortgage lien was invalid, nor that the Note and Mortgage were unenforceable against [defendants.\u201d Finally, the court restored and reinstated the Security mortgage as \u201ca valid first lien\u201d on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">A second order, also entered on March 12, 2003, addressed the Chaudhris\u2019 motion to dismiss EMC\u2019s foreclosure action, asserting application of res judicata and collateral estoppel. We note the Chaudhris\u2019 did not reveal they had sold the property to DeWit. The court also denied this motion stating: \u201cDismissal of the Unicor ... foreclosure action against these defendants because of procedural defects and deficiencies does not at law or in equity preclude a subsequent action on the note and mortgage by a different party for a later default.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Based on the record, we conclude EMC was unaware of the sale to DeWit and Gateway\u2019s mortgage, recorded in February 2003. Gateway did not receive notice of or participate in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">On September 19, 2003, EMC amended its foreclosure complaint to add Gateway and DeWit. Gateway filed a contesting answer asserting its lien was primary to any debt due EMC. Also, Gateway filed cross-claims against the Chaudhris and DeWit to recoup damages if its mortgage was not deemed the first lien on the property. Gateway also filed a counterclaim against EMC to declare EMC\u2019s lien was inferior to Gateway\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">Final disposition of the foreclosure matter was delayed because Ishaque Chaudhri filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 701. When EMC secured an order to vacate the automatic stay, 11 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 362(d), from the Bankruptcy Court, it resumed the foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Motions for summary judgment were filed by the Chaudhris, DeWit and Gateway. A different judge (the motion judge) was assigned to the matter following the trial judge\u2019s retirement. On April 27, 2007, the motion judge entered three separate orders granting each defendant\u2019s request for summary judgment. The motion judge ordered that Gateway, and its successors or assigns, were not bound by the February 24, 2003 and March 12, 2003 orders, and concluded that Gateway\u2019s mortgage had priority over EMC\u2019s. The motion judge issued the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">[I] find that the lender ... EMC, has not cured the procedural deficiencies as it relates to proceeding on this foreclosure action by most specifically not providing proof of notice of the assignment to these defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">[T]hat was the specific problem[ ] with the initial foreclosure action____ Failure to provide notice of proof, notice of the intention to foreclose, and failure to provide proof of notice of the assignment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">[I] will find[ ] the notice of the intent to foreclose in October of 2002 was mailed by ... regular mail not returned, [and] certified mail unclaimed. Under the unique circumstances of this case where the lender, EMC, knew very well that the specific issue of notice of the intent to foreclose and notice of the assignment were so important in the dismissed action, I find that more than just certified mail as usually allowed would have to be shown here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">The lender, EMC, knew that there was an attorney; I don\u2019t have any proof that even the attorney was advised. Personal service, although not required in the ordinary notice of intent to foreclose, would certainly be expected in this instance and/or process service, and particularly the notice of assignment. Not providing notice of that assignment as recorded to counsel and/or to the Chaudhris, I find to be a distinct, procedural deficiency that permits this Court to grant summary judgment to the Chaudhris, at this point with prejudice, the second opportunity to correct those procedural deficiencies under the unique circumstances of this case [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">X also note that this lender, EMC, did not itself check the status of this properly between December of '02 and January 30th of '03____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">So in that sense the lender itself is not acting in a way that protects its very own interest from September of '02 until I believe the check that an affidavit that sent the document here, it indicated an inquiry as to status in January of '03. So the lender itself is not protecting its own interest and its own property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-12\">The lender had not moved under the note, ... even after the dismissal of the initial action ... to which they had the right to do, and they still had the right even though the declaration of bankruptcy to collect this money pursuant to a note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>[I] also find that Gateway certainly had reason to rely upon the Court ordered discharge at the time that it provided the mortgage to [DeWit], that it is entitled to act as a first iien[,] and is entitled to otherwise rely upon that discharge that it saw at the time. Although there is a gap certainly between December of '02 and January of '03, I\u2019m satisfied that it had a reason to rely upon that Court ordered discharge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">And I note as well a lack of notice. EMC went before [the court] in 2003 seeking to vacate that discharge, not giving notice or having notice or checking the notice as it related to Gateway____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">This is a very unique circumstance, and again, I\u2019m imposing upon this lender obligations that relate to the very unique circumstances of this case, particularly in view of the trial that was conducted in September of 2003.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">In the same way, I\u2019m satisfied that [DeWit] had the right to proceed and be dismissed from this case. Again, I don\u2019t know ... the reason why she\u2019s brought in____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">On appeal, EMC maintains the motion judge erred in granting summary judgment because genuine issues of material fact required disposition at trial. Further, EMC argues the motion judge erred by imposing procedural provisions not required by the FFA to foreclose its mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">Summary judgment must be granted if \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:46-2(c). \u201cA party may defeat a motion for summary judgment by demonstrating that the evidential materials relied upon by the moving party, considered in light of the applicable burden of proof, raise sufficient credibility issues \u2018to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the alleged disputed issued in favor of the non-moving party.\u2019 \u201d <em>D\u2019Amato v. D'Amato, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>109, 114, 701 A.2d 970 (App.Div.1997) (quoting <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 523, 666 A.2d 146 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>The trial court\u2019s \u201cfunction is not ... to weigh the evidence and determine the truth ... but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d 146 (quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>242, 249, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d. 202, 212 (1986)). The trial judge must consider \u201cwhether the competent evidential materials presented, when viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, are sufficient to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the alleged disputed issue in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>When the facts present \u201ca single, unavoidable resolution\u201d and the evidence \u201cis so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law,\u201d then a trial court should grant summary judgment. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">We apply the same standard of review that governs trial courts when reviewing summary judgment orders. <em>Liberty Surplus Ins. Corp. v. Nowell Amoroso, </em>P.A, 189 <em>N.J. </em>436, 445-46, 916 A.2d 440 (2007). If there is no genuine issue of fact, we then must decide whether the lower court\u2019s ruling on the law was correct. <em>Id. </em>at 446, 916 A.2d 440. In reviewing a trial court\u2019s determination on a question of law, we are to consider the matter de novo, with no deference to the trial court\u2019s views. <em>See Manalapan Realty v. Manalapan Twp. Comm., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In this matter, we note that the arguments raised on appeal, as well as the analysis applicable to reach disposition of those issues, vary among the three defendants. Therefore, organizational needs dictate that we separately address the challenges pertinent to each defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">The motion judge granted summary judgment to the Chaudhris, after determining EMC provided unsatisfactory notice under the FFA prior to commencing foreclosure, and failed to deliver a copy of the recorded assignment received from Unicor.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">\u201c[T]he [FFA] was designed to make clear the rights and remedies of both borrowers and lenders prior to and throughout the foreclosure process. The [FFA\u2019s] ultimate goal is to allow mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>gage lenders their remedies while giving borrowers \u2018every opportunity\u2019 to pay their mortgages and keep their homes.\u201d <em>Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc. v. Stull, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>449, 456, 876 A.2d 298 (App.Div.2005) (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:50-54) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Under the FFA, a residential mortgage lender must serve a notice of intention to file foreclosure proceedings, \u201cby registered or certified mail, return receipt requested\u201d prior to commencing suit. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:50-56(a) and (b). By enacting this provision, the Legislature mandated that lenders must first serve the notice to allow homeowners \u201cevery opportunity to pay their home mortgages, and thus keep their homes; and that lenders will be benefited when residential mortgage debtors cure their defaults and return defaulted residential mortgage loans to performing status.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A-.50-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Because the issuance of the FFA notice was pivotal to the motion judge\u2019s determination, it is prudent to recite the statutory requirements of the notice provision. The lender\u2019s notice of intent to foreclose must comply with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">The written notice shall clearly and conspicuously state in a manner calculated to make the debtor aware of the situation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">(1) the particular obligation or real estate security interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">(2) the nature of the default claimed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">(3) the right of the debtor to cure the default as provided in section 5 of this act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">(4) what performance, including what sum of money, if any, and interest, shall be tendered to cure the default as of the date specified under paragraph (5) of this subsection c.;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-12\">(5) the date by which the debtor shall cure the default to avoid initiation of foreclosure proceedings, which date shall not be less than 30 days after the date the notice is effective, and the name and address and phone number of a person to whom the payment or tender shall be made;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-13\">(6) that if the debtor does not cure the default by the date specified under paragraph (5) of this subsection c., the lender may take steps to terminate the debtor\u2019s ownership in the property by commencing a foreclosure suit in a court of competent jurisdiction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-14\">(7) that if the lender takes the steps indicated pursuant to paragraph (6) of this subsection c., a debtor shall still have the right to cure the default pursuant to section 5 of this act, but that the debtor shall be responsible for the lender\u2019s court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>costs and attorneys\u2019 fees in an amount not to exceed that amount permitted pursuant to the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">(8) the right, if any, of the debtor to transfer the real estate to another person subject to the security interest and that the transferee may have the right to cure the default as provided in this act, subject to the mortgage documents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">(9) that the debtor is advised to seek counsel from an attorney of the debtor\u2019s own choosing concerning the debtor\u2019s residential mortgage default situation, and that, if the debtor is unable to obtain an attorney, the debtor may communicate with the New Jersey Bar Association or Lawyer Referral Service in the county in which the residential property securing the mortgage loan is located; and that, if the debtor is unable to afford an attorney, the debtor may communicate with the Legal Services Office in the county in which the property is located;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">(10) the possible availability of financial assistance for curing a default from programs operated by the State or federal government or nonprofit organizations, if any, as identified by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance. This requirement shall be satisfied by attaching a list of such programs promulgated by the commissioner; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">(11) the name and address of the lender and the telephone number of a representative of the lender whom the debtor may contact if the debtor disagrees with the lender\u2019s assertion that a default has occurred or the correctness of the mortgage lender\u2019s calculation of the amount required to cure the default.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">[N.J.S.A 2A:50-56(c).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">The FFA does not state the resultant consequences if a lender fails to comply and few published opinions interpret the provisions of the FFA. In <em>Cho Hung Bank v. Kim, </em>361 <em>N.J.Super. </em>331, 343, 825 A.2d 566 (App.Div.2003), we commented that a lender\u2019s \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the contents of a notice of intent, sent by a lender prior to initiation of foreclosure, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:50-56(c), was not authorized by the statute\u2019s terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">Also, in <em>GE Capital Mortgage Servs., Inc. v. Weisman, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>590, 592, 773 A.2d 122 (Ch.Div.2000), a Chancery Division judge examined the borrower\u2019s challenge to the lender\u2019s policy of mailing the statutory notice solely by first class mail. <em>Ibid. </em>The judge noted the dearth of New Jersey authority and reviewed judicial interpretations of a similar statute adopted by Pennsylvania, 41 <em>Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. </em>\u00a7 101 to \u00a7 605 (2007). <em>Id. </em>at 592-94, 773 A.2d 122. The judge concluded the lender\u2019s inability to locate its records demonstrating service did not require the dismissal of the foreclosure complaint, <em>id. </em>at 592, 773 A.2d 122, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>and permitted the lender to cure the technical deficiency without prejudice to the borrowers\u2019 rights. <em>Id. </em>at 594, 773 A.2d 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">We note that in <em>GE Capital, supra, </em>the lender claimed compliance with the FFA notice requirements, but it was unable to produce proof. 339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 595, 773 A.2d 122. If a lender solely employs first class mail, no presumption of receipt arises when the notice is sent. <em>Hammond v. Paterson, </em>145 <em>N.J.Super. </em>452, 455, 368 A.2d 373 (App.Div.1976). \u201cThe very reason for providing for certified mail or actual receipt is to avoid such a presumption.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">We disapprove of the remedy employed in that case, and reinforce the statutory mandate that lenders send proper notice, by registered or certified mail, at least thirty days prior to the initiation of a foreclosure action. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:50-56(a). The Legislature specifically intended that lenders faithfully comply with the FFA provisions and articulated that \u201c[w]aivers by the debtor of rights provided pursuant to [the FFA] are against public policy, unlawful, and void, unless given after default pursuant to a workout agreement in a separate written document signed by the debtor.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:50-61. Accordingly, courts are not free to deviate from the unambiguous statute. <em>Cho Hung Bank, supra, </em>361 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 343, 825 A.2d 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">This discussion serves as a prelude to the examination of the facts and issues at hand. We concur with the trial judge\u2019s dismissal, without prejudice, of Unicor\u2019s foreclosure complaint due to the failure to send the notice of intent to foreclose prior to commencing suit. As we noted, the notice provisions are mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">In EMC\u2019s action, the motion judge found the FFA notice was sent by first class and certified mail, return receipt requested, prior to filing the foreclosure complaint. Contrary to the Chaudhris\u2019 contentions, EMC pled these facts at paragraph 11 of its foreclosure complaint. Nevertheless, the motion judge concluded the methods employed by EMC for service of the FFA notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>were insufficient because \u201c[u]nder the unique circumstances of this case ... more than just certified mail as usually allowed would have to be shown____ Personal service, although not required in the ordinary notice of intent to foreclose, would certainly be expected in this instance.\u201d We disagree with this conclusion as no legal or equitable authority supports such a proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">First, no provision of the FFA delineates circumstances warranting the imposition of an enhanced notice requirement. EMC not only complied as directed by the statute, it additionally followed the provisions of <em>Rule </em>4:4-7 by also sending the notice by first class mail. EMC presented proof of the unclaimed certified mail notice sent to the Chaudhris and that the first class mail was not returned. The simultaneous use of certified mail and first class mail satisfies the statutory requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:50-56. Nothing more is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The Chaudhris\u2019 contention that \u201cnotice\u201d was not effectuated because they did not retrieve the certified mail is specious. The Chaudhris\u2019 failure to claim the certified mail, despite notices issued by the Postal Service to do so, will not defeat statutory compliance. We will not sanction a mortgagor\u2019s deliberate attempt to frustrate the mortgagee\u2019s efforts by ignoring the properly sent notice of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Second, contrary to the motion judge\u2019s suggestion, the dismissal of Unicor\u2019s foreclosure, due to procedural deficiencies, in no way amplifies the specific statutory notice requirements. Moreover, a dismissal of a foreclosure action, without prejudice, has no effect on the underlying contractual obligations of the parties and \u201cdoes not bar reinstitution of the same claims in a later action.\u201d <em>Woodward-Clyde Consultants v. Chemical &amp; Pollution Scis., Inc., </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>464, 472, 528 A.2d 131 (1987); <em>R. </em>4:37-2(a). We conclude the motion judge erred in granting summary judgment to the Chaudhris because of a perceived noncompliance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:50-56. The evidence of record proves otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">As further justification to dismiss the foreclosure complaint, the motion judge identified EMC\u2019s failure to provide proof of service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>of its recorded assignment from Unicor. The motion judge expressly stated that because EMC was aware of this \u201cprocedural deficiency,\u201d identified in the September 11, 2002 order of dismissal, the continued failure to serve the assignment was \u201ca distinct, procedural deficiency that permits this Court to grant summary judgment to the Chaudhris, at this point with prejudice.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">A mortgage assignment must be in writing and \u201cany such assignment shall pass and convey the estate of the assignor in the mortgaged premises, and the assignee may sue thereon in his own name.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>46:9-9; <em>Byram Holding Co. v. Bogren, 2 N.J.Super. </em>381, 336, 63 A.2d 822 (Ch.Div.1949). Instruments affecting title to real estate, which include assignments of mortgages, may be recorded in the county recording office. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:16-l(d). Mortgage assignments are also specifically recordable pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:18-3. It is important to note that \u201c[t]he fact that assignments <em>of </em>mortgages may be recorded does not affect the validity of an assignment of a mortgage which has not been recorded.\u201d <em>In re Kennedy Mortgage Co., </em>17 <em>B.R. </em>967, 964 (Bankr.D.N.J.1982); <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank v. Larson, </em>17 <em>B.R. </em>957, 965 (Bankr.D.N.J.1982); <em>Clift v. Scheutz, </em>83 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>442, 444, 91 A. 815 (Ch.1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">In this case it is unrefuted that the assignment from Unicor to EMC was duly recorded on October 8, 2002. Also, there is no challenge made to the terms of the mortgage at paragraph 19, which provides that \u201cthe Note ... (together with this Security Instrument) may be sold one or more times without prior notice to the Borrower.\u201d The Chaudhris advance no claim of harm suffered from the alleged failure to actually receive a copy of EMC\u2019s mortgage assignment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Their grievance merely is that they were not served with a copy of the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>The suggestion that New Jersey law places \u201ca requirement of notice of the assignment to the obligor[,]\u201d is incorrect as a matter of law. When an assignment is duly recorded, it shall \u201cbe notice to <em>all persons concerned </em>that [the] mortgage is so assigned.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:18-4 (emphasis added). Mortgagors are \u201cpersons concerned\u201d under the statute. Thus, current New Jersey law provides that the recordation of the mortgage assignment alone serves as notice to third parties of its existence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Rose v.

Specifically, the FFA contains no such requirement. Further, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:22-1, which is advanced as authority to void EMC\u2019s mortgage claim, does not apply to mortgage assignments. <em>United States v. Goldberg, </em>362 <em>F.</em>2d 575, 577 (3d Cir.1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>386 <em>U.S. </em>919, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>881, 17 L.Ed.2d 790 (1967). This section of the Recording Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:15-1.1 to 46:26-1, provides, in part, that failure to record \u201ca deed or instrument of the nature or description set forth in section <em>[N.J.S.A.] </em>46:16-1\u201d shall, be \u201cvoid and of no effect against subsequent judgment creditors without notice, and against all subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>quent bona fide purchasers and mortgagees for valuable consideration, not having notice[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:22-l.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Assignments of mortgages do not fall within the purview of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">A notice requirement does exist when the servicing of a mortgage is sold, assigned or transferred. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\u201cRESPA\u201d), 12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2601 to -17, imposes an obligation upon a <em>servicer </em>of any federally related mortgage loan to deliver to the borrower a written notice of any assignment, sale, or transfer of the <em>servicing </em>of the loan to any other person or entity, which will be <em>servicing </em>a loan. 12 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 2605(b); <em>see </em>RESPA, 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 3500.21(d) (2008). The loan servicer and the assignee of the mortgage are not necessarily one and the same. Different entities may service a loan owned by another. Oftentimes, mortgages are assigned and the loan servicer does not change.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">As the law now stands, recording the assignment is all that is required to provide notice of its existence. <em>Steadman v. Foster, </em>83 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>641, 643, 92 <em>A. </em>353 (E. &amp; A.1914). Consequently, the failure to advise the Chaudhris of EMC\u2019s receipt of the assignment from Unicor was innocuous. <em>See Restatement (Third) of Property: Mortgages, </em>\u00a7 5.5 comment a (1997). The motion judge\u2019s (and the trial judge\u2019s) order to the contrary was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">In summary, we conclude that: (1) EMC is not required to exceed the notice provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:50-56, and sending the statutory notice of intent to foreclose by first class and certified mail, return receipt requested, satisfies the statutory prerequisites; (2) EMC is to serve its assignment on the Chaudris prior to pursuing its foreclosure action, as the recorded assignment is notice to all; and (3) the dismissal of Unicor\u2019s foreclosure had no substantive effect on the rights and entitlements of EMC or the Chaudhris under the mortgage and note \u2014 in essence the parties\u2019 claims and defenses remain unchanged by that litigation. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>ingly, we reverse the order of summary judgment in favor of the Chaudhris and reinstate EMC\u2019s foreclosure complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Next, we examine the summary judgment granted in favor of DeWit. The motion judge made no factual examination of DeWit\u2019s knowledge of her parents\u2019 opportunistic actions to take advantage of the trial judge\u2019s inadvertence in entering the October 25, 2002 order. It was clear that the Unicor foreclosure was dismissed, without prejudice, and the law unequivocally expresses such a dismissal has no impact on the respective parties\u2019 substantive rights. <em>Woodward-Clyde Consultants, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 472, 523 A.2d 131. Further, the sharp misuse of motion practice to discharge EMC\u2019s mortgage cannot be overlooked as it lends factual support for EMC\u2019s theory of the case. EMC presented sufficient facts to require a trial to determine whether the Chaudhris engaged in a scheme to convey the property to DeWit, unencumbered by EMC\u2019s mortgage, despite not having satisfied that mortgage. EMC must be afforded a trial to develop the extent of DeWit\u2019s knowledge of and participation in these events.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">DeWit relies on the receipt of a clear title report, after a January 3, 2003 title search, to claim the status of a bona fide purchaser for value. DeWit\u2019s receipt of the title report is not determinative of EMC\u2019s assertions. The title search revealed EMC\u2019s recorded assignment and lis pendens filed prior to DeWit\u2019s purchase of her parents\u2019 home. EMC disputes DeWit\u2019s suggested status as a bona fide purchaser for value based on the familial relationship with the Chaudhris along with the timing of the transaction. A trial will ferret out whether DeWit knew of her parents\u2019 purchase money mortgage and whether she knew the Chaudhris failed to pay that mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">DeWit advances an additional argument that EMC\u2019s failure to comply with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:22-1 voids the assignment against a bona fide party-in-interest. This argument is rejected. This very question was posed to the Court of Errors and Appeals in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>Leonard, supra, </em>81 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>at 490, 87 <em>A. </em>645. The defendants advanced the position that \u201cthe mortgage has become waste paper by reason of the failure to record the assignment, so that while in fact the complainant\u2019s title is paramount, in law it is void.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491, 87 <em>A. </em>645. In rejecting this contention, the court stated that although section 54 of the Conveyances Act, as revised in 1898, (the predecessor of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:22-1) could be construed broadly to include mortgage assignments, the statute did not defeat section 32 of the Mortgage Act (now <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:18-4), \u201cwhich makes the record of the assignment notice to all persons concerned, and does not limit its effect to judgment creditors, purchasers and mortgagees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 493, 87 <em>A. </em>645. <em>See also Goldberg, supra, </em>362 F.2d at 577 (\u201cit has been held that \u00a7 54 of the [Conveyance] Act, the counterpart of <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>46:22-1], ... was not applicable to the assignments of mortgages on real property.\u201d); <em>Rose, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>at 78-74, 172 <em>A. </em>510 (\u00a7 54 of the Conveyance Act is not applicable to assignments of mortgage as against subsequent judgment creditors). Despite the passage of time, these precedents remain applicable because the statutes have not changed. <em>United States SBA v. Martignetti, </em>98 F.Supp.2d 587, 592 (D.N.J. 2000); <em>First Nat'l Bank, supra, </em>17 <em>B.R. </em>at 965.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Because we reverse summary judgment to the Chaudhris, the factual dispute attached to their transfer of the property to DeWit also must be aired. Accordingly, genuine issues as to material facts preclude the entry of summary judgment for DeWit.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">EMC\u2019s priority position vis-\u00e1-vis Gateway\u2019s claim introduces a different factual dispute. The law provides that a mortgagee for value without notice, actual or constructive, acquires a lien free from all latent equities existing in favor of third persons. <em>Bajek v. Polack, </em>120 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>104, 107-09, 184 <em>A. </em>212 (Ch.1936). \u201cNew Jersey is considered a \u2018race-notice\u2019 jurisdiction, which means that as between two competing parties the interest of the party who first records the instrument will prevail so long as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>that party had no actual knowledge of the other party\u2019s previously-acquired interest.\u201d <em>Cox v. RKA Corp., </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>487, 496, 753 A.2d 1112 (2000). A corollary to that rule is that parties are charged with constructive notice of instruments that are properly recorded. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The question of whether Gateway was without notice is disputed. Gateway agrees that when searching the property\u2019s title it learned of the assignment from Unicor to EMC, as well as EMC\u2019s lis pendens, prior to executing its mortgage encumbrance with DeWit. However, Gateway argues it also determined that the underlying mortgage (between Security and the Chaudhris) was discharged by the October 25, 2002 order, and it concluded EMC\u2019s recorded assignment and lis pendens became void as a matter of law. We do not agree that the establishment of Gateway\u2019s priority is so simply made.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Constructive notice by known circumstances may defeat the mortgagee\u2019s asserted priority position. <em>See Henion v. Monahan, </em>110 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>361, 363, 160 A. 566 (E. &amp; A.1932). When a mortgagee is faced with extraordinary, suspicious, and unusual facts, which should prompt an inquiry, \u201cit is equivalent to notice of the fact in question.\u201d <em>Tantum v. Green, </em>21 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>364, 367-70 (E. &amp; A. 1869).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Also, Gateway may have had actual notice. <em>Howard v. Diolosa, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>222, 232, 574 A.2d 995 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>414, 585 A.2d 409 (1990). On this record, the reasonableness of Gateway\u2019s reliance on its title examination, which may be the subject of expert opinion, and the facts surrounding Gateway\u2019s knowledge of EMC\u2019s recorded mortgage interest remain at issue. We list several questions that require examination. Whether Gateway had an obligation to inquire of the Chaudhris or EMC regarding the satisfaction or existence of the mortgage. Whether the recorded October 25, 2002 order clarified or clouded the title because the lis pendens was recorded by EMC (not Unicor) under a different docket number than the foreclosure action addressed in the October 25, 2002 order. Whether the timing of the recording of these documents (the lis pendens on October 8, 2002, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>court order with a different docket number of October 25, 2002) further adds to the confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Because EMC\u2019s foreclosure was dismissed on summary judgment, these particular points were not adequately explored. We conclude that a factual dispute as to the bonafides of Gateway\u2019s actions must be resolved at trial. Accordingly, the order granting Gateway summary judgment must also be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">In considering the correctness of the lower court\u2019s decision, we bottom our review on the case only as it had unfolded to the point of the motion, and the evidential material submitted on that motion. <em>Bilotti v. Accurate Forming Corp., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>184, 188, 188 A.2d 24 (1963). Based on that review, we conclude that summary judgment was improvidently granted to all defendants. EMC\u2019s foreclosure complaint shall be reinstated and a trial on the merits must be scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b161-9\"> Proper service of the Chaudhris' motion was disputed by EMC. Mr. Fox's notice was incompletely addressed and not sent to his law office. Also, EMC's co-counsel, who had appeared in the foreclosure proceeding, Edward A. Dreskin, Esq., was not served. Viewing the facts most favorable to EMC, would lead to the conclusion that the motion to discharge the lis pendens and mortgage were not properly served on counsel or EMC, Unicor's assignee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b171-8\"> The statute preserves \u201call just set-offs and other defenses against the assignor that would have been allowed in any action brought by the assignor and existing before notice of such assignment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:9-9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b172-6\"> We recognize the <em>Restatement (Third) of Property: Mortgages, </em>\u00a7 5.5 comment c (1997) takes a contrary position.
