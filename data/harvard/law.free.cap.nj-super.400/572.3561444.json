She was initially diagnosed at Morris-town Memorial Hospital (the hospital) as having a minor knee sprain and discharged with a prescription for pain medication. A few days later, she returned to the hospital\u2019s emergency room in extreme pain. This time she was diagnosed with a serious infection, which tragically resulted in the amputation of both legs, her right arm, and four fingers of her left hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Plaintiff filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim, which resulted in an award of $400,000 in permanent and total disability with an expectation of additional benefits for the rest of her life. Plaintiff later filed this medical malpractice action against the hospital and others. Plaintiff and the hospital settled for $125,000; the workers\u2019 compensation statutory lien, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-10, held by appellant Workers\u2019 Compensation Security Fund (the fund), attached to that recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Plaintiff went to trial against the remaining defendants. Before the jury could render its verdict, plaintiff and defendant Richard D. Shih entered into what they have referred to as a \u201cverdict risk limiting\u201d agreement, which guaranteed \u2014 regardless of the jury\u2019s verdict \u2014 that plaintiff would receive no less than $100,000 and no more than $3,500,000. That is, if the verdict was that plaintiff should receive nothing or less than $100,000, Shih was bound to pay plaintiff $100,000; if the verdict was in excess of $3,500,000, plaintiff would receive only $3,500,000; and if the verdict fell between $100,000 and $3,500,000, the amount of the verdict would define the amount due plaintiff. The jury rendered a \u201cno cause\u201d verdict, and, based on her agreement with defendant Shih, plaintiff received $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Plaintiff thereafter filed a motion in this action, seeking a declaration that the fund\u2019s statutory lien did not attach to the $100,000 payment. The fund opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>There was no genuine factual dispute about the nature and terms of the \u201cverdict risk limiting\u201d agreement. Such an agreement, also commonly known as a \u201chigh/low\u201d agreement, fixes the parties\u2019 obligations pending a determination of the defendant\u2019s monetary obligation through the rendering of the jury\u2019s otherwise irrelevant verdict.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The discrete issue presented on appeal is whether defendant Shih\u2019s $100,000 payment was subject to the fund\u2019s statutory lien, which attaches by law to any \u201csum in release or in judgment on account of [a third person\u2019s] liability to\u201d the employee. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-40. The trial judge concluded that the payment did not meet this statutory definition and granted plaintiffs motion. We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">\u201cWith respect to work-related injuries, the rights and duties of an employee and employer, as well as those of the employer and a third-party tortfeasor, are governed by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-1 to -127.\u201d <em>Ramos v. Browning Ferris Indus., Inc., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>177, 183, 510 A.2d 1152 (1986). As the Court has explained, an earlier statutory scheme permitted an injured employee to recover not only workers\u2019 compensation benefits but also any payments received from third-party tortfeasors. In this manner, employees were able at times to obtain double recoveries. <em>Frazier v. N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>590, 596-97, 667 A.2d 670 (1995). Finding such double recoveries inequitable, the Legislature enacted <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-40, which, with some modifications since its original adoption in 1913, creates a lien in favor of the employer that attaches to the employee\u2019s recovery against other tortfeasors. <em>See also </em>6 Arthur Larson, <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number><em>Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 110.08 (2007) (observing that \u201c[t]he policy of avoiding double recovery is a strong one, and has on occasion been invoked to override a result that might be thought required by a literal or technical interpretation of statutes\u201d). As a result, although the legislative scheme permits an employee to pursue a claim for damages against an alleged tortfeasor, any recovery obtained, not in excess of the amount of the lien, is encumbered by the employer\u2019s statutory lien. <em>See Errickson v. Supermarkets Gen. Corp., </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>457, 463, 587 A.2d 1322 (App.Div.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">With this understanding of the statute\u2019s history as \"a backdrop, we focus on whether the fund\u2019s lien attached to the payment plaintiff received from defendant Shih. That is, we must determine whether this $100,000 payment is what is referred to in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-40 as a \u201csum in release or in judgment on account of [a third person\u2019s] liability to\u201d plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Our analysis could begin and end with the observation that plaintiff executed and delivered a general release of all her past, present and future claims against defendant Shih as the verdict risk limiting agreement apparently required in order to obtain the $100,000 payment. No parsing of the language of the statute, in light of those circumstances, would suggest anything other than that this payment was a <em>\u201csum in release </em>... on account of [a third person\u2019s] liability.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">But, we also conclude that it is not the mere delivery of a release in exchange for the payment, but the nature of the settlement agreement itself, that warrants the attachment of the statutory lien to the payment. The general language of <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-40 clearly evinces the Legislature\u2019s intent to broadly expand the type of payments to which the lien will attach. No matter how atypical or novel the nature of a settlement agreement, the lien will attach to a payment received by an injured employee that is derivative of the employee\u2019s demand, claim or suit against a third party tortfeasor. <em>See Grijalva v. Ariz. State Comp. Fund, </em>185 <em>Ariz. </em>74, 912 P.2d 1303, 1306 (1996). Such is in keeping with our courts\u2019 expansive view of the statutory lien. By way of illustra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>tion, we note that it has been held that the statutory lien attaches to a recovery or settlement of a legal malpractice action based on an attorney\u2019s failure to pursue a claim against a third party tortfeasor. <em>Frazier, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 601-02, 667 A.2d 670; <em>Johns-Manville Prods. Corp. v. Dronebarger, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>520, 525-26, 511 A.2d 1304 (Law Div.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">In short, the lien attaches regardless of the merit of the third-party claim. As a result, it is of no moment that the jury rendered a verdict favorable to defendant Shih in determining whether the payment he later made was \u201con account of\u2019 his liability to plaintiff. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-40. The phrase \u201con account of ... liability\u201d does not limit itself to those payments made when a third party tortfeasor is actually found liable. The question to be determined is whether the agreement to make a payment was made in contemplation of and while the alleged tortfeasor was in the course of responding to or defending against a claim brought by the employee. Accordingly, the lien attaches as well to an alleged tortfeasor\u2019s promise to pay in order to avoid the consequences of a verdict yet to be delivered, as here.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">When Shih agreed to make a payment to plaintiff this case was still active. Shih\u2019s $100,000 payment to plaintiff was not a gift; it was a settlement. It was offered and accepted as the means for resolving the parties\u2019 differences, subject only to the rendering of a jury verdict for the sole purpose of filling in the agreement\u2019s gaps by defining the amount Shih had agreed to pay. This constituted a settlement of the type encompassed by <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-40 because it was generated by, and made in contemplation of, plaintiffs suit against Shih and was the consideration she agreed to accept in order to resolve that litigation. As a result, we conclude in this novel circumstance, a conclusion also assumed by a court of a sister state, <em>Martino v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd., </em>813 A.2d 945, 947-49 (Pa.Commw.Ct.2002), <em>appeal denied, </em>573 <em>Pa. </em>706, 827 A.2d 431 (2003)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, that the payment to the employee of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>the \u201clow\u201d defined by a high/low agreement, which agreement preceded a decision or verdict in favor of an alleged tortfeasor, is subject to the employer\u2019s statutory lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Reversed and remanded for the entry of an order enforcing the fund\u2019s statutory lien.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-7\"> At oral argument, plaintiff argued there was insufficient detail in the record on appeal by which the terms and meaning of the verdict risk limiting agreement could be ascertained. This contention was never raised in the trial court nor was such an argument contained in plaintiff\u2019s appellate brief. Indeed, contrary to plaintiff\u2019s contentions at oral argument about the alleged inadequacies in the record, the nature of the agreement was spelled out in plaintiffs motion in the trial court, and the fund expressly indicated its agreement with plaintiff\u2019s description. Accordingly, we resolve the issues on appeal by reference to plaintiff's own description of the agreement in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b607-7\"> <em>Martino </em>assumed the applicability of the employer\u2019s right of subrogation to the payment of the \"low\" required by a high/low agreement, which preceded an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>arbitrator\u2019s decision in favor of the defendant. The only controversy in <em>Martino </em>was whether the employer\u2019s rights extended to the injured party's spouse's alleged share of the \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019, based on the spouse\u2019s loss of consortium claim. The divided court held that the employer\u2019s rights extended to the entirety of the unallocated \"low.\" 813 A.2d at 948.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
