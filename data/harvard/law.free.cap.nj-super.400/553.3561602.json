Rosenberg, M.D. Because we find the trial court erred in allowing defense counsel to read extensive portions of the non-testifying defendant\u2019s deposition testimony into the record, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-15\">By way of background, on December 3, 2001, plaintiff, a twenty-seven-year-old Brazilian citizen, consulted with defendant, a board-certified plastic surgeon, about laser hair removal in her pubic and lower abdominal areas. According to plaintiff, she informed defendant of her low tolerance for pain and of her keloid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>scar, after which defendant documented plaintiffs skin sensitivity in his records. After being assured that a topical gel would relieve any associated pain, plaintiff scheduled the procedure for the following day. She was given a cream to be applied prior to the procedure to numb the area that would be treated.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The next day, plaintiff signed a consent form indicating that she had \u201cbeen informed that scarring, blistering, purpura, hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation are possible risks and complications.\u201d During the ensuing procedure, plaintiff complained of pain several times and in response to her complaints, defendant blew cold air through a tube and lowered the laser\u2019s frequency.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Immediately after the procedure, plaintiff was still in pain and noticed \u201cbubbles\u201d on her skin. Defendant escorted her back to the procedure room where he administered additional \u201cforced air cooling,\u201d and applied ice and aloe vera gel to the affected area. Plaintiff, however, continued to experience severe pain, so defendant administered a shot. Thereafter, she slept for about three hours at the office. When she awoke, defendant gave plaintiff a two-day supply of Toradol, a pain and anti-inflammatory medication, as well as aloe vera gel for the burns.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The pain persisted upon her return home. On a follow-up visit to defendant\u2019s office on December 6, defendant noted first-degree bums and dark circles. On a subsequent visit one week later, defendant noted plaintiff was \u201cdoing well. No more pain in bikini area. Spotty areas of hyper[-] and hypopigmentation, especially at periphery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Plaintiff complained of pain for about two weeks after the procedure. During that time, she was unable to wear underwear or walk without discomfort. She consulted a dermatologist, Dr. Ira Guterman, who noted \u201cscattered superficial crusting with pigmented\u201d and \u201csuperficial laser bums.\u201d Guterman diagnosed plaintiff with first degree burns and prescribed Bactroban antibiotic ointment. At a follow-up visit on December 21, 2001, Guterman noted loss of pigmentation, but \u201cno crusting\u201d and that the \u201claser burns [are] much improved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>About two months after the procedure, plaintiff returned to work as a \u201cgo-go dancer.\u201d Although she was able to wear both one- and two-piece bikinis while dancing, she had modified her style of dress in other ways to hide her scars. For instance, she no longer wears bikinis \u201cfrom Brazil\u201d or low-cut jeans or blouses and wears make-up to cover-up the marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Plaintiff sued defendant in medical malpractice for injuries received during the hair removal procedure. She later sought a stay of the proceedings because of visa complications that delayed her return from Brazil. The denial of this motion resulted in the grant of defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on plaintiffs failure to file an expert report within the discovery period. We reversed both orders and remanded the matter with instructions to conduct a ease management conference and issue a case management order with a discovery end date. <em>Alves v. Rosenberg, </em>No. A-5574-02T5, 2006 WL 1008669 (App. Div. April 19, 2006) (slip op. at 7-8).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Due largely to plaintiffs unavailability and defendant\u2019s background <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trial proceeded without live witnesses. All testimony was presented via either videotape or the reading of depositions. Thus, in addition to plaintiffs own <em>de bene esse </em>videotaped testimony, plaintiff also offered the videotaped deposition testimony of her expert, Dr. Richard Marfuggi, a board-certified plastic surgeon. Marfuggi opined that defendant deviated from the standard of care in his treatment of plaintiff in several ways, by failing to: (1) take into account her previous history of poor scarring from other injuries; (2) conduct a \u201cspot test\u201d; (3) \u201cstop and/or alter the settings of the laser in light of the patient\u2019s expression of experi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>encing severe pain during the procedure\u201d; and (4) properly evaluate the burns suffered by plaintiff inasmuch as blisters and crusting are signs of second-degree, and not first-degree burns. Marfuggi concluded that plaintiffs injuries, including the pain, burns and skin changes, were the result of defendant\u2019s deviations.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Plaintiffs counsel also read limited portions of defendant\u2019s deposition testimony into evidence, specifically those excerpts wherein he said he addressed plaintiffs post-procedure pain, as well as those wherein he denied that plaintiff was in severe pain during the procedure, received second- or third-degree burns, or required a spot test.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The defense presented no witnesses on its case-in-chief, although defendant was present during the trial. Instead, the defense sought to read into evidence additional portions of defendant\u2019s deposition admittedly unrelated to those excerpts previously read into the record by plaintiff, and addressing defendant\u2019s evaluation and treatment of plaintiff, laser hair removal generally, and spot testing. Over plaintiffs objection, the trial judge admitted this evidence, interpreting <em>Rule </em>4:16-l(d) as expressly allowing such a tactic. As noted, the jury ultimately found in defendant\u2019s favor and consequently the court entered an order of final judgment dismissing plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">On appeal, plaintiff principally argues that the judge committed reversible error in allowing defense counsel to read portions of defendant\u2019s deposition without making the requisite showing of fairness under <em>Rule </em>4:16 \u2014 1(d). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Under our rules of evidence, deposition testimony is generally inadmissible at trial as hearsay unless it falls under one of the enumerated exceptions. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>801; <em>N.J.R.E. </em>802. <em>Rule </em>4:16-1 sets forth instances where a deposition may be used at trial. Specifically,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">At the trial ... any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence applied as though the witness were then present and testifying, may be used in accordance with any of the following provisions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>(a) Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of deponent as a witness, or for any other purpose <em>permitted by the Rules of Evidence.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">(b) The deposition of a party ... may be used by an adverse party for any purpose against the deponent____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">(c) Except as otherwise provided by <em>R. </em>4:14-9(e), the deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose, against any other party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had reasonable notice thereof <em>if the court finds that the appearance of the witness cannot be obtained </em>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">(d) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, <em>an adverse party may require the offering party to introduce any other part which ought in fairness be considered with the part introduced, </em>and any party may offer any other parts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-10\">[R. 4:16-1 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">Thus, under <em>Rule </em>4:16-1, any deposition may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of the deponent as a witness, or where the deponent is \u201cunavailable,\u201d provided the party against whom the deposition is sought to be used was on notice of the deposition and had the opportunity to cross-examine the deponent. <em>R. </em>4:16-1(a), (e). Further, the deposition of a <em>party </em>may be used at trial by the <em>adverse </em>party for any reason. <em>R. </em>4:16-1 (b). Significantly, for present purposes, paragraph (d) of the rule also \u201cpermits the adverse party to offer in evidence any part of an <em>admissible </em>deposition not offered by the proponent thereof[,]\u201d Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 1 on <em>R. </em>4:16-1 (2008) (emphasis added), or \u201cany other part which ought in <em>fairness </em>be considered with the part introduced____\u201d <em>R. </em>4:16-l(d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">Paragraph (d)\u2019s notion of \u201cfairness\u201d is paralleled in <em>N.J.R.E. </em>106\u2019s \u201cdoctrine of testimonial completeness.\u201d Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>106 (2008). According to the doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-13\">[T]he opponent, against whom a part of an utterance has been put in, may in his turn complement it by putting in the remainder, in order to secure for the tribunal a complete understanding of the total tenor and effect of the utterance. It has been seen, ... that there is much opportunity for difference of opinion whether the <em>proponent </em>in the first instance <em>must </em>put in the whole. But there is and could be no difference of opinion as to the <em>opponent\u2019s right, </em>if a part only has been put in, himself to <em>put in the remainder.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>[State v. Lozada, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>260, 270, 608 A.2d 407 (App.Div.) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>1 Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7 2113 (Chadbourn rev.1978)), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>595, 617 A.2d 1218 (1992).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Thus, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>106 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">[w]hen a writing or recorded statement or part thereof is introduced by a party, an adverse party may require the introduction at that time of any other part or any other writing or recorded statement which in fairness ought to be considered contemporaneously.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Consequently, the completeness doctrine allows the reading of a second writing or statement where \u201cit is necessary to (1) explain the admitted portion, (2) place the admitted portion in context, (3) avoid misleading the trier of fact, or (4) insure a fair and impartial understanding.\u201d <em>Lozada, supra, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 272, 608 A.2d 407 (discussing doctrine of completeness in context of federal counterpart to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>106) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">As noted then, deposition testimony will be admissible only as specifically exempted from the hearsay proscription or as required by fairness. Consistent with this principle, plaintiff at trial read limited portions of defendant\u2019s deposition as admissions by a party <em>opponent. See N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(25); <em>R. </em>4:16 \u2014 1(b). In response, defendant sought to introduce other excerpts from his deposition which he readily acknowledged were unrelated to the admitted portions. Relying on the last phrase of section (d) to the effect \u201cand any party may offer any other parts[,]\u201d the trial judge allowed defense counsel to read extensively from defendant\u2019s deposition \u2014 nearly twelve pages in all. Therein, defendant denied that plaintiff was in pain during the procedure or that a \u201ctest spot\u201d was appropriate, or would have made a difference, and further asserted that plaintiffs \u201cresponse to the laser was a classic blistering first-degree burn not deeper than that.\u201d We conclude the admission of this evidence constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">To be sure, \u201ca trial court is afforded considerable latitude regarding the admission of evidence, and is to be reversed only if the court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Nelson, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>417, 470, 803 A.2d 1 (2002) (citation omitted). Discretion, however, means <em>legal </em>discretion, \u201cin the exercise of which the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>must take account of the law applicable to the particular circumstances of the ease and be governed accordingly.\u201d <em>State v. Steele, </em>92 <em>N.J.Super. </em>498, 507, 224 A.2d 132 (App.Div.1966). Obviously, \u201c[i]f the trial judge misconceives the applicable law or misapplies it ... the exercise of legal discretion lacks a foundation and becomes an arbitrary act.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In this regard, the trial court\u2019s \u201c \u2018interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference.\u2019\u201d <em>Magues v. Estate of Guy, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>108, 116, 936 A.2d 414 (2007) (quoting <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Manalapan Twp. Comm., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Here, the trial court misconstrued section (d) by reading the phrase \u201cand any party may offer any other parts\u201d in isolation and out of context, without reference to the limiting language preceding it. Clearly the phrase in issue is qualified by the rule\u2019s prefatory language that the proffered deposition testimony be \u201cadmissible under the rules of evidence!,]\u201d <em>R. </em>4:16-1; Pressler, <em>supra, </em>comment 1 on <em>R. </em>4:16-1, or as otherwise required by fairness. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>106; <em>see also Martin v. Prime Hospitality Cor., </em>345 <em>N.J.Super. </em>278, 294, 785 A.2d 16 (App.Div.2001); <em>Moksvold v. Meyers, </em>130 <em>N.J.Super. </em>481, 484-85, 327 A.2d 681 (App.Div. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Neither of these conditions, however, have been satisfied. Defendant\u2019s self-serving, exculpatory representations in those portions of his deposition proffered on his behalf do not qualify either as admissions of a party opponent under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(25), or, because of his availability, under any of the other recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule. Nor are they necessary to ensure fairness under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>106 for a complete understanding of the testimony. On this score, defendant does not claim that the proffered passages were required to complement, supplement, contextualize or contradict those portions admitted on plaintiffs case-in-chief, or to avoid confusing or misleading the trier of fact. On the contrary, defendant acknowledged their unrelatedness, but nevertheless urges his statements in the deposition are admissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>simply because they were made by him, and not because of their testimonial trustworthiness. Yet even the doctrine of completeness, which we find not implicated here, does not require admission of the self-serving, exculpatory portions of defendant\u2019s depositions. <em>See, e.g., Lozada, supra, </em>257 <em>NJ.Super. </em>at 272, 608 A.2d 407; <em>State v. Gomez, </em>246 <em>NJ.Super. </em>209, 216-17, 587 A.2d 272 (App.Div.1991); <em>State v. Colon, </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>608, 613, 588 A.2d 440 (App.Div.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The trial court\u2019s expansive interpretation of <em>Rule </em>4:16-1 would allow unlimited use by a defendant of his or her own deposition testimony and for any reason simply because an adversary admitted unrelated portions thereof on its case-in-chief. We find no warrant for that construction in either the language of the rule itself or in interpretative case law. <em>See, e.g., Martin, supra, </em>345 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 294, 785 A.2d 16 (rejecting defendant\u2019s argument that under <em>R. </em>4:16 \u2014 1(d) it should be allowed to admit the entire statement of a fact witness after the plaintiff introduced portions thereof into evidence, and noting that the defendant made \u201can inadequate showing that <em>fairness required other parts </em>of the statement to be admitted\u201d) (emphasis added). Moreover, an interpretation that allows any party to read any portion, or the entirety, of his or her own deposition for any reason renders the limitation of section (d) irrelevant and obviates the need for a \u201cfairness\u201d determination altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Nor was the admission of defendant\u2019s excerpts justified because plaintiff \u201copened the door.\u201d \u201cThe \u2018opening the door doctrine\u2019 is essentially a rule of expanded relevancy and authorizes admitting evidence which otherwise would have been irrelevant or inadmissible in order to respond to (1) <em>admissible evidence </em>that generates an issue, or (2) <em>inadmissible evidence </em>admitted by the court over objection.\u201d <em>State v. James, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>538, 554, 677 A.2d 734 (1996). Similar to the \u201ccompleteness\u201d doctrine, the \u201copen door\u201d doctrine provides an adverse party the opportunity to place evidence into its proper context. <em>Ibid. </em>Here, however, as previously noted, defendant conceded that the proffered excerpts were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>unrelated, and therefore not offered \u201cin response,\u201d to the portions read by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Lacking any sound evidential basis, defendant\u2019s extensive and selective use of his own substantive deposition testimony had a real potential for unfairness to plaintiff, who was thereby deprived of the opportunity for full and effective cross-examination at trial, and a real capacity to unjustly influence the trier of fact. We therefore consider the error reversible. Such error was compounded by precluding plaintiff thereafter from challenging defendant\u2019s credibility through the use of other omitted portions of his deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">In light of our disposition, we need not address other issues raised by plaintiff claiming error in excluding evidence of defendant\u2019s inability to prescribe medication and admitting evidence of plaintiffs work as a go-go dancer. Suffice it to say, as to the former, plaintiff\u2019s proffer was occasioned only by defendant\u2019s use of his deposition testimony, which we have held to be improper. As to the latter, the issue will presumably be considered <em>in limine </em>on remand, based on the particular proffers made at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">We do address, however, plaintiffs final claim that the trial court erred by denying plaintiffs motion for a directed verdict under <em>Rule </em>4:40-1 because defendant failed to offer any expert testimony to counter that offered by plaintiffs expert, Marfuggi. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">The standard for determining a motion under <em>Rule </em>4:40-1 is the same as that for a motion for involuntary dismissal under <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b). <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 5, 258 A.2d 706 (1969). Specifically, the trial court must decide</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAe\">whether the evidence, together with the legitimate inferences therefrom, could sustain a judgment in favor of the party opposing the motion, ?.&amp;, if, accepting as true all the evidence which supports the position of the party defending against the motion and according him the benefit of all inferences which can reasonably and legitimately be deduced therefrom, reasonable minds could differ, the motion must be denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(internal quotes and citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Ordinarily, such a motion should be denied when the case rests upon issues of credibility. <em>Johnson v. Salem Corp., </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>78, 92, 477 A.2d 1246 (1984). \u201c[S]imply because proofs are undisputed is insufficient in and of itself to warrant the grant of a motion for judgment ... in situations in which credibility is at issue, since the fact-finder is free to reject those uncontested proofs on credibility grounds.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also D\u2019Amato v. D'Amato, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>109, 115, 701 A.2d 970 (App.Div.1997) (noting that a jury issue is created where reasonable minds may differ as to the truth of testimony, \u201cwhether it be uncontradicted, uncontroverted or even undisputed\u201d). Such credibility determinations, however, may be removed from the jury\u2019s purview and a directed verdict granted when the testimony provided is uncontradicted and reliable, i.e., the testimony \u201cis not improbable, extraordinary or surprising in its nature, or [where] there is no other ground for hesitating to accept it as the truth____\u201d <em>Ferdinand v. Agric. Ins. Co., </em>22 <em>N.J. </em>482, 494,498,126 A.2d 323 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Here, plaintiff essentially contends that without an expert, defendant could not overcome Marfuggi\u2019s uncontradicted, credible testimony that defendant\u2019s conduct deviated from the standard of care about which plaintiff\u2019s expert opined. Yet, plaintiff overlooks record evidence upon which a jury could question Marfuggi\u2019s conclusions, especially when affording defendant all reasonable inferences to which he is entitled at that stage. In particular, Marfuggi acknowledged that he had not performed a laser hair removal in almost six years and, on cross-examination, that he neither interviewed nor examined plaintiff personally. More significantly, several of the facts upon which the expert based his conclusion came directly from plaintiff\u2019s testimony, which was contradicted in part by defendant\u2019s deposition testimony and plaintiff\u2019s own medical record. Thus, viewing the record in the light most favorable to defendant, we find no error in the judge\u2019s denial of plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment under <em>Rule </em>4:40-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\"> At the time of plaintiff\u2019s treatment, there were restrictions imposed on defendant\u2019s medical license, due to his own drug addiction, prohibiting him from prescribing or administering certain narcotic painkillers. At a pre-trial <em>in limine </em>hearing, the trial judge precluded reference to defendant\u2019s past drug addiction and medical license suspension as unduly prejudicial, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403, but permitted general inquiry as to the nature of the limitations or conditions placed on defendant\u2019s medical license at the time of plaintiff\u2019s treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
