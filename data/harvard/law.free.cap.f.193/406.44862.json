Two of these patents were issued to M. S. Farmer, but need not be further noticed, since complainant very properly admitted that their rights rest solely on the Crampton patent, No. 331,782, The pressure of business upon the court prevents much discussion of the contentions of the parties, but the ability displayed in the argument and the importance of the\" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>case to the parties make it proper that the court outline the reasons for its conclusions, reserving for another time the filing of a more extended opinion. I think it will conduce to a better understanding of the issue whether there is substantial identity of the operation and of the different mechanisms by which the switches operate and co-operate to produce the result claimed for them, respectively, to give in parallel columns the essential features of the mechanism and mode of operation of the two switches.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-3\">After a careful reading of the testimony and claims of the Orampton patent, and an inspection of the somewhat crude models, and the illustrations of their modes of operation as given by counsel in practical working, I am satisfied that what follows is a fair and just statement of the differences between the mechanism and operation of the two switches.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-4\">GltA MPT OX'S SWITCH.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AFMH\">Grampton\u2019s shifting lever is substantially wedge-shaped and <em>must be </em>substantially wedge-shaped to operate in his construction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A6A\">Crampton\u2019s Switch Point is <em>not completely thrown </em>until the depending bar <em>reaches the end of Ms shifting lever.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A0sx\">The forward end of Grampton\u2019s shifting lever is not shifted <em>until the depending bur reaches the rear end of said lever.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ABb\">Crampton\u2019s lever <em>operates on two fulerums </em>(one of the ends of the slot B', and one of the pins C O') to completely throw his switch point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Amt\">Crampton\u2019s depending bar furnishes the power for throwing the switch point <em>and shifting the forward end of the lever.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AlQQ\">During the shifting of the forward end of Grampton\u2019s lever, pin G or O' is Ms fulcrum and <em>the depending bar is his power. </em>(In the modified construction illustrated by the model produced by complainant\u2019s counsel at the final hearing, the switch point connecting rod is Orampton\u2019s fulcrum for shifting the forward end of Ms lever, while the depending bar is his power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AsSR\">Crampton\u2019s switch point is connected by rod Y <em>to the rear end </em>of Ms shifting lever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aq_\">The forward end of Crampton\u2019s lever is shifted gradually by the action <em>of the depending bar. </em>Cramp ton\u2019s lever and switch point are only moved <em>when his lever is acted upon by the depending bar.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A3v\">Cramp!on\u2019s lover and switch point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number><em>are rigidly looked </em>against movement in any direction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>SHEPHERD\u2019S SWITCH.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-15\">Shepherd\u2019s shifting lover has parallel sides.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-16\">Shepherd\u2019s switch point <em>is completely thrown </em>when the depending bar has travelled <em>half the length of the shifting lever.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-17\">The forward end of Shepherd\u2019s shifting lever is shifted <em>immediately after the depending bar passes the switch point connection.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-18\">Shepherd\u2019s lever <em>has but one fulcrum </em>(one side of the forward end of the box) <em>to completely throw his switch point.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-19\">Shepherd\u2019s depending bar only furnishes the power for throwing the switch point.

Rowell v. Lindsay, 113 U. S. 97, 103, 5 Sup. Ct. 507, 28 L. Ed. 906. Walker on Patents, \u00a7 354.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-4\">A substituted part in a patented combination, in order to constitute .an equivalent which will not avoid infringement, must not vary in any manner the idea of means, and while it may perform some new or additional function, and still be an equivalent, it must perform all the functions of the element for which it is substituted in substantially the same way, and be a mere change of parts and form involving no inventive skill, hut suggested by the patented invention itself to every person skilled in the particular art. If it not only performs the functions of the element for which it is substituted, but introduces into the combination a new idea or a much more extended development of the idea of means, it is not an equivalent, but a patentable invention. Dey Time Register Co. v. Syracuse Time Recorder Co. (C. C.) 152 Fed. 440. See, also, Westinghouse Airbrake Co. v. New York Airbrake Company, 119 Fed. 874, 56 C. C. A. 404.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-5\">Doubts on the question of mechanical equivalents should be resolved against the patentee where the patentability of the claim sued on is doubtful in view of the prior art. Upon the question of the mechanical equivalency of defendant\u2019s device with complainant\u2019s patent, any doubt as to equivalency should be resolved against the patentee when the claim contains the words \u201cdescribed as substantially set forth.\u201d Cleveland Foundry Co. v.
