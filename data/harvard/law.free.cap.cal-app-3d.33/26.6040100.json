At the heart of the dispute is a claim made by Mrs. Elizabeth Ehrenburg that she suffered personal injury on October 24, 1966. As we hereafter show, her claim was settled by Hartford prior to trial, hence there has been no finding as to the facts underlying her claim. The coverage dispute was submitted to the trial court upon an agreed statement which recited inter alia that Mrs. Ehrenburg <em>alleged </em>to have been injured in the manner hereinafter described. The judgment from which plaintiff appeals was entered on findings which did not determine how (or whether) Mrs. Ehrenburg was injured; in this respect, the findings merely reiterated her allegations of the fact and manner of her injury. At oral argument in this court, however, counsel stipulated that Mrs. Ehrenburg suffered an injury in the manner and of the type alleged by her, and as more specifically described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>in depositions which are a part of the record on appeal. Our summary of the events of Mrs. Ehrenburg\u2019s injury is taken from the agreed statement as thus expanded by the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">I. The Record</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">On the evening of October 24, 1966, Mrs. William Morrison parked her four-door sedan in front of her Redding home, and a guest passenger \u2014Mrs. Elizabeth Ehrenburg\u2014started to alight from the stopped car. The Morrisons\u2019 male scottie dog had been riding in the back seat; Mrs. Morrison usually took the dog with her in the automobile when she drove at night. While still sitting in the right front seat, Mrs. Ehrenburg started to open the door in order to alight from the car. As she did so, the dog jumped from the back seat onto the front seat and over Mrs. Ehrenburg\u2019s right shoulder, biting Mrs. Ehrenburg beside the right eye and on her right arm as he climbed over the seat in an attempt to get out of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Under a homeowner\u2019s policy in force on the date in question, Hartford insured Mr. and Mrs. Morrison (and agreed to defend them) against liability for bodily injury<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arising out of the ownership, occupation, and use of their residence, including the operation, maintenance, and use of automobiles on their premises or on the ways immediately adjoining. The \u201cother insurance\u201d clause in Hartford\u2019s policy provided, however, that \u201cwith respect to loss <em>arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or unloading of </em>. . . <em>any automobile </em>... at the premises or the ways immediately adjoining . . . , this insurance shall not apply to the extent that any valid and collectible insurance, whether on a primary, excess or contingent basis, is available to the Insured.\u201d (Italics added.) The applicable limit of the Hartford policy was $25,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">At the same time, under a standard automobile policy with an applicable limit of $10,000,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Civil Service insured Mrs. Morrison and her husband (a co-owner of the car) against liability for \u201cbodily injury, sickness or disease, including death at any time resulting therefrom, sustained by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>any person, caused by accident and <em>arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the automobile.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Civil Service further undertook therein to \u201cdefend any suit against the insured alleging such injury, sickness, [or] disease . .,. and seeking damages on account thereof, even if such suit is groundless, false or fraudulent. . . .\u201d In regard to losses within the coverage here described, the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause in the Civil Service policy provided for proration with other \u201cvalid and collectible\u201d insurance but did not purport to be excess insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Mrs. Ehrenburg subsequently sued Mr. and Mrs. Morrison, seeking damages for the personal injury caused to her by their dog.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Hartford, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Morrisons, notified Civil Service \u201cof the claim and the suit\u201d (we quote the findings) and tendered the defense of the Morrisons to Civil Service. Civil Service refused the tender. Thereafter, having furnished a defense to the Morrisons, Hartford paid Mrs. Ehrenburg $15,000 in full settlement of her claim. Hartford and Civil Service stipulated\u2014and the trial court found\u2014that Hartford acted reasonably and in good faith in negotiating and consummating the settlement and in making the payment of $15,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hartford subsequently commenced the present action against Civil Service, seeking indemnification of the $15,000 as well as reimbursement of Hartford\u2019s costs and expenses in defending -against the Ehrenburg claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">II. The Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The trial court adjudged that Civil Service had no duty either to defend the Morrisons in the Ehrenburg suit or to indemnify Hartford for its out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>lays therein,  The judgment reflects the court\u2019s express determination that, contrary to Hartford\u2019s contention, Mrs. Ehrenburg\u2019s injury was-not one \u201carising out of the . . . use\u201d of the Morrisons\u2019 automobile, within the meaning of the two policies, but rather that the incident \u201coccurred as a result of the ownership of a dog.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Although the issue is not free of difficulty, we are of the opinion that the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">In determining whether the events of the accident were within the coverage of the Civil Service policy, that policy must be considered alone as though the Morrisons had no other insurance available. <em>(Monolith Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>American Home Assur. Co. </em>(1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 115, 123 [78 Cal.Rptr. 113]; <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co. </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 144, 148-149 [57 Cal.Rptr. 240].) \u201cIf the insurer uses language which is uncertain any reasonable doubt will be resolved against it; if the doubt relates to extent or fact of coverage, [such] as to peril insured against . . . , the language will be understood in its most inclusive sense, for the benefit of , the insured.\u201d <em>(Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Constr. Co. </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 423, 437-438 [296 P.2d 801, 57 A.L.R.2d 914]; see also, <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., supra.) </em>We must ascertain \u201cthat meaning of the contract which the insured would reasonably expect.\u201d <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 263, 270 [54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168].)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u201cIn deciding whether peripheral activity involving a vehicle amounts to a \u2018use,\u2019 the courts follow the rule that uncertainties in policy language are construed in favor of imposing liability on the insurer; hence, that \u2018use\u2019 must be understood in its most comprehensive sense. The term is not confined to motion on the highway, but extends to any activity in utilizing the insured vehicle in the manner intended or contemplated by the insured.\u201d <em>(Pacific Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exch. </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 700, 703 [76 Cal.Rptr. 281].) (Fns. omitted.) \u201c[T]he acts coming within such use are not necessarily those arising out of or related to the <em>operation </em>of the vehicle.\u201d <em>(Glens Falls Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Consolidated Freightways </em>(1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 774, 783 [51 Cal.Rptr. 789].) (Original italics.) The word \u201cuse\u201d may apply though the insured vehicle is at rest. <em>(St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>(1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 826, 831 [53 Cal.Rptr. 650].)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The concept of loss <em>arising out of </em>the use of an insured vehicle \u201cimports some kind of sequential relationship between the vehicle and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>accident. The decisions posit varying descriptions of this relationship. One is that the vehicle need not be the proximate cause of the injury in the legal sense, but \u2018the events giving rise to the claim must arise out of; and be related to, its use.\u2019 Another is that the injury b'e a \u2018natural and reasonable incident or consequence of the use of the [automobile] for the purposes shown by the declarations . . . [and not] directly caused by some independent act, or intervening cause wholly disassociated from, independent of and remote from the use of the [automobile].\u2019 The phrase \u2018arising out of\u2019 is equated with origination, growth or flow from the event.\u201d <em>(Pacific Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exch., supra, </em>270 Cal.App.2d at p. 704 <em>(tas. </em>omitted); <em>see </em>also, <em>International Business Machines Corp. </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exch. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 1026, 1031, fn. 6 [89 Cal.Rptr. 615, 474 P.2d 431].)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The transportation of household pets in family cars is commonplace. In the case at bench, the fact that the scottie was riding in the Morrisons\u2019 automobile clearly involved a \u201cuse\u201d of that vehicle. In <em>National Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Corbo </em>(Fla.App. 1971) 248 So.2d 238, in a case of nationwide first impression, the court held that the plaintiff\u2019s injury arose out of the use of the insured\u2019s automobile where the plaintiff\u2014a guest passenger\u2014was bitten in the parked car by the insured\u2019s watchdog while the car was transporting the dog to the insured\u2019s place of business. In so holding, the Florida court relied on the proposition that \u201carising out of\u201d is a phrase of much broader significance than \u201ccaused by,\u201d and is ordinarily understood to mean \u201cincident to, or having connection with\u201d the use of the car. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 240.)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The biting of Mrs. Ehrenburg presents as strong a case for coverage as did the facts in <em>National Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Corbo, supra, </em>248 So.2d 238, for here the injury occurred while the Morrisons\u2019 dog was trying to get out of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The \u201cuse\u201d of a vehicle includes its loading and unloading, even though, as in the Civil Service policy in the instant case, there is no specific provision covering such activities. <em>(International Business Machines Corp. </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exch., supra, 2 </em>Cal.3d at p. 1029 &amp; fn. 1; <em>Truck Ins. Exch. </em>v. <em>Webb </em>(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 140, 144 [63 Cal.Rptr. 791].) In <em>Morari </em>v. <em>Atlantic Mutual Fire Insurance Company </em>(1970) 105 Ariz. 537 [468 P.2d 564], the insured accidentally shot a passenger when the insured, standing beside his parked pickup-camper, attempted to take out a hunting rifle from behind the seat, causing the loaded gun (not on safety) to discharge. The court distinguished cases involving the accidental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>discharge of firearms and firecrackers by passengers inside automobiles on the ground that they were not \u201cunloading\u201d situations. Pointing out that the rifle was part of the vehicle\u2019s normal cargo on hunting trips such as the one in question, the court held that the accident was \u201cconnected with\u201d the unloading of the vehicle (i.e., the removal of the gun). (105 Ariz. at p. 540 [468 P.2d at p. 567].)  We perceive no logical distinction in the case at bench, where the injury occurred during the \u201cunloading\u201d of the scottie from the Morrisons\u2019 car. The circumstances that the scottie was <em>animate </em>cargo and was unloading <em>itself </em>are not determinative. Dogs transported in family cars normally remove themselves from the vehicles when the trips are over. \u201cThe fact that .an instrumentality independent of the insured vehicle caused the injuries does not preclude coverage.\u201d <em>(Brunswig Wholesale Druggist </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>(1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 11, 14 [77 Cal.Rptr. 859]; see also, <em>American Auto Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Transport Indem. Co. </em>(1962) 200 Cal.App.2d 543, 549 [19 Cal. Rptr. 558].)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u201cAn insurer . . . bears a duty to defend its insured whenever it ascertains facts which give rise to the <em>potential </em>of liability under the policy.\u201d <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co., supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at pp. 276-277.) (Italics added.) \u201cSince modern procedural rules focus on the facts of a case rather than the theory of recovery in the complaint, the duty to defend should be fixed by the facts which the insurer learns from the complaint, the insured, or other sources.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 276; see also, <em>State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Flynt </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 538, 548-549 [95 Cal.Rptr. 296].) The issue is whether such facts \u201ccreated the <em>possibility </em>that the insurer would be liable for the claim.\u201d <em>(Paramount Properties Co. </em>v. <em>Transamerica Title Ins. Co. </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 562, 571 [83 Cal.Rptr. 394, 463 P.2d 746] (italics added); see also, <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co., supra, </em>at p. 277.)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">As we have seen, the Civil Service automobile policy obligated it to defend suits alleging personal injury arising out of the use of the Morrisons\u2019 automobile even if such suits were \u201cgroundless, false or fraudulent.\u201d \u201cWhile it is true, the duty to defend litigation brought against an insured may exist even where coverage is in doubt and ultimately does not develop, \u2018The \u201cgroundless, false, or fraudulent\u201d clause, . . . does not extend the obligation to defend without limits; it includes only defense to those actions of the nature and kind covered by the policy.\u2019 <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co., supra, </em>65 Cal.2d 263, 274.)\u201d <em>(State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Flynt, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.3d at p. 548.)</p>\n<p id=\"Ak\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Mrs. Ehrenburg\u2019s complaint against the Morrisons alleged that the scottie bit her while she \u201cwas alighting\u201d from the car; but the complaint was silent as to whether the dog had been riding inside the vehicle. (See fn. 4, <em>supra) </em>It is unnecessary, however, for us to determine whether the allegations of the Ehrenburg complaint apprised Civil Service of the possibility that her claim was of the nature and kind covered by its policy.  Inadequate allegations of a third party\u2019s complaint are not determinative of an insurer\u2019s obligation to defend if the insurer learns from the insured or other sources facts which give rise to the potential of liability under its policy. (See <em>Paramount Properties Co. </em>v. <em>Transamerica Title Ins. Co., supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at pp. 570-571; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co., supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at pp. 276-277; <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Flynt, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.3d at pp. 548-549.) It was admitted by the answer of Civil Service, and the court found, that Hartford notified Civil Service of the pendency of Mrs. Ehrenburg\u2019s \u201cclaim,\u201d as well as of her lawsuit; and the findings in effect describe her claim as being that the dog \u201callegedly\u201d bit her while he was climbing over the front seat to get out of the car. Moreover, Civil Service has not contended, either in the trial court or here, that it lacked information concerning the details of the Ehrenburg claim when it refused Hartford\u2019s tender.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Accordingly, the refusal by Civil Service to defend the Morrisons was wrongful; the Ehrenburg claim created the possibility of liability on the part of Civil Service. (Note Civ. Code, \u00a7 3342 (\u201cdog bite\u201d statute); compare Veh. Code, \u00a7 17158 (\u201cguest\u201d statute, in effect at the time of Mrs. Ehrenburg\u2019s injury; see <em>Brown </em>V. <em>Merlo </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 855 [106 Cal. Rptr. 388, 506 P.2d 212]).)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">We have shown, in our recital of the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses of the two policies, that the Civil Service policy (although providing for proration) was primary, and that Hartford\u2019s policy was excess.  \u201c[I]n the case of multiple insurance policies covering the same loss, one <em>of </em>which contains a provision for pro-ration in the event o-f other insurance and the other a clause that it shall be treated as \u2018excess insurance\u2019 to any other policy, the policy with the proration clause is primary and must bear the loss to its policy limits.\u201d <em>(Fireman\u2019s Fund etc. Ins. Companies </em>v. <em>State Farm etc. Ins. Co. </em>(1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 445, 448-449 [78 Cal.Rptr. 38]; see, <em>Pacific Employers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 318, 328 [54 Cal.Rptr. 385, 419 P.2d 641]; <em>Donahue Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Transport Indem. Co. </em>(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 291, 302-303 [86 Cal.Rptr. 632].)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>It is the general rule that if there is a wrongful refusal to defend, the insurer loses its right to control the litigation, and is liable for \u201cany reasonable settlement\u201d arrived at in good faith thereunder and paid by the insured. <em>(Columbia Southern Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>Manufacturers &amp; Wholesalers Indem. Exch. </em>(1961) 190 Cal.App.2d 194, 204 [11 Cal.Rptr. 762]; see also, <em>Northwestern Title Security Co. </em>v. <em>Flack </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 134, 146 [85 Cal.Rptr. 693].)  As previously indicated, Mrs. Ehrenburg\u2019s $15,000 settlement exceeded by $5,000 the limit of the Civil Service policy. However, the unqualified stipulation in the trial court that the settlement was <em>reasonable in amount </em>was tantamount to an acknowledgment by Hartford that the payment of the $5,000 excess was not proximately caused by the refusal of Civil Service to defend (cf. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 508, 528-531 [88 Cal.Rptr. 246]), and that Hartford would have been liable in any event to pay such excess. Accordingly, Civil Service must reimburse Hartford in the amount of $10,000\u2014the Civil Service policy limit\u2014as the share of the settlement which must be charged against the automobile policy. Similarly, by virtue of the same stipulation, Civil Service is liable for Hartford\u2019s costs and expenses (including attorney\u2019s fees) only in the same ratio that the limit of the Civil Service policy bears to the $15,000 settlement, rather than for the total amount of costs and expenses incurred by Hartford. (See, <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co., supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at pp. 279-281; <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Zurich Ins. Co. </em>(1961) 57 Cal.2d 27, 35-38 [17 Cal.Rptr. 12, 366 P.2d 455]; <em>Kapelus </em>v. <em>United Title Guaranty Co. </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 648, 653 [93 Cal.Rptr. 278]; <em>Travelers Ins.
