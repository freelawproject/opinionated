(See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 418.10.) An alternative writ was issued and after argument the matter was submitted on the petition, the exhibits filed therewith, and the memorandum of points and authorities in opposition to the petition, and the return filed by real party in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Petitioner contends: (1) that the record fails to show facts which would render it subject to a judgment in personam in this state; that the trial court is without jurisdiction to render a judgment against it (2) because the method used to perfect service of process was not in accordance with an international treaty governing service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents, and (3) because the notice given by the service of process failed to comply with due process of law because it was not written in the. language of the country to which it was mailed. A review of these contentions reveals that they are without merit. The alternative writ must be discharged and the petition for a peremptory writ denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">The complaint filed by real party in interest on August 20, 1971, reflects that this action arises out of a collision on December 24, 1970, between a motorcycle operated by real party in interest, the plaintiff in the action below and so referred to herein, and a vehicle allegedly negligently operated by the defendant Shirley Ann Hardesty; that at the time of the accident the plaintiff was wearing a Dias Safety Helmet with a designated serial number; and that he received severe personal injuries as a proximate result of the collision and of the failure of the helmet, for which he seeks to recover $1,500,000 general damages and special damages and loss of earnings according to proof. The first cause of action is directed' at the negligence of those who designed, manufactured, constructed, tested, repaired, sold, retailed, wholesaled, and distributed the safety helmet. The second cause of action is directed at the same defendants for breach of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>implied warranty that the saftey helmet was fit for the use for which it was designed and intended. The third cause of action, against the same defendants, is predicated upon the theory of product liability. The fourth cause of action is based upon the negligence of the, driver and those responsible for the operation of the other vehicle; and the fifth cause of action is grounded upon the concurrent negligence of all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Among the named defendants is D. S. <em>Kogaco </em>Company, Ltd., a corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The petitioner, Shoei Kako Co., Ltd., according to the declaration filed on its behalf, is a corporation organized and existing under and in accordance with the laws of Japan with its principal and main office in Tokyo. Admittedly petitioner assumed the responsibility for all debts and obligations of D. S. <em>Kagako Co., Ltd., </em>a corporation formerly organized and existing under and in accordance with the laws of Japan, with its principal and main office in Tokyo because the latter corporation was merged into the petitioning corporation after December 24, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Section 410.10 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: \u201cA court of this state may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of this state or of the United States.\u201d The basic underlying rule is found in <em>Internat. Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1945) 326 U.S. 310 [90 L.Ed. 95, 66 S.Ct. 154, 161 A.L.R. 1057] wherein the court referred to \u201csufficient contacts or ties with the state of the forum to make it reasonable and just, according to bur traditional conception of fair play and substantial justice, to permit the state to enforce the obligations which [the nonresident] has incurred there.\u201d (326 U.S. at p. 320 [90 L.Ed. at p. 104].) In recommending the passage of section 410.10 to the Legislature, the Judicial Council followed the format found in the Restatement Second Conflict of Laws (1971). (See Judicial Council of Cal., Annual Rep. (1969) Appendix II, at p. 68, pp. 85-91; and cf. Rest.2d Conflict of Laws, \u00a7\u00a741-42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">In an effort to meet the criteria so enunciated petitioner filed an affidavit, dated February 20, 1973, of an employee, who was also an employee of the merged corporation, in which he alleges that neither corporation has done business in, has qualified to do business in, has made or contracted to perform any contracts in, has made or contracted to supply services or things in,, has maintained any employees, agents or other representatives in, had any interest in real property in, has caused any tortious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>injury by act or omission in, has contracted to insure any person, property or risk located in, or has designated any agent for purposes of service of process within the State of California, or any states of the United States or its territories or possessions. He acknowledges that the sole and only contact within the State of California and any state of the United States or its territories of either corporation is an equitable interest of the corporations in one California corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The plaintiff relies upon proffered evidence which he claims shows that the petitioner\u2019s predecessor was subject to the jurisdiction of this state because it manufactured a defective helmet which caused an effect, the injuries suffered by plaintiff, within this state. In <em>Buckeye Boiler Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 893 [80 Cal.Rptr. 113, 458 P.2d 57], the court stated: \u201cA manufacturer whose products pass through the hands of one or more middlemen before reaching their ultimate users cannot disclaim responsibility for the total distribution pattern of the products. If the manufacturer sells its products in circumstances such that it knows or should reasonably anticipate that they will ultimately be resold in a particular state, it should be held to have purposefully availed itself of the market for its products in that state.\u201d (71 Cal.2d at p. 902.) It continued: \u201cWhen a plaintiff is allegedly injured in the forum state by a defect in a nonresident manufacturer\u2019s product, the question whether that product\u2019s use or purchase was an isolated instance or part of a continuous course of business in the state is relevant but not necessarily decisive in determining the existence or nonexistence of the requisite jurisdictional activity. [Citations.] Only if isolated use or purchase conclusively establishes lack of foreseeability that the product will enter the state is the isolation necessarily fatal to jurisdiction over the manufacturer; in that event there is a manifest lack of purposeful activity on the part of the manufacturer.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 904.

Cf. <em>Fisher </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number><em>Governor Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1959) 53 Cal.2d 222, 226 [1 Cal.Rptr, 1, 347 P.2d 1]; <em>Vibration Isolation Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Nat.

App.2d 610, 615-619 [81 Cal.Rptr. 320].)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">In order to trace that the helmet worn by plaintiff was one manufactured by petitioner\u2019s predecessor for general distribution in the United States, plaintiff presented a copy of a form of declaration purportedly executed by an officer of a testing corporation in which it is recited that the testing corporation\u2019s serial number found in the helmet involved \u201cwas issued to D. S. Kagaku Co., Ltd. on January 22, 1969.\u201d Although the signed original of this declaration does not appear in the record, petitioner apparently does not seriously question the accuracy of that declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Plaintiff also relies upon written answers to interrogatories filed by other parties to the action. On March 5, 1973, three days after argument on petitioner\u2019s motion but prior to the submission and decision of the matter, plaintiff filed the answers to interrogatories of the defendant Newman Company, a corporation from which it appears that certain helmets which that company sold to defendant Gemco Co. prior to plaintiff\u2019s accident were imported from Sunrise &amp; Co., a trading company which bought the helmets from D. S. Kagaku (now Shoei Kako Co.) Ltd., named as manufacturer in the answers, and that other helmets were purchased from Standard Sales, a Los Angeles importer, and from Nelson Sales, a Kansas City, Kansas importer. In the return filed with this court plaintiff has included what purports to be a verification of the foregoing answers executed and served and filed in May 1973 after the petition was filed in this court. Also attached to the return is what purports to be a copy of answers to interrogatories propounded by National Industries, d.b.a. Nelson Sales Co. to Gemco Stores.  The answers of one party elicited in response to interrogatories propounded by another cannot be used as evidence against a third party. <em>(Petersen </em>v. <em>City of Vallejo </em>(1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 757, 776 [66 Cal.Rptr. 776]; <em>Associates Discount Corp. </em>v. <em>Tobb Co. </em>(1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 541, 550-552 [50 Cal.Rptr. 738]. See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 2030, subd. (a) and 2016, subd. (d).) If it be assumed that the delayed verification of the Newman Company\u2019s answers transformed them into an affidavit, the fact remains that neither that verification nor the Gemco Stores\u2019 answers were in the record, before or available to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Stripped of unsigned declarations and extraneous answers there is little, if anything, to show that petitioner\u2019s predecessor had any contacts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>with this state. The declaration of plaintiff states that he purchased the helmet from Gemco Co. prior to the accident, and that it had the testing corporation\u2019s numbered sticker in it. At best, under petitioner\u2019s concession, the evidence shows that plaintiff purchased a helmet which had in it a label secured by petitioner\u2019s predecessor from the testing corporation which is also named as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">There is, however, further evidence to show that both petitioner and the merged corporation were doing business in the state, or at the least, doing acts in this state which were related to the distribution and sale of similar helmets. One Philip K. Huff executed a declaration in which he stated that prior to July 15, 1968, he was doing business in this state under the name D. S. Kagaku Co., and that on that date he incorporated and carried a business under the name D. S. Safety Htimet Corporation. The declaration of plaintiff\u2019s attorney reflects that on December 9, 1971, Huff, as vice-president of D. S. Safety Helmet Corporation gave him a card bearing that legend with a Los Angeles addresg for the corporation, and the further endorsement \u201cD. S. Kagaku Co., Ltd.\u201d with the Tokyo address of that corporation. An investigator for the plaintiff filed a dec-' laration that on January 13, 1973, at a motorcycle and accessories trade show in Long Beach there was in charge of a booth one Philip K. Huss <em>(sic, </em>Huff) which housed helmets manufactured by petitioner, and that \u201cHuss\u201d was advertising and selling the merchandise. Copies of the brochures distributed bear petitioner\u2019s name with its head office designated at the Tokyo address used by the merged corporation, and, as well, reference to Shoei Safety Helmet Corp. at the Los Angeles address used by Huff.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Although in view of the legal evidence suggested, plaintiff\u2019s actual presentation is shockingly incomplete, it must be viewed in the light of petitioner\u2019s failure to respond to the material presented by plaintiff, other than to question the method of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The fact that the helmet was found in channels of retail trade in this state, that there was an ostensible representative of the merged corpo^ ration within this state (without, however, proof of actual or ostensible authority from the merged corporation), and that this representative later appeared promoting the sales of the successor corporation, suggests, in the absence of more specific declarations to the contrary, that the merged corporation should have reasonably anticipated that its products would be resold in this state, and was in effect purposefully availing itself of the market for its products in this state when it sold them to Japanese ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>porters or American importers. The evidence sustains the implied finding of the trial court that there were sufficient contacts with this state to uphold the exercise of in personam jurisdiction if petitioner was given the notice required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Petitioner acknowledges that on or about January 9, 1973, it received a doc\u00fament entitled \u201cNotice and Acknowledgment of Receipt\u201d (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 415.30; and Cal. Rules of Court, rule 982(4) )<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> addressed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>D. S. <em>Kogaco </em>Co., Ltd. 2-9-2 Shimbashi Minato-Ku, Tokyo 105, Japan together with a copy of the complaint in the pending action.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Plaintiff produced a form of \u201cNotice and Acknowledgment of Receipt,\u201d in the form prescribed by statute and rule of court, dated January 4, 1973, and addressed to D. S. <em>Kogacu </em>Company Limited, sued herein as D. S. <em>Kogaco </em>Company Ltd.\u201d and bearing the legend \u201cYou Are Served Herein as Doe Two.\u201d The acknowledgment prescribed by statute and rule of court was not executed, but plaintiff produced what appears to be a form of international mail receipt written in the English and French languages. It contains the following, apparently inserted by the addressee: \u201cAddressee (Name or firm) D. S. <em>Kogaku Co. Ltd.. </em>Street and No. <em>2-9-2 Shinbashi </em>Place and Country <em>Minato-ku, Tokyo 105, Japan.\u201d </em>The legend \u201cThis receipt must be signed by the addressee or by a person authorized to do so by virtue of the regulations of the country of destination, or, if those regulations so provide, by the employee of the office of destination, and returned by the first mail directly to the sender\u201d is followed by the printed recital, \u201cThe article mentioned above was duly delivered. Date.\u201d In the appropriate blank there is inserted in script, undecipherable on the copy made available to the court, but allegedly, \u201cJan. 8, 1973.\u201d Following the form\u2019s printed \u201cSignature of the employee of the office of destination\u201d is a signature which appears to be \u201cMiyoka Aoki.\u201d This is followed by a postmark, apparently endorsed in connection with the return of the receipt, which indicates a mailing date of January 9, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">On February 1, 1973, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney addressed a registered letter to D. S. Kogacu Ltd., at the address referred to above. This letter alleges that the addressee was served with a copy of the summons and complaint on January 8, 1973. It states that the time within which to' answer expired January 29, 1973.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It threatened that unless a responsive pleading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>was filed by Febraary 15, 1973, the plaintiff would \u201ctake default and judgment against [the addressee] in the amount prayed for i.e., $1,500,000.00.\u201d On Febraary 16, 1973, petitioner mailed, and on Febraary 20, 1973, there was filed its \u201cNotice Of Motion To Quash Service Of Summons For Lack Of Personal Jurisdiction Or To Stay Or Dismiss Action On Ground Of Convenient Forum.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Section 413.10 provides in pertinent part, \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by statute, a summons sh\u00e1ll be served on a person: ... [11] (c) Outside the United States, as provided in this chapter or as directed by the court in which the action is pending, or, if the court before or after service finds that the service is reasonably calculated to give actual notice, as prescribed by the law of the place where the person is served or as directed by the foreign authority in response to a letter rogatory.\u201d Sections 415.30 and 415.40 (see fns. 1 and 2 above) are within the same chapter, and each, therefore, is an authorized method of effecting service outside the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Section 417.20 provides in pertinent part: \u201cProof that a summons was served on a person outside this state shall be made: [H] (a) If served in a manner specified in a statute of this state, as prescribed by Section 417.10, and if service is made by mail pursuant to Section 415.40, proof of service shall include evidence satisfactory to the court establishing actual delivery to the person to be served, by a signed return receipt or other evidence; . . .\u201d Section 417.10 provides with respect to service under section 415.30, \u201d... If service is made by mail pursuant to Section 415.30, proof of service shall include the acknowledgment of receipt of summons in the form provided by that section or other written acknowledgment of receipt of summons satisfactory to the court.\u201d (See also \u00a7 415.30, subd. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>(c), fn. 1 above.) No proof of a formal acknowledgement under section 415.30 was presented to the court. The court, however, under the statute could accept the signed return receipt as satisfactory evidence of actual delivery to the person to be served. (Cf. <em>Stamps </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 108, 110 [92 Cal.Rptr. 151].)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The adequacy of service \u201cso far as due process is concerned is dependent on whether or not the form of substituted service provided for such cases and employed is reasonably calculated to give him actual notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard. If it is, the traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice [citation] implicit in due process are satisfied.\u201d <em>(Milliken </em>v. <em>Meyer </em>(1940) 311 U.S. 457, at p. 463 [85 L.Ed. 278, at p. 283, 61 S.Ct 339, 132 A.L.R. 1357]. See also Rest. 2d (1971) Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 25.)  Here there is. no question but that petitioner has received actual notice and an opportunity to be heard.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It insists., however, that the notice was inadequate under international treaty.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The second clause of article VI of the United States Constitution provides as follows: \u201cThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d This state, therefore, cannot attempt to exercise jurisdiction if to do so would violate an international treaty. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pink </em>(1942) 315 U.S. 203, 230, 234 [86 L.Ed. 796, 817-818, 820, 62 S.Ct. 552]; <em>Hauenstein </em>v. <em>Lynham </em>(1879) 100 U.S. 483, 488-490 [25 L.Ed. 628, 630-631]; and <em>Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 208 Cal.App.2d 803, 819-820 [25 Cal.Rptr. 798].)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">On February 10, 1969, following prior ratification and proclamation, the United States of America became bound by the provisions of a multilateral international convention governing \u201cService Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents.\u201d (20 U.S.T. 361-367.) A declaration filed on behalf of petitioner indicates that the convention became effective, subject to certain objections noted below, as to Japan on or about July 27, 1970. The difficulties giving rise to the convention, which was agreed upon at The Hague, November 15, 1965, have been documented. (See Jones, <em>International Judicial Assistance </em>(1953) 62 Yale L.J. 515, 534-538; and Smit, <em>International Aspects of Federal Civil Procedure </em>(1961) 61 Colum.L.Rev. 1031, 1032-1043.)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Article 1 of the treaty provides: \u201cThe present Convention shall apply in all cases, in civil or commercial matters, where there is occasion to transmit a judicial or extrajudicial document for service abroad.\u201d Articles 2 through 6 establish a system whereby each contracting state shall organize and designate a \u201cCentral Authority\u201d which will undertake to receive, and to reject or to execute, and to certify requests for service of process from other contracting states. Other methods of service are recognized. Article 8 permits service to be effected upon persons abroad through diplomatic or consular agents unless opposition has been declared by the state involved to such service on others than nationals of the originating state. Article 9 permits service by forwarding documents for service through consular or diplomatic channels to authorities who are authorized to effect service. The controversy in this case revolves about the provisions of article 10, which reads: \u201cProvided the State of destination does not object, the present Convention shall not interfere with\u2014(a) the freedom to send judicial documents, by postal channels, directly to persons abroad, (b) the freedom of judicial officers, officials or other competent persons of the State of origin to effect service of judicial documents directly through the judicial officers, officials, or other competent persons of the State of destination, (c) the freedom of any person interested in a judicial proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>to effect service of judicial documents directly through the judicial officers, officials or other competent persons of the State of destination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">According to the record the Japanese Government\u2019s adherence to the convention recites, \u201cWe hereby declare that the employment of the methods of service and notice of Article 10 (b) and (c) shall be refused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Article 15 of the convention is the equivalent of our national due process concept, and it was so recognized in the Senate. (See, Cong. Rec., Senate proceedings (April 13, 1967) p. 404.) That section provides in part: \u201cWhere a writ of summons or an equivalent document had to be transmitted abroad for the purpose of service, under the provisions of the present Convention, and the defendant has not appeared, judgment shall not be given until it is established that\u2014(a) the document was served by a method prescribed by the internal law of the State addressed for the service of documents in domestic actions upon persons who are within its territory, or (b) the document was actually delivered to the defendant or to his residents by <em>another method provided for by this Convention, </em>and that in either of these cases the service or the delivery was effected in sufficient- time to enable the defendant to defend.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The plaintiff contends that since the provisions of subdivision (a) of article 10 are effective both as to the United States and Japan, he was free to send the summons and complaint by postal channels directly to the petitioner; and that if there was actual delivery to the corporate residence by the postal authorities, as is evidenced by the return receipt, the courts of this state would not be precluded from giving judgment against petitioner if it failed to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">On the other hand, petitioner points out that the convention persistently refers to \u201cservice\u201d (\u201cservice abroad,\u201d art. 1; \u201crequests for service,\u201d art. 2; \u201cdocument to be served,\u201d art. 3: \u201cserve the document or shall arrange to have it served,\u201d art. 5; \u201cthe document has been served,\u201d art. 6; \u201ceffect service of judicial documents,\u201d art. 8; \u201cforward documents, for the purpose of service,\u201d art. 9; \u201ceffect service of judicial documents,\u201d art. 10, subds; (b) and (c); \u201cfor the purpose of service of judicial documents,\u201d art. 11; \u201cservice of judicial documents,\u201d art. 12; \u201crequest for service,\u201d art. 13; \u201ctransmission of judicial documents for service,\u201d art. 14; \u201ctransmitted, abroad for the purpose of service,\u201d art. 15 and art. 16.) Petitioner notes that subdivision (a) of article 10 refers to \u201cthe freedom to <em>send </em>judicial documents by postal channels, directly to persons abroad,\u201d (italics added) as distinguished from the transmission abroad for the purposes of service. It claims that the subsection does not authorize service by mail if actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>delivery is effected, but that it merely authorizes the giving of notices and exchange of other judicial documents after jurisdiction is acquired. It draws an analogy between service of summons as provided in chapter 4 (\u00a7\u00a7 413.10-417.40) of title 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and chapter 5 (\u00a7\u00a7 1010-1020) of title 14 of that code which refers to notices and filing and service of papers, and expressly authorizes service by mail in such cases (see \u00a7\u00a7 1012, 1013 and 1013 a). The latter provisions expressly do not apply to the service of summons (\u00a7 1016).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Although there is some merit to the proposed distinction it is outweighed by consideration of the entire scope of the convention. It purports to deal with the subject of service abroad of judicial documents. The reference to \u201cthe freedom to send judicial documents by postal channels, directly to persons abroad\u201d would be superfluous unless it was related to the sending of such documents for the purpose of service. The mails are open to all. Moreover, the reference appears in the context of other alternatives to the use of the \u201cCentral Authority\u201d created by the treaty. If it be assumed that the purpose of the convention is to establish one method to avoid the difficulties and controversy attend\u00e1nt to the use of other methods (see Miller, <em>International Cooperation </em>(1965) 49 Minn.L.Rev. 1069, 1075-1086; Jones, <em>supra, 62 </em>Yale L.J. 515, 534-538; and Smit, <em>supra, </em>61 Colum.L.Rev. 1031, 1040-1043), it does not necessarily follow that other methods may not be used if effective proof of delivery can be made. The provisions of article 5 provide that \u201cunless [it] is incompatible with the law of the State addressed . . . the document may always be served by delivery to an addressee who accepts it voluntarily.\u201d The return receipt is some evidence of this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The provisions of subdivision (i) of rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Procedure (see fn. 4 above) were promulgated January 21, 1963 to be effective July 1, 1963. (374 U.S. 865; 4 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure (1969) \u00a7 1007 at p. 62, fn. 26, and accompanying text.) At that time, under the provisions of the governing statute, the rules could not be effective until reported to Congress which then had an opportunity to act. (See 28 U.S.C.A., former \u00a7 2072, rev. 1966.) The purpose of the rule was to expedite service of process abroad. (See Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes for subd. (i) of rule 4, as published in (1969) 47 F.R.D. 73, 117-120; Kaplan, <em>Amendments of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, </em>1961-1963(1) (1964) 77 Harv.L.Rev. 601, 635-637; and Comment (1964) 62 Mich.L.Rev. 1375, 1377-1382.) If petitioner\u2019s interpretation of the treaty is accepted it means that the Senate in ratifying the treaty April 14, 1967, intended to abrogate what it had impliedly approved four years earlier. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>It is more reasonable to infer that in approving subdivision (a) of article 10 the Senate intended to retain service by mail, as provided in subdivision (i) of rule 4, as an effective method of service of process in a foreign country unless that country objected to those provisions. Moreover, if the treaty abrograted the provisions of subdivision (i) of rule 4 which permits service of process abroad by mail when there is proof of delivery, it is strange that there has been no change in the provisions of that subdivision despite other revisions of the rules which have been made since February 10, 1969, when the treaty became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Finally it may be noted that it does not appear that service by mail with evidence of delivery is not \u201ca method prescribed by the internal law of [Japan] for the service of documents in domestic actions upon persons who are within its territory. . . .\u201d (Art. 15, subd. (a).) From all that appears in the record the internal law of Japan permits transmission by postal channels of documents coming from abroad for service within its territory.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The failure to object to the provisions of subdivision (a) of article 10 may be so construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Therefore, it is concluded that the provisions of the convention do not prevent the exercise of jurisdiction of the courts of this state in actions where the court has jurisdiction over a party arising from the nature of the claim asserted and notice has been given by service by mail accompanied by a receipt for delivery. It is recognized that this court cannot render an interpretation of the treaty which will bind the courts of Japan in the event plaintiff, if he obtains a judgment against petitioner, seeks to enforce it through the courts in that nation. Nevertheless, an interpretation must be made at this time, and the conclusion of this court is consistent with both the letter and the spirit of the convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">In <em>Julen </em>v. <em>Larson </em>(1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 325 [101 Cal.Rptr. 796], this state refused to enforce a default judgment taken in a Swiss court against a local defendant, who presumably had been doing business in Switzerland, because the documents forwarded to him by certified- mail by the local Swiss consul were entirely written in the German language and were not described in the forwarding letter. The court concluded: \u201cSince in the present case no informative notice was given in English, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>conclude that the documents and correspondence served on defendant did not give him sufficient notice of the pending Swiss action and consequently the Swiss court never acquired the basis on which to adjudicate the claim of personal jurisdiction over defendant.\u201d (25 Cal.App.3d at p. 330. See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Harlow </em>(1935) 9 Cal.App.2d 643, 645 [50 P.2d 1052].)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Petitioner urges that the service of process should be quashed because the documents transmitted by mail were not written in the Japanese language. Significantly in <em>Julen </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>the court recognized the convention heretofore reviewed. (See part II above.) It noted the provisions of the convention which provide for use of the English or French language.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Admittedly in this case service was not made through a Central Authority designated by the receiving state under the convention, but by means of an alternative method. Plaintiff, therefore, cannot rely upon the authorization of English language contained in the treaty, although it may be persuasive on the issue of whether the recipient legally did have actual notice. The record does show by the declaration of a qualified international lawyer that in his experience \u201call Japanese companies involved in trade with other .countries carry on correspondence with enterprises in such other countries relating to such trade in the English language, and almost all Japanese companies involved in trade with other countries are accustomed to receiving communications in English and have facilities for the interpretation and translation of the same.\u201d The record does show that the recipient executed the postal receipt which was written in English <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>and French. Petitioner also apparently authorized the use of brochures printed in English to further sales of its products in this state. The special appearance in these proceedings bespeaks that the purport of the documents was understood. Under these circumstances there was neither a lack of due process of law nor a violation of the letter or spirit of the treaty.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The alternative writ is discharged. The petition for peremptory writ of mandate is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Molinari, P. J., and Elkington, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 28, 1973, and petitioner\u2019s application for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied October 3,1973.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Code of Civil Procedure section 415.30 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">\u201c(a) A summons may be served by mail as provided in this section.
