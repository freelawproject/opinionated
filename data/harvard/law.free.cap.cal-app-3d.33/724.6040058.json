(Pen. Code, \u00a7 207), in count II, with forcing Sharon T. to commit an act of oral copulation (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288 a), in count III, with kidnaping one Karen G. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 207), in count IV, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>with raping Karen G. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261, subd. 2) and with being armed with a deadly weapon, and in count V, with raping one Marilyn K. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261, subd. 2). Defendant pleaded not guilty, and defendant\u2019s motion to sever the counts for trial was denied. The information was then amended to add count VI, in which defendant was charged with assaulting Marilyn K. with the intent to commit rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7 220). Defendant pleaded not guilty to count VI, and defendant\u2019s motion pursuant to Penal Code section 995 to set aside count I and count III was denied. Defendant was tried before a jury, and at the conclusion of the prosecution\u2019s case, defendant moved for acquittal on count I, count HI, count IV, and count V. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1118.1.) Defendant\u2019s motion was granted as to count I and count HI, but was denied as to count IV and count V. Later in the trial, the People moved the court to vacate the court\u2019s \u201cprior order on 1118, dismissing Count I and Count III.\u201d The court \u201cgrant[ed] the motion to vacate the order previously made with regard to Count I,\u201d but denied the People\u2019s motion as to count III. The jury found defendant guilty of count I, count II, count V, and count VI. The jury further found that defendant was guilty of count IV, that defendant was also guilty of \u201cviolation of Section 220 P.C., Assault With Intent to Commit Rape, a felony, a lesser but necessarily included offense than that charged in COUNT IV,\u201d and that defendant was \u201carmed at the time of the commission of the offense as contained in count IV . . . .\u201d Proceedings were suspended as to count VI, and defendant was sentenced to the terms prescribed by law as to count I, count II, count IV, and count V, with the sentences on count I and count II to run consecutively, and with the sentences on count IV and count V to run concurrently. Penal Code section 12022 was found to be applicable to count IV. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Defendant first contends that the \u201ccourt erred in not severing the six counts in the information.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree. Penal Code section 954 provides in part: \u201cAn accusatory pleading may charge two or more different offenses connected together in their commission, or . . '. two or more different offenses of the same class of crimes or offenses, under separate counts . . .; provided, that the- court in which a case is triable, in the interests of justice and for good cause shown, may in its discretion order that the different offenses or counts ... be tried separately . . . .\u201d Here, count I and count H (the crimes against Sharon T.) were \u201cconnected to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>gether in their commission.\u201d Count III and count IV (the crimes against Karen G.) were connected together in their commission, and count V and count VI (the crimes against Marilyn K.) were connected together in their commission. Likewise, the crimes against Sharon T. (count I and count II), Karen G. (count III and count IV), and Marilyn K. were \u201cof the same class of crimes or offenses . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rhoden, </em>6 Cal.3d 519, 524-525 [99 Cal.Rptr. 751, 492 P.2d 1143]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Shells, </em>4 Cal.3d 626, 631-632 [94 Cal.Rptr. 275, 483 P.2d 1227]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Conrad, </em>31 Cal.App.3d 308, 314-316 [107 Cal.Rptr. 421]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Van De Wouwer, </em>91 Cal.App.2d 633, 639-640 [205 P.2d 693].) We therefore find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s refusal to grant defendant\u2019s motion to sever.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Defendant next contends that the trial court erred \u201cin reinstating count I after having dismissed it pursuant to Penal Code section 1118.1.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We must agree. At the close of the prosecution\u2019s case, defendant\u2019s counsel told the court: \u201cI\u2019d like to make an 1118 motion without the presence of the jury as to several matters, if I may.\u201d After argument on behalf of both defendant and the People, the court granted defendant\u2019s motion as to count I and count III, but. denied the motion as to count IV and count V. The trial court\u2019s granting of defendant\u2019s motion as to count I and count III was, in effect, an \u201corder [for] the entry of a judgment of acquittal\u201d as to each of those counts. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1118.1.) Therefore, since \u201c[t]he rendition of judgment is the oral pronouncement\u201d (Witkin, Cal. Criminal Procedure, \u00a7 609 at p. 602), and since \u201c[a] judgment of acquittal entered pursuant to the provisions of Section . . . 1118.1 . . . is a bar to any other prosecution for the same offense\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 11.18.2), defendant\u2019s conviction as to count I must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Defendant contends next that the record does not contain substantial evidence to support his identification as to either count II (forcing Sharon T. to commit an act of oral copulation) or' count IV (raping Karen G.). We disagree. Sharon T. testified that at approximately 4:45 p.m., just prior to her attack, she \u201cwalked by\u201d her assailant and was within \u201ca couple of yards away from him.\u201d Sharon T. again saw her assailant at the time of the attack, and Sharon T. testified that she was \u201cpositive\u201d that it was defendant who attacked her. Further, Sharon T. testified that her assailant\u2019s lower right arm was marked with a tattoo that depicted a red heart with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>the word \u201cRobbie or Bobbie\u201d inscribed above the heart. At trial, defendant displayed his right forearm which showed the word \u201cBobbie\u201d inscribed above a heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Karen G. testified and was asked: \u201cAre you able to identify the man who did this to you?\u201d Karen G. replied: \u201cNot distinctly.\u201d Karen G. was then asked: \u201cDo you see anyone in this courtroom who looks familiar?\u201d Karen G. responded: \u201cYes.\u201d Karen G. was then asked if she \u201ccould . . . point him out,\u201d and Karen G. pointed to defendant. In addition, Karen G. testified that her assailant had abducted her to a place \u201cbehind [a] curtain\u201d in an apartment garage, that the rape had been committed behind that curtain, and that during the course of the rape \u201canother man came up, and then I started screaming, and then the [assailant] got up and ran.\u201d One Steven Yankowski testified for the prosecution that he was the man who had pulled back the curtain, and that he had seen \u201ca man on the floor and [Karen G.] was on top of him. . . . The man got up and ran past me, pushed me, and ran past me.\u201d Yankowski was able \u201cto look at him straight in the face.\u201d Yankowski was \u201cabsolutely certain\u201d that defendant was the man who had run away. This testimony of Sharon T., Karen G., and Steven Yankowski is clearly substantial evidence in support of defendant\u2019s convictions as to count II and count IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Defendant next contends that the trial court committed prejudicial error in admitting into evidence 1) certain \u201cmug shots\u201d of defendant, and 2) prosecution testimony to the effect that at a time prior to trial, defendant had suffered the suspension of his driver\u2019s license. Specifically, defendant contends that the photographs and the testimony were evidence of defendant\u2019s \u201cprior misconduct,\u201d and that \u201cprior specific instances of misconduct by a criminal defendant is generally inadmissible to prove conduct on a specific occasion.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1101.) In opposition, the People argue that this evidence was introduced for the sole purpose of impeaching certain of defendant\u2019s testimony. We, however, need not resolve this dispute, for even if we assume arguendo that this evidence was admitted for the single improper purpose of demonstrating prior misconduct, nonetheless, \u201cit is [not] reasonably probable that a result more favorable to [defendant] would have been reached in the absence of the error.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Defendant next argues that the \u201cfinding that [defendant] was armed with a deadly weapon [as to count IV] was error as a matter of law.\u201d We disagree. The weapon in question is a three-pronged metal fork.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cA deadly weapon is one likely to produce death or great bodily injury\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fuqua, </em>58 Cal. 245, 247), and \u201c[wjhether a particular weapon is a deadly weapon is a question of fact\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>255 Cal.App.2d 183, 190 [63 Cal.Rptr. 184]). Further, there exists a \u201cdistinction between instrumentalities which are \u2018weapons\u2019 in the; strict sense of the word, such as guns, dirks, etc., and those instrumentalities which are not weapons in that sense, such as ordinary razors, pocket-knives or other sharp objects. With reference to the latter classification . . . : \u2018When it appears . . . that [such] an instrumentality ... is capable of being used in a \u201cdangerous or deadly\u201d manner, and it <em>may be fairly inferred from the evidence that its possessor intended on a particular occasion to use it as a weapon should the circumstances require, we believe that its character as a \u201cdangerous or deadly weapon\u201d may be thus established, at least for the purposes of that occasion.\u2019\u2019 [People </em>v. <em>Raleigh, </em>128 Cal.App. 105, 108-109 (16 P.2d 752).] (Italics ours.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em>25 Cal.2d 177, 189 [153 P.2d 315].)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Finally, defendant contends, and the People concede, that defendant should not have been convicted of <em>both </em>count V and count VI because count VI (assault with the intent to commit rape) is a lesser included offense of count V (rape), and defendant cannot be convicted of both the charged crime and a lesser included offense of the charged crime. We agree. \u201cA person cannot be convicted of both the included and the greater offense because, in essence, only one offense is committed.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Doolittle, </em>23 Cal.App.3d 14, 19 [99 Cal.Rptr. 810]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Greer, </em>30 Cal.2d 589, 600-601 [184 P.2d 512].) Count VI must therefore be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The judgment is reversed as to count I and count VI. In regard to count IV, we note that the jury returned two different verdicts : (1) a verdict finding defendant guilty of raping Karen G. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261, subd. 2); and (2) a verdict finding defendant guilty of having assaulted Karen G. with the intent to rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7 220). Again, a defendant cannot be convicted of both the greater and the lesser included offense, and the judgment is therefore reversed to the extent that it reflects that \u201cdefendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>[was] duly found guilty ... of the crime of . . . Violation of Section 220, Penal Code, a felony, a lesser but necessarily included offense than that charged in Count IV . ...\u201d In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Kaus, P. J., and Ashby, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\">The record on appeal shows that defendant\u2019s motion to sever was made prior to the time that count VI was added to the information. The People, however,' have not taken exception to defendant\u2019s having characterized his motion as a motion to sever six counts, and we, therefore, will treat defendant\u2019s motion as a continuing objection to his being tried in a single trial on any combination of two or more of the counts charged in the information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\">\u201cIn a case tried before a jury, the court on motion of the defendant . . . , at the close of the evidence on either side and before the case is submittd to the jury for decision, shall order the entry of a judgment of acquittal of one or more of the offenses charged in the accusatory pleading if the evidence then before the court is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses on appeal.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1118.1.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b611-7\">In regard to the photographs, defendant is apparently arguing that the photographs suggested to the jury that defendant had had some prior association with the law, and, therefore, that defendant was guilty of having committed some undefined act of prior misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b612-6\">In describing the weapon for identification, the prosecutor characterized the weapon as a \u201cthree-pronged type of instrument.\u201d In moving to have the weapon admitted into evidence, the prosecutor described the weapon as \u201cthe fork.\u201d Karen G., the victim of count IV, testified that the weapon was a \u201cmetal prong\u201d with \u201cthree prongs on it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
