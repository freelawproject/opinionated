Following unsuccessful appeals to the board of appeals and to the city council, petitioner sought a writ of mandate in the court below to compel issuance of the permit, alleging its application complied with all applicable statutes, ordinances and regulations and that the building director\u2019s administrative order was invalid. Respondents answered denying that petitioner\u2019s application complied with legal requirements for the issuance of a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">At the outset of the trial, the court exacted from the parties a stipulation that only two issues were before the court: (1) Whether the building director had \u201cdiscretion\u201d to impose restrictions on the size of aluminum electrical conductors which could be used and (2) if he had such \u201cdiscretion,\u201d whether he exercised it arbitrarily or capriciously. The court answered the first question in the affirmative. Following that ruling, petitioner elected not to try the second issue but instead stipulated that assuming the correctness of the court\u2019s resolution of the first issue, the building director did not abuse his \u201cdiscretion\u201d in issuing his administrative order. Judgment was thereupon entered denying the petition. Petitioner appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">The thrust of petitioner\u2019s argument is as follows: The 1970 amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>ments to the State Housing Law (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 17910 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> mandated statewide uniformity in the promulgation and enforcement of building code regulations by requiring the State Commission of Housing and Community Development (State Housing. Commission) and local entities to adopt and enforce the requirements of the uniform codes specified in section 17922, including the National Electrical Code, 1968 edition (hereinafter N. E. Code);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the N. E. Code permits use of aluminum electrical conductors sizes 2 through 12; the state law and regulations issued thereunder have thus preempted the field of building regulations and the building director\u2019s administrative order is therefore invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">For reasons which follow, we have concluded petitioner\u2019s attack upon the building director\u2019s order must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Preliminarily, we shall review the pertinent provisions of the State Housing Law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Prior to the 1970 amendments, the State Housing Law empowered local agencies to enact building regulations imposing standards \u201cequal to or greater\u201d than those promulgated by the state (\u00a7 17951) and the state statutes and regulations were made inapplicable in any city having and enforcing such local regulations (\u00a7 19825). State building requirements therefore did not preempt the field of building regulation. <em>(City of Bakersfield </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>64 Cal.2d 93, 100-101 [48 Cal.Rptr. 889, 410 P.2d 393].)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">In 1970 the Legislature amended section 17951 by deleting the provision authorizing local agencies to adopt ordinances imposing standards \u201cequal to or greater\u201d than those promulgated by the state, repealed section 19825 and made other substantial revisions in the State Housing Law. (Stats. 1970, ch. 1436.) The revisions directed the State Housing Commission to adopt rules and regulations imposing \u201cthe same requirements\u201d as are contained in the various uniform building codes, including the N. E. Code (\u00a7 17922), and required every city and county to adopt ordinances or regulations imposing the same requirements within one year after the effective date of the 1970 amendments (Nov. 23, 1970). (\u00a7 17958.)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">Pursuant to the legislative mandate, the State Housing Commission adopted a regulation providing that all buildings for human habitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>\u201cshall comply with electrical requirements contained in the [N. E. Code] . . . as applicable,\u201d and that its provisions \u201cshall be enforced by the Department or the local government agency so designated as the enforcement agency in division 13, part 1.5, .Health and Safety Code.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 25, \u00a7 1076.)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The N. E. Code provides in pertinent part: \u201cNonmetallic sheathed cable shall be an approved Type NM or NMC in sizes No. 14 through 2 AWG with copper conductors and in sizes No. 12 through 2 with aluminum conductors. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Petitioner urges that the changes wrought by the 1970 amendments clearly indicate a legislative intention to preempt the field of building regulations and to withdraw from local agencies the power (except to the limited extent authorized by \u00a7\u00a7 17958.5<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 17958.7<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>) to enact regulations imposing standards which differ from or exceed state regulations. It directs our attention to the legislative declaration that \u201cuniformity of codes throughout the State ... is a matter of satewide interest and concern since it would reduce housing costs and increase the efficiency of private housing construction industry and its production.\u201d (Stats. 1970, ch. 1436, \u00a7 7.) In light of the history of the 1970 amendments and the declaration of policy, petitioner urges that the Legislature has mandated uniformity in enforcement of building regulations. It is therefore urged that a local enforcement officer has no \u201cdiscretion\u201d to disapprove use of any material covered by the uniform codes specified in section 17922.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>To phrase the issue in terms of \u201cdiscretion\u201d in the abstract is to state the question too broadly. A fair reading of the limited record before us reveals that petitioner\u2019s application for a permit was disapproved because the building director had determined that existing methods of terminating the proscribed sizes of aluminum wire at branch circuits in residential structures, including the method of \u201cpigtailing\u201d copper to aluminum, are unsafe.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, the precise question presented by petitioner\u2019s attack upon the building director\u2019s order is whether a local enforcement officer may impose restrictions on use of aluminum electrical conductors in residential structures where such restrictions are determined to be necessary to safeguard life and property.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To state the issue is to answer it.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The State Housing Law cannot be read as an inflexible command to a local enforcement officer to willy nilly approve use of a material or method, even though he has determined it to be hazardous, simply because it is code permitted. The provisions of the N. E. Code indicate its drafters did not contemplate the code specifications to be so construed. They caution that the code was only designed to provide \u201cbasic minimum provisions considered necessary for safety\u201d so that compliance \u201cwill result in an installation essentially free from hazard but not necessarily efficient, convenient or adequate for good service or future expansion of electrical use\u201d (N. E. Code, \u00a7 90-1, subd. (b)): they warn the code is not intended \u201cas a design specification nor an instruction manual for untrained persons\u201d (N. E. Code, \u00a7 90-1, subd. (c));<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> they included provisions for the examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>and testing of code covered items for safety (N. E. Code, \u00a7 90-8);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and they provided that \u201cconductors and equipment required or permitted by [the] Code shall be acceptable only when approved\u201d (N. E. Code, \u00a7 110-2), defining \u201capproved\u201d as \u201cacceptable to the authority enforcing [the] Code.\u201d (N. E. Code, \u00a7 100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The foregoing provisions of the N. E. Code reveal its draftsmen did not intend to foreclose safety tests of materials or methods covered by the code and disapproval of those found unsafe; they did not contemplate blind enforcing authority approval of the use of a method or material simply because it is covered by the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Petitioner contends, however, that the Department of Housing and Community Development (Department) is the only agency empowered to disapprove use of code covered material because it is the body empowered to administer and enforce the rules and regulations. While the Department is vested with <em>supervisory </em>powers over the administration and enforcement of building regulations, the day-to-day administration and enforcement of the regulations are vested in the local building department. Section 17921 provides <em>\u201cexcept as hereinafter provided\u201d </em>the Department shall enforce the rules and regulations. (Italics supplied.) Section 17960 under chapter 5 entitled \u201cAdministration and Enforcement\u201d provides \u201c[t]he building department of every city or county shall enforce within its jurisdiction all the provisions of this part and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder ...\u201d Moreover, the act provides that enforcement by the Department shall not be initiated except for nonenforcement by a local entity and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>then only after notice, opportunity to be heard, and decision by the commission. (\u00a7 17952.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Petitioner contends inferentially that the provisions of the N. E. Code to which we have referred and which are contained in articles entitled \u201cIntroduction,\u201d \u201cDefinitions,\u201d and \u201cGeneral\u201d were not promulgated by the State Housing Commission as part of the state regulations. It is urged the Legislature only intended the commission to adopt the \u201ctechnical\u201d or \u201csubstantive\u201d provisions. Assuming the Legislature so intended (see 55 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 157, 161), the N. E. Code provisions to which we have referred can hardly be characterized as \u201cadministrative\u201d or \u201cclerical.\u201d The purpose the code is designed to serve, definitions of the terms used, and the \u201cGeneral\u201d provisions all bear directly upon the proper interpretation and application of the technical provisions. They are substantive, not administrative or clerical.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Petitioner strenuously urges that a, decision upholding the building director\u2019s order in the case at bench would seriously undermine the uniformity policy mandated by the Legislature,  While statewide uniformity in the adoption and enforcement of building regulations was unquestionably one of the objectives of the 1970 amendments to the State Housing Law, a correlative, if not the paramount, policy underlying the building regulations is the protection of public health and safety, (\u00a7 \u00a7 17921, 17964.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>It would be unreasonable to assume the Legislature intended that considerations of safety must yield to the policy of uniformity.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Petitioner seeks to raise a contention not raised in the court below. It contends the building director\u2019s order was void because it was adopted without complying with the provisions of sections 17958.5 and 17958.7 pertaining to the power of a local entity to make changes or modifications in building regulations in order to meet local conditions. By virtue of the stipulations limiting the issues in the court below, petitioner is precluded from raising that question for the first time on appeal. In any event, the contention is without merit. The power of the building director to impose the restriction was not dependent upon a change or modification in the N. E. Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">We conclude that the State Housing Law and regulations* promulgated thereunder did not invalidate the building director\u2019s administrative directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The city contends that apart from the provisions of the N. E. Code, the building director was authorized to issue his directive under the provisions of the city Electrical Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The city enacted an ordinance on September 20, 1971 (effective Oct. 20, 1971) adopting the N. E. Code, subject to \u201camendments and additions.\u201d The additional provisions which are set out in the margin below<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> authorize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the building director to deny permits for electrical work where the material, equipment or method is reasonably determined by him to be hazardous or dangerous to persons or property or will cause a condition which is hazardous or dangerous.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Petitioner contends that by virtue of section 17958, the uniform codes named in section 17922 have superseded all local regulations on the subject, including the additional provisions of the city code.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The Attorney General has held, however, and we agree, that while the State Housing Commission is not empowered to adopt rules and regulations on subjects not covered by the uniform codes, section 17958 directing cities to adopt regulations \u201cimposing the same requirements\u201d as are contained in the uniform codes does not preclude cities from adopting additional regulations on subjects not covered by departmental regulations. (55 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 157.) The Attorney General stated: \u201cMoreover, a city or county is empowered to make changes or modifications in the requirements contained in regulations adopted by the Department when it determines that such changes or modifications are reasonably necessary because of local conditions. Section 17958.5. The local appeals boards are given the final power to determine whether rules or regulations which have been adopted by the Department are reasonable when applied in the local areas. Section 17925. The legislative sensitivity to, and deference for, local conditions and needs are inconsistent with an interpretation of section 17958 which restricts the cities and counties from adopting ordinances and regulations on particular subjects which, although not covered by the regulations adopted by the Department, may nevertheless have considerable local significance.\u201d (55 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 157, 160.)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Many of the additional provisions of the city Electrical Code relate to subjects not expressly covered by the N. E. Code and state regulations such as duties of the building director, form and content of applications for permits, and methods of handling unusual problems or conditions not contemplated by the N. E. Code. Those provisions of the city code are therefore consistent with section 17958 and valid. The power granted to the building director to deny permits where the electrical wiring or equipment is determined by him to result in a condition which is hazardous or dangerous to persons or property is, as we have explained earlier, also consistent with the provisions of the State Housing Law and the N. E. Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">We conclude that under both the N. E. Code as promulgated by the State Housing Commission and the city and the additional provisions of the city code, the building director was empowered to disapprove petitioner\u2019s application on the basis that use of aluminum electrical conductors of the size specified will create a condition hazardous to persons and property.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Gardner, P.

E. Code compelled the building director to approve use of aluminum electrical conductors sizes 12 through 2, petitioner misquotes, no doubt through inadvertence, section 336-2 of the electrical code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>as reading \u201cNonmetallic sheathed cable <em>shall be approved </em>... in sizes No. 12 through 2 with aluminum conductors.\u201d (Italics supplied.)

This occurs because initial wiring did not provide for increases in use of electricity. For this reason it is recommended that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>initial installation be adequate and that reasonable provisions for system changes be made as may be required for future increase in the use of electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">\u201c(c) This Code is not intended as a design specification nor an instruction manual for untrained persons.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Section 90-8 of the N.

This avoids the necessity for repetition of examinations by different examiners, frequently with inadequate facilities for such work, and the confusion that would result from conflicting reports as to the suitability of devices and materials examined for a given purpose. It is the intent of the Code that factory-installed internal wiring or the construction of equipment need not be inspected at the time of installation of the equipment except to detect alterations or damage if the equipment has been listed by an electrical testing laboratory, which is nationally recognized as having the facilities described above and which requires suitability for installation in accordance with the Code.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Section 17952 provides: \u201cIn the event of nonenforcement of this part or the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, such provisions or rules and regulations shall be enforced by the department in any such city or county after the department\" has given written notice to the governing body of such city or county of a violation of this part or the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder and the city or county has failed to initiate proceedings to secure correction of the violation within 30 days of the date of such notice.

Listing or labeling, as conforming to the standards of the Underwriter\u2019s Laboratories, Inc., as approved by the United States Bureau of Standards, or other similar institutions of nationally-recognized standing, shall be prima facie evidence of conformity with approved standards of safety to life and property.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b483-9\">The city Electrical Code was further amended in April 1972 by the addition of the following section: \u201c8221.5.1 Use of Aluminum Conductors Prohibited, (a) The City Council finds that the acts prohibited by subsection (b) of this section are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>hazardous or dangerous to persons or property and declares that the public health, safety and welfare require such prohibition, (b) It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation either as an owner, architect, contractor, artisan or otherwise, to terminate or to connect to any other conductor, any solid size No. 6 American wire gauge or smaller aluminum conductor in residential construction branch circuit wiring.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The city argues that the foregoing, amendment is not in conflict with the provisions of the N. E. Code or the State Housing Law. In view of the fact that the amendment was not in force at the time petitioner\u2019s permit was denied, its validity is not properly before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Qn the face of it, section 17958 appears to provide that if a city fails to adopt ordinances or regulations imposing the <em>same requirements </em>as contained in the regulations adopted under section 17922, the regulations adopted under the latter section would by operation of law become applicable in such city. The Attorney General, however, has interpreted section 17958 \u201cas having application <em>only </em>to the extent that a given building activity to be regulated is not already regulated by an existing city or county building regulation enacted on or before November 23, 1970. To otherwise interpret section 17958 would be to ignore the plain language of the proviso contained in section 17958.7.\u201d (54 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 87, 88-89; original italics.) The Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of section 17958 and 17958.7 was approved in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>30 Cal.App.3d 282, 290, 291 [106 Cal.Rptr. 260].</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">The Huntington Beach Electrical Code, however, was adopted after, not before, November 23, 1970, and therefore cannot be upheld under the proviso in section 17958,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
