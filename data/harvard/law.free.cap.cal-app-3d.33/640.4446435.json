Petitioners (hereafter named plaintiffs), on behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated (hereafter unnamed plaintiffs), brought a class action against defendant claiming damages for trespass and nuisance and seeking a permanent injunction. The complaint alleges that named and unnamed plaintiffs comprise a class of approximately 1,500 persons who own boats which are moored in King Harbor in the City of Redondo Beach; that in the course of the normal operation of a steam power plant by defendant great quantities of particulate pollutants are discharged into the air and fall upon and cause damage to the boats owned by members of the class. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Plaintiffs pray for compensatory damages in the approximate sum of $5,000,000, for exemplary and punitive damages in the sum of $5,000,000, and for a permanent injunction. In its answer defendant denied the material allegations of the complaint and alleged certain affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Defendant commenced discovery proceedings and, pursuant thereto, named plaintiffs furnished defendant with a list of names, last known addresses and telephone numbers of the approximately 500 unnamed plaintiffs who were members of the King Harbor Boat Owners. Association. From that list defendant selected 20 names and noticed the taking of their depositions. Defendant took the position that since the unnamed plaintiffs were persons \u201cfor whose immediate benefit\u201d the action or proceeding was being prosecuted, service of subpoenas upon them was unnecessary under the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure, section 2019, subdivision (a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The named plaintiffs moved for a protective order (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a72019, subd. (b)(1)), which the trial court granted in part, stating: \u201cThe particular ground of the ruling is based upon the fact that subpoenas were not issued to the [unnamed plaintiff] deponents and, at least for the purposes of noticing their depositions, I am treating them as though they were nonparty deponents. [$] Now, I recognize that they are in what might be characterized as a hybrid classification, at least, but for purposes of this deposition, the present ruling is based upon this court\u2019s opinion that it is appropriate and fair and a proper interpretation of the discovery statutes to require that the persons who have been named as members of the class, but who are not named plaintiffs, should be subpoenaed rather than have their depositions noticed without subpoena. [10 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 fflt is an unwarranted and improper burden upon counsel for the plaintiff to require that he produce them [unnamed plaintiffs] on pain of a forfeiture to those persons if the counsel cannot produce them.\u201d The trial court\u2019s protective order was upheld by the Supreme Court in <em>Southern California Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>7 Cal.3d 832 [103 Cal.Rptr. 709, 500 P.2d 621].</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Subsequently, defendant noticed a \u201cMotion to Allow Service of Alternative Subpoena Upon Unnamed Class Members,\u201d the trial court\u2019s ruling with respect to that motion being the matter which is now before this court. In essence, defendant\u2019s motion sought issuance of deposition subpoenas to unnamed plaintiffs, each subpoena to be accompanied by a letter informing the prospective deponent of the nature of the underlying class action and of defendant\u2019s right by virtue of the subpoena to depose the served unnamed plaintiff. The subpoena was also to be accompanied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>by a \u201cDeclaration Waiving Claim\u201d and a stamped, return-addressed envelope.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion and issued its written order as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">\u201cIt Is Ordered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">\u201c1.

It is further alleged that the deposit of this fallout on the boats damages them by staining the decks and flat surfaces, staining and destroying sails and canvas covers, and in other ways. It is further alleged that the owners of these boats suffer damage resulting from the fallout, because the owners are required to expend time, labor and money cleaning and repairing their boats and have been deprived of the use and enjoyment of the boats.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">\u201cEdison has denied these allegations and has denied that it is causing any damage to the boats or their owners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">\u201cIf the named plaintiffs are successful in this action, all of the persons who are then members of the class may be entitled to receive a monetary recovery in compensation for the damages described above. Unless injunctive relief is granted, persons then owning boats moored at King Harbor may also be entitled to the recovery of some amount for future damages which they may sustain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">\u201cIf the named plaintiffs are successful in this action, the amount of money which any individual class member would be entitled to recover as damages would depend upon the amount and kind of damages he had sustained, upon the terms of the judgment rendered by the court and upon certain other factors which cannot be foreseen at this time. Depending upon the type of judgment rendered by the court, an individual class member might or might not be required to testify or to take some other affirmative action (such as filling out a claim form) in order to recover his share of the damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">\u201cIf the named plaintiffs are successful in this action, some of the factors</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>which would be involved in calculating the amount of damages which any individual plaintiff would be entitled to recover are the following: (1) the length of time the boat was moored at King Harbor; (2) the size of the boat; (3) the amount by which the value of the boat had been diminished as a result of Edison\u2019s activities; (4) the kind of damage which the boat sustained; (5) the cost of materials purchased for necessary repairs and/or cleaning as a result of Edison\u2019s activities; (6) the cost of labor for repairs and/or cleaning of the boat necessary because of Edison\u2019s activities, if the boat owner hired someone else to do these tasks; (7) the amount of time spent in repairing and/or cleaning the boat, if the boat owner or someone else performed these tasks without compei^ation; and (8) other relevant factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\">\u201cIf you elect to participate in the class, you will be included in any judgment rendered, whether favorable or not.

Vogel Judge of the Superior Court\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">The letter which, under the order of the trial court, must accompany the deposition subpoenas affords unnamed plaintiffs three alternative courses of action. Thus, in the part of the letter entitled \u201cSummary\u201d the prospective deponent is instructed that he \u201cmust\u201d either (1) appear for his deposition pursuant to the accompanying subpoena, (2) arrange for a different time for the taking of his deposition, or (3) execute the \u201cDeclaration Waiving Claim\u201d and thereby waive all rights to recovery as a member of the class.  Accordingly, the issue presented is whether the unnamed plaintiffs\u2019 rights to remain as members of the class can be made to depend without qualification upon their willingness to submit to deposition proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">Apparently a similar suggestion for excluding unnamed class members was made in connection with the previous proceedings which culminated in the Supreme Court opinion to which reference has been made herein-above, <em>Southern California Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d 832. Thus the Supreme Court stated therein (pp. 841-842): \u201cIn the instant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>case, several factors warranted the trial court\u2019s conclusion that there was good cause for the issuance of a protective order: . . . Most importantly, it was charged that defendant planned to continue noticing the depositions of batches of unnamed plaintiffs and to move for exclusion from the class of those who did not appear.\u201d In expressing disapproval of that procedure the Supreme Court stated at page 842: \u201cWe fear that the notice procedure employed by Edison is susceptible of great abuse. In essence, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys will be forced to expend extraordinary time and effort to round up persons of a disorganized class with whom they probably have had no prior contact; such occurred in the instant case. Prospective deponents who do not heed informal efforts on the part of counsel and do not appear will <em>face potential exclusion. Thus, a defendant can effectively stifle a class action at the discovery stage, either by imposing impossibly expensive burdens on the named plaintiffs or by chipping away at the size of the class through exclusion of the unnamed plaintiffs. </em>It is especially vital to prevent such \u2018chilling\u2019 of class actions in light of their new importance as a litigation tool, presaged by recent federal cases and our own decisions in <em>Daar </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d 695 [63 Cal.Rptr. 724, 433 P.2d 732] and <em>Vasquez </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 800 [94 Cal.Rptr, 796, 484 P.2d 964].\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">It appears that the procedure embodied in the trial court\u2019s order under consideration here is but another device by which a defendant could \u201cchip away at the size of the class through exclusion of the unnamed plaintiffs.\u201d By way of guidance it is to be noted that rule 23, subdivision (c) (2), of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides that notice be given to unnamed members of the class respecting the nature of the class action and that members who do not wish to participate may request exclusion from the class. However, in the instant case, the order under consideration did not allow unnamed plaintiffs to freely \u201copt out\u201d of the class but, rather, required them to either submit to deposition proceedings or exclude themselves from the class. In effect, unnamed plaintiffs served with deposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>subpoenas are required, under the terms of the trial court\u2019s order, to take affirmative action in order to remain as members of the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Despite the clear wording of rule 23, subdivision (c) (2), controversy still exists in the federal courts as to whether unnamed members of a class should be required to take affirmative action (opt in) in order to retain their status as members of the class or be allowed to remain members of the class unless they take affirmative action to exclude themselves (opt out) from the class. (See Kaplan, <em>Continuing Work of the Civil Committee: 1966 Amendments of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, </em>81 Harv.L.Rev. 356 at pp. 394-398; compare <em>State of Iowa </em>v. <em>Union Asphalt &amp; Roadoils, Inc. </em>(S.D.Iowa 1968) 281 F.Supp. 391, 403, with <em>Abulaban </em>v. <em>R. W. Pressprich &amp; Co. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1971) 51 F.R.D. 496, 497.)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Thus, in <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Kraftco Corporation </em>(N.D.Ga. 1972) 54 F.R.D. 532, footnote page 535, the court stated: \u201cDefendants have renewed their request that the court require all class members to- file a \u2018proof of claim\u2019 before the trial begins. The court did not grant this request earlier in this case, although it is aware that some courts have required class members to affirmatively indicate their intentions to prove damages even before liability is established by the representative party. <em>E.g., </em>Philadelphia Electric Co. v. Anaconda American Brass Co., 43 F.R.D. 452, 459-460 (E.D. Pa. 1968). <em>Compare </em>In re Antibiotic Antitrust Actions, 333 F.Supp. 267, 271-272 (S.D.N.Y. 1971), <em>with </em>In re Antibiotic Antitrust Actions, 333 F.Supp. 278, 281-282 (S.D.N.Y. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\u201cThe court\u2019s-reluctance to require such an affirmative indication by class members at the outset of the class action stems from the literal terms of Rule 23, especially Rule 23(c) (2) (B) which provides that the judgment \u2018will include all members who do not request exclusion.\u2019 It is clear that the draftsmen of the Rule intended this to mean that class members must \u2018opt out,\u2019 not \u2018opt in.\u2019 <em>See </em>Kaplan, Continuing Work of the Civil Committee, <em>supra, </em>397-398. Indeed, at least one court which did require the filing of such a \u2018proof of claim\u2019 recognized that unless and until liability to the class is established class members may not be barred for failure to file the \u2018proof of claim\u2019 in view of the objectives of Rule 23. Korn v. Franchard Corp., 50 F.R.D. 57, 59-60. (S.D.N.Y. 1970). Such a lack of sanction is a further reason, in this court\u2019s opinion, for refusing to require class members to somehow \u2018opt in\u2019 before liability is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">\u201cThe court does not, however, rule out the use of such a \u2018proof of claim\u2019 device as a reasonable condition to the participation by class members in any recovery.\u201d However, even in cases requiring unnamed class members to take some affirmative action, such as filing a proof of claim form, few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>have made noncompliance with the requirement a reason for exclusion of class members. (See <em>In re Antibiotic Antitrust Actions </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1971) 333 F.Supp. 278, 281-282; <em>Eisen </em>v. <em>Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1971) 52 F.R.D. 253, 268; <em>Pfizer, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lord </em>(2d Cir. 1971) 449 F.2d 119, 120; <em>Korn </em>v. <em>Franchard Corporation </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1970) 50 F.R.D. 57, 59-60 (revd. on other grounds 456 F.2d 1206); <em>In re Cohen\u2019s Will </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1970) 51 F.R.D. 167, 175.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">If defendant is desirous of taking the depositions of unnamed plaintiffs, remedies are available to it to enforce its subpoenas. The sending of notice to unnamed plaintiffs respecting the nature of the action and their option to exclude themselves from the class should they choose to do so is not, in and of itself, improper. Indeed, this is procedure approved under rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and California Civil Code section 1781 for use at an appropriate time. That which we find objectionable is the either/or nature of the notice used here, reinforced as it is by inclusion of the waiver form, which encourages unnamed plaintiffs to \u201copt out\u201d of the class at the discovery stage rather than to submit to deposition proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">For reasons noted herein, the trial court\u2019s order of April 16, 1973, constituted an abuse of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Let the peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the trial court to vacate its order of April 16, 1973, and to proceed in accordance with the governing law stated herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Rule 23, subdivision (c)(2), of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides: \u201c(2) In any class action maintained under subdivision (b) (3), the court shall direct to the members of the class the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort. The notice shall advise each member that (A) the court will exclude him from the class if he so requests by a specified date; (B) the judgment, whether favorable or not, will include all members who do not request exclusion; and (C) any member who does not request exclusion may, if he desires, enter an appearance through his counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Similar notice requirements are provided in California Civil Code section 1781, subdivisions (d) and (e) (Consumers Legal Remedies Act), and in the new Manual for the Conduct of Pretrial Proceedings on Class Action Issues, formulated by the Los Angeles Superior Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b537-9\">It should be remembered that the primary purpose of the \u201copt out\u201d provisions of rule 23, subdivision (c) (2), is not to cut down the size of the class but to respect the interests of unnamed class members who might wish to pursue their own litigations. Thus, in the Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules respecting rule 23, subdivision (c)(2), the committee states: \u201cSubdivision (c)(2) makes special provision for class actions maintained under subdivision (b)(3). As noted in the discussion of the latter subdivision, the interests of the individuals in pursuing their own litigations may be so strong here as to warrant denial of a class action altogether. Even when a class action is maintained under subdivision (b)(3), this individual interest is respected. Thus the court is required to direct notice to the members of the class of the right of each member to be excluded from the class upon his request. A member who does not request exclusion may, if he wishes, enter an appearance in the action through his counsel; whether or not he does so, the judgment in the action will embrace him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b537-7\">ALLPORT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aij\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">The majority holds that the order of the trial court for submission to unnamed plaintiffs of a notice requiring them to appear for a deposition in response to a personally served subpoena or arrange for some date or time other than that specified or execute a waiver of participation in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>class action at the discovery: stage is so derogatory of the class action procedure as to amount to an abuse of discretion requiring vacation of the order. I do not agree that the order is objectionable, much less that it is an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The inherent complexity of class actions requires the establishing of procedures calculated-to expedite their conclusion with due. consideration to the rights of all concerned, not only the named parties plaintiff and their attorneys but the .unnamed parties plaintiff, the defendants and the courts. It is conceded that the letter in question fully and fairly explains the nature of the action in general, the deposition procedure and the options of the unnamed parties. The either/or nature of the communication in no way compels action not otherwise required by the mere service of the subpoena. It merely offers the one served with the subpoena a quick, inexpensive and convenient way to extricate himself from participation in a legal action in which he may have no interest whatsoever, i.e., his boat may have suffered only inconsequential damage or perhaps it was not even in the harbor at the time in question. If the ordinary subpoena process is required this party is faced with uncertainty, expense, inconvenience and possible legal action for failing to obey the compulsion of the subpoena. In this regard, I question the holding of the majority that the issue presented in this petition is whether the unnamed plaintiffs\u2019 rights to remain as members of the class \u201ccan be made to depend upon their willingness to submit to deposition proceedings.\u201d Once the unnamed plaintiff has been served with a subpoena he is under court order to appear for the deposition and there is no question of willingness on his part to submit. His failure to appear could result in contempt proceedings under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1209, subdivision 9; 1991 and 1992, or in dismissal of the action as to him under section 2034. The procedure contemplated by the order in question may be of material benefit to him and of no detriment either to him or to any of the other parties or to the prosecution of the action itself. In fact the procedure appears to me to offer material benefits to all concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">It is necessary that at some stage of the procedure the extent of the class be determined. An advance determination is of benefit if settlement is to be had at an early stage of the action. The settlement possibility is reached only after the extent of the class is determined and the potential monetary loss and defense expense established with some degree of certainty. The cost of defense is an important consideration in effecting settlement and is directly affected by the nature and extent of the discovery to be had and the length of the trial itself. It would appear to be unnecessary to refer to other benefits that might be gained from adopting the procedure contemplated by the order in question. Since in my opinion only benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>to all concerned can result from the procedure adopted, I must conclude that the trial court exercised its discretion wisely. Certainly it was not abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">I would discharge the order to show cause and deny the petition for the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 16, 1973. Allport, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted. The petition of the real party in interest for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 19, 1973.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
