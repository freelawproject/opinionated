When we accepted the case and ordered it transferred here, we did so primarily to decide whether the municipal court erred in instructing the jury that it could disregard expert testimony of community standards if it found that the conduct in question was so patently offensive as to violate any conceivable community standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>That question and other issues previously presented in the appeal have now been overshadowed by a new contention that Penal Code sections 311 and 311.2 are unenforceable<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as a result of decisions of the United States Supreme Court handed down on June 21, 1973.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We proceed now to discuss that contention and deal subsequently in this opinion with the earlier raised issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Appellant Werner Enskat was convicted by a municipal court jury of violating Penal Code section 311.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The conviction arose from his exhibition of what was alleged to be an obscene sound motion picture entitled, \u201cThe Collection.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The applicable part of section 311.2 provides, \u201c. . . Every person who . . . possesses . . . with intent to . . . exhibit to others or who . . . exhibits to others, any obscene matter, is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d Section 311 provides, so far as relevant here, \u201c. . . \u2018Obscene matter\u2019 means matter, taken as a whole, the predominant appeal of which to the average person, applying contemporary standards, is to prurient interest, i.e., a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion; and is matter which taken as a whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters; and is matter which taken as a whole is utterly without redeeming social importance.\u201d This statutory definition derives from the language of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U.S. 476 [1 L.Ed.2d 1498, 77 S.Ct. 1304], as amplified in <em>Memoirs </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>383 U.S. 413 [16 L.Ed.2d 1, 86 S.Ct. 975]. The extreme difficulty in defining obscenity and in applying the definition to particular fact situations and \u201cthe somewhat tortured history of the [United States Supreme] court\u2019s obscenity decisions\u201d <em>(Miller </em>at p. 20 [37 L.Ed.2d at, p.428]) need not be recounted here. It is amply discussed in <em>Miller </em>(413 U.S. at pp. 20-24 [37 L.Ed.2d at pp. 428-430]); and in the dissent of Brennan, J., in <em>Paris </em>(413 U.S. at p. 73 et seq. [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 467 et seq.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">\n<em>Does California Still Have an Obscenity Statutef</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\"><em>Miller </em>marks a new turn in obscenity prosecutions. Since it and its companion decisions were handed down, they have been popularly regarded as making it easier for convictions to be secured m obscenity cases. That is so because no member of the United States Supreme Court any longer supports the <em>Memoirs </em>definition of obscenity <em>(Miller, supra, </em>at p. 23 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 430]) and in particular, because that part of the definition which required obscene matter taken as a whole to be \u201c <em>\u2018utterly </em>without redeeming social value\u2019 \u201d has been abandoned. In its place toe court has adopted a different standard: \u201cwhether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literacy, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d <em>(Miller </em>at p. 24 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 431].)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">We turn then to a discussion of the problem posed to us by <em>Miller. </em>Appellant argues vigorously that the Supreme Court\u2019s abandonment of the <em>Memoirs\u2019 </em>test, upon which the definition of obscene matter in section 311 is based, renders that statute and its application to appellant\u2019s case unenforceable. This argument requires us to examine closely into the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Miller. </em>That case, as the one at bench, involved sections 311 and 311.2. Specifically at issue in <em>Miller </em>were five unsolicited advertising brochures primarily consisting \u201cof pictures and drawings very explicitly depicting men and women in groups of two or more engaging in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>variety of sexual activities, with genitals often prominently displayed\u2019.\u2019 <em>(Miller, supra, </em>at p. 18 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 427]). After pointing out that it has been \u201ccategorically settled\u201d that obscene matter is unprotected by the First Amendment, the court stated that it acknowledged, however, \u201c. . . the inherent dangers of undertaking to regulate any form of expression.\u201d <em>(Miller, supra, </em>at p. 23.) Accordingly, the court continued \u201cState statutes designed to regulate obscene materials must be carefully limited. [Citation omitted.] As a result, we now confine the permissible scope of such regulation to works which depict or describe sexual conduct. That conduct must be specifically defined by the applicable state law, as written or authoritatively construed. [Fn. omitted.] A state offense must also be limited to works which, taken as a whole, appeal to the prurient interest in sex, which portray sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and which, taken as a whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">\u201cThe basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether \u2018the average person, applying contemporary community standards\u2019 would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest. <em>Kois </em>v. <em>Wisconsin . . </em>. 408 U.S. at p. 230, quoting <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at p. 489; (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. We do not adopt as a constitutional standard the <em>\u2018utterly </em>without redeeming social value\u2019 test of <em>Memoirs </em>...\u201d (italics by the Supreme Court, <em>Miller </em>at pp. 23-24 [37 L.Ed.2d at pp. 430-431]). The court additionally declared that \u201cWe also reject, as a constitutional standard, the ambiguous concept of \u2018social importance\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 25 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 431]).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Finally, the court said, \u201cWe emphasize that it is not our function to propose regulatory schemes for the States. That must await their concrete legislative efforts. It is possible, however, to give a few plain examples of what a state statute could define for regulation under the second part (b) of the standard announced in this opinion, <em>supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-7\">\u201c(a) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-8\">\u201c(b) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>Building on <em>Miller\u2019s </em>holding that the permissible scope of state statutes regulating obscene material is confined to works depicting or describing sexual conduct <em>specifically defined </em>by the applicable state law as written or authoritatively construed, appellant now argues that sections 311 and 311.2 are facially vague and overbroad because they fail to specifically define proscribed depictions or representations of sexual conduct. He further argues that California appellate courts have not had the occasion to authoritatively construe those sections so as to limit their reach to specifically defined sexual conduct. Also, appellant asserts, the statutory element that the work must be \u201cutterly without redeeming social importance\u201d has been rejected by the Supreme Court as impermissible. The upshot of the argument is appellant\u2019s contention that he has been denied due process and that his case was submitted to the jury \u201cin the absence of viable legal standards.\u201d He urges that \u201cthe new and prospective standards\u201d enunciated in <em>Miller </em>cannot be applied to this case. Relying on <em>Bouie </em>v. <em>City of Columbia, </em>378 U.S. 347 [12 L.Ed.2d 894, 84 S.Ct. 1697], he argues that if a statute is vague, the vice inherent in that vagueness cannot be cured in the very case under consideration by placing valid limits on the statute. His claim is that this would amount to a retrospective application comparable to ex post facto legislation. Finally, appellant states that separation of powers principles would be violated were this court to judicially rewrite the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">We summarize our holding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\">(1) The United States Supreme Court has not held section 311 and like state statutes unconstitutional but rather has left it to the states to see if their statutes measure up to the <em>Miller </em>requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-6\">(2) Except for the requirement that obscene matter be \u201cutterly without redeeming social importance,\u201d section 311 has been previously construed substantially in accordance with the <em>Miller </em>requirements and the jury was so instructed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-7\">(3) The courts are not at liberty to read out of section 311 the \u201cutterly without redeeming social importance\u201d element of the offense proscribed by that section; that is a matter for the Legislature. However, there is no constitutional reason why the statute as written cannot continue to be applied pending any changes which the Legislature may wish to make in it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">We discuss briefly these propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number><em>First, </em>in <em>Miller, </em>the Supreme Court made it clear that section 311 and like statutes were not unconstitutional.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Additionally, in <em>Kaplan, supra, </em>413 U.S. 115, at page 122 [37 L.Ed.2d 492, at page 499], the court held that a book involved there was obscene and not protected by the First Amendment and that \u201c. . . the prosecution\u2019s evidence was sufficient, as a matter of federal constitutional law, to support petitioner\u2019s conviction.\u201d Like <em>Miller, Kaplan </em>also involved sections 311 and 311.2:</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Orders issued by the United States Supreme Court in disposing of the obscenity cases before it illuminate that court\u2019s conclusion that it is possible for a statute either to be limited on remand by judicial construction, or to be held on remand to have been previously so limited. In <em>Miller, </em>the order of court was to <em>vacate, </em>not reverse, the state court judgment and to remand the case to the Appellate Department of the Superior Court of Orange County, whence it had come, \u201cfor further proceedings not inconsistent with the First Amendment standards established by this opinion.\u201d (413 U.S. at p. 37 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 438].) Footnote 7 of <em>12 200-Ft. Reels </em>was cited. With one exception, a similar disposition was made in all of the other state obscenity cases decided by the court together with Miller.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>To be contrasted is the disposition of the obscenity cases in <em>12 200-Ft. Reels. </em>There, the material had been seized at a port of entry under a federal statute prohibiting importation of \u201cobscene or immoral\u201d matter. The federal trial court held the statute under which the seizure resulted unconstitutional on its face. Reversing that decision, the United States Supreme Court returned the case to the trial court to determine whether the material involved was obscene in the light of <em>Miller.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court then noted in footnote 7, 413 U.S. at page 130 [37 L.Ed.2d at page 507], that while the construction of state legislation should be left to state courts, the Supreme Court had a duty to authoritatively construe federal statutes where a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised and continued, \u201c. . . If and when such a \u2018serious doubt\u2019 is raised as to the vagueness of the words \u2018obscene,\u2019 \u2018lewd,\u2019 \u2018lascivious,\u2019 \u2018filthy,\u2019 \u2018indecent,\u2019 or \u2018immoral\u2019 as used to describe regulated material in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1305(a) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1462, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Orito, supra, </em>... we are prepared to construe such terms as limiting regulated material to patently offensive representations or descriptions of that specific \u2018hard-core\u2019 sexual conduct given as examples in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><em>Second, </em>we need not discuss further the first element of section 311\u2014 that obscene matter is matter, taken as ,a whole, the predominant appeal of which to the average person, applying contemporary standards is to prurient interest. It is identical with one of the three <em>Miller </em>requirements. And, since we hold that section 311 is to be applied in appellant\u2019s case as it has previously been construed (and without eliminating the statutory requirement that an obscene work is one \u201cutterly without redeeming social importance\u201d) we pause but briefly with appellant\u2019s contention that section 311 has not been authoritatively construed in the past so as to limit its reach to specifically defined sexual conduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The contention is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">In requiring that obscene matter must go \u201csubstantially beyond contemporary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters,\u201d the statute is substantially the same as the general <em>Miller </em>formulation which inquires \u201cwhether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive, way, sexual conduct.\u201d <em>Miller </em>states that those matters must be \u201cspecifically defined by the applicable state law.\u201d Previous California cases have so limited section 311. Thus, it is clear that section 311 prohibits only \u201chardcore pornography\u201d <em>(Zeitlin </em>v. <em>Arnebergh, </em>59 Cal.2d 901 [31 Cal.Rptr. 800, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>383 P.2d 152, 10 A.L.R.3d 707]),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that nudity does not equate with obscenity and that \u201cno matter how ugly or repulsive the presentation, we are not to hold nudity, absent a sexual activity, to be obscene\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Noroff, 61 </em>Cal.2d 791 at p. 797 [63 Cal.Rptr. 575, 433 P.2d 479]), and that \u201c[t]o constitute obscenity ... the material must contain a graphic description of sexual activity\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cimber, </em>271 Cal.App.2d Supp. 867, 869 [76 Cal.Rptr. 382]). Further, and with respect to material of similar character to that involved here,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Landau </em>v. <em>Fording, </em>245 Cal.App.2d 820 [54 Cal.Rptr. 177] stated with reference to a film depicting, among other things, fellatio, sodomy and oral copulation that \u201c[i]t should be readily apparent from the preceding description that the film goes far beyond customary limits of candor in offensively depicting certain unorthodox sexual practices and relationships.\u201d (245 Cal.App.2d at p. 826.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The film was held to be obscene within the meaning of section 311. <em>Miller, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>thus has not imposed any new requirements upon California law insofar as two of the three elements required by section 311 are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\"><em>Third, Miller </em>has, however, eased the prosecutorial burden in obscenity cases by not adopting as a constitutional requirement the \u201cutterly without redeeming social value\" test and the concept of \u201csocial importance\u201d discussed in <em>Memoirs </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, supra, </em>383 U.S. 413 (reported <em>sub nom. A Book </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>16 L.Ed.2d 1). Section 311 includes that test: \u201c. . . \u2018Obscene matter\u2019 ... is matter which taken as a whole is utterly without redeeming social importance.\u201d This language constitutes one element of the definition of obscenity established by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The California Supreme Court has recently said the following: \u201cIn California all crimes are statutory and there are no common law crimes. Only the Legislature and not the courts may make conduct criminal. [Citations omitted.] <em>Deletion by the courts of one of the statutory requirements of a crime would make conduct criminal which the Legislature has not seen fit to make criminal </em>and would violate the fundamental principle that there are no common law crimes in this state.\u201d <em>(In re Brown, 9 </em>Cal.3d 612, 624 [108 Cal.Rptr. 465, 510 P.2d 1017], italics supplied.) See also <em>In re James M., 9 </em>Cal.3d 517 [108 Cal.Rptr. 89, 510 P.2d 33]. This court, thus, may not read out of section 311 the \u201cutterly without redeeming social importance\u201d requirement. To do so \u201cwould be to invade the province of the Legislature by redefining the elements of the underlying crime\u201d <em>(In re James M., supra, </em>at p. 522) and would thus violate separation of powers principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Only two alternatives appear to remain to us: To declare, as appellant would have us do, that in light of <em>Millet% </em>California no longer has an obscenity statute or, to hold, as we believe <em>Miller </em>and its companions clearly indicate should be the result, that the retention of the \u201cutterly without redeeming social importance\u201d requirement, pending any legislative change in section 311, is not constitutionally fatal. We choose the latter course and proceed to examine the reasons for this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">In the first place, by adopting a test that matter can be found to be obscene if it merely \u201clacks <em>serious </em>literary, artistic, political, or scientific value\" <em>(Miller </em>at p. 24 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 431], italics supplied), instead of being utterly without redeeming social value, the Supreme Court has obviously made it considerably easier for obscenity prosecutions to succeed. With such a relaxation of the prosecutor\u2019s burden goes a corresponding increase in \u201cthe inherent dangers of undertaking to regulate any form of expression\u201d (Mi<em>ller </em>at p. 23 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 430]).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>These dangers were expressly recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller. </em>It is because of them that the court enunciated the new statutory standards which we have discussed at length. It would be most anomalous if the result of the relaxed requirements put on the prosecution by <em>Miller </em>and its companion decisions, was the elimination of California obscenity laws pending any legislative reenactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">In the second place, language in <em>Miller </em>itself indicates that the intent of the court was only to require increased specificity in the state laws if the \u201cutterly without redeeming social value\u201d test was abandoned. Thus, in summing up its holding, the Supreme Court said, among other things, that \u201c[W]e . . . hold that [obscene] material can be regulated by the States, subject to the specific safeguards enunciated above, without a showing that the material is <em>\u2018utterly </em>without redeeming social value,\u2019 . . .\u201d <em>(Miller </em>at pp. 36-37 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 438], italics by the United States Supreme Court.) The Supreme Court nowhere holds that the \u201cutterly without redeeming social value\u201d test is itself unconstitutional. The precise language used by the Court is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">In the third place, there is no reason at all why state law cannot impose more strict requirements on the prosecution as to the definitions of obscenity than the Constitution would require. That, in effect, is what the \u201cutterly without redeeming social importance\u201d formulation does. In <em>Paris, supra, </em>413 U.S. 49, at pages 53-54 [37 L.Ed.2d 446, at p. 454], the court pointed out that \u201c[i]t should be clear from the outset that we do not undertake to tell the States what they must do, but rather to define the area in which they may chart their own course in dealing with obscene material.\u201d Clearly, the states can adopt or retain more restrictive standards for obscenity prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Appellant argues that because the Supreme Court has characterized the words, \u201csocial importance\u201d as ambiguous, no viable standard remains.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">It is clear to us that the focus of the court\u2019s decision was not on the ambiguity of \u201csocial importance,\u201d but rather on the change from works which are <em>utterly </em>without value or importance to works which <em>lack serious </em>value or importance. The court expressly has retained the concept of \u201cvalue\u201d as part of the test for obscenity permitted under <em>Miller. </em>Yet, the phrases, \u201csocial value\u201d and \u201csocial importance\u201d not only have been used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>interchangeably in Supreme Court decisions, but are synonymous.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, though the concept of \u201csocial importance\u201d was referred to by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller </em>as being ambiguous, its semantic equivalent is set forth as a standard without constitutional defect. Further, the passing reference to ambiguity in <em>Miller </em>is only dictum. In light of all the circumstances, it is clear that this court would be remiss in seizing on that reference to invalidate California\u2019s obscenity laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Additionally, if a claim is made that retention of section 311\u2019s requirement that a work be \u201cutterly without redeeming social importance\u201d renders the statute fatally vague, we think the answer is that it is no more vague than the phrases upheld against such challenge in the <em>Giannini </em>decision (\u201clewdly\u201d and \u201clewd or dissolute\u201d <em>In re Giannini, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 563, 571 [72 Cal.Rptr. 655, 446 P.2d 535]) or in the phrases treated in fn. 7 of <em>12 200-Ft. Reels, supra </em>(\u201clewd,\u201d \u201clascivious,\u201d \u201cfilthy,\u201d \u201cindecent,\" \u201cimmoral,\u201d 413 U.S. at p. 130) or for that matter, than the predecessui language of section 311 upheld against an attack of vagueness in <em>Alberts </em>v. <em>California, </em>decided in the same opinion as <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U.S. 476 [1 L.Ed.2d 1498, 77 S.Ct. 1304].<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">In sum, as to the issues raised by <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California </em>and its companion decisions, we hold (1) that section 311 as heretofore construed, defines obscene matter as required by <em>Miller, </em>except as to <em>Miller\u2019s </em>tolerance of an obscenity finding as to matter which is not utterly without redeeming social importance; (2) that while the work in question here meets the <em>Miller </em>test of lacking serious literary, artistic apd other values, we cannot apply that yardstick to it, but instead must measure it against the concept of being \u201cutterly without redeeming social importance\u201d; (3) that such measurement is still permissible; and (4) that so measured, the film which appellant was convicted of exhibiting is obscene.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>\n<em>Need for Expert Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">We now arrive at the questions originally certified by the appellate department. They are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-6\">\u201c1. Is expert testimony or other evidence of contemporary community standards necessary to convict under Penal Code section 311.2 in all cases?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-7\">\u201c2. Where a defendant has introduced expert testimony on the subject of community standards, may the jury be instructed that evidence of community standards is unnecessary and such testimony need not be considered if it finds the material in question is so patently offensive as to violate any conceivable community standard?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">Expert testimony was given by witnesses for both sides as to whether the material was obscene. Over defense objection, the court gave the following instruction at the request of the People: \u201cYou are instructed that should you first find that the conduct in question, from all the evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt, is so patently offensive as to violate any conceivable community standard, evidence of community standards is unnecessary; and expert testimony need not be considered upon this issue.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It is this instruction which is attacked by appellant. We hold the instruction to be proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">The requirement that expert testimony must be introduced in obscenity cases on the issue of community standards was introduced in <em>In re Giannini </em>(1968) <em>supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 563, 574. Holding that the relevant community to be considered in determining whether a challenged dance violated \u201ccontemporary standards\u201d was a statewide one, the court refused to assume that jurors in themselves necessarily reflected those standards. Therefore, expert testimony was required. The court had under consideration, however, a \u201ctopless\u201d dance shown only to adults and stated as to it \u201c[sjince this conduct is not so patently offensive as to violate any conceivable community standard, we need not decide whether evidence of community standards must be introduced in an extreme and unquestionable situation.\u201d (69 Cal.2d at p. 576, fn. 8.) Thus, <em>Giannini </em>itself, upon which appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>relies, does not require that expert testimony be presented in the situation envisaged by the instruction challenged here. Further, section 312.1<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> was adopted by the Legislature after the <em>Giannini </em>decision. The section in effect repeals <em>Giannini </em>(see <em>In re </em>Price, 4 Cal.App.3d 941, 948 [84 Cal. Rptr. 585] [Thompson, J., dissenting]).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">In <em>Paris, supra, </em>413 U.S. 49, the United States Supreme Court held that it was not error \u201cto fail to require \u2018expert\u2019 affirmative evidence that the materials were obscene when the materials themselves were actually placed in evidence.\u201d (413 U.S. at p. 56 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 456]). The court stated that the films there involved were obviously the best evidence of what they represent and that in its decisions since <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>354 U.S. 476, it had regarded the materials as sufficient in themselves for the determination of the question. Finally, the United States Supreme Court said, \u201cThis is not a subject that lends itself to the traditional use of expert testimony. Such testimony is usually admitted for the purpose of explaining to lay jurors what they otherwise could not understand. Cf. 2 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 556, 559 (3d ed. 1940). No such assistance is needed by jurors iir obscenity cases; indeed the \u2018expert witness\u2019 practices employed in these cases have often made a mockery out of the otherwise sound concept of expert testimony . . . \u2018Simply stated hard core pornography . . \u2022 can and does speak for itself.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wild, </em>422 F.2d 34, 36 (CA2 1970), cert, denied, 402 U.S. 986 (1971). We reserve judgment, however, on the extreme case, not presented here, where contested materials are directed at such a bizarre deviant group that the experience of the trier-of-fact would be plainly inadequate to judge whether the material appeals to the prurient interest. See <em>Mishkin </em>v. <em>New York, </em>383 U.S. 502, 508-510 (1966); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Klaw, </em>350 F.2d 155, 167-168 (CA2 1965).\u201d <em>Paris, </em>at 413 U.S. at p. 56, fn. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">As for the argument that the instruction deprived appellant of the benefit of the testimony of his defense experts, we see no difference in substance between the manner in which the jury was instructed and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>provisions of section 1127b. The defense is free to introduce expert testimony <em>(Kaplan, supra, </em>at p. 121 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 498]), but the jurors may disregard it if they find it to be unreasonable. We therefore hold that on the facts of this case, the giving of the instruction was not error and that expert testimony was not necessary to convict appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">\n<em>Miscellaneous Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Other contentions raised by appellant in the appellate department or before us have also been laid to rest by <em>Paris </em>and its judicial siblings, and need not be discussed by us. Remaining for consideration is the contention that the film in question was seized under an improper search warrant, a claim that the jury was improperly instructed as to scienter and that there was insufficient evidence that appellant knew the film was obscene and a claim that the court misdefined certain terms in its instructions. As to the scienter instruction, we see nothing wrong with it; the jury was adequately instructed that the People had to prove that appellant was aware of the character of the matter; we know of no requirement that it must be proven that appellant knew the film was obscene separately from the jury\u2019s ultimate determination that that is the fact. We decline to search the record to see if the evidence of appellant\u2019s knowledge was sufficient. It is appellant\u2019s burden to point out all evidence on the issue and he does not purport to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the court did not properly define terms in its instructions is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Insofar as appellant argued to the appellate department that the copy of the film introduced into evidence as Exhibit 1 should have been suppressed, we agree with the decision of the appellate department on that point and adopt it as our own as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">\u201cAppellant contends that Exhibit One, a copy of the film, was seized under a warrant, the affidavit for which did not sufficiently show an intent of the possessor of the film to commit a public offense with it (i.e., an intent to distribute or exhibit the film in violation of Penal Code section 311.2) as is required by Penal Code section 1524, subdivision (3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>\u201cWe do not agree with the contention. This film is sufficiently identified in the affidavit, by its title, as a 16 mm. color film. Moreover, a summary of its contents was given by incorporating in the affidavit the description in the application for a criminal complaint against appellant. The location, 8965 Keith Avenue, Los Angeles, is sufficiently described as a single family residence of wood and stucco with, among others, a louvered door through which could be seen a \u2018film studio.\u2019 Contained within the studio, numerous film cans and some filming equipment could be seen through the door. One film can bearing the name \u2018The Collection\u2019 and one bearing the name \u2018The Collection\u2014Print 2\u2019 could also clearly be seen. The affidavit further alleged that affiant, while on duty investigating obscenity cases, had, on September 19, 1970, observed the film publicly exhibited at the Avon Theater, 7059 Hollywood Boulevard, Los Angeles, where it had been shown for about a week. Facts were also alleged showing that the Avon Theater obtained the film from Signature Films Company, which leased it from Thomas DeSimone. The affidavit showed that the resident at that address was Thomas DeSimone and that affiant had seen DeSimone\u2019s name on the film when viewing it at the Avon Theater as the director and co-producer thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">\u201cFrom these facts the magistrate could fairly infer that the copy of the film seized under the warrant was possessed by DeSimone with the intent to commit a public offense (i.e., to distribute or exhibit the film). There was no error in admitting it in evidence.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Kaus, P. J., and Stephens, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied October 24, 1973.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b776-10\">Assigned by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-7\">A11 statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b777-8\">These opinions are <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U.S. 15 [37 L.Ed.2d 419, 93 S.Ct. 2607] (hereinafter Miller); <em>Paris Adult Theatre I </em>v. <em>Slaton, </em>413 U.S. 49 [37 L.Ed.2d 446, 93 S.Ct. 2628] (hereinafter <em>Paris); United States </em>v. <em>Orito, </em>413 U.S. 139 [37 L.Ed.2d 513, 93 S.Ct. 2674] (hereinafter <em>Orito); Kaplan </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U.S. 115 [37 L.Ed.2d 492, 93 S.Ct. 2680] (hereinafter <em>Kaplan); United States </em>v. <em>12 200-Ft.

The display, live or pictorial, of the nude human body, male or female, or both, in the absence of depicting any sexual activity is not legally obscene. Sex and obscenity are not synonymous. The description or portrayal of sexual activity which does not appeal to prurient interest is not legally obscene.
