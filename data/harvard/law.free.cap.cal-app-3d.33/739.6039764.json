Gonzales\u2019 default was founded upon the grounds that Gonzales had sublet her dwelling, had harassed, annoyed, threatened, harmed, and disrupted other tenants, and had committed wilful violations of the \u201crules and regulations by which the tenants of said project are governed.\u201d On August 3, 1971, and August 13, 1971, appellant\u2019s board of directors again resolved to terminate Gonzales.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">On August 3, 1971, appellant\u2019s board of directors terminated real party in interest Jacobo\u2019s \u201cmembership and tenancy rights.\u201d On August 4, 1971, appellant served Jacobo with notice of \u201ctermination.\u201d Jacobo\u2019s default was founded upon grounds similar to Gonzales\u2019 default. On August 13, 1971, appellant\u2019s board of directors again resolved to terminate Jacobo.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Also on August 3, 1971, appellant\u2019s board of directors resolved to terminate real party in interest Davis\u2019 \u201cmembership and tenancy rights.\u201d On August 13, 1971, appellant served Davis with notice of termination. Davis\u2019 default was founded upon grounds similar to the Gonzales and Jacobo defaults, with the additional ground of nonpayment of rent. On that same day, August 13, 1971, appellant\u2019s board of directors again resolved to terminate Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Sometime thereafter, although neither appellant\u2019s petition nor any other part of the record tells us when, appellant filed complaints in unlawful detainer, in respondent municipal court, against each of the real parties in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>On September 8, 1971, respondent municipal court refused to assume jurisdiction in the unlawful detainer proceedings because \u201csummary dispossession proceedings were an improper and inadequate forum for the termination of the membership and occupancy rights of Real Parties in Interest in the Sun Terrace Manor Apartments and that the [respondent municipal court] therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction of said actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Thereafter, on September 20, 1971, appellant petitioned superior court for the aforementioned writ of mandate to compel respondent municipal court to assume jurisdiction in the unlawful detainer actions. Superior court issued an alternative writ, but on September 30, 1971, discharged the alternative writ and denied the petition for a writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Appellant appeals from the denial of its petition for writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The municipal court, of course, has subject matter jurisdiction over certain actions in unlawful detainer,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and our unlawful detainer statute provides in part that \u201c[a] tenant of real property ... is guilty of unlawful detainer . . . [w]hen he continues in possession . . . after default in the payment of rent, . . . [or] after a neglect or failure to perform other . . . covenants of the lease or agreement under which the property is held, including any covenant not to . . . sublet . . . .\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1161.) Therefore, if real parties in interest were in fact \u201ctenant[s]\u201d within the meaning of the unlawful detainer statute, then respondent municipal court did in fact have subject matter jurisdiction over the unlawful detainer actions, and the superior court did err in refusing to mandate respondent municipal court to assume that jurisdiction. (5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Extraordinary Writs, \u00a781, p. 3858.) On appeal, therefore, we are confronted with the question of whether the real parties in interest were \u201cteiiant[s]\u201d within the meaning of our unlawful detainer statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Since there appears to be no California case law on this precise question, we turn to other authorities that have considered the character of the relationship of a corporate cooperative with the shareholder-tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">In a Maryland case, the court quoted with approval the following language from 1 American Law of Property (Casner ed. 1952) at page 200:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>\u201c \u2018[I]n legal theory the corporation is distinct from its shareholders [or members], no one of whom has a right to receive legal title to any specific property of the corporation . . . and it is necessary that this distinction be observed in order to carry out the purposes of the cooperative. The courts have recognized that the relation is that of landlord and tenant in allowing the corporation the usual remedies of a landlord against a tenant.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Green </em>v. <em>Greenbelt Homes, Inc., </em>232 Md. 496 [194 A.2d 273, 276].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">In a New York case, the court held that \u201c[t]he relationship between- the [shareholder-tenant] and the [corporate cooperative] is that of landlord and tenant. The fact that the tenant is also a stockholder of the corporation owning and managing the entire premises does not nullify or negate their essential relationship of landlord and tenant in relation to the particular apartment occupied by the [shareholder] (tenant). [T]he identity of the stockholder remains distinct and separate from that of the corporation, and there is no sufficient merger of interest to erase the relationship of landlord and tenant between them! It is elementary that the corporation managing the property and the tenant are distinct and separate entities.\u201d <em>(Brigham Park Co-Operative Apts., Sec. 4 </em>v. <em>Lieberman </em>(Mun.Ct.) 158 N.Y.S.2d 135, 136.)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The approach of the Maryland and New York courts has further been adopted by a number of legal commentators (Sengstock, <em>Homeownership: A Goal for All Americans, </em>46 J. Urban Law. 313, 435, 443; Ramsey, Condominium: The New Look in Co-Ops (1962) p. 4; Rohand, <em>Cooperate Housing: An Appraisal of Residential Controls and Enforcement Procedure, </em>18 Stan.L.Rev. 1323, 1331, 1333; Friedman, <em>Community Apartments: Condominium or Stock Cooperative?, </em>50 Cal.L.Rev. 299, 309) and appears to be justified: \u201cWith one mortgage and one tax bill for the whole [corporate cooperative], a sizeable number of transfers to financially irresponsible people could result in responsible shareholders paying a higher bill .... In a condominium a financially irresponsible person is a nuisance because he does not pay his share of the upkeep. In a cooperative he is a menace whose unreliability may occasion seizure of the whole property by the government for taxes, or by banks for arrears in mortgage payments\u201d (Miller, <em>Cooperative Apartments: Real Estate or Securities?, 45 </em>B.U.L.Rev. 465, 495).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">We note, too, that a writer for the California Law Review has simply assumed that the shareholder-tenant is a \u201ctenant\u201d within the definition of our unlawful detainer statute: \u201c[T]he costs of operating [the apartment] building are paid out of a maintenance fund. In both the stock cooperative and the condominium this fund is maintained by assessment. If a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>fails to pay the assessments, his share of the burden is shifted to the other owners or tenants until the default is cured. Therefore, effective enforcement of the covenant to pay the assessments demands that any breach thereof be speedily remedied, [f] It appears that the stock cooperative is superior in this respect. The lease is generally made conditional upon the occurrence of any of several significant conditions, which usually include breach of any of the covenants that are contained in the typical condominium declaration. [Fn. omitted.] If any enumerated condition does occur the lessor-corporation may exercise the summary remedy available to it [fn. omitted][<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] upon compliance with a short notice requirement. [Fn. omitted.] The corporation is then free to sell, lease, or rent the premises to another party within a relatively short period of time, [fn. omitted] thereby removing the financial burden imposed on the non-breaching tenant-shareholders.\u201d (Friedman, <em>Community Apartments: Condominium or Stock Cooperative?, supra, </em>50 Cal.L.Rev. 299, 309.)</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">In addition to these authorities, the occupancy agreement entered into between [appellant] and [real parties in interest] provides specifically that the shareholder-tenant \u201cagrees that there exists under this Occupancy Agreement a landlord-tenant relationship and that in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Member [shareholder-tenant] of any covenant or provision of this Agreement, there shall be available to the Corporation such legal remedy or remedies as are available to a landlord for the breach or threatened breach under the law by a tenant of any provision of a lease or rental agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Therefore, in light of the aforementioned authorities, and in light of real parties in interest agreeing to endow appellant corporate cooperative with \u201csuch . . . remedies as are available to a landlord,\u201d then, under these circumstances, we hold that real parties in interest were \u201ctenantfs]\u201d within the meaning of our unlawful detainer statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The superior court therefore erred in refusing to mandate respondent municipal court to assume subject matter jurisdiction in the unlawful detainer actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The order of the superior court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Kaus, P. J., and Ashby, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Specifically, appellant\u2019s bylaws provided that a \u201cmember\u201d is \u201cany natural person approved by the Board of Directors [who] executes a Subscription Agreement, if membership is purchased from the Corporation, and Occupancy Agreement in the usual form employed by the Corporation covering a specific unit in the housing project.\u201d The bylaws further provided that the cost of a membership varied from $150 to $250. The \u201coccupancy agreement\u201d provided that \u201cmembers\u201d enjoy \u201cthe right to occupy [appellant\u2019s]\u201d dwelling units, \u201crenewable thereafter for successive three-year periods. . . .\u201d The \u201cCooperative Agency Agreement\u201d shows that \u201cCertificates of Stock\u201d were drawn to \u201cevidenc[e] membership.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Specifically, a municipal court has subject matter jurisdiction over unlawful detainer actions only \u201cwhere the rental value is six hundred dollars ($600) or less per month and the whole amount of damages claimed is five thousand dollars ($5,000) or less.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 89, subd. (a)(4).) In the case before us, the unlawful detainer complaints are not included in the record on appeal, but there is no suggestion from either the record or the parties that the dollar-allegations of the unlawful detainer complaints exceeded the dollar-jurisdiction of the municipal court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b626-8\">The omitted footnote is as follows: \u201cCal.

Code \u00a7 791 (right of reentry).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Our opinion is limited to the question of subject matter jurisdiction in unlawful detainer actions, and we express no opinion as to any other legal relationships that may exist between appellant and real parties in interest.
