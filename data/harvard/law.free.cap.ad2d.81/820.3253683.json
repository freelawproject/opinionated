Order reversed, on the law, with $50 costs and disbursements, and plaintiff\u2019s motion is denied. On or about July 11, 1978, plaintiff commenced this action for divorce by service of a summons. In September, 1978 plaintiff served her complaint, alleging cruel and inhuman treatment, and issue was joined by service of defendant\u2019s answer on or about October 27, 1978. Plaintiff filed her statement of readiness on March 4, 1980, and the case was scheduled for trial on July 22, 1980. On the eve of trial, plaintiff moved pursuant to CPLR 3217 (subd [b]) for leave to discontinue her action without prejudice. In her moving papers, she candidly acknowledged that she wanted to discontinue her action to enable her to commence a new action which would be governed by part B of section 236 of the Domestic Relations Law, which is only applicable to actions commenced on or after July 19, 1980 (see Domestic Relations Law, \u00a7 236). Special Term granted her motion, concluding that defendant failed to demonstrate \u201clegal prejudice.\u201d An application for leave to discontinue without prejudice may not be granted in these circumstances (see <em>Tucker v Tucker, </em>80 AD2d 244). Therefore, plaintiff\u2019s motion should have been denied. Titone, J. P., Gulotta, Cohalan and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
