There was no oral argument. Fed. R.Civ.P. 78. For the following reasons, Plaintiffs motion is DENIED in its entirety and Defendants\u2019 motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">The facts of this case are set forth fully in the Court\u2019s prior opinion granting in part and denying in part Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. <em>In re Lord Abbett Mutt. Funds Fee Litig., </em>385 F.Supp.2d 471 (D.N.J.2005) [hereinafter, <em>\u201cLord Abbett\u201d </em>or \u201cthe Opinion\u201d]. Familiarity with the facts set forth in the Opinion is presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-17\">Plaintiffs raise two reasons why the Court should reconsider its decision in <em>Lord Abbett. </em>First, Plaintiffs argue that the Court overlooked controlling authority in ruling that \u00a7 36(b) of the Investment Company Act (\u201cICA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. 80a-35(b), does not provide a private right of action to assert direct claims. Second, Plaintiffs contend that the Court overlooked the principle that a dismissal under the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act (\u201cSLUSA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78bb(f), should be without prejudice as to Plaintiffs\u2019 ability to replead state law claims that are not preempted under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-18\">Defendants, on the other hand, raise two reasons why the Court should reconsider its decision in <em>Lord Abbett. </em>First, Defendants argue that the Court overlooked controlling authority holding that dismissal of certain claims under SLUSA requires dismissal of the entire action. Accordingly, Defendants contend that the Court erred in allowing Plaintiffs 30 days to replead their claims under \u00a7 36(b) and \u00a7 48(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 80a-47(a), of the Investment Company Act (\u201cICA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-1 <em>et seq. </em>Second, Defendants request that the Court remove dictum from the <em>Lord </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number><em>Abbett </em>decision indicating that certain injuries sustained by Plaintiffs\u2019 were direct. Both Defendants and Plaintiffs argue that the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lord Abbett </em>and <em>In re Franklin Mut. Funds Fee Litig., </em>388 F.Supp.2d 451 (D.N.J.2005) [hereinafter, <em>\u201cFranklin Funds </em>\u201d], which were based on materially identical complaints, contradict each other. On this point, the Court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">A motion for reconsideration is an extraordinary remedy to be granted \u201cvery sparingly.\u201d <em>Yurecko v. Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp., </em>279 F.Supp.2d 606, 608 (D.N.J.2003). It is improper on a motion for reconsideration to \u201cask the Court to rethink what it had already thought through' \u2014 rightly or wrongly.\u201d <em>Oritani Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., </em>744 F.Supp. 1311, 1314 (D.N.J.1990). Rather, a motion for reconsideration is reserved for those instances where the Court may have \u201coverlooked\u201d pertinent facts or controlling case law. <em>See </em>D.N.J. Civ. R. 7.1(i). When a matter was considered by the Court, it was not \u201coverlooked.\u201d <em>P. Schoenfeld Asset Mgmt. LLC v. Cendant Corp., </em>161 F.Supp.2d 349, 353 (D.N.J.2001). If the moving party fails to cite pertinent facts or case law that the Court overlooked, then the Court should deny the motion. <em>Egloff v. New Jersey Air Nat\u2019l Guard, </em>684 F.Supp. 1275, 1279 (D.N.J.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">II. Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion For Reconsideration Is Denied In Its Entirety</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">A. Section 36(b) Does Not Provide A Direct Right Of Action</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Plaintiffs disagree with the Court\u2019s holding that shareholders of a mutual fund do not have a direct right of action under \u00a7 36(b) of the ICA. Plaintiffs argue that this holding contravenes Supreme Court precedents, the plain language of \u00a7 36(b), and \u00a7 36(b)\u2019s alleged obliteration of the distinction between claims by shareholders and claims by a mutual fund. In doing so, Plaintiffs fail to identify any law the Court overlooked as required by the standard of review on a motion for reconsideration. Moreover, Plaintiffs are mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">First, the Court disposed of the first two arguments in its discussion of the issue. <em>See Lord Abbett, </em>385 F.Supp.2d at 488-89. Plaintiffs\u2019 reiteration of the very same arguments is no more persuasive the second time around. Supreme Court precedents make clear that the rights asserted in a \u00a7 36(b) action are the rights of the company, e.g., the mutual fund, not the individual shareholders. <em>See Daily Income Fund, Inc. v. Fox, </em>464 U.S. 523, 535 n. 11, 104 S.Ct. 831, 78 L.Ed.2d 645 (1984); <em>Kamen v. Kemper Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>500 U.S. 90, 108, 111 S.Ct. 1711, 114 L.Ed.2d 152 (1991). As the Court succinctly stated in its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-13\">Given the plain language of Section 36(b) and the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent comment on the meaning of the statutory provision, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 36(b) claim must be pleaded as a derivative (not a direct) claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-14\"><em>Lord Abbett, </em>385 F.Supp.2d at 489. Thus, Plaintiffs may not assert direct claims under \u00a7 36(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-15\">Second, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that \u00a7 36(b) obliterated the distinction between claims by shareholders and claims by mutual funds is incorrect. Essentially, Plaintiffs argue that under \u00a7 36(b), the rights of shareholders and the mutual funds are inextricably intertwined such that an injury to the funds is a direct injury to their shareholders. <em>(See, e.g., </em>Pls.\u2019 Mt. for Recons. at 4-6). In <em>Franklin Funds, </em>howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>er, the Court considered and rejected this argument. In that case, the shareholder plaintiffs argued that mutual funds have a unique structure because each share represents a fractional ownership interest in a large investment account. <em>Franklin Funds, </em>388 F.Supp.2d at 462-64. As such, the shareholder plaintiffs argued that any injury to the funds was a direct injury to investors. Relying on the Third Circuit\u2019s opinion <em>Kauffman v. Dreyfus Fund, Inc., </em>434 F.2d 727 (3d Cir.1970), the Court rejected that proposition, concluding that the structure of a mutual fund was not determinative of the type of injury suffered by the shareholders. <em>Id. </em>at 463-64. In other words, shareholders cannot recast an injury to mutual funds as a direct injury to themselves; it remains a derivative injury to the shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Moreover, contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 argument, \u00a7 36(b) did not obliterate distinctions between rights of shareholders and mutual funds. It did not commingle their interests, making them indiscernible from one another. Rather, it clearly keeps their rights separate and distinct. Indeed, it is their maintained distinction that restricts \u00a7 36(b)\u2019s reach. Shareholders have the right to bring suit under \u00a7 36(b), not mutual funds. Shareholders can only bring claims \u201con behalf of\u2019 the funds, i.e., assert derivative claims, not direct claims. And, any recovery goes to the mutual funds, not the shareholders. Accordingly, Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cobliteration\u201d argument is without merit and does not warrant reconsideration of the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">B. Plaintiffs\u2019 Request For Leave To Amend Their State Law Claims To Avoid SLUSA Preemption Is Denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Plaintiffs also seek reconsideration of this Court\u2019s dismissal, with prejudice, of their state law claims under SLUSA. In particular, Plaintiffs ask the Court for leave to amend their state law claims to eliminate SLUSA preemption. Plaintiffs contend that they can define a subclass of persons who neither purchased nor sold during the class period, thereby avoiding SLUSA preemption. Furthermore, Plaintiffs argue that they can amend their state law claims to make clear that they are not predicated on any misrepresentations or omissions of fact, as barred by SLUSA, but rather on the charging of excessive fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) provides that a party may seek leave of court to amend a pleading and that leave \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). The decision to grant or deny a motion for leave to amend, however, \u201crests within the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>Rolo v. City Investing Co. Liquidating Trust, </em>155 F.3d 644, 654 (3d Cir.1998) (citing <em>Howze v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., </em>750 F.2d 1208, 1212 (3d Cir.1984)). \u201c\u2018Among the grounds that could justify a denial of leave to amend are undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, prejudice, and futility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Krantz v. Prudential Invs. Fund Mgmt. LLC, </em>305 F.3d 140, 144 (3d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Shane v. Fauver, </em>213 F.3d 113, 115 (3d Cir.2000)). Moreover, a court may deny a request for leave to amend a complaint \u201cif the movant fails to provide a draft amended complaint.\u201d <em>Cureton v. NCAA, </em>252 F.3d 267, 273 (3d Cir.2001) (citing <em>Adams v. Gould Inc., </em>739 F.2d 858, 864 (3d Cir.1984)); D.N.J. Civ. R. 7.1(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Under this standard, Plaintiffs\u2019 request fails on two grounds. First, Plaintiffs had numerous opportunities to plead the state law claims that they now argue can avoid SLUSA preemption. After filing an initial complaint, and amending that complaint, they now seek a third bite at the proverbial apple. <em>See, e.g., Rolo, </em>155 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>F.3d at 654-55 (rejecting proposed second amended complaint where plaintiffs were repleading facts which could have been plead earlier). In addition, Plaintiffs failed to provide the court with a second amended complaint setting forth their proposed state law claims. As such, it would be entirely speculative for the court to consider the merits of Plaintiffs request at this time. <em>See Lake v. Arnold, </em>232 F.3d 360, 374 (3d Cir.2000) (\u201cObviously, without this draft complaint, the District Court cannot evaluate the merits of a plaintiffs request.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Second, Plaintiffs fail to cite to any relevant facts or controlling authority overlooked by the Court in dismissing their state law claims with prejudice. <em>See </em>D.N.J. Civ. R. 7.1(i). Plaintiffs cite only to <em>Rowinski v. Salomon Smith Barney Inc., </em>398 F.3d 294, 305 n. 12 (3d Cir.2005) for the proposition that a district court can dismiss a claim under SLUSA without prejudice. However, Plaintiffs provide no authority that dismissal without prejudice is <em>required </em>by the Court. The <em>Roivinski </em>court merely noted, in a footnote, that the district court in the case dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims under SLUSA without prejudice. <em>Id. Roivinski </em>makes no statement that dismissal without prejudice is required in every SLUSA case. Accordingly, this statement cannot seriously be considered controlling authority overlooked by this Court and, therefore, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration on this ground is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">III. Defendants\u2019 Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">A. Defendants\u2019 Request For Reconsideration Of Partial Dismissal Of This Action Is Denied</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">In <em>Lord Abbett, </em>this Court dismissed counts seven through ten under SLUSA. The Court, however, allowed Plaintiffs to submit a new complaint limited to pleading derivative claims under \u00a7\u00a7 36(b) and 48(a). Defendants seek reconsideration of this holding. They argue that dismissal of certain claims under SLUSA mandates the dismissal of the \u201centire action,\u201d including those claims not dismissed under the statute. In support of their argument, Defendants rely on the statute itself, which preempts any \u201ccovered class <em>action </em>based upon the statutory or common law of any State or subdivision thereof....\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78bb(f)(l) (emphasis added). According to Defendants, since the Court found that certain claims in Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint were preempted by SLUSA, the entire \u201caction\u201d must be dismissed and, therefore, Plaintiffs should not be allowed the opportunity to replead any of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">The only authority that Defendants cite in support of their argument, and which is binding on this Court, is the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Rowinski. </em>The court in <em>Rowinski </em>noted that SLUSA could stand for the proposition that preemption of a claim under the act requires dismissal of the entire action. <em>Rowinski, </em>398 F.3d at 305. The court, though, did not reach this issue. <em>Id. </em>Instead, the court only remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-11\">As an initial matter, we question whether preemption of certain counts and remand of others is consistent with the plain meaning of SLUSA. The statute does not preempt particular \u201cclaims\u201d or \u201ccounts\u201d but rather preempts \u201cactions,\u201d suggesting that if any claims alleged in a covered class action are preempted, the entire action must be dismissed. <em>But we need not decide whether a count-by-count analysis is appropriate in this case, </em>because Plaintiff has incorporated every allegation into every count in his complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). While this quote might suggest that dismissal of a claim under SLUSA mandates dismissal of an entire action, the Third Circuit expressly reserved decision on this issue. As such, <em>Rowinski </em>does not constitute a \u201ccontrolling decision[ ]\u201d that the Court \u201coverlooked.\u201d <em>See </em>D.N.J. Civ. R. 7.1(i). Therefore, Defendants\u2019 motion for reconsideration on this issue is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">B. Plaintiffs\u2019 Alleged Injuries Are Derivative, Not Direct, And The Court Will Withdraw The <em>Lord Abbett </em>Decision And Issue An Amended Version That Conforms With The <em>Franklin Funds </em>Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Defendants seek reconsideration of this Court\u2019s holding that Plaintiffs alleged a direct injury, i.e., \u201cthe decline in net asset value per share for shareholders (despite the Funds\u2019 net asset growth) as a result of new investors joining the fund.\u201d <em>See Lord Abbett, </em>385 F.Supp.2d at 481. Defendants argue that <em>Lord Abbett </em>is contrary to pertinent case law and this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Franklin Funds, </em>which dealt with a materially identical complaint and held that plaintiffs alleged only derivative injuries. Plaintiffs agree that the holdings in <em>Lord Abbett </em>and <em>Franklin Funds </em>are contradictory, but argue that <em>Lord </em>Abbett\u2019s holding is correct and <em>Franklin </em>Funds\u2019s holding needs modification. Because the parties are correct that the Court\u2019s holdings are irreconcilable, the Court finds that this is one of the rare instances where reconsideration is appropriate. Further, because the Court finds that it incorrectly found a direct injury alleged in this case where none existed, the Court shall amend the <em>Lord Abbett </em>decision to reflect that all alleged injuries are derivative.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">In <em>Lord Abbett, </em>the Court found that the \u201cdecline in net asset value per share\u2014 allegedly caused by Lord Abbett\u2019s broker compensation practices\u201d was a direct injury. <em>Lord Abbett, </em>385 F.Supp.2d at 481. That finding was premised on the fact that shareholders of mutual funds are holders of \u201credeemable securities\u201d and, as such, \u201cany increase in the number of fund shareholders that is not accompanied by a proportionate increase in such assets diminishes the value of that fund\u2019s redeemable securities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481-82. Having found that \u201cthe Complaint alleges that Lord Ab-bett\u2019s broker compensation practices, by causing new investors to join the Funds without any corresponding proportionate increase in Fund assets, caused new asset value per share to decrease (despite overall Fund asset growth),\u201d the Court concluded that the broker compensation practices could be said to have directly injured plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>at 482. That conclusion, in retrospect, is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">First, as found in <em>Lord Abbett </em>and <em>Franklin Funds, </em>the injuries attributable to broker compensation practices are derivative. As the Court clearly articulated in <em>Lord Abbett:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-10\">The first two forms of alleged injury' \u2014 \u2022 payment of excessive distribution and advisory fees out of Fund assets \u2014 are, in the Court\u2019s opinion, derivative in nature. That is, the injury they allegedly caused Fund shareholders (depletion of Fund assets) is indistinguishable from injury they caused the Funds themselves: the mere fact that Fund assets ultimately belong to the Fund shareholders does not render depletion of those assets injury suffered by shareholders that is distinct from injury suffered by the Funds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 481. The Court reached the very same conclusion in <em>Franklin Funds:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\">In light of [the Third Circuit\u2019s holding in <em>Kauffman v. Dreyfus Fund, Inc., </em>434 F.2d 727, 733 (3d Cir.1970) ], the Court concludes that all of plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injuries are derivative. Because the excessive fees and charges reduced the net asset value of the funds and, in turn, reduced the net asset per share value, the plaintiffs did not sustain an injury distinct from that suffered by the funds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlX\"><em>Franklin Funds, </em>388 F.Supp.2d at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">To the extent the Court characterized the broker compensation practices as causing direct injuries, the Court conflated the losses to the fund attributable to the broker compensation practices with losses to the fund due to other reasons, e.g., poor market performance. After reviewing paragraphs 2, 4 and 108 of the Complaint, the paragraphs the Court relied upon when reaching its conclusion, it is clear that they do not alleged that the broker compensation practices caused \u201cnew investors to join the Funds without any corresponding proportionate increase in Fund assets.\u201d <em>Lord Abbett, </em>385 F.Supp.2d at 482. Instead, they merely allege that the Defendants unjustifiably continued to charge excessive fees even though economies of scale were created as the number of investors in the Fund grew. <em>(See, e.g., </em>Compl. \u00b6 108). Accordingly, the Court erred when it found a fourth form of injury. Instead, after reconsideration of the allegations contained in the Complaint, the Court finds that the Complaint alleges only three forms of injury \u2014 loss due to \u201cexcessive fees,\u201d payment of advisory fees without any corresponding benefit, and \u201cdiminished marginal returns\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 and that they are all derivative. In short, the <em>Lord Abbett </em>opinion, as modified by this opinion, and the <em>Franklin Funds </em>opinion are now in consonance.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">The Court believes that the most efficient and effective means for modifying the Opinion, reported as 385 F.Supp.2d 471, and Order issued on August 30, 2005, is to vacate and withdraw the Opinion and Order and issue an amended version of the Opinion and Order. The amended versions will not contain the discussion pertaining to the fourth form of injury and will grant Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Counts One, Two, Four, and Seven through Ten as being improperly pleaded as direct claims. Furthermore, the Court is aware that Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint subsequent to and based upon the previous <em>Lord Abbett </em>decision. Having withdrawn that decision, the Court will allow Plaintiffs to amend their complaint so that it comports with the amended versions of the Opinion and Order and the Opinion of the Court herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">For the aforementioned reasons, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration is DENIED on all points. Furthermore, Defendants\u2019 motion for reconsideration of the Court\u2019s dismissal of the entire action is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>DENIED, but is GRANTED as to our holding that Plaintiffs\u2019 fourth alleged injury is direct. An appropriate Order accompanies this Opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-6\">. Defendants argue that the <em>Lord Abbett </em>opinion may be read as suggesting \"that the redeemable nature of mutual fund securities transforms what would otherwise clearly be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>derivative injury to a direct one.\u201d (Defs.\u2019 Mot. for Recons, at 3). As seen from the excerpt above, however, where the Court found the first two forms of injury to be derivative, interpreting the Court's Opinion as making that suggestion would be untenable. Further, in <em>Franklin Funds, </em>the Court rejected the argument that mutual funds have a \"novel corporate structure\u201d and should be treated differently than corporations. <em>See Franklin Funds, </em>388 F.Supp.2d at 462-64. Rather, the Court's discussion reg\u00e1rding \"redeemable securities\u201d was meant to illustrate how an injury to shareholders may be differentiated from an injury to a mutual fund. Factually, however, as explained below, that example is not applicable to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b669-13\">. <em>See Lord Abbett, </em>385 F.Supp.2d at 481.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
