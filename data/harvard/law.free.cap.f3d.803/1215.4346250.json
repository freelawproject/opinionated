That jury, however, also acquitted Defendant of aiding and abetting the use of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). On appeal, Defendant argues that the district court erred in impos-' ing (1) a five-level enhancement based on his accomplice\u2019s brandishing of a firearm during the attempted robbery and (2) a two-level enhancement based on injuries inflicted on a victim by this accomplice. After careful review, we affirm Defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-17\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-18\">A. <em>Underlying Offense Conduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1217-19\">On September 2, 2013, Defendant and accomplice Joe Clinton attempted to rob a Walgreens drugstore. After casing the store, Clinton forced manager William Feeney into the manager\u2019s office, while Defendant served as a look-out. In the office, Clinton pointed a gun at Feeney\u2019s head and ordered him to open the safe. Feeney told Clinton that he was unable to do so because he did not have the key. Clinton grabbed Feeney\u2019s keys, but was unable to open the safe. Clinton threatened to shoot Feeney if he did not get the money. After Clinton racked the gun several times in an effort to get it to work, Feeney pulled out a box cutter to defend himself against what appeared to be an imminent attack. Clinton then pistol-whipped Feeney, causing several cuts on Feeney\u2019s head. Clinton and Defendant then fled the store, with Clinton pointing the gun at another, employee and at the store customers as he ran out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>Clinton pled guilty to attempted armed robbery and brandishing a firearm during the robbery. Defendant proceeded to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">B. <em>Trial Testimony of Defendant and Clinton</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-5\">At trial, both Defendant and Clinton testified. As relevant to this appeal, Clinton testified that he and Defendant had talked about robbing the Walgreens store three or four times prior to the actual day of the robbery. Clinton noted that they did not really have a plan, but both decided to bring guns because they \u201cnever [knew] what might happen.\u201d On the night of the robbery, he and Defendant met up earlier and discussed \u201ca few things,\u201d including that Defendant would \u201cwatch [Clinton\u2019s] back\u201d during the robbery. Clinton planned to bring a gun with him and showed the gun to Defendant. Defendant handled the gun and polished it with his t-shirt. Defendant also carried his own gun, a Glock .45. When the two men arrived at the Walgreens, they paced around the store for a few minutes, going in and out of the store to avoid suspicion. When he saw store manager William Fee-ney coming out of the office, Clinton forced Feeney back into the office. Prior to Clinton going into the office, Defendant told him to \u201cgo, go ahead and go,\u201d which Clinton took to mean that he should go ahead and commit the robbery. While Clinton was in the office, he could see, through the office window, that Defendant was acting as a look-out to make sure no one else tried to come into the office. After Clinton assaulted Feeney, he ran out of the office. Then he and Defendant ran out of the store and drove away in the car that Clinton had driven to the scene. Clinton further admitted that, when arrested, he had lied to the police several times about the robbery of the Walgreens, including initially telling the police that another individual, not Defendant, had robbed' the Walgreens with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-9\">On cross-examination, Clinton acknowl- \u2019 edged that he was testifying pursuant to a plea agreement and that, as part of the agreement, the Government had agreed to drop the charges or reduce his sentence on the two robberies, which carried a cumulative mandatory-minimum sentence of 32 years\u2019 imprisonment. He agreed that he would do whatever was in his best interest to reduce his sentence. Clinton further acknowledged that he had told the police that he was schizophrenic and bipolar, had memory problems, and used drugs that affected his memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-10\">Defendant testified in his own defense. He stated that he arrived at the Wal-greens separately from Clinton, believing that he was to meet Clinton at the Wal-greens before going to a club together. After going into the store once to ask an employee about some medication, Defendant continued to go in and out of the store: once to use the bathroom and other times because he did not like waiting outside. Defendant denied having any knowledge that Clinton planned to rob the store or that he was carrying a gun. (Defendant also denied that he was carrying a gun.) According to Defendant, as he was coming out of the bathroom, Clinton ran past him, at which point Defendant saw that Clinton was carrying a gun. Defendant became scared and ran out of the store with Clinton, but did not get into the car with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-11\">On cross-examination, Defendant acknowledged that his testimony conflicted with earlier testimony from a store employee about how many times he had been in and out of the bathroom.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As to footage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>from the surveillance camera that showed him walking out of the Walgreens ahead of Clinton, Defendant said that this demonstrated nothing more than unlucky timing on his part. That is, Defendant just happened to be leaving the bathroom and walking out of the store at the very same moment Clinton fled the office where he had assaulted Feeney. Defendant also admitted that he had lied to the police several times about whether he was at the Walgreens on the night of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">As noted, the jury convicted Defendant of aiding and abetting an attempted armed robbery, but acquitted him of aiding and abetting the. use of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">C. <em>Presentence Investigation Report and Sentencing Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">After the jury\u2019s verdict, the probation office prepared Defendant\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The PSR calculated a base offense level of 20, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(a). Because a firearm was brandished during the commission of the offense, the PSR applied a five-level enhancement under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C). The PSR also applied a separate two-level enhancement, pursuant to \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(A), because bodily injury was caused to a victim of the offense, yielding a total offense level of 27. Defendant had three criminal history points, which yielded a criminal history category of II. Based on a total offense level of 27 and his criminal history category of II, Defendant\u2019s guideline range was 78 to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-8\">Prior to .and at his sentencing hearing, Defendant objected to any enhancement for brandishing a weapon or for causing bodily injury to a victim, both of which were based on Clinton\u2019s conduct. Defendant argued that the brandishing enhancement could be applied only if the Government had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant had advance knowledge that Clinton possessed a gun at the time of the robbery. And Defendant argued that the Government had failed to meet that burden because its evidence rested entirely on Clinton\u2019s testimony, which Defendant deemed not credible. He further contended that enhancing his sentence based on acquitted conduct violated his Sixth Amendment right to trial. Defendant similarly argued that the bodily injury enhancement was improperly applied to him- because Feeney\u2019s injuries were inflicted by Clinton\u2019s use of his gun and, once again, Defendant argued that he had no advance knowledge that Clinton would have a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-10\">The district court overruled both objections. The court determined that, for the above enhancements to apply, the Government had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the relevant conduct at issue was reasonably foreseeable. Looking at the totality of the circumstances of the robbery, along with the surveillance video and Clinton\u2019s and Defendant\u2019s testimony, the court concluded that the Government had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that it was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant that Clinton would brandish a gun during the robbery. As a logical extension of that conclusion, it was also reasonably foreseeable that Clinton might injure someone during the course of the robbery, particularly given the fact that he was carrying a gun. After considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court sentenced Defendant to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-11\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-12\">On appeal, Defendant argues that the district court should not have factored Clinton\u2019s brandishing of a firearm and causing bodily injury into the Guidelines\u2019 calculation for Defendant because Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>dant had been acquitted of aiding and abetting the use of a firearm. Alternatively, he contends that the Government failed to prove such conduct by a preponderance of the evidence. Finally, Defendant throws a new argument into the mix by asserting that the conduct in question could not be counted as relevant conduct based on the Guidelines\u2019 rules on grouping.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Ford, </em>784 F.3d 1386, 1395 (11th Cir.2015). We review any constitutional challenges to the sentence under the same standard. <em>United States v. Pope, </em>461 F.3d 1331, 1333 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>Ford,. </em>784 F.3d at 1396. We will therefore not disturb the district court\u2019s finding of fact unless we have \u201ca definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Among the factual findings a district court may make is whether a preponderance of the evidence supports the application of a sentence enhancement. <em>See United States v. Victor, </em>719 F.3d 1288, 1290 (11th Cir.2013) (reviewing as a finding of fact the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence enhancement, and noting that the prosecution must establish applicability of enhancement by a preponderance of the evidence). Where the district court has made a determination as to a witness\u2019s credibility, we afford that determination substantial deference. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 744 (11th Cir.2007). We will accept a factfinder\u2019s credibility determination unless the proffered evidence is \u201ccontrary to the laws of nature\u201d or is \u201cso inconsistent or improbable on its face that no reasonable factfinder could accept it.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002). The fact that a witness is of dubious character does not, by itself, render his testimony incredible. <em>United States v. Flores, </em>572 F.3d 1254, 1263 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-8\">B. <em>Application of Enhancements Notwithstanding Defendant\u2019s Acquittal on the Charge of Aiding and Abetting Another in the Violation of \u00a7 m(e)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-10\">Although the jury convicted Defendant of the count charging him with aiding and abetting the robbery of the Walgreens store, it acquitted him of the count charging him with aiding and abetting his accomplice in the latter\u2019s use and carrying of a firearm that was brandished during the robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Defendant argues that, given the above acquittal, the district court erred when it applied a 5-level enhancement for brandishing a weapon during the robbery under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) and a 2-level enhancement because a victim of that robbery sustained a bodily injury under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-11\">It is well settled, however, that the sentencing court may consider any fact for which a defendant has been acquitted as long as the Government proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, the occurrence of that conduct and as long as the enhancement results in a sentence below the maximum statutory penalty authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See United States v. Faust, </em>456 F.3d 1342, 1347, 1348 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Poyato, </em>454 F.3d 1295, 1299 (11th Cir.2006). As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201csentencing enhancements [under the Guidelines] do not punish a defendant for crimes of which he was not convicted, but rather increase his sentence because of the manner in which he committed the crime of conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Watts, </em>519 U.S. 148, 154, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>(1997). More to the point, an acquittal does not mean that the defendant is innocent of any particular aspect of the charged criminal conduct; it simply means that the Government failed to prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the charged offense. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1317 &amp; n. 14 (11th Cir.2007). And, because \u201cit is impossible to know exactly why a jury found a defendant not guilty on a certain charge,\u201d a jury cannot be said to have necessarily rejected any particular fact when it returns a general verdict of not guilty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Watts, </em>519 U.S. at 155, 117 S.Ct. 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">Thus, the merits of Defendant\u2019s argument depends on whether the Government proved by a preponderance of the evidence that he engaged in conduct that would warrant the enhancements applied by the sentencing court. We agree with the district court that the Government met its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">In calculating a defendant\u2019s total offense level, a district court must consider all relevant conduct attributable to the defendant. The Guidelines, which explain the term \u201crelevant conduct\u201d in \u00a7 1B1.3, offer three ways in which relevant conduct may arise and be attributable to a defendant for purposes of applying an enhancement. First, relevant conduct includes \u201call acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A). Second, relevant conduct also includes the acts and omissions taken by a defendant \u201cin concert with others\u201d that were in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and that were \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). Third, as to offenses that would be grouped under the Guidelines\u2019 multiple count grouping rules, relevant conduct also includes any acts or omissions that were \u201cpart of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-9\">The district court concluded that the second trigger for relevant conduct, found in \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B), had been satisfied here. So the question becomes whether the Government proved that Defendant and Clinton had engaged in \u201cjointly undertaken criminal activity\u201d and whether Clinton had engaged in acts \u201cin furtherance of that activity\u201d that were reasonably foreseeable to Defendant. Clearly, Defendant and Clinton engaged together in criminal activity: they attempted to rob the Wal-greens store, with Clinton doing the actual robbing and with Defendant acting as the look-out. Indeed, Defendant was convicted of the substantive attempted robbery count, and Clinton pled guilty. Second, it is undisputed that Clinton brandished a firearm while attempting to rob the Wal-greens store manager and that the manager suffered bodily injury when Clinton pistol-whipped him. There is no question that these acts, which are the basis for the enhancements imposed by the district court, were done in furtherance of the jointly undertaken attempted robbery of the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-10\">The only question left then is whether the Government proved by a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>ponderance of the evidence that it would have been reasonably foreseeable to Defendant that the above conduct by his criminal cohort might occur. The district court concluded that the Government had met its burden, and the district court was right. The court found that Defendant knew that his accomplice, Joe Clinton, possessed a firearm at the time he attempted to rob the Walgreens store. While Defendant denies that knowledge, the district court, which had observed both Defendant and Clinton testify at trial, concluded that Clinton\u2019s testimony was credible on this point. We defer to the court\u2019s assessment of the credibility of these witnesses. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 744 (11th Cir.2007). Moreover, the circumstances of the attempted robbery support the court\u2019s credibility determination. Defendant and Clinton had planned to rob this store. It makes sense that Clinton would have shared a detail as important as the fact that he was carrying a gun to the site of the robbery. Indeed, the district court also found that Defendant, himself, was carrying a firearm. And once one concludes that Defendant knew that Clinton was armed with a gun, it makes perfect sense that he could also reasonably anticipate that Clinton might well show that gun to the person whom he was trying to force to hand over the store\u2019s money. After all, isn\u2019t that the primary purpose of bringing a gun to a robbery? As to the injuries suffered by the store manager, the district court was likewise on solid ground in concluding that Defendant could also reasonably anticipate that his admittedly erratic coconspirator might well use that gun, in some way, on anyone who thwarted his efforts to obtain the sought-after money. Thus, based on the above evidence, the district court\u2019s determination regarding the reasonable foreseeability of the abov\u00e9 acts does not give rise to a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Ford, </em>784 F.3d at 1396.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-10\">C. <em>Whether the Guidelines Prohibit Application of the Above Enhancements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-11\">For the first time on appeal, Defendant argues that the Sentencing Guidelines prohibit any consideration of Clinton\u2019s brandishing of a firearm and causing-bodily injury because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d) prohibits the grouping of Defendant\u2019s attempted robbery count of conviction and therefore \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2), which expands the applicability of relevant conduct in offenses that are groupable, does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-12\">We generally review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation and ap~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>plication of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Ford, </em>784 F.3d at 1395. Yet, because Defendant did not raise his grouping argument below, we review this issue for plain error. <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>579 F.3d 1233, 1238 (11th Cir.2009). Under plain error review, we will reverse where there is \u201c(1) an error (2) that is plain and (3) that has affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights; and ... (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Madden, </em>733 F.3d 1314, 1322 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">Defendant\u2019s argument has no merit under either a plain error or <em>de novo </em>standard of review. This is so because, as explained above, \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) clearly permitted the district court to consider the reasonably foreseeable acts of Clinton, and it was reasonably foreseeable that Clinton would brandish the gun that Defendant knew him to be carrying and that a victim might thereafter suffer a bodily injury. This is also so because \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2), on which Defendant relies, is not remotely applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">As to the inapplicability of \u00a7 IB 1.3(a)(2),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> this subsection applies only to the type of offense that would be grouped under \u00a7 3D1.2(d) were there to be multiple counts of conviction. Because a robbery offense is clearly <em>not </em>the type of offense that would be grouped,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> this subsection does not even make it out of the starting gate for purposes of analyzing the relevant conduct in this case. But even if it did apply, it would <em>expand, </em>not contract, the possible relevant conduct to include reasonably foreseeable acts that were \u201cpart of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-10\">Second, the fact that \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2) does not apply to the present offense of conviction does not mean that \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B), which clearly permits inclusion of the conduct at issue as relevant conduct, is thereby neutered. Indeed, \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2) cannot even be triggered unless there are first acts that would fit within either \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(A) or (B). Further, the fact that \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2) will not apply to a particular count of conviction does not mean that other subsections of the relevant conduct provision cannot be given effect. As noted, \u00a7 lB1.3(a) expands the potential relevant conduct for groupable offenses. It does not contract use of relevant conduct for other type of offenses. Were that the case, relevant conduct would be an infrequent occurrence, given the specificity of the fact pattern that can give rise to \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2). <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>431 F.3d 767, 772-73 (11th Cir.2005) (rejecting relevant conduct analysis undertaken by district court pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2) because offense did not re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>quire grouping under \u00a7 3D1.2(d), but remanding to district court for relevant conduct analysis under \u201cthe other provisions of \u00a7 1B1.3\u201d); <em>United States v. Ashford, </em>718 F.3d 377, 382-83 (4th Cir.2013) (holding that even when grouping is not permitted under \u00a7 3D1.2(D) and relevant conduct analysis cannot be conducted under \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2), the district court should consider whether conduct is relevant under \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)); <em>United States v. Cuthbertson, </em>138 F.3d 1325, 1327 (10th Cir.1998) (holding that when an offense is specifically excluded from grouping by \u00a7 3D1.2(d), \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2) does not apply, but instead the court is to limit its relevant conduct analysis to \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">Indeed, the Guidelines make clear that more than one subsection of \u00a7 1B1.3 may apply to the same offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment. (illus.(a)(l)) (stating that \u201c[i]n certain cases, a defendant may be accountable for particular conduct under more than one subsection of this guideline.\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (illus.(b)(1)) (reiterating that \u201ca defendant may be accountable for particular conduct under more than one subsection\u201d and using as an example the fact that a bank robber who drove the getaway car could be accountable under \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(A) for the money taken during the robbery because he aided and abetting the taking of the money (which was the specific objective of the conspiracy), and also be accountable for injury to the teller under subsection (a)(1)(B) because such conduct was reasonably foreseeable given the nature of the offense). <em>See also United States v. Jones, </em>32 F.3d 1512, 1515, 1520 (11th Cir.1994) (holding that enhancements based on Jones\u2019s accomplices\u2019 reckless behavior, including brandishing a firearm, was relevant conduct under \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) in sentence for aiding and abetting robbery).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">In short, the fact that multiple provisions of the relevant conduct section may be potentially applicable in a given case does not mean that all provisions must apply in order for relevant conduct to be recognized. We therefore conclude that the district properly considered as relevant conduct the brandishing of a firearm by Defendant\u2019s accomplice and the injury suffered by a victim at the hand of that accomplice. This conclusion means that the court did not plainly err.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">III.

United </em>States, - U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1240, 188 L.Ed.2d 248 (2014), Defendant also argues that for the challenged enhancements to apply, the Government had to establish that he had advance knowledge that Clinton possessed a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"AqLP\">But, as explained, the Government proved that knowledge by a preponderance of the evidence, which is the standard that applies to such sentencing decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"AaEc\">Plus, <em>Rosemond </em>set out the facts that the Government must prove (beyond a reasonable doubt) in order to <em>convict </em>a defendant of aiding and abetting a \u00a7 924(c) count; the decision clearly did not address the standards for determining whether a sentencing enhancement should apply under a Guidelines\u2019 provision that expressly applies to conduct that is reasonably foreseeable, not just conduct that one actually knows in advance will occur.</p>\n<p id=\"ATr\">To the extent that Defendant is arguing that the Government also had to prove that Defendant actually knew to a certainty that Defendant would actually brandish the gun, even <em>Rose-mond </em>did not require such knowledge to sustain a \u00a7 924(c) conviction. <em>See United States v. Payne, </em>763 F.3d 1301, 1304 n. 2 (11th Cir.2014) <em>(Rosemond </em>required only that a defendant know that one of his confederates was carrying a gun; it did not require knowledge that this confederate would brandish the gun.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2) applies \"solely\u201d to an offense that is of the type that it would be grouped, were there multiple counts of conviction for this offense. And if that type of offense of conviction is present, then relevant conduct will also include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-8\">all acts and omissions described in subdivisions (1)(A) [aiding and abetting] and (1)(B) [reasonably foreseeable acts] that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay9\">As explained in text and in note 5, <em>infra, </em>because a robbery offense is not groupable, the premise of \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2) is absent and this subsection has no applicability to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1223-11\">. Section 3D 1.2(d) provides that where the offense level is determined largely based on factors that are quantifiable, such as loss amount, certain counts of conviction, such as drug trafficking offenses, are to be grouped (that is, the offense level will be determined based on the total amount involved) and other specified offenses, such as robbery, will not be grouped (meaning that each count of conviction for those specified offenses may result in the addition of more offense levels consistent with the grouping rules found in \u00a7 3D 1.3 and 3D 1.4). Translation: a robbery offense is not groupable under this particular provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
