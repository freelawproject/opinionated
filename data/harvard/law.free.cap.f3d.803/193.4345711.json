Pina-Galindo contends that, because that subsection provides that an alien convicted of \u201can offense under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1182(a)(2)\u201d is not eligible for cancellation of removal, the plain reading of the statute shows that only aliens who have been convicted of a single offense for a crime involving moral turpitude or a controlled-substance offense, as set forth in \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A), are ineligible for cancellation of removal. Pina-Galindo further asserts that the legislative history of \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C) supports his interpretation. He urges that if this court determines that the statutory language is ambiguous, the BIA\u2019s interpretation is impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">Because the BIA\u2019s decision is published, it has precedential force and is entitled to deference under <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>See Dhuka v. Holder, </em>716 F.3d 149, 154 (5th Cir.2013); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(g) (providing that published decisions issued by three-member panels of the BIA are precedents). Under <em>Chevron </em>deference, a court reviewing an agency\u2019s interpretation must first ask \u201cwhether the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue before it.\u201d <em>Orellana-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 517 (5th Cir.2012). If Congress\u2019s unambiguously expressed intent \u201con the precise question at issue\u201d is clear from the language of the statute, no interpretation is needed, because Congress\u2019s \u201cintention is the law and must be given effect.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43 <em>&amp; </em>n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 2778. If a statute is silent or ambiguous, an agency\u2019s interpretations of a statute it administers are given \u201ccontrolling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778; <em>Orellana-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 517 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">The BIA rejected Pina-Galindo\u2019s theory that the term \u201coffense,\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C), cannot include offenses listed in \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(B). The BIA noted that although it had consistently found that the language of \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) included all the offenses listed in \u00a7 1182(a)(2), its prior decisions were not necessarily dispositive because they had involved aliens who were ineligible under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A). The. BIA, assuming that the statute was ambiguous, examined the legislative history and determined that Pina-Galindo\u2019s argument on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>that point was unpersuasive. The agency noted that the language quoted by Pina-Galindo to show legislative intent did not track the language contained in the statute. Also, the BIA looked to <em>Ramos-Godinez v. Mukasey, </em>295 Fed.Appx. 733, 733-34 (5th Cir.2008) (per curiam), determining that an alien convicted of multiple offenses with an aggregate sentence of more than five years was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The plain language of \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C) references an \u201coffense under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)\u201d and does not limit ineligibility for cancellation of removal to offenses under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A). Additionally, as noted in <em>Ramos-Godinez, </em>Congress has twice amended the statute without changing the reference to \u00a7 1182(a)(2). <em>See Ramos-Godinez, </em>295 Fed.Appx. at 734. Even if there is ambiguity, the BIA\u2019s construction of \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(2)(B) and 1229b(b)(1)(C) in the instant ease is a reasonable interpretation of the statutory language that is entitled to deference. <em>See Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED. Pina-Galindo\u2019s motion for a stay of deportation is likewise DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
