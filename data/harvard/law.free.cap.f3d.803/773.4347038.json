The district court affirmed the acting Commissioner\u2019s decision and Morgan now appeals. Because the ALJ based his decision on a credibility assessment of Morgan\u2019s testimony without holding an additional hearing as required by HALLEX, we hold that Appellant was prejudiced by the HALLEX violation and accordingly REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND with instructions that the case be remanded to the Commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">Morgan applied to the Social Security Administration to receive disability insurance and supplemental income benefits following injuries he sustained when he fell off an 18-wheeler while working as an auto-glass technician. He claimed he suffered injuries to his back, his left shoulder and his left leg, and that these injuries, along with the resultant pain, prevented him from maintaining gainful employment. After the Commissioner denied his application, Morgan requested an administrative hearing, which was held in front of Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) Elizabeth Palacios. Morgan testified at this hearing and was represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">Hearing Office Chief ALJ Michael Hert-zig issued the final decision in place of ALJ Palacios. The record is silent as to why ALJ Palacios was unavailable. The decision ends with a single paragraph asserting that ALJ Hertzig replaced ALJ Palacios with her authorization and in accordance with the applicable regulation, and states that ALJ Hertzig did so after he \u201creviewed all the evidence of record as well as the prior hearings\u201d and found there was \u201cno need to conduct a supplemental hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-13\">In the decision, ALJ Hertzig made a series of findings, including that Morgan had not engaged in gainful activity since his declared date of injury; that Morgan suffered from disorders of the back, substance addiction disorder and affective disorder; and that Morgan would be unable to work as an auto-glass technician. The ALJ also found that because Morgan\u2019s \u201cresidual functional capacity\u201d (his ability to work) allowed him to perform jobs that were available in the national economy (such as industrial cleaner, dining room attendant, and cafeteria attendant), Morgan was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-14\">Morgan first requested review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision through the Social Security Appeals Council, but was denied. He filed his complaint in federal district court seeking judicial review pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), and the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. After the district court denied Morgan\u2019s motion and granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion, Morgan timely appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-16\">Appellant makes six arguments to challenge the Commissioner\u2019s ruling on appeal. Because we conclude that a remand is required under Morgan\u2019s second argument regarding the ALJ\u2019s credibility assessment, we need not reach Morgan\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same standard that the district court applied. <em>Spellman v. Shalala, </em>1 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.1993). Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision, like the district court\u2019s review, is limited under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) to two inquiries: (1) whether substantial evidence of record supports the decision; and (2) whether the decision comports with proper legal standards. <em>Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 236 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">A claimant is \u201cdisabled\u201d as defined in the Social Security Act if the claimant is unable \u201cto engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). The Commissioner uses a sequential, five-step approach<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to determine whether a claimant is so disabled: (1) whether the claimant is presently performing substantial gainful activity; (2) whether the claimant has a severe impairment; (3)whether the impairment meets or equals a listed impairment; (4) whether the impairment prevents the claimant from doing past relevant work; and (5) whether the impairment prevents the claimant from performing any other substantial gainful activity. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4), 416.920(a)(4). Under this five-step approach, if the Commissioner determines at a prior step that the applicant is or is not disabled, the evaluation process stops, and the Commissioner does not go on to the next step. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">At step five, the ALJ determined that Morgan was not disabled because Morgan has the residual functional capacity to perform medium work, and, upon consideration of Morgan\u2019s age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity, there are jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Morgan can perform. The ALJ found that Morgan\u2019s level of pain did not prevent Morgan from engaging in other substantial gainful activity, in contradiction to Morgan\u2019s, and his doctor\u2019s, assertions that Morgan\u2019s pain was completely disabling.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The ALJ based this finding largely .on Morgan\u2019s drug-seeking behavior, as evidenced in Morgan\u2019s medical records,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as well as the fact that Morgan\u2019s testimony was \u201cinconsistent with the ... residual functional capacity assessment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">Morgan challenges the ALJ\u2019s credibility assessment for, among other reasons, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>fact that the ALJ who made the credibility assessment was not the same ALJ who conducted the hearing at which Morgan testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Under our binding precedent, Social Security administrative hearings must follow their own policies. <em>See Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 459 (5th Cir.2000). Such hearings are governed by the policies set forth in an internal manual called the Hearings, Appeals, and Litigation Law Manual (HALLEX).' While other courts have held HALLEX not binding on the Commissioner,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Fifth Circuit utilizes the following stringent standard: \u201cwhile HALLEX does not carry the authority of law, ... \u2018where the rights of individuals are affected, an agency must follow its own procedures, even where the internal procedures ' are more rigorous than otherwise would be required,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c[i]f prejudice results from a violation, the result cannot stand.\u201d <em>Newton, </em>209 F.3d at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">HALLEX \u00a7 1-2-8-40 provides ALJs with applicable procedures to follow when an ALJ who conducts a hearing is unable to issue a decision. The manual instructs that the case may be reassigned to a different ALJ, and the ALJ to whom the case is reassigned will review the record and determine whether another hearing is required. The manual gives examples of when such a hearing would be required, including: \u201c[A]nother hearing would be necessary if ... the claimant alleges disabling pain, and the ALJ believes the claimant\u2019s credibility and demeanor could be a significant factor in deciding the case.\u201d HALLEX, \u00a7 1-2-8-40 (2008), http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OP_Home/ hallex/I-02/I-2-8-40.html.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Here, Morgan\u2019s credibility was not only a significant factor in deciding his case, it was essential to the decision. The ALJ acknowledged in the decision that \u201cwhenever statements about the intensity, persistence, or functionally limiting effects of pain or other symptoms are not substantiated by objective medical evidence, the [ALJ] must make a finding on the credibility of the statements based on a consideration of the entire case record.\u201dThe ALJ concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-11\">After careful consideration of the evidence, the undersigned finds that the claimant\u2019s medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause the alleged symptoms; however, the claimant\u2019s statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are not credible to the extent they are inconsistent with the above residual functional capacity assessment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">Morgan\u2019s credibility regarding his level of pain thus went directly to whether Morgan could perform any other substantial gainful activity, and this step was the step upon which the Commissioner denied Morgan\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-13\">A finding that Morgan\u2019s testimony regarding pain was not credible may very well have been supported by substantial evidence \u2014 had the ALJ actually heard the testimony. But ALJ Hertzig forwent an additional hearing and assumed that an examination of the record was sufficient. Without hearing Morgan\u2019s testimony, or having seen Morgan in person, the ALJ violated HALLEX 'by concluding that Morgan\u2019s testimony was not credible. In this circuit, \u201c \u2018where the rights of individuals are affected, an agency must follow its own procedures, even where the internal procedures are more rigorous than otherwise would be required,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c[i]f prejudice results from a violation, the result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>cannot stand.\u201d <em>Newton, </em>209 F.3d at 459. Here, Morgan\u2019s rights were affected by the Commissioner\u2019s denial of his claim, and the discrediting of Morgan\u2019s testimony by the ALJ prejudiced his claim, as it directly resulted in the denial of Morgan\u2019s claim. Because the ALJ\u2019s violation of HALLEX prejudiced Morgan, a remand for rehearing before an ALJ is warranted. <em>See, e.g., Kane v. Heckler, </em>731 F.2d 1216, 1220 (5th Cir.1984) (providing the remedy of a remand when HALLEX was violated and prejudiced the claimant).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-3\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Because the ALJ violated HALLEX such that Morgan\u2019s rights were affected and Morgan was prejudiced by the violation, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and Remand the case with instructions that it be remanded to the Commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-6\">. The burden of proof is on the claimant at the first four steps. <em>Leggett v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 558, 564 (5th Cir.1995). The burden of proof shifts to the Commissioner at the fifth step to establish the existence of other available substantial gainful employment that a claimant can perform. <em>Fraga v. Bowen, </em>810 F.2d 1296, 1301-02 (5th Cir.1987). If the Commissioner identifies such employment, the burden shifts back to the claimant to prove that she could not perform the alternative work identified. <em>Id. </em>at 1302.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b776-7\">. \u201cThe sequential evaluation process is a series of five 'steps' that we follow in a set order.... If we can find that you are disabled or not disabled at a step, we make our determination or decision and we do not go on to the next step.

One of Morgan\u2019s doctors, Dr. Thomas, opined that Morgan could not work because of his severe back pain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b776-14\">. The ALJ concluded that Morgan claimed to suffer from severe pain merely in order to acquire prescription medications and, for that reason, Morgan's testimony as to the severity of his pain was not credible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b777-8\">. <em>See, e.g., Moore v. Apfel, </em>216 F.3d 864, 868 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that because HALLEX does not have the force and effect of law, it is not binding on the Commissioner).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
