Haddon, District Judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b503-8\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">We have considered both the government\u2019s and petitioners\u2019 responses to the Order to Show Cause dated August 13, 2015, and these submissions have satisfied us that no government attorney provided information to the press with the object of influencing this appeal. Rather, it appears that a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokesperson provided information about this case in response to an inquiry by a <em>Los Angeles Times </em>reporter on July 16, 2015, and that the timing of the article\u2019s publication was only coincidentally related to the date of the hearing. We therefore discharge the Order to Show Cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">Though we appreciate the government\u2019s prompt and respectful submission, we remain concerned that government counsel made an argument based on evidence not properly before this court, which left an impression contrary to the facts surrounding Kaene Dean\u2019s immigration bond hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">Under review are cross-motions for summary judgment. We are therefore limited to considering evidence that was before the district court when it issued its ruling, unless we take judicial notice of the new evidence pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(a); <em>LVRC Holdings LLC v. Brekka, </em>581 F.3d 1127, 1136 (9th Cir.2009). Government counsel did not request judicial notice of the July 21, 2015, <em>Los Angeles Times </em>article, which referenced Mr. Dean\u2019s bond hearings. Nor was the article properly a subject for judicial notice as it contained representations neither \u201cgenerally known within the trial court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction\u201d nor \u201caccurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 201(b). Unfortunately, the representations made to the court by government counsel about those proceedings appear to have been based on the news article, which included partial and potentially misleading information concerning the proceedings. <em>See </em>Model Rules of Prof'l Conduct r. 3.3; Cal. Rules of Prof'l Conduct r. 5-200.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-14\">Government counsel argued to the panel that Mr. Dean was <em>initially </em>denied release on bond under the \u00a7 1226(a) standard, but that under the <em>Rodriguez </em>preliminary injunction standard, in a second bond hearing, the immigration judge (IJ) concluded that Mr. Dean had to be released because the government had not carried its bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>den.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government has now provided us with the transcript of the April 28, 2015, <em>Rodriguez </em>bond hearing. The transcript shows that the IJ conducted a total of four bond hearings for Mr. Dean and had previously released him twice on bond with conditions <em>before </em>she held the bond hearing pursuant to <em>Rodriguez. </em>On each occasion, Mr. Dean violated the conditions of release on bond and was returned to detention. <em>See </em>Apr. 28, 2015 Tr. at 16 (\u201c[Y]ou\u2019ve been given bond twice before, and you\u2019ve broken the terms of the bond twice before.\u201d). Mr. Dean\u2019s release on bond on the prior two occasions was not due to the government\u2019s failure to meet the <em>Rodriguez </em>standard, as the district court did not issue its preliminary injunction until September 13, 2012. Moreover, as the IJ states, she released Mr. Dean on bond on April 28, 2015, because she concluded that Mr. Dean\u2019s predatory behavior was treatable, his mother presented a concrete treatment plan, and Mr. Dean and his mother assured her that he would comply with it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 14-17. The IJ also reasoned that, \u201cat the last hearing,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>on December 2, 2014 (the \u201cinitial\u201d hearing to which government counsel referred) when Mr. Dean was denied release on bond, Mr. Dean\u2019s mother wasn\u2019t sure if Mr. Dean would consent to mental health treatment. <em>Id. </em>at 15.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">We do not see the relevance of Mr. Dean\u2019s immigration proceedings to the legal issues on appeal, and neither in its response to the Order to Show Cause nor at any time in a proper way, <em>e.g., </em>a letter brief filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j), has government counsel explained the relevance. We will therefore disregard the <em>Los Angeles Times </em>article and government counsel\u2019s arguments referencing it. However, we find no basis for concluding that government counsel deliberately attempted to mislead the court by relying on only a partial and potentially misleading news report of Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Deans immigration proceedings; we therefore do not find her conduct in doing so sanctionable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ADa\">The Order to Show Cause is discharged; no sanctions are imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"Azu\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-4\">. Counsel argued that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aar\">We know that initially the hearing was conducted under the 1226(a) standard, that the first hearing when he was taken into custody was conducted under that standard. That standard places the burden on the individual alien to prove that he is not a flight risk or a danger. The IJ denied bond and said that this person is not entitled to release. It was only after 180 days passed and we then conducted the hearing again anew under the standard under the preliminary injunction, which requires the government to prove by clear and convincing evidence, that that individual was released. It was concluded by the immigration judge that the government had not carried the burden....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4n\">Oral Argument at 12:23-13:00; <em>see also id. </em>at 10:44-10:53.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A1h\">. As the IJ explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfX\">I am going to grant you bond. I think what's going on here is treatable. I don't think there\u2019s enough evidence to show that you're a danger. Well it\u2019s a disturbing record but it's not enough for me to find that you\u2019re a danger and not eligible for bond. It is disturbing though. But I think it\u2019s treatable. I think this is something you can figure out. Okay? So I\u2019m going to grant you bond. Because you\u2019ve broken bond twice before though it has to be a significant bond. Even though I gave you $10,000 bond and you got in trouble, I\u2019m going to do $10,000 again. But obviously I\u2019m going to add a couple things to it. I\u2019m going to add a requirement that you report to the Department of Homeland Security once a month, and I\u2019m requiring that you enroll in a mental health treatment plan with the Santa Marita Mental Health Center. This is the program that your mother has provided us with evidence of. You must do that. You must go to that center and set up the treatment plan within 10 days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVv\"><em>Id. </em>at 16-17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A12\">.The government's response to the Order to Show Cause indicates that there is no transcript of the December 2, 2014, proceeding available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"A4m\">.
