Appellant alleged that her husband, S. J. Goodrich was an habitual drunkard, and that \u201cbetween the dates of August 1st to the 30th of that month, 1907, and on divers dates at and about that time,\u201d Wallis sold and delivered to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>said husband in his (Wallis\u2019) place of business, intoxicating liquor. In their answer, appellees set up as a bar to appellant\u2019s right to recover for the breach alleged of the bond, a judgment rendered in cause Mo. 9702, being a suit by appellant against appellees to recover for alleged breaches of the bond by Wallis, \u201cabout August 3rd to 10th, 1907,\u201d and on \u201cdivers days and dates\u201d about that time, by selling to her said husband, then an habitual drunkard, and by selling to him after he (Wallis) had been notified by her not to do so, intoxicating liquor. It appeared from the judgment rendered in said cause Mo. 9702, that the court sustained a demurrer to the part of the petition setting up as a ground for the recovery sought, that Wallis had sold intoxicating liquor to the plaintiff\u2019s husband, after he had been notified by her not to do so. Thereupon the \u201cplaintiff announced,\u201d the judgment recites, \u201cthat she would not insist upon the allegations that her husband was an habitual drunkard, and that no liability of the defendant is claimed in the suit except that based upon the written notice given, that she would not urge the single question of his being an habitual drunkard.\u201d \u201cWherefore,\u201d the judgment concludes, \u201cthe court having sustained the demurrer and plaintiff having declined to amend, it is hereby ordered that plaintiff take nothing by this suit, and the case is hereby dismissed at the plaintiff\u2019s cost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">It appears from recitals in the judgment from which this appeal is prosecuted that the court, after hearing \u201cthe matters of fact as well as of law\u201d relating to said plea, found that the \u201cmatters and facts set out\u201d in it were true, and thereupon, sustained same and dismissed appellant\u2019s suit. In so doing, we think the court erred. It afihnatively appeared from -the recitals in the judgment in said cause Mo. 9702, that appellant\u2019s right to recover for a breach by Wallis of his bond in selling liquor to appellant\u2019s husband, then an habitual drunkard, had not been litigated. The court had neither sustained a demurrer to that part of the petition which set up as ground for a recovery the breach by Wallis of his bond in selling liquor to an habitual drunkard, nor had he otherwise -determined that question on its merits. Philipowski v. Spencer, 63 Texas, 605; Teal v. Terrell, 48 Texas, 491; 9 Enc. Plead. &amp; Prac., 621. He had merely dismissed appellant\u2019s suit based on that ground, because she had declined to further prosecute it. A judgment dismissing a cause for want of -prosecution is not <em>res adjudicata </em>as to another -suit based on -the same cause, of 'action. Worst v. Sgitcovich, 46 S. W., 72. And \u201ca judgment,\u201d quoting from the syllabus to Jackson v. Finley, 40 S. W., 427, \u201cagainst a. plaintiff on his refusal to amend his petition after exceptions -thereto have been sustained, is not an adjudication on the merits -of a cause of 'action stated therein, as to which exceptions were overruled, and will not bar another action thereon.\u201d Moreover, appellant sought in said suit Mo. 9702, to recover on account of sales made to her husband \u201cabout August 3rd to 10th, 1907,\u201d while in this suit resulting in the judgment from which this appeal is prosecuted, she sought to recover on account of sales made to him \u201cbetween the dates of August 1st to the 30th of that month, 1907.\u201d Certainly the judgment rendered in said cause Mo. 9702, was not a bar to appellant\u2019s right to recover for sales made to her husband after August 10, 1907.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>The judgment will be reversed, and the cause will be remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
