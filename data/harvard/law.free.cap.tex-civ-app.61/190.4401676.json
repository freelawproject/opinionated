A trial before the court without a jury on May 12, 1909, resulted in a judgment in favor of plaintiff for $1467. From this judgment appellant perfected an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">The first contention presented in appellant\u2019s brief is that plaintiff\u2019s cause of action being based upon an alleged violation of an interstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>tariff, claimed to be in force between defendant and connecting lines, which required it to make this refund upon shipments from the Indian Territory to Sherman, its suit should have been commenced in the United States courts, which alone have jurisdiction. This contention is not tenable. The question of jurisdiction is to be determined by the averments of the petition and not by the Federal' questions presented defensively in the answer of defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s petition does not present a Federal question conferring jurisdiction exclusively on the Federal Court's. Louisville &amp; N. Ry. Co. v. Mottley, 211 U. S., 149; Railway Co. v. Neaves, opinion of this court, 60 Texas Civ. App.,\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\">The appellant cites the case of Gulf, C. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v. Moore, 98 Texas, 302, in support of its contention. This was a suit to recover on a cause of action based on section 3 of the Interstate Commerce Law, and it was held in such a case the courts of the United States alone had jurisdiction. This case is not controlled by the holding in that case. The sole issue in this case is, as to the meaning and interpretation to be given the tariff put out by appellant, and the Interstate Commerce Law does not affect such interpretation. The State courts are not without jurisdiction to interpret a tariff though it is interstate and established, and required by the Act of Congress. Galveston, H. &amp; S. A. Ry. Co. v. Piper, 52 Texas Civ. App., 568, (115 S. W,. 107); Nelson v. Southern Railway Co., 172 Fed. Rep., 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The trial court filed conclusions of fact from which it appears appellant had on file two circulars fixing tariffs for the shipment of cotton, one I. C. C. Flo. 5361, and the other, I. C. C. F\u00edo. 5360. The last named circular was a joint through tariff and applied only to cotton when delivered for final shipments to seaports and other points named therein, east of the Mississippi Biver. Sherman was not included as one of the points therein named, and it would seem that the cotton could not have been concentrated at Sherman under said tariff circular. It is true that joint circular F\u00edo. 5360 named a rate of five percent less on cotton linters, than it did on other grades of cotton, but this circular expressly refers to circular I. C. C. Ho. 5361, for concentration rules and privileges. In construing these circulars the trial court held that circular Ho. 5361 applied to both cotton and cotton linters, and that the word \u201ccotton\u201d used therein, included \u201ccotton linters,\u201d and appellant\u2019s contention that the court erred in such holding is not sustained. Hor did the court err in his finding that the cotton was.shipped to or concentrated at Sherman under circular Ho. 5361, which contained a rule that when cotton is re-shipped over appellant\u2019s line, through rate from point of origin to final destination, will be protected. Protection of the through rate from point of origin, which in this case was Madill and Boff, Indian Territory, necessarily involves refunding the charges for shipment to concentration point, which' was Sherman. The cost of shipment from Madill and Boff, Indian Territory, to Sherman, was $1.50 per bale.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Finding no error in the judgment, the same is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
