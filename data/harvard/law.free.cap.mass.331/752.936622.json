The plaintiff was named as beneficiary. The policy provided for an additional benefit of $10,000, for death caused directly by a bodily injury sustained solely by external, violent, and accidental means, if death occurred within 90 days after such injury, and such injury was evidenced by a visible wound or contusion. But the additional benefit was not to be payable \u201cif such death occurs while the insured is in military, naval or air service in time of war, whether such war be declared or undeclared.\u201d On June 25, 1951, the insured died in Virginia through an injury in an automobile accident which was within the provision for additional benefit except for circumstances to be stated. At the time of his death the insured was in the naval service of the United States, stationed in North Carolina, and was on an unexpired furlough. The defendant paid the principal sum of $10,000, but refused to pay the additional benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">Before the death of the insured the United States navy was engaged in battle in Korea for the purpose of repelling an attack by North Korea upon the Republic of Korea and thus of performing the obligation of the United States under the charter of the United Nations, and had suffered thousands of casualties.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>The only question is, whether the death of the insured occurred \u201cwhile the insured is in military, naval or air service in time of war, whether such war be declared or undeclared.\u201d The Superior Court reported the case, which was presented on a case stated, without making any decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The fighting in Korea was not preceded or accompanied by any declaration of war. But that has been true of many wars. In a policy of insurance, the word \u201cwar\u201d includes everything that ordinary people regard as war, and clearly includes a conflict between the armed forces of different nations under the authority of their respective governments. <em>Stankus </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co. </em>312 Mass. 366. <em>Langlas </em>v. <em>Iowa Life Ins. Co. </em>245 Iowa, 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Under the policy, the defendant escapes liability if the insured was in the naval service when he died, although his death was not the result of his service. <em>Laurendeau </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins.
