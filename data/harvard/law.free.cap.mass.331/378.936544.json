The family physician was the only witness before the single member. The following facts could be found from his testimony. The decedent was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>accustomed to have the doctor examine him each year. He was examined on March 18, 1949, and no trace of any heart disease was found. He next saw the doctor on April 24, 1950, and told him that while on duty on April 18, 1950, he had become involved in an altercation with the operator of an automobile whom he had chased, that he had experienced a pain in his chest which developed during the argument with the operator, that he became pale and was required to sit down and rest, and that a fellow inspector happened to observe his condition and gave him some nitroglycerin tablets which relieved him. He had never complained to the doctor, prior to the visit of April 24, 1950, of any heart condition. There was a connection between the incident of April 18, 1950, and his condition on April 24, 1950. It was the first time the witness had discovered any evidence of coronary artery disease and in his opinion it was precipitated by the chasing of and argument with the motorist. The employee saw the doctor on February 1, 1951. He complained of pain. The electrocardiogram disclosed a condition consistent with a coronary artery disease and also \u201can old anterior infarction, a myocardial infarction.\u201d He was advised to stop work for a few months. He rested for about two months when he returned to work on a light duty basis, and he continued doing light work until October, 1951, when he suffered another heart attack which caused his death. The angina pectoris which the doctor diagnosed in April, 1950, was the first symptom that the coronary artery was insufficient; the first symptom is often precipitated by an emotional upset or a physical activity, and in the natural train of events death followed, as it did here, from an acute myocardial infarction.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The statute, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 233, \u00a7 65, as appearing in St. 1943, c. 232, \u00a7 1, providing for the admission of certain declarations of a deceased person, applies to proceedings under the workmen\u2019s compensation act, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, <em>Pigeon\u2019s Case, </em>216 Mass. 51; and the admission of such declarations imports a finding that the statutory conditions precedent to their admission have been satisfied. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number><em>Rothwell </em>v. <em>First National Bank, </em>286 Mass. 417, 420. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Bernoi, </em>297 Mass. 271, 274. The statements of the decedent on April 24, 1950, to his family physician were properly considered as substantive evidence. <em>Filosa\u2019s Case, </em>295 Mass. 592. The evidence, although somewhat meager, was in our opinion sufficient to support the finding that the death arose out of and in the course of his employment. <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487. <em>Griffin\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 71. <em>O\u2019Flaherty\u2019s Case, </em>325 Mass. 303.
