L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 151A, \u00a7 42, as appearing in St. 1943, c. 534, \u00a7 6, as amended by St. 1947, c. 434, the petitioner challenges the statement in the judge\u2019s report that \u201cthere is some evidence to support the finding of the board of review,\u201d which denied unemployment benefits under the employment security law. The petitioner was discharged by the respondent Hayes Bickford Lunch System, Inc., a chain lunchroom operator, on September 25, 1950. An original determination that he was entitled to benefits was reversed by the authorized representative of the director. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 151 A, \u00a7 39, as appearing in St. 1949, c. 659. This action was upheld by the board of review after a hearing by a review examiner. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 151A, \u00a7 41, as appearing in St. 1941, c. 685, \u00a7 1. The ground for the denial of benefits was that the petitioner was guilty of \u201cdeliberate misconduct in wilful violation of the employing unit\u2019s interest.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 (e) (2), as appearing in St. 1941, c. 685, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The specific misconduct found by the review examiner was that the petitioner, who was employed as a counterman, did not comply with a company rule that each sale must be rung in on the cash register. That the rule was known to the petitioner is apparently not in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The only witnesses before the review examiner were the petitioner and one Mason, personnel manager of the company. Mason\u2019s testimony on the vital issue was entirely hearsay. He expressly disclaimed any contention that the petitioner had misappropriated funds, and testified that on three occasions it had been reported to one Morrissey, the general manager of the company in Boston, that the petitioner had not registered a sale promptly. The respective informants were a company official from New York named Davenport; one Moore, \u201cpresident of our California branch\u201d; and \u201ca trusted employee\u201d who worked in the same restaurant as the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The applicable statutory provision is: \u201cthe findings of the board of review as to the facts, if supported by any evidence, shall be conclusive . . ..\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 151A, \u00a7 42, as appearing in St. 1943, c. 534, \u00a7 6, as amended by St. 1947, c. 434. <em>Wagstaff </em>v. <em>Director of the Division of Employment Security, </em>322 Mass. 664.

In the testimony of Mason before the review examiner the following appears: Q. \u201cDid he admit \u2014 Mr. Gross [the authorized representative of the director referred to above] says that he admitted that he didn\u2019t ring up all sales?\u201d A. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. He did admit that he may not have rung up all the sales.\u201d Q. \u201cOn that particular day [September 24, 1950] or other days?\u201d A. \u201cWell, there [is] a little hesitation there, a little question on that.\u201d The testimony of the petitioner was: Q. \u201c[D]id you state before Mr. Gross that it\u2019s possible that on this particular Sunday afternoon, at the time Mr. Moore was there, that you had not rung up this sale?\u201d A. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say that.\u201d Q. \u201cDid you say you may have failed to do so on that particular day?\u201d A. \u201cOn that particular day, no.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The decision of the review examiner stated: \u201cThe claimant contends that he at no time failed to record sales on the register for the purpose of misappropriating the money but admits that on occasion sales were not recorded because of various reasons: (1) when the tape had run out and another had not as yet been put into the register; (2) when the counter was too busy to record sales immediately; and (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>when the register was being read.\u201d It would not be profitable to detail the testimony upon these matters, as the decision was not rested upon them, but contained the following: \u201cTo conclude, the explanations of the claimant are plausible. It does not seem probable . . . however, that three individuals could have erred in their observations.\u201d We fail to find any testimony of the petitioner, or of anyone, for that matter, in corroboration of the hearsay testimony. The decision is based wholly on hearsay and cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The decision of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded to the board of review for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
