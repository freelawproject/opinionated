The question for decision is whether the judge erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to enter a verdict in its favor. In determining whether such a motion should be granted the same test is applied as in the case of a motion for a directed verdict. <em>Holton </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>291 Mass. 513, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>515. <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Dunphy, </em>297 Mass. 345. <em>Brightman </em>v. <em>Blanchette, </em>307 Mass. 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The plaintiff is a corporation engaged in the business of printing books. The defendant, also a corporation, proposed to publish a two volume work called \u201cMasterplots\u201d and desired to have the plaintiff print and bind the work and to supply the paper for it. During the period here material one Walton C. Allen was manager of the plaintiff. He had been in the publishing business since 1920 and during that time had \u201cestimated many thousands of jobs for publishers.\u201d In April, 1949, the plaintiff was requested by one Lightbown to submit to Frank N. Magill, general manager and principal officer of the defendant and the author of \u201cMasterplots,\u201d estimates for the paper, printing, and binding involved in publishing this work. On April 25, 1949, the plaintiff submitted an estimate for the paper and printing of \u201cMasterplots 2 Volumes Quantity 5,000 each/10,000 each.\u201d The plaintiff concedes that this was an estimate for 5,000 or 10,000 sets. Two days later, April 27, the plaintiff submitted a bid for binding \u201cMasterplots Volumes I &amp; II Quantity 5,000/10,000.\u201d The price was quoted as \u201c5,000 copies @ .561 10,000 copies @ .538.\u201d On May 12 Allen and Magill met for the first time and Magill requested Allen to proceed with the work. On May 16 the defendant by one Brown wrote to Allen confirming the \u201cverbal order placed with you on May 12 by Mr. Frank N. Magill, for 5,000 copies of a two volume book known as Masterplots.\u201d It is agreed that Brown was authorized to act for the defendant. The books were subsequently printed and delivered to the defendant and a bill was sent to it on July 30, 1949. In the bill the charge for binding was $.561 per volume.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter the defendant directed the plaintiff\u2019s attention to the fact that it had been overcharged with respect to the binding. The defendant\u2019s position was that the plaintiff\u2019s bid of $.561 was the price <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>for a set of two volumes; the plaintiff contended that the bid was on a per volume basis. It appeared that \u201cMaster-plots\u201d was the defendant's first publication, and that although Magill \u201cwas familiar with the printing of books\u201d when he first met Allen \u201che had never had a book printed before.\u201d Allen testified that binding estimates are submitted on a per volume basis and \u201cthat is a well recognized custom in the book production business and that he was aware of it when he first met Magill.\u201d The foregoing is a summary of the evidence in its aspect most favorable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The defendant\u2019s contention that the agreement was unambiguous and that its construction presented a question of law for the court cannot be sustained. In support of this contention the defendant relies to a considerable extent on a proposal alleged to have been submitted to the plaintiff by the defendant which was introduced in evidence as exhibit 12. But it could have been found that this proposal was never received by the plaintiff. The controversy here stems from the different interpretations placed by the parties on the expression \u201c5,000 copies @ .561 10,000 copies @ .538\u201d contained in the plaintiff\u2019s bid of April 27. But this expression was not unambiguous and it was permissible for the plaintiff to explain its meaning by resort to usages of the trade. <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Tirrell, </em>9 Gray, 401. <em>Lynn Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>180 Mass. 527, 533-534. <em>Harvard Brewing Co. </em>v. <em>Killian, </em>222 Mass. 13. Restatement: Contracts, \u00a7 248 (2), illustration 5. The existence of the usage is a question of fact to be determined by the jury. <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Hudson River Fire Ins. Co. </em>12 Cush. 416, 429. <em>Barrie </em>v. <em>Quinby, </em>206 Mass. 259, 265. <em>Cronan </em>v. <em>Hornblower, </em>211 Mass. 538, 541. That Magill may not have known of the usage in the publishing trade referred to in Allen\u2019s testimony is not controlling. \u201cWhere the usage is established the presumption is that the parties contracted with reference to it.\u201d <em>Baccari </em>v. <em>B. Perini &amp; Sons) Inc. </em>293 Mass. 297, 304, That is especially true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>where both parties are engaged in the same trade. Restatement: Contracts, \u00a7 248 (2). The plaintiff was not obliged to prove actual knowledge of the usage on the part of the defendant. <em>A. J. Tower Co. </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>184 Mass. 472, 475. See <em>Rice &amp; Lockwood Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>308 Mass. 101. The case was rightly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b237-5\"> Inasmuch as approximately 10,000 volumes were bound, the price, as the plaintiff concedes, should have been fixed on that basis rather than on the basis of 5,000 copies and an adjustment was made accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
