We think that the decree was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">The evidence may be summarized as follows: Walter J. McMurray was fifty-one years old when he suddenly died on October 19, 1951, at about 4 p.m. He had been employed by the registry of motor vehicles of the Commonwealth for about twenty-two years. At the time of his death he was an investigator and as such he was investigating an unusual fatal accident in Greenfield. This accident, which happened on October 17, 1951, involved the death of a Mrs. Plouff. She was riding in an automobile, in good mechanical condition, with her son who was about twenty years old and an epileptic. There was a small pet dog on the front seat with her and her son. The automobile left the highway, struck a cement abutment, and went over a cement dam into Green River. The woman drowned but the son was rescued and taken to a hospital. There was some question as to who was driving the automobile and whether her death was a result of suicide or an accident. The episode received considerable publicity in the press <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>and otherwise because of the uncertainty as to what actually happened. The superior of the decedent told him that he wanted a report as soon as possible. The decedent was making a complete investigation and in pursuance thereof talked with the son at the hospital between 2: SO and 3 p.m. on the day he died. The son was in a state of shock and seemed \u201cto be in a fog, a daze.\u201d This interview was depressing. After leaving the hospital in furtherance of his investigation he went to the home of a Miss Danihy who was supposed to know something about the circumstances leading up to the accident. He was seated in a chair, and after he was there five or six minutes he suffered a heart attack and died. The cause of death was coronary thrombosis. The decedent was a conscientious man who took his work very seriously. He was disturbed and worried on the day of his death because of the distressing interview at the hospital and because he was anxious to get his report in the office before 4:30 p.m. He had known Mrs. Plouff personally and was much concerned about the question of suicide. The investigation imposed upon him was a \u201cnerve wracking job\u201d of making the right decision as to whether the deceased woman had committed suicide. His personal physician, who was also the medical examiner for that district, had treated the decedent for about a year for a heart condition. He had advised him to avoid any physical or mental stress. He saw him on October 17,1951, and noticed nothing unusual about his condition. He testified that in his opinion an emotional stress or strain brought about by the investigation he was making hastened or aggravated the preexisting heart condition the decedent had and caused death. Specifically he said, \u201cI would say it was like the last straw that broke the camel\u2019s back; he simply could not take that strain on his heart.\u201d Another medical expert in answer to a hypothetical question which embodied substantially all the evidence heretofore recited, said, \u201cI would feel there is a connection between the facts outlined in the hypothetical question, the emotional, nervous influence produced by the situation outlined in the hypothetical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>question and the death of the inspector,\u201d and an expert for the Commonwealth testified \u201cthat an emotional strain can precipitate a heart attack just as physical strain can if it is a pretty profound strain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">It has been well established by this court that the decision of the reviewing board unless tainted by error of law is to stand if supported by the evidence, including all rational inferences. <em>Chapman\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 705, 707. <em>O\u2019Flaherty\u2019s Case, </em>325 Mass. 303, 305. <em>Paltsios\u2019s Case, </em>329 Mass. 526, 528. While this case goes to the verge we are satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to warrant the findings of the board. \u201cWhen a pre-existing heart disease of the employee is accelerated to the point of disablement . . . there may be found to have been a personal injury\u201d within the meaning of the act. <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487, 496. <em>O\u2019Flaherty\u2019s Case, supra. </em>It is true that usually the emotional stress or strain appears to have been accompanied by some physical exertion in connection with the work of the employee, but we perceive no difference between a stress or strain brought about by physical exertion and that occasioned by distress, worry, fear, or anxiety. <em>Charon\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 694. <em>Egan\u2019s Case, ante, </em>11.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The Commonwealth argues and we agree that there was no direct evidence that the decedent suffered an emotional disturbance at any time during the investigation. However, essential facts tending to prove the existence of such a condition need not be proved by direct evidence but may be established by reasonable inferences from facts shown to exist. <em>Paltsios\u2019s Case, </em>329 Mass. 526, 528. We do have opinions of medical experts, on the basis of facts which the evidence tended to show, that the employee suffered emotional stress or strain.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">In <em>Brzozowski\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 113, 115-116, we said, \u201cWe recognize that there are decisions which hold that where the employee\u2019s incapacity or death is caused by a gradual breaking down of tissue as a result of work over a long period it cannot be said to arise from a personal injury within the meaning of the act . . . [\u00a1with cases cited]]. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>line between cases of that type and those where an employee suffers a strain in the performance of his work may at times be difficult to ascertain, but it exists nonetheless. Whether the employee\u2019s death here was caused by a gradual degeneration of his cardiac organs or was accelerated by a strain or exertion attributable to his work on June 6 was a question of fact for the board to decide.\u201d Here as in that case we cannot say that the decision of the board was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">In view of the finding of the board that the injury arose out of and in the course of his employment, it is unnecessary to consider the effect of the presumption afforded by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 7A, inserted by St. 1947, c. 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In the opinion of a majority of the court the decree must be affirmed. Costs of this appeal under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 11 A, inserted by St. 1945, c. 444, shall be allowed by the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
