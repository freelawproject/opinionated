According to the findings of a judge of the District Court the plaintiff was one of several real estate brokers \u201cengaged\u201d by one Fame to sell a certain parcel of real estate. The plaintiff gave the defendant information concerning the property and the latter after some negotiation told the plaintiff that, \u201cIf I\u2019m interested, I\u2019ll contact you\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201d Thereafter the defendant went to Fame and by falsely representing to him that he, the defendant, had not been solicited by a broker induced Fame to sell him the property at a lower price. The defendant\u2019s act was \u201cmalicious\u201d in that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>intended to deprive the plaintiff of a commission. Fame would not have sold the property for the lesser amount if he had believed that he would be obligated to pay a commission. As the plaintiff\u2019s effort was the \u201csole and efficient cause\u201d of the sale to the defendant he was deprived of a commission. The judge ruled, however, as matter of law that \u201cdefendant\u2019s acts were not tortious on which plaintiff might predicate a suit for damages\u201d and found for the defendant. He reported the case to the Appellate Division for determination of the correctness of this ruling. The Appellate Division dismissed the report and the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">It is a general principle that, if damage is caused, an intentional invasion of a legally protected interest without legal justification creates liability. <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Dunphy, </em>177 Mass. 485, 487. <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>286 Mass. 269, 271. <em>Caverno </em>v. <em>Fellows, </em>300 Mass. 331, 333. <em>Owen </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>322 Mass. 356, 360. The interest of the plaintiff which he contends was invaded by the defendant was the right created by his engagement as a broker to sell Fame\u2019s real estate. There was, in effect, a listing of the property with him for sale. See <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Kazajian, </em>255 Mass. 459, 461, and cases cited. Presumably it was understood that Fame would pay him a commission if he should become the efficient cause of accomplishing the object for which he was engaged, whether that object was the procuring of a customer able, ready, and willing to buy upon Fame\u2019s terms or the effecting of an actual transfer of title upon such terms. <em>Corleto </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>320 Mass. 612, 616. It does not appear that the defendant caused Fame to terminate the plaintiff\u2019s employment. In fact by purchasing the property from Fame on terms satisfactory to him (see <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>312 Mass. 691; <em>Morad </em>v. <em>Haddad, </em>329 Mass. 730, 734), he completed the sale which the plaintiff had been employed to effect. The latter has not been deprived of his commission. The case is governed by <em>McAuslan &amp; Nutting, Inc. </em>v. <em>Futurity Thread Co. </em>254 Mass. 216. See also <em>Shapiro </em>v. 316 Mass. 556. . .</p>\n<p id=\"AB0\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
