Penney. The prayers are for specific performance of the agreement and for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">The memorandum referred to in the bill and marked <em>\u201cA\u201d </em>reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">\u201cI Kathleen Picardi hereby sell to Victor N. Cluff of Tewksbury the land and buildings on Main Street, Tewksbury formerly the home of my mother for the sum of thirty seven hundred dollars of which this is a receipt for two hundred dollars as a down deposit. The remainder to be paid upon the settlement of the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-11\">Mrs. Kathleen Picardi Administrator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">The plaintiff could have set up the agreement in general terms without stating whether it was oral or in writing. He was not obliged to allege, as in substance he has, that it was oral and that he relies upon the paper marked <em>\u201cA\u201d </em>as his memorandum of it. <em>Southwick </em>v. <em>Spevak, </em>252 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>354, 356-357. <em>Ranicar </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>326 Mass. 710, 712. If the plaintiff had taken that course the defendants, if they intended to rely upon the statute of frauds, would have been obliged to plead the statute. <em>Abalan </em>v. <em>Abalan, </em>329 Mass. 182, 183, and cases cited. But even in that event the burden of proving a sufficient memorandum would have been upon the plaintiff. <em>Kalker </em>v. <em>Bailen, </em>290 Mass. 202, 205. <em>Beaver </em>v. <em>Raytheon Manuf. Co. </em>299 Mass. 218, 219. <em>Fichera </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>312 Mass. 287, 288. Since, however, the plaintiff has chosen to plead an oral contract with an alleged memorandum of it, the defendant can take advantage of the statute of frauds by demurrer. <em>Bank of Commerce &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Schooner, </em>263 Mass. 199, 204-205. <em>Denvir </em>v. <em>North Avenue Savings Bank, </em>290 Mass. 137, 138. <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>Lowenstein, </em>314 Mass. 642, 645. <em>Siegel </em>v. <em>Knott, </em>316 Mass. 526, 527-528. And the demurrer may be a general one and need not specifically mention the statute. <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>Lowenstein, </em>314 Mass. 642, 645-646.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Upon inspection of the alleged memorandum marked <em>\u201cA.\u201d </em>it appears <em>not </em>to be a memorandum of the agreement set forth in the bill. That agreement is alleged to have been between the plaintiff and the two defendants jointly. The alleged memorandum purports to bind the defendant Picardi alone, even if we assume, without deciding, that her designation as \u201cAdministrator\u201d can be ignored and that she is bound personally. There is nothing in the alleged memorandum to bind the defendant Penney. If in fact the defendant Picardi signed the alleged memorandum as authorized agent for Penney as well as in her own behalf, very likely the memorandum would bind both herself and Penney. <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Knox, </em>7 Cush. 371, 374. <em>Byington </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>134 Mass. 169. <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>183 Mass. 389, 391-392. <em>Jacobson </em>v. <em>Perman, </em>238 Mass. 445, 448. Restatement: Agency, \u00a7 153. But nowhere is the fact of agency alleged. That fact cannot be assumed in favor of the pleader. It is his duty to plead all the primary facts necessary to make out a case. <em>Drew </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>107 Mass. 64, 73. <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>223 Mass. 47, 48. <em>Chinese </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number><em>American Restaurant Corp. </em>v. <em>Finigan, </em>272 Mass. 360, 364. He is not helped by his bare allegation that the paper marked <em>\u201cA\u201d is </em>a memorandum of the agreement. That is an allegation of a conclusion involving both fact and law and is not supported but rather is belied by the particular facts alleged. If the plaintiff at a hearing on the merits should prove all the allegations of fact properly set forth in his bill, without more, he would lose his case for lack of a sufficient memorandum. The case is governed in principle by <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Burt, </em>196 Mass. 395, and <em>Harrigan </em>v. <em>Dodge, </em>200 Mass. 357. It is distinguishable from <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Coster, </em>249 Mass. 391, where the bill alleged that the contract was signed by the defendant, and the contract on its face purported to be signed by the defendant by his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">It follows in the opinion of a majority of the court that the demurrer was rightly sustained, and the bill was rightly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\n<em>Interlocutory decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed with costs of appeal.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
