For the reasons set forth below, this Court reverses and remands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This case arises from a long-standing feud between neighbors. This is the fourth appeal in this matter following the jury trial and post-judgment motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The first appeal was dismissed upon the parties' joint motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Catalanotto v. Byrd\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Summit No. 27144 (Jan. 22, 2014) (\"\n   <em>\n    Catalanotto I\n   </em>\n   \"). The second appeal outlined the parties' claims, the jury's verdict, and the disposition of the post-trial motions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   In their suit, the Catalanottos brought counts against both Byrd and [Edwin] Moore for trespass, loss of enjoyment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy, and declaratory judgment. They also brought counts against Byrd alone for conversion, trespass to chattels, malicious prosecution, and abuse of process. Byrd and Moore answered the complaint, and Byrd filed several counterclaims against the Catalanottos, including claims for trespass, assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Byrd's counterclaims for trespass and assault included a request for punitive damages and attorney fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   A jury trial took place and * * * resulted in verdicts in favor of Byrd on her counterclaims for trespass, assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. As to her claim for trespass, the jury found that the Catalanottos had acted with malice and that Byrd was entitled to attorney fees, but did not award her either compensatory or punitive damages. As to her claim for assault, the jury likewise found that the Catalanottos had acted with malice and that Byrd was entitled to attorney fees, but once again did not award her any compensatory damages. The jury awarded Byrd $5,000 in punitive damages on her claim for assault and $10,000 in compensatory damages on her claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court entered a judgment on the verdicts and noted the need for a hearing on the matter of attorney fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   * * * [T]he Catalanottos filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\"JNOV\"). In their JNOV motion, they argued that Byrd was not entitled to punitive damages on her assault claim because the jury had failed to award her compensatory damages on that claim. They further argued that, once the court overturned the punitive damage award, Byrd would not be entitled to attorney fees. Byrd responded in opposition, arguing both that the Catalanottos' motion was procedurally defective and that she should prevail on the arguments underlying it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court granted the JNOV motion in part and denied it in part. Specifically, the court vacated the punitive damage award, but allowed the award of attorney fees. [After an attorney fee hearing, the trial court] ordered the Catalanottos to pay $15,000 for Byrd's attorney fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Catalanotto v.

Byrd argued on appeal that the trial court erred in partially granting the Catalanottos' Civ.R. 50(B) motion because the motion was procedurally defective in that it only challenged the punitive damages and attorney fee awards as \"contrary to Ohio law.\" [This Court] agreed and sustained Byrd's assignment of error on that basis since Civ.R. 50(B) only allows parties to challenge a jury's verdict, not the jury's damages award. [This Court] further determined that the appropriate relief for this error was to reverse and remand and [this Court] explained the scope of the proceedings on remand as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"On remand, the parties will be placed in the positions they occupied prior to the entry of the trial court's erroneous judgment in favor of the Catalanottos. Thus, the Catalanottos' [ Civ.R. 50(B) ] motion will be before the court, and it will be for the court to decide whether to deny the motion on procedural grounds or to employ Civ.R. 59(D) and determine whether the Catalanottos should be afforded relief in the form of a new trial.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   On remand, the trial court denied the Catalanottos' motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and their \"prayer for a new trial.\" As to the Civ.R. 50(B) motion, the trial court stated that \"[s]ince there is no provision in Civ.R. 50(B) for relief based on a jury award that is contrary to law, [the Catalanottos'] Civ.R. 50(B) motion * * * is denied as it is a remedy to which they are not entitled.\" As to the Catalanottos' request for a new trial, the trial court noted that the entry of judgment was filed on May 17, 2013 and the Catalanottos did not assert their request for a new trial until filing a reply brief on June 14, 2013. The trial court concluded that under the provisions of former Civ.R. 59, the Catalanottos had to request a new trial within 14 days of the entry of judgment and since they failed to do that, the trial court denied the Catalanottos' request as untimely. The trial court also declined to sua sponte grant a new trial under Civ.[R.] 59(D) on the basis that this provision only allows such relief within 28 days of the entry of judgment. The court determined that since the time period for such relief expired on June 14, 2013, it was precluded from sua sponte granting a new trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Internal citations and footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Catalanotto v.

First, Ms. Byrd pled three torts: trespass, assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Each claim included allegations of malice arising from that respective claim. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Moskovitz\n   </em>\n   , Ms.\n   Byrd's allegations of malice arose from the same tort and facts in which she sought compensatory damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Second, in her prayer for relief, Ms. Byrd made a general request as to all claims \"for compensatory and punitive damages [ ]according to proof.\" At trial, the issue of malice and punitive damages on the intentional infliction of emotion distress claim was not submitted to the jury. The jury was only instructed on malice and punitive damages on the trespass and assault claims. As to the assault claim, the jury found malice and awarded punitive damages, but found no underlying compensatory harm arising from the assault. Because Ms. Byrd pled intentional infliction of emotional distress and assault as separate and distinct claims and she pursued separate and distinct relief for each claim,\n   <em>\n    Moskovitz\n   </em>\n   does not permit her to combine the claims post-verdict to support a punitive damages award. Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Moskovitz\n   </em>\n   is not applicable in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 19} On Ms. Byrd's assault counterclaim, the jury found in favor of Ms. Byrd but awarded zero compensatory damages. The jury went on to find the Catalanottos acted with malice and awarded $5,000 in punitive damages. While the jury made the requisite finding of malice, it failed to award Ms. Byrd any compensatory damages. The jury's punitive damages award is contrary to R.C. 2315.21(C)(1)-(2).
