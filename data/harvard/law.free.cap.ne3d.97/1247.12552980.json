The matter went to trial in June and July of 2015, with the trial court granting a divorce and entering the decree of divorce in June 2016. Mr. McGrew now appeals, raising five assignments of error. At issue are the division of marital property and marital debt, the parenting plan with regard to the McGrews' daughter, and the award of attorney fees to Ms. McGrew. During oral argument, Mr. McGrew informed this Court that his second assignment of error had been resolved, and withdrew it from consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR ONE\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT AT CF BANK WAS TRANSMUTED FROM SEPARATE TO MARITAL PROPERTY.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In his first assignment of error, Mr. McGrew argues the trial court erred in treating a certificate of deposit as partially marital property and partially separate property. Mr. McGrew contends that the trial court \"provided no logical or legal explanation for the bifurcated treatment of the [c]ertificate of [d]eposit as both marital and separate property\" and \"committed an abuse of discretion in finding that any portion of the [c]ertificate of [d]eposit was\n   transmuted from separate to marital.\" We agree that the trial court did not apply the correct analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} R.C. 3105.171(B) provides that, \"in a divorce proceeding, the trial court must classify the parties' property as either marital property or separate property, after which it must divide the property equitably.\"\n   <em>\n    Fetzer v.

During the period of 1995 through 2013, Mr. McGrew operated a business known as MCS Marketing, Inc., of which he was the president and Ms. McGrew was the sole shareholder. In 2009, Mr. McGrew lent MCS Marketing, Inc. $70,000.00 of his separate property. In June 2010, Mr. McGrew applied for a $51,200.00 loan from Cuyahoga Falls Bank, signing the application for the loan and the note, and purchasing a certificate of deposit with his separate property in the amount of $53,895.00 as collateral for the business loan. At the time of trial, the loan balance was $50,970.60, while the certificate of deposit balance was $53,718.86. The trial court noted that monthly payments had therefore not been made towards the loan balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} At trial, Mr. McGrew argued he should be awarded the certificate of deposit as his separate property and that the Cuyahoga Falls Bank loan should be divided equally between the parties. The court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   It is clear to this court from the evidence presented that [Mr. McGrew] alone managed MCS Marketing, Inc. and Alumni Partners and made the decisions with respect to these businesses. He made the decision to collater[al]ize a marital business debt with a certificate of deposit purchased with his separate property. He also made the decision not to make monthly payments on the note to reduce the debt in question. More importantly however, is what he did with\n   income generated by the company in 2011, 2012, and 2013. In 2011, shareholder loans made to the company were reduced by $15,105 from $125,532 at year beginning to $110,427 at year end. In 2012, shareholder loans were reduced by $19,174 from $110,427 at year beginning to $91,253 at year end. In 2013, shareholder loans were reduced by $25,716 from $89,253 at year beginning to $63,537 at year end. In this three year period the shareholder loans were reduced by $59,995. None of this money was paid to [Ms. McGrew] who was the sole shareholder. The monies were paid to [Mr. McGrew] for loans he had made to the company from his separate property in 2009. He clearly made a conscious decision to repay himself rather than repaying in full the only other creditor of the business, Cuyahoga Falls Bank, thereby exposing [Ms. McGrew] to liability for at least 50% of this debt. Further, [Mr. McGrew] collected interest income of $2,938 in 2001, $2,721 in 2012, and $3,006 in 2013 for loans he had made in prior years to MCS Marketing, Inc.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Based upon the evidence presented, the court finds that the Cuyahoga Falls Bank debt in the approximate [amount] of $50,870.60 is a marital debt. The court further finds that plaintiff's actions in operating the business transmuted the certificate of deposit from separate property to marital property to the extent of the payoff of the business loan to Cuyahoga Falls Bank. Any amount in the Certificate of Deposit above the payoff of the Cuyahoga Falls Bank loan constitutes [Mr. McGrew's] separate property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In\n   <em>\n    Kuehn v.

Although nonmarital property may be converted to marital property, the trial court did not make a finding that property was commingled or engage in an inquiry of traceability as set forth in R.C. 3105.171(A)(6)(b) when it found that the certificate of deposit had been \"transmuted\" from separate property to marital property. We note that a trial court has discretion to equitably divide marital property and marital debts in the attempt to formulate a division that is fair under the circumstances; however, separate property may not simply be converted to marital property for purely equitable purposes, but rather, is dependent upon the requisite factual analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

We also note that the analysis engaged in by the trial court focuses on the income generated by MCS Marketing, Inc. to pay down shareholder loans, with the money being paid to Mr. McGrew for loans he made to the company in 2009, rather than to Ms. McGrew, with the trial court finding that his \"actions in operating the business transmuted the certificate of deposit from separate property to marital property.\" We are unable to construe these findings as an examination of the commingling and traceability of the certificate of deposit, which was collateral for the 2010 loan. We therefore conclude the trial court did not engage in an analysis or make factual findings that would support the conversion of the certificate of deposit from separate property into marital property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Mr. McGrew's first assignment of error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR TWO\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT HUSBAND SHARED ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PARTIES' TAX DEBTS IN 2011, 2012, AND 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 11} At oral argument, the second assignment of error was withdrawn because the issue had been resolved and is now moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR THREE\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DETERMINING THAT THE MEDICAL BILLS INCURRED BY HUSBAND RELATED TO DIAGNOSIS OF AND TREATMENT FOR THE PARTIES' SPECIAL NEEDS DAUGHTER SHOULD BE HIS SOLE RESPONSIBILITY.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In his third assignment of error, Mr. McGrew argues the trial court erred in allocating to him sole responsibility for medical bills incurred for diagnostic testing.

The trial court acts within its discretion in allocating marital debt for equitable purposes, and a division need not be equal to be equitable. Consequently, we conclude the decision of the trial court to allocate the medical bills at issue was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Mr. McGrew's third assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR FOUR\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN REFUSING TO MODIFY THE HUSBAND'S COMPANIONSHIP SCHEDULE WITH THE PARTIES' SPECIAL NEEDS DAUGHTER.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In his fourth assignment of error, Mr. McGrew argues the trial court erred in refusing to modify the parenting plan because it \"failed to properly ground its determination * * * in any evidence\" and \"failed to engage in any analysis whatsoever along the lines contemplated by R.C. 3109.04. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 20} R.C. 3109.04(E)(1)(a) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The court shall not modify a prior decree allocating parental rights and responsibilities for the care of children unless it finds, based on facts that have arisen since the prior decree or that were unknown to the court at the time of the prior decree, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child, the child's residential parent, or either of the parents subject to a shared parenting decree, and that the modification is necessary to serve the best interest of the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Thus, although a finding of changed circumstances is a prerequisite to modifying a prior decree allocating parental rights and responsibilities, the statute does not require specific findings in a court's refusal to modify. Furthermore, the trial court made several findings in support of its ruling, noting that Mr. McGrew was seeking to modify summer vacation and Christmas vacation parenting time, even though the last parenting plan agreement, filed approximately three months prior to trial, contained time provisions for summer and Christmas vacation. The trial court further noted that Ms. McGrew was opposed to modifying the parenting plan, and had indicated that the holiday schedule prior to its implementation was a \"mess,\" and that the parenting plan was written specifically to avoid such problems. After making these findings, the trial court stated: \"Based upon all of the evidence presented, the court finds that [Mr. McGrew's] motion to modify the parenting plan is not well taken and should be denied in its entirety.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 21} We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mr. McGrew's motion to modify the parenting plan.

The trial court was under no obligation to, in some manner, engage in a balancing of the time and expenditures related to attorney fees with regard to each party, and Mr. McGrew provides no legal authority in support of this argument. The trial court need only find such an award equitable and \"may consider the parties' marital assets and income, any award of temporary spousal support, the conduct of the parties, and any other relevant factors the court deems appropriate.\" R.C. 3105.73(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Mr. McGrew also argues that he was not solely responsible for \"the multitude of pretrial motions,\" and states that\n   during his period of self-representation, he filed only six of his own motions. This statement is not accurate. An order granting the withdrawal of Mr. McGrew's attorney was filed on February 15, 2013. Subsequent to that withdrawal, and prior to Attorney James E. Brown entering his appearance, the following motions were filed, pro se, by Mr. McGrew:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   1. motion to compel and request for reimbursement of attorney fees (filed 2/22/13);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   2. motion for psychological assessment (filed 2/25/13);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   3. motion to remove counsel and request for reimbursement for attorney fees and other costs plus fines and sanctions to be levied against the defendant attorneys (filed 2/26/13);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   4. motion to compel (filed 5/10/13);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   5. motion for extension (filed 6/10/17);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   6. emergency motion for return of misappropriated non-marital assets bequeathed for the express purpose of the college tuition of parties' son (filed 6/11/13);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   7. motion that the Charles W.

These figures were set forth in the affidavit of Ms. McGrew's attorney, Robyn C. Bergman, on July 24, 2015. It was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to round the amount down to an award of $25,000.00 where there was evidence indicating that she owed at least $28,161.24 in attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 27} We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney\n   fees to Ms. McGrew.
