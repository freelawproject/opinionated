L. c. 123, \u00a7 36C. That statute now requires the transmission of certain identifying and nonclinical information about a person who has been involuntarily committed to the Department of Criminal Justice Information Services, which in turn submits to the United States Attorney General information required or permitted by Federal law to be included in the national instant criminal background check system. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 167A (\n      <em>\n       h\n      </em>\n      ). Although we conclude that a patient's continuing interest in removing stigma associated with an involuntary commitment is sufficient to require an appeal to be decided on its merits, we recognize that the statute itself may implicate ongoing Federal collateral consequences, providing an additional reason for needing to resolve the appeal on the merits.

A judge in the District Court denied F.C.'s first and only request to continue the hearing date, and a hearing was held, which resulted in F.C.'s involuntary commitment and treatment. F.C. appealed to the Appellate Division of the District Court.
