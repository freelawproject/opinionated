The court observed only that appellate review of \"[i]ssues involving the commitment and treatment of mentally ill persons are generally considered matters of public importance,\" and that such issues, even where moot, \"present 'classic examples' of issues that are capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" <em>Id</em>. at 635, <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20N.E.3d%20476\">71 N.E.3d 476</extracted-citation>, quoting <em>Newton-Wellesley Hosp</em>. v. <em>Magrini</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789534\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/451/777/#p782\">451 Mass. 777</extracted-citation>, 782, <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=889%20N.E.2d%20929\">889 N.E.2d 929</extracted-citation> (2008). <em>Matter of N.L</em>. should not be interpreted to require or permit dismissal of an appeal concerning the commitment and treatment of mentally ill persons without consideration of the merits of the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<attorneys id=\"p-15\">The expired involuntary commitment order at issue in <em>Matter of N.L</em>. was entered prior to January 1, 2015, the effective date of G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 36C. That statute now requires the transmission of certain identifying and nonclinical information about a person who has been involuntarily committed to the Department of Criminal Justice Information Services, which in turn submits to the United States Attorney General information required or permitted by Federal law to be included in the national instant criminal background check system. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 167A (<em>h</em> ). Although we conclude that a patient's continuing interest in removing stigma associated with an involuntary commitment is sufficient to require an appeal to be decided on its merits, we recognize that the statute itself may implicate ongoing Federal collateral consequences, providing an additional reason for needing to resolve the appeal on the merits. See, e.g., <em>In the Interest of B.A.C</em>., <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338183\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/902/767/#p770\">902 N.W.2d 767</extracted-citation>, 770 (N.D. 2017) (actual controversy on appeal where Federal firearms restriction is collateral consequence of court's order of involuntary hospitalization).</attorneys>\n</footnote>\n<opinion type=\"majority\"><p id=\"p-7\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"2\" data-label=\"1029\" href=\"#p1029\" id=\"p1029\">**1029</a>Following F.C.'s involuntary hospitalization at McLean Hospital, the hospital filed a petition for his commitment under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 \u00a7 7 and 8, and for other relief, pursuant G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 8B. A judge in the District Court denied F.C.'s first and only request to continue the hearing date, and a hearing was held, which resulted in F.C.'s involuntary commitment and treatment. F.C. appealed to the Appellate Division of the District Court. His appeal was stayed pending this court's decision in <em>Matter of N.L</em>., <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12462700\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/476/632/#p633\">476 Mass. 632</extracted-citation>, 633, <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20N.E.3d%20476\">71 N.E.3d 476</extracted-citation> (2017) (dismissing appeal as moot, but concluding that first continuance request \"is mandatory where a denial thereof is reasonably likely to prejudice [a patient's] ability to prepare a meaningful defense\"). In the interim, F.C.'s condition improved, and he was discharged from the facility. Citing <em>Matter of N.L</em>., <em>supra</em>, the Appellate Division summarily dismissed the appeal as moot. F.C. now appeals from the order of the Appellate Division dismissing the appeal.</p><p id=\"p-8\">We transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion to clarify that nothing we stated in <em>Matter of N.L</em>., <em>supra</em>, was intended to require the dismissal of such appeals as moot, or otherwise to change the appellate process for appeals involving commitment, treatment, and other orders issued pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8, and 8B, that have expired. In this case, the Appellate Division erred in summarily dismissing F.C.'s appeal as moot in reliance on <em>Matter of N.L</em>., something that was neither raised nor decided in that case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Seney</em> v. <em>Morhy</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317742\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/467/58/#p61\">467 Mass. 58</extracted-citation>, 61, <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20N.E.3d%20577\">3 N.E.3d 577</extracted-citation> (2014) (because of continuing interest at stake, appeals of expired harassment protection orders are not moot and should be reviewed on their merits).

L. c. 258E) or expired abuse prevention orders (G.

Although an expired or terminated order may no longer have operative effect, the appeal should not be dismissed without considering the merits of the underlying order. See <em>Superintendent of Worcester State Hosp</em>. v. <em>Hagberg</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3871342\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/374/271/#p276\">374 Mass. 271</extracted-citation>, 276, <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=372%20N.E.2d%20242\">372 N.E.2d 242</extracted-citation> (1978) (\"[m]ental illness does not carry the same stigma it once did, but we are not prepared to say that the stigma has entirely disappeared\").</p><p id=\"p-10\">We therefore vacate the order of the Appellate Division dismissing the appeal as moot. We remand the case to the Appellate Division for determination of the appeal on its merits.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"
