Although the lab was constructed for use by New York City's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, the construction\n   documents identified DASNY as the owner. DASNY also contracted with a joint venture between Gilbane Building Company and TDX Construction Corporation (hereinafter, Gilbane JV) for Gilbane JV to be the construction manager for the project. DASNY's contract with Samson provided that Samson would obtain general liability insurance for the job, with an endorsement naming as additional insureds: \"[DASNY], the State of New York, the Construction Manager [Gilbane JV] and other entities specified on the sample Certificate of Insurance provided by [DASNY].\" Samson obtained general liability insurance coverage from Liberty Insurance Underwriters (Liberty). The sample certificate of insurance listed as \"Additional Insureds under General Liability as respects this Project: ... Gilbane/TDX Construction Joint Venture.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2006, DASNY sued Samson and Perkins Eastman Architects, P.C., the project architect, alleging that Samson damaged the excavation support system in August of 2003 by negligently removing a section of steel plating which caused the foundation of the neighboring building to settle several inches. Perkins then commenced a third-party action against Gilbane JV in 2010. Gilbane JV provided notice to Liberty by letter in April of 2011, seeking defense and indemnity under the Liberty policy for Perkins' suit against it, which Liberty denied in July of that year. Gilbane\n   JV commenced this lawsuit in September of 2012, arguing that it qualified for coverage under the Liberty policy as an additional insured. Supreme Court denied Liberty's motion for summary judgment, holding that Gilbane JV is an additional insured under the policy ( 2014 N.Y. Slip Op. 33766[U],\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202392024\">\n    2014 WL 2392024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2014] ). The Appellate Division subsequently reversed, granting Liberty's motion (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12168304\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/143/146/\">\n    143 A.D.3d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12168304\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/143/146/\">\n    38 N.Y.S.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2016] ). We now affirm, because the terms of the policy at issue here require a written contract between the named insured and an additional insured, if coverage is to be extended to an additional insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The relevant portion of the Liberty policy is the \"Additional Insured-By Written Contract\" provision, which reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"WHO IS AN INSURED (Section II) is amended to include as an insured any person or organization\n   <em>\n    with whom\n   </em>\n   you have agreed to add as an additional insured by written contract but only with respect to liability arising out of your operations or premises owned by or rented to you.\" (Emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Gilbane JV has no written contract with Samson denominating it an additional insured, but argues no such contract is necessary, because that requirement would conflict with the plain meaning of the Liberty endorsement; with \"well-settled rules of policy interpretation\"; and with the parties' reasonable expectations. Alternatively, Gilbane JV argues that the Liberty endorsement is, at most, ambiguous on that point, and therefore must be construed against Liberty and in favor of coverage. Gilbane JV is incorrect; the endorsement is facially clear and does not provide for coverage unless Gilbane JV is an organization \"with whom\" Samson has a written contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Generally, the courts bear the responsibility of determining the rights or obligations of parties under insurance contracts based on the specific language of the policies\" (\n   <em>\n    State of NY v.

Omitting \"with,\" the phrase would read: \"any person or organization whom you have agreed by written contract to add,\" and Gilbane JV's position would have merit. But Samson and Liberty included that preposition in the contract between them, and we must give it its ordinary meaning. Here, the \"with\" can only mean that the written contract must be \"with\" the additional insured. Gilbane JV proposes other wordings that, in its view, would more clearly require the existence of a written contract between Samson and an additional insured, but those formulations are no clearer and, in any event, the endorsement's meaning is plain and unambiguous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The dissent aptly notes that \"[a] reviewing court must decide whether, affording a\n   <em>\n    fair meaning to all of the language\n   </em>\n   employed by the parties in the contract and leaving no provision without force and effect, there is a reasonable basis for a difference of opinion as to the meaning of the policy\" (\n   <em>\n    Fed.

We cannot ascribe to the position that, whereas \"with\" has a definite meaning in English, the average insured understands it to have no meaning.

In doing so, the majority disregards the appropriate standard\n   of review concerning barriers to coverage and, as a result, undermines an industry market solution aimed at efficiently allocating risk among entities involved in construction projects. Because the language of the policy endorsement is ambiguous and subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, it should be construed against defendant Liberty Insurance Underwriters, as the insurer, and in favor of coverage.

Plaintiff Gilbane JV asserts that the phrase \"by written contract\" modifies \"to add,\" and argues that it refers to the act of the named insured, Samson, agreeing to add an additional insured. Put differently, Gilbane JV argues that \"by written contract\" means only that any agreement by Samson to add an additional insured must be memorialized in a writing-not necessarily a writing between Samson and the purported additional insured. Thus, according to Gilbane JV, the contract between DASNY and Samson-under which Samson agreed in writing to\n   procure a general liability insurance policy for the construction project and to name Gilbane JV as an additional insured-was sufficient to confer additional insured status upon Gilbane JV. Defendant, on the other hand, focuses on the phrase \"with whom,\" arguing that the named insured must agree with the purported additional insured, in a writing between those parties, to add coverage for that entity under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Fixating on the word \"with,\" the majority summarily concludes that the policy does not \"provide for coverage unless Gilbane JV is an organization 'with whom' Samson has a written contract\" (majority op., at 135, 74 N.Y.S.3d at 164, 97 N.E.3d at 712). In so doing, the majority places the phrase \"by written contract\" directly after \"agreed,\" effectively rewriting the policy while altogether failing to address Gilbane JV's proposed construction. Under this reformulation, the pertinent policy language would confer additional insured status upon \"any person or organization with whom you have agreed by written contract to add as an additional insured.\" Of course, that is not what the policy says. Moreover, even though the majority's construction is reasonable, the policy language is ambiguous because the construction proffered by Gilbane JV is also reasonable; indeed, Gilbane JV's interpretation is consistent with the \"reasonable expectations of the average insured\" that would seek to procure this type of coverage, whereas defendant's interpretation is not (\n   <em>\n    Universal Am.

In any event, because each party's reading of this language is reasonable, the endorsement is \"ambiguous and thus [should be] interpreted in favor of\" coverage (\n   <em>\n    Federal Ins.

It follows, then, that the endorsement should\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be interpreted as imposing a requirement of privity between Samson and Gilbane JV to effectuate additional insured coverage of Gilbane JV, and the DASNY-Samson contract was sufficient\n   to satisfy the policy provision and entitle Gilbane JV to such coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A review of\n   <em>\n    Liberty Mut.

Turner, Insurance Coverage of Construction Disputes \u00a7 42:1 [2d ed] [emphasis omitted] ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Construction project owners, such as DASNY, customarily require contractors of every tier, such as Samson, to provide coverage for \"upstream\" parties-such as Gilbane JV-as additional insureds on their general liability policies (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"71053\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/6/192/71053/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This allocation of risk makes sense insofar as the party that is best positioned to control and mitigate any potential risks is responsible for obtaining coverage that extends to those upstream entities that are removed from the work being performed by a particular subcontractor yet-as a property owner or project manager-may be exposed to third-party liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Consistent with this risk transfer regime, \"[a] blanket additional insured endorsement generally provides coverage for any person or organization to whom or to which the named insured is obligated to name as an additional insured by virtue of a written contract or agreement\" (3 Steven Plitt et al., Couch on Insurance \u00a7 40:30 [3d ed] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The point of such a blanket endorsement is to furnish a means of providing such coverage that is more efficient than requiring either a separate contract between each subcontractor and each additional insured (which the majority finds to be necessary here) or that the policy list the identity of each additional insured (a list that would have to be amended whenever the named insured undertakes an obligation to add a new upstream entity, consistent with standard commercial practice). In that regard, counsel for defendant conceded that underwriting considerations for a policy like the one before us are based, not on the number or identity of additional insureds that may be covered\n   but, instead, on the nature of the insured's work. Thus, when Samson-a subcontractor on a major construction project, with a practical understanding of risk allocation in the construction industry-procured the policy here, it would reasonably expect that it had the right to add Gilbane JV, an upstream entity, as an additional insured without the approval of, or even so much as a notification to, defendant, so long as such coverage was required by\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   written contract. Seen through this lens, the interpretation proffered by Gilbane JV is consistent with the \"reasonable expectations of the average insured upon reading the policy and employing common speech\" (\n   <em>\n    Universal Am.

The parties do not dispute that, pursuant to the DASNY-Samson contract, Samson agreed to procure general liability insurance with an endorsement naming Gilbane JV as an additional insured.

In other words, the risk falls on the party best positioned to mitigate potential hazards. A critical component of risk transfer in the industry is additional insured coverage afforded to parties that are upstream-typically general contractors, construction managers, and property owners-and do not have immediate control over the work being performed. Downstream subcontractors, at each tier, are typically required to provide this coverage for all upstream parties.
