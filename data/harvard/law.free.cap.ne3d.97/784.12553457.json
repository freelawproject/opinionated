Hairston appeals from the decision of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas overruling his motion to suppress. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Hairston was indicted on one fourth-degree felony count of carrying a concealed weapon, in violation of R.C. 2923.12, for an offense alleged to have occurred on or about March 29, 2015. (July 10, 2015 Indictment.) Hairston filed a motion to suppress the evidence and statements that the state intended to introduce as evidence to prove its case, alleging that they were the fruits of an unconstitutional search and seizure. (Dec. 22, 2015 Mot.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The trial court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion on February 8, 2016. At the hearing, the state called Officer Samuel Moore as its sole witness. (Feb. 6, 2016 Tr. at 3-4.) Officer Moore\n   testified that while on patrol on March 29, 2015, he responded to a call concerning a domestic dispute at approximately 9:00 p.m. (Tr. at 5-6.) When he and his partner exited the patrol vehicle at the address of the dispute, Officer Moore heard four or five gunshots coming from the west, in the direction of a nearby elementary school. (Tr. at 7.) Drug activity, thefts, assaults, and crimes involving guns had occurred in the neighborhood and near the elementary school and a neighboring high school, and Officer Moore had personally made arrests for such offenses. (Tr. at 8-9.) After hearing the gunshots, he and his partner returned to the car and drove in the direction of the elementary school, four-tenths of a mile away, where they arrived \"no more than 30, 60 seconds\" later. (Tr. at 9, 16, &amp; 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} As they were approaching the school, Officer Moore saw Hairston walking east, away from the school, across a crosswalk, talking on a cell phone. (Tr. at 9 &amp; 24.) At this time, it was dark out and no other people were around. (Tr. at 15.) Officer Moore and his partner exited their vehicle with their guns drawn and ordered Hairston to stop. (Tr. at 24.) They asked Hairston if he had had heard gunshots and he replied that he had heard gunshots coming from the west. (Tr. at 11.) Officer Moore asked Hairston whether he had any weapons on his person, and instructed him to place his hands behind his back in order to perform a pat-down. (Tr. at 25.) Hairston replied that he had a gun and \"nodded towards his left jacket pocket,\" where Officer Moore found a semiautomatic pistol. (Tr. at 9-10.) Officer Moore described Hairston's demeanor as \"a little nervous,\" but stated that Hairston was \"compliant\" and \"calmly\" answered the officers' questions. (Tr. at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} After Officer Moore's testimony, the trial court heard the attorneys' arguments and overruled Hairston's motion. Ruling from the bench, the trial court found that the officers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [P]ersonally heard [the gun shots] and went in that direction, and the officer said it only took them a minute or so to get there. And you asked him if he had a hunch, and he said yeah. Well, he did have a hunch, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he didn't have a little more than a hunch when he only saw one person in the area and didn't see any other cars. All he has to have is a reasonable suspicion to question the suspect, and that's what he did, and that led to the discovery of the firearm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   So I think it's a close call because, you know, what's a reasonable suspicion probably varies from one individual to the next. But with all the facts that were testified to by the officer, I think that they had enough to do a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.

(Mar. 18, 2016 Entry.) The trial court imposed a suspended prison term of six months. (Mar. 22, 2016 Jgmt. Entry.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Hairston now appeals and asserts the following assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT OVERRULED THE DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO SUPPRESS THE EVIDENCE OBTAINED FOLLOWING THE UNLAWFUL SEIZURE OF THE DEFENDANT, AT GUNPOINT, MADE WITHOUT ANY ARTICULABLE SUSPICION TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAD COMMITTED ANY OFFENSE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Such is not the case here. Hairston was simply crossing the street and speaking to someone on a cell phone when the officers came on him.

In that case, officers responded to a report that multiple shots had been fired at an apartment complex.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205638096\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3 &amp; 6. The officers parked in multiple locations within several blocks of the apartment and converged on it on foot from different directions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. As they approached, they heard seven more shots that were so close that the officers \"could tell almost exactly where they were coming from.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. The officers circled the building with a clear view of the only way in and out of the parking lot. When they arrived in the parking lot, one individual in a vehicle began to start it and drive away, and no one else was around.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. As the officers approached the vehicle with their weapons drawn, they made multiple commands to the driver to stop. He did not initially comply, and they had to tell him \"over and over again\" to stop before he did.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. After exiting the vehicle, he told the officers that he had just seen the two shooters running away to the north, yet the officers had just come from that\n   direction. Without being asked, he stated that there was no gun in the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. At that time, the officers patted the driver down before searching his vehicle, where they found a weapon in the glove compartment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. We held that these circumstances amounted to reasonable suspicion to justify the stop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 17}\n   <em>\n    Pinckney\n   </em>\n   does not support the state's argument. The tip in\n   <em>\n    Pinckney\n   </em>\n   identified a specific location where shots had been fired-an apartment complex. As the officers approached the apartments, they personally heard more shots from only \"200 feet\" away and \"could tell almost exactly where they were coming from.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. Here, in contrast, Officer Moore heard shots that \"sounded as though they were coming from the west near the elementary\" school, four-tenths of one mile away, a large area that also encompassed a high school, fields, and parking lots. (Tr. at 7, 9, &amp; 16.) Based on personal observation as they approached the apartments and the parking lot from multiple directions, the officers in\n   <em>\n    Pinckney\n   </em>\n   knew that no one else had left the area where the shots were fired other than the particular driver that tried was trying to leave when they arrived. Officer Moore and his partner did not have any such assurance that Hairston was the only possible suspect, as the area in question was much larger and not subject to surveillance. Furthermore, the driver in\n   <em>\n    Pinckney\n   </em>\n   initially failed to comply with the officer's requests, dubiously claimed that he had seen the shooters go in the direction the officers had just come from, and, without being asked, asserted that he had no gun. Hairston displayed no comparable behavior that was cause for concern. He was walking and talking on a cell phone when stopped by Officer Moore and his partner. Hairston talked \"calmly\" and was \"compliant,\" and Officer Moore stated that he \"didn't blame\" Hairston for appearing \"somewhat nervous\" when confronted by two officers with their weapons drawn. (Tr. at 17 &amp; 32.) In short, the facts and circumstances of\n   <em>\n    Pinckney\n   </em>\n   that provided a particularized, objective basis for reasonable suspicion were not present when Officer Moore and his partner stopped Hairston.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 18} For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Hairston's seizure lacked the reasonable suspicion required by\n   <em>\n    Terry.\n   </em>\n   The trial court therefore erred when it overruled Hairston's motion to suppress, and his assignment of error is sustained. Accordingly, the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and this cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings in accordance with law and consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment reversed; cause remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   BROWN and LUPER SCHUSTER, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    It is not clear that the trial court applied this standard when, while ruling on the motion to suppress, it stated: \"what's a reasonable suspicion probably varies from one individual to the next.\" (Feb. 6, 2016 Tr. at 44.) Because reasonable suspicion asks whether a\n    <em>\n     reasonable\n    </em>\n    person would conclude, based on \"the facts available to the officer at the moment,\" that the defendant had engaged in or was about to engage in criminal activity, it is an objective standard that should not vary from one individual to the next.\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n    at 21-22,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n     88 S.Ct. 1868\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
