As an initial matter, the Office of the Attorney General did not represent the state in this case. The county prosecutor represented the state, and two assistant attorneys general were appointed as special prosecutors to assist the county.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In any event, Beasley did not file a request for Justice DeWine to recuse himself from this case pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. 4.04(B). The privilege to seek disqualification of a judge \"is regarded as waived unless claimed at the earliest available opportunity.' \" (Emphasis added.) 1 Ohio Jurisprudence, Pleadings and Practice Forms, Section 2:32 (2017); see also In re Disqualification ofPepple,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20Ohio%20St.%203d%20606\">\n    47 Ohio St.3d 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 607,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=546%20N.E.2d%201298\">\n    546 N.E.2d 1298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989) (\"A party may be said to have waived the right to obtain a judge's disqualification when the alleged basis therefor has been known to the party for some time, but the objection is raised in an untimely fashion, well after the judge has participated in the proceedings\"). It is well known that Attorney General Mike DeWine is Justice DeWine's father; Beasley knew or should have known the information necessary to request that Justice DeWine recuse himself from this case long before he filed the instant motion for reconsideration. For this\n   reason, Beasley has waived his opportunity to request that Justice DeWine recuse himself and has waived any argument for reconsideration based on Justice DeWine's alleged need to recuse himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} More importantly, even if Beasley could overcome his waiver, his substantive arguments are without merit. Beasley argues that this court should grant reconsideration based on an alleged appearance of impropriety leading to a due-process-based structural error. Beasley highlights the father-son relationship between Attorney General Mike DeWine and Justice DeWine but paradoxically mentions In re Disqualification ofCelebrezze,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4238746\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/145/1242/\">\n    145 Ohio St.3d 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-5672\">\n    2015-Ohio-5672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20N.E.3d%20306\">\n    49 N.E.3d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a decision that allowed a judge to hear a case despite the fact that her brother was an attorney with the law firm representing the plaintiff. Beasley merely speculates that the principles set forth in Celebrezze could be altered by the determination of an as-yet-unresolved ethics complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} It is well settled that \"[t]he proper test for detennining whether a judge's participation in a case presents an appearance of impropriety is * * * an objective one. A judge should step aside or be removed if a reasonable and objective observer would harbor serious doubts about the judge's impartiality.\" Lewis,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3797687\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/117/1227/\">\n    117 Ohio St.3d 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004-Ohio-7359\">\n    2004-Ohio-7359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=884%20N.E.2d%201082\">\n    884 N.E.2d 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Under Article IV, Section 5(C) of the Ohio Constitution, the chief justice has the authority to disqualify judges of the courts of common pleas and the courts of appeals. The Constitution does not provide the chief justice the authority to disqualify other justices. Nonetheless, more than one chief justice of this state has considered the disqualification of judges of the courts of common pleas or the courts of appeals in cases involving arguments directly analogous to the argument raised in the instant motion. Those decisions have provided a consistent rule that is contrary to Beasley's argument, and these cases are extremely persuasive authority. When detennining whether a judge should be disqualified based on familial ties to lawyers working for a governmental entity representing a party, chief justices have focused on the involvement of the judge's family member in the proceeding at hand and the potential for financial gain. See In re Disqualification ofCorrigan,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20Ohio%20St.%203d%20602\">\n    47 Ohio St.3d 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 603,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=546%20N.E.2d%20925\">\n    546 N.E.2d 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989) ; In re Carr,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1196464\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/105/1233/\">\n    105 Ohio St.3d 1233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004-Ohio-7357\">\n    2004-Ohio-7357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=826%20N.E.2d%20294\">\n    826 N.E.2d 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11-17 ; In re Disqualification of Bates,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4125381\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/134/1249/\">\n    134 Ohio St.3d 1249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-6342\">\n    2012-Ohio-6342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=984%20N.E.2d%2017\">\n    984 N.E.2d 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In Carr, Chief Justice Moyer noted that \"[s]alaried government attorneys simply ' \"do[ ] not have the financial interest in the success of the departmental representation that is inherent in private practice.\" ' \" Carr at \u00b6 15, quoting United States v. Caggiano,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"390934\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/660/184/#p191\">\n    660 F.2d 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 191 (6th Cir.1981), quoting American Bar Association Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Formal Opinion No. 342 (1975). Chief Justice Moyer further explained in Carr that the judge should not be disqualified so long as the judge's spouse, who was an assistant prosecutor, neither entered an appearance in the case nor participated in the presentation of the case. Carr at \u00b6 17; see also Corrigan at 603 (\"disqualification is not warranted solely because Judge Corrigan is the son of the duly elected prosecuting attorney of this large metropolitan county\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Similarly, in In re Disqualification of Jennings,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353670\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/143/1225/\">\n    143 Ohio St.3d 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-5866\">\n    2014-Ohio-5866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20N.E.3d%20531\">\n    35 NE.3d 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Chief Justice O'Connor, citing Carr, stated that \"[i]t is well established that a spousal relationship between a judge and a government attorney who is not involved in the case before the judge does not automatically warrant disqualification.\" Id. at \u00b6 5; see also Bates at \u00b6 9 (trial judge whose spouse was prosecuting attorney not required to recuse himself, because there was \"no evidence that Prosecutor Bates has participated in the preparation or presentation of the underlying case\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Additionally, 41 other states have similar judicial-conduct rules. See Adair v. State, Dept. ofEdn.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=474%20Mich.%201027\">\n    474 Mich. 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1033-1034,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=709%20N.W.2d%20567\">\n    709 NW.2d 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). Some of our sister supreme courts have specifically relied on Ohio's interpretation when interpreting their own equivalent rule. See, e.g., In re Jacobs,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7078258\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/802/748/#p753\">\n    802 NW.2d 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 753 (Minn.2011), citing Carr,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1196464\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/105/1233/\">\n    105 Ohio St.3d 1233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004-Ohio-7357\">\n    2004-Ohio-7357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=826%20N.E.2d%20294\">\n    826 NE.2d 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Only Colorado has case law somewhat supporting Beasley's argument. In Smith v. Beckman,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10429821\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/683/1214/\">\n    683 P.2d 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Colo.App. 1984), the Colorado Court of Appeals decided, without the benefit of other courts' interpretation of the applicable rule, that a judge should have disqualified himself from a misdemeanor criminal case because of his wife's position as a deputy district attorney in the same county.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10429821\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/683/1214/\">\n    Id. at 1215-1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even that case is distinguishable from the instant case, however, because the court based its decision on \"the close nature of the marriage relationship,\" which the court described as \"more intimate than any other kind of relationship between individuals.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10429821\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/683/1214/\">\n    Id. at 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In any event, courts in many states, including Ohio, have rejected the reasoning in Smith. See, e.g., Carr at \u00b6 17; Jacobs at 753-754.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Ohio's interpretation of Rule 2.11 of the Code of Judicial Conduct is consistent with the overwhelming majority of other states' readings of similar rules. The interpretation does not support the conclusion that Justice DeWine was required to recuse himself from the instant case based on his familial ties to Attorney General Mike DeWine. In fact, the above case law, which was barely mentioned in Beasley's motion for reconsideration, supports the opposite conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Beasley cites a decision of the United States Supreme Court, Williams v. Pennsylvania, --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597488\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1899/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597488\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1899/\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), in support of his argument that Justice DeWine's participation in his appeal deprived him of due process. In Williams, the court held that that \"an unconstitutional failure to recuse constitutes structural error even if the judge in question did not cast a deciding vote.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597488\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1899/\">\n    Id. at 1909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, \"[d]ue process guarantees 'an absence of actual bias' on the part of the judge.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597488\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1899/\">\n    Id. at 1905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting In re Murchinson,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11333990\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/349/133/#p136\">\n    349 U.S. 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 136,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11333990\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/349/133/#p136\">\n    75 S.Ct. 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20L.%20Ed.%20942\">\n    99 L.Ed. 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1955). The problem in Williams was that the chief justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court hearing Williams's appeal had been the district attorney at the time of Williams's trial, had participated in the case, and had personally made the final decision to seek the death penalty. That arrangement created \"a serious risk that a judge would be influenced by an improper, if inadvertent, motive to validate and preserve the result obtained through the adversary process.\" Id. at 1907. The same risks do not exist here-in part because there is no evidence that Attorney General Mike DeWine participated in the case. Further, Beasley has cited no authority for the proposition that a failure to recuse based on an alleged \"appearance of impartiality,\" as opposed to actual bias, violates due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Given that Beasley failed to request Justice DeWine's recusal under S.Ct.Prac.R. 4.04(B) and that almost every court that has addressed the issue has rejected similar arguments regarding when a judicial officer is disqualified, I find Beasley's first argument in support of reconsideration to be both waived and without merit. Thus, I concur in the decision to deny Beasley's motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   O'Donnell, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
