Appellant filed counterclaims regarding the property for declaratory judgment, quiet title, breach of contract, specific performance, promissory estoppel, implied contract, and equitable lien. Appellant also filed a motion to transfer the case to the common pleas court. The trial court granted appellant's motion on December 23, 2015 and issued a judgment entry transferring the case to the Stark County Court of Common Pleas. Appellees filed a reply to appellant's counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellees filed a motion to file an amended complaint. The trial court granted appellees' motion on January 22, 2016. Appellant filed an answer to the amended complaint on February 22, 2016 and again asserted his counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On September 23, 2016, appellees filed a motion for summary judgment. Attached to the motion for summary judgment was the affidavit of appellee Eddie Hmeidan. In the affidavit, Eddie Hmeidan averred: he and his wife Mimi are owners of the commercial real property located at 125-12th Street N.E. in Canton, Ohio, via a quitclaim deed filed on November 21, 2011; on November 10, 2011, he and Mimi entered into a lease/purchase agreement for the premises with appellant; under the terms of the agreement, appellant agreed to pay rent according to a schedule; appellant failed to pay rent for the month of May 2013, appellant paid only $1,000 per month for November 1, 2013 through October 31, 2014, when he was supposed to pay $1,500 per month, and appellant paid only $1,000 from November 1, 2014 to February 28, 2015, rather than the sum of $2,000 per month as required by the contract; appellant failed to pay any rent subsequent to February 28, 2015 and is in arrears in excess of $49,000; the contract provides that appellant shall be responsible for the payment of all delinquent real estate taxes and assessments, all current real estate taxes and assessments, and all future real estate taxes and assessments with respect to the premises; appellant has failed to pay real estate taxes and assessments, both delinquent and ongoing installments, and, as of December 31, 2015, taxes due, together with penalties and interest, is in excess of $21,576.32; on December 9, 2015, he served appellant with a 3-day notice to vacate the premises by posting the notice on the door of the property; and appellant remains in possession of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On October 7, 2016, appellant filed a motion for extension of time to respond to the motion for summary judgment due to the fact that appellant had filed bankruptcy. Appellees objected to the motion for extension of time. Appellees also filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment seeking to hold appellant personally liable for post-bankruptcy petition debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On October 14, 2016, appellant filed an affidavit in support of his motion for extension of time to respond to appellees' motion for summary judgment. The affidavit of appellant asserted: the deal he negotiated with appellees is a financing arrangement and not a lease; Eddie Hmeidan and appellant negotiated the deal in Arabic on November 1, 2011, and entered into a contract handwritten in Arabic, which has been translated into English and is attached as Exhibit A; the property was transferred to appellees as collateral for the loan agreement; he signed the lease purchase agreement, but because English is his second language, he was unable to read and understand that it may have been different from the agreement they previously wrote in Arabic; he made the periodic payments called for, and the amount of the payments were accepted by Eddie Hmeidan by agreement of the parties; Eddie Hmeidan abruptly stopped accepting\n   payments in March 2015 without prior notice or explanation; he paid $250,000 to another company, not related to Hmeidan, to purchase the property, and Hmeidan did not pay anything; the value for the loan in the agreement was the removal of a judgment lien Hmeidan had against the house where appellant lives; and he needs additional time to conduct discovery and respond to the motion for summary judgment because of his ill health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Attached as \"Exhibit A\" to the affidavit is a copy of three notebook pages of paper. At the end of the three pages, it says, \"Signed by Hasan Muheisen, Ahmad Hamdan, and Adel Hmeidan.\" The document also says, \"Translator: Mohammed Nayet.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On December 9, 2016, the trial court issued a judgment entry staying the case due to bankruptcy and stated it would not rule on any pending motions until the bankruptcy stayed was lifted. On January 31, 2017, the trustee in appellant's bankruptcy case filed a notice that she abandoned the property at 125-12th Street N.E. and that appellant's bankruptcy case was closed. The trial court returned the case to the active docket on February 2, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On February 27, 2017, appellees filed a motion for consideration of their motion for summary judgment filed on September 23, 2016. The trial court issued a judgment entry on March 2, 2017 setting a briefing schedule on appellees' motion for summary judgment. The trial court ordered any response be filed on or before March 17, 2017 and any reply be filed on or before March 24, 2017. The trial court stated, \"(n)o further continuances will be granted. Should any party wish for the Court to hold an oral hearing on this matter, it must be requested prior to March 17, 2017.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellant filed an objection and response to the motion for summary judgment on March 20, 2017, and asked the trial court to permit appellant to conduct discovery. Appellant also asserted the motion for summary judgment should be denied based upon his October 2016 affidavit. However, the affidavit was not attached to appellant's response and objection to the motion for summary judgment. Appellees filed a reply to appellant's response on March 21, 2017. Appellees argued appellant was not entitled to a continuance of more than eight days unless a bond was posted pursuant to R.C. 1923.08. Further, that appellant had provided no admissible evidence to contradict the evidence provided by appellees in their motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On March 28, 2017, appellant filed a, \"Refiling of Affidavit in Support of Response to Summary Judgment Motion.\" Appellant re-submitted his affidavit that was filed on October 14, 2016 in support of his motion for extension of time to respond to the motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The trial court issued a judgment entry granting appellees' motion for summary judgment on April 10, 2017. The trial court found appellant failed to make numerous rent payments as provided for in the lease agreement and failed to pay real estate taxes and assessments as provided for in the lease agreement. The trial court found appellant in default of the agreement. The trial court stated it considered the only evidence before it, the affidavit of Eddie Hmeidan, which states appellant has not paid rent or installments payments under the agreement since February 28, 2015 and states payments were sporadic and inadequate for some period prior to ceasing altogether. The trial court stated the \"purported agreement in Arabic cannot properly be considered.\" The trial court granted appellees summary judgment\n   and ordered a writ of restitution so appellees could regain possession of the property. The trial court also found the lease/purchase agreement void and cancelled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On April 26, 2017, the trial court transferred the writ of restitution to the Canton Municipal Court for execution. Appellant filed a motion to stay pending appeal on May 1, 2017. On May 3, 2017, the trial court issued a judgment entry staying the case pending appeal and ordered any monies due under the lease purchase agreement be deposited into an escrow account at the Stark County Clerk of Courts. The trial court modified its entry granting stay on May 11, 2017 and ordered appellant to post bond in the amount of $22,000. On May 16, 2017, the trial court issued a judgment entry and ordered appellant to post the $22,000 bond on or before June 2, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellees filed a motion to remove stay pending appeal on June 5, 2017 and argued the stay should be removed because appellant failed to post the $22,000 bond. On June 14, 2017, the trial court issued a judgment entry removing and rendering void the stay pending appeal for appellant's failure to comply with the trial court's May 16, 2017 order which required appellant to post bond in the amount of $22,000 on or before June 2, 2017. On June 30, 2017, a Canton Municipal Court judge ordered a writ of restitution for the property. The writ of restitution was issued on July 5, 2017. A forcible eviction was set for July 14, 2017. A Canton Municipal Court bailiff filed a return of writ, indicating he served the writ on July 14, 2017, but the occupants had moved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Appellant appeals the April 10, 2017 judgment entry of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas, and assigns the following as error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} \"I.

Thus, on June 14, 2017, the trial court issued a judgment entry removing and rendering void the stay pending appeal for appellant's failure to post bond. On June 30, 2017, the Canton Municipal Court ordered a writ of restitution for the premises. The writ of restitution was issued on July 5, 2017. The writ\n   was served on July 14, 2017, and the return from the bailiff stated the occupants had moved.
