L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. Debarros was tried in the District Court on the charge of accosting and annoying a person of the opposite sex. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. The jury were unable to reach a unanimous verdict, and the judge declared a mistrial. Debarros moved to dismiss on the ground that the evidence <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"2\" data-label=\"1033\" href=\"#p1033\" id=\"p1033\">**1033</a>was insufficient to warrant a conviction. That motion was denied, and Debarros's G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition sought relief from that denial.</p><p id=\"p-10\">Shortly after the single justice denied relief, the criminal charge was dismissed for lack of prosecution. The Commonwealth has therefore moved to dismiss this appeal as moot. We agree that the appeal must be dismissed. Where the underlying criminal case has been dismissed, there are no charges pending against Debarros, and he \"no longer has a personal stake in the outcome of this litigation.\" <em>Matter of Rudnicki</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"861497\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/421/1006/#p1007\">421 Mass. 1006</extracted-citation>, 1007, <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=657%20N.E.2d%20758\">657 N.E.2d 758</extracted-citation> (1995), quoting <em>Delaney</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3906791\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/415/490/#p492\">415 Mass. 490</extracted-citation>, 492, <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=614%20N.E.2d%20672\">614 N.E.2d 672</extracted-citation> (1993).
