Appellee is the State of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Facts and procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On September 25, 2016, shortly before 1:00 a.m. Appellant Mattes was operating a 2014 Toyota in Violet Township, Fairfield County, when Trooper P.M. White of the Ohio State Highway Patrol stopped him. The stop occurred at 12:53 a.m. T. at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} As a result of said traffic stop, appellant was cited for a marked lanes violation ( R.C. 4511.33 ) and arrested for OVI ( R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Following his arrest, appellant told Trooper White at the scene that he would provide a chemical sample to test for his alcohol level. Appellant was transported to the Lancaster Highway Patrol Post where he was read and signed the BMV-2255 form. Appellant was then taken to the room containing the BAC Datamaster equipment for a breath test. After Trooper White had completed his calibrations, appellant blew into the machine, but the result was an \"invalid sample.\" T. at 12. This result was obtained at 2:13 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Trooper White, according to his subsequent testimony, was trained that the Datamaster had to be taken out of service if a second consecutive invalid sample occurred. The trooper therefore decided not to offer appellant a second opportunity to submit to a breath test. Instead, Trooper White requested that appellant submit a urine sample. However, when appellant failed to produce a sufficient sample, Trooper White listed appellant on the BMV-2255 form as having \"refused\" chemical testing. This took place at 2:15 AM, just two minutes after the invalid breath sample result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On September 26, 2016, appellant filed an appeal to the Fairfield County Municipal Court of his administrative license suspension, with a request for an oral hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} A hearing took place on October 17, 2016.

Burtch,\n   </em>\n   10th Dist. Franklin No. 09AP-635,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-259\">\n    2010-Ohio-259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%20323222\">\n    2010 WL 323222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17 (additional citations omitted). However, in the present case the trooper stated that he did not know what Ohio Administrative Code section addressed removal of a BAC Datamaster after two invalid samples from an individual. Tr. at 18. But while a Datamaster must be taken out of service for inspection upon two controlled instrument checks outside the .005 range for the calibration solution target (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   OAC 3701-53-04 (A)(2) ), the State in its response brief provides no citation to an administrative provision supporting the trooper's assertions regarding removal of the machine from service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Next, in regard to the subsequent urine test attempt, it is undisputed that the trooper allowed just two minutes for appellant to provide a sample before marking him as \"refused,\" even though appellant claimed he was able to produce \"a couple of drops\" of urine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 49. We note that during the ALS appeal hearing, the following exchange took place between appellant's counsel and Trooper White:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 28} \"Q: Now, just so we're clear, Trooper, you're saying that Mr. Mattes said, 'I'm not going,' words to the effect that I'm not going to pee in that cup or no, I'm not going to take that test, or something to that effect?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 29} \"A: I cannot testify to that. He just did not provide a sample.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Tr. at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Appellant testified that he asked for a glass of water and a twenty-minute waiting period to try for another urine sample, but that Trooper White declined\n   and stated he needed to get back on patrol. Tr. at 50, 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 32} As the majority duly recites, \"[i]t is not a refusal if a person is unable to perform the requested act.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   (additional citations and internal quotations omitted). I am therefore troubled by Trooper White's stark assertion at the hearing that \"not providing a sample is a refusal.\" Tr. at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The majority also recites the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    City of Kettering v. Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , for the holding that R.C. 4511.191(A) does not impose an obligation mandating chemical testing conducted by municipalities. However, I note in that case, which did not stem from an appeal of an ALS suspension, Kettering authorities apparently had previously made a policy decision not to perform breathalyzer or blood tests at all, and the defendant therein did not request any chemical testing when transported to the jail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 352,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=328%20N.E.2d%20805\">\n    328 N.E.2d 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 34} In the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , appellant indeed requested testing, and given Trooper White's questionable curtailment of the breath test after one try and the restricted time frame immediately thereafter provided for the urine test, I do not find the trial court's conclusion that a valid testing refusal had occurred and the court's corresponding denial of appellant's ALS appeal were supported by competent, credible evidence. While I recognize the potential for stalling tactics by a driver submitting to OVI chemical testing, fundamental fairness demands that before driving privileges can be suspended on the basis of a motorist's \"refusal\" to allow such testing, a law enforcement officer must do more than what the trooper accomplished in this instance once the testing process has been initiated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 35} I would therefore sustain appellant's sole Assignment of Error and reverse the municipal court's affirmance of the ALS suspension.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
