We conclude a computer generated image may constitute a portrait within the meaning of that law. We also conclude, however, that the subject images are not recognizable as plaintiff, and that the amended complaint, which contains four causes of action for violation of privacy pursuant to Civil Rights Law \u00a7\u00a7 50 and 51, was properly dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants develop, sell, market, and distribute video games, including the commercially successful \"Grand Theft Auto V\" (GTAV) game. GTAV is an action-adventure game that is set in a fictional state called \"San Andreas\" that, according to the vice president for quality assurance of defendant Rockstar Games, Inc. (Rockstar), is intended to evoke Southern California. GTAV's plot occurs in and around a fictional city called \"Los Santos,\" which in turn is intended to evoke Los Angeles. In addition to a 50-hour principal storyline, GTAV contains approximately 100 hours of supplementary game play containing \"random events\" that a player may choose to explore as he or she proceeds through the game's main plot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   One of those random events is relevant to this appeal. In what defendants characterize as the \"Escape Paparazzi\" scene in GTAV, the player encounters a character named \"Lacey Jonas\" hiding from paparazzi in an alley. To the extent the player chooses to help her escape those photographers, Jonas enters the player's automobile before describing herself as an \"actress slash singer\" and the \"voice of a generation.\" Jonas also characterizes herself as \"really famous,\" and the player's character recognizes \"that Jonas has\n   starred in romantic comedies and a cheerleader dance-off movie.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before the GTAV storyline may proceed to any random events, including the \"Escape Paparazzi\" scene, the player must view what defendants refer to as \"transition screens,\" which \"contain artwork that appears briefly on the user's screen while the game content [loads] into the game console's memory.\" Two \"screens\" from GTAV are relevant to this appeal. One such screen contains an image (the \"Stop and Frisk\" image) of a blonde woman who is clad in denim shorts, a fedora, necklaces, large sunglasses, and a white T-shirt while being frisked by a female police officer. The second such screen contains an image (the \"Beach Weather\" image) wherein the same blonde woman is depicted wearing a red bikini and bracelets, taking a \"selfie\" with her cell phone, and displaying the peace sign with one of her hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants purportedly released GTAV for the PlayStation and Xbox 360 video game consoles on or about September 17, 2013. Through that release, copies of GTAV were distributed to and sold by numerous domestic and foreign retailers, including retailers within New York State. To advertise the game prior to its release, defendants allegedly used the \"Stop and Frisk\" and \"Beach Weather\" images on various promotional materials, including billboards. Defendants also used the \"Beach Weather\" image on the packaging for the GTAV, and both the \"Beach Weather\" and \"Stop and Frisk\" images on video game discs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to plaintiff, who describes herself as a figure \"recognized in social media\" and as \"a celebrity actor... who has been regularly depicted in television, tabloids, blogs, movies, fashion related magazines, talk shows, and theatre for the past 15 ... years,\" the Jonas character is her \"look-a-like\" and misappropriates her \"portrait[ ] and voice.\" Plaintiff also believes that the \"Stop and Frisk\" and \"Beach Weather\" images each cumulatively evoke her \"images, portrait[,] and persona.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Inasmuch as she did not provide written consent for the use of what she characterizes as her portrait and her voice in GTAV, plaintiff commenced this action seeking, among other things, compensatory and punitive damages for invasion of privacy in violation of Civil Rights Law \u00a7\u00a7 50 and 51. In lieu of answering, defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a cause of action (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CPLR 3211[a][7] ) and based on, among other things, documentary evidence (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CPLR 3211[a][1] ).

It follows that \"a privacy action [cannot] be sustained ... because of the nonconsensual use of a [representation] without identifying features\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=472%20N.E.2d%20307\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Whether an image or avatar is a \"portrait\" because it presents a \"recognizable likeness\" typically is question for a trier of fact (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=472%20N.E.2d%20307\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Nevertheless, before a factfinder can decide that question, there must be a basis for it to conclude that the person depicted \"is capable of being identified from the advertisement alone\" as plaintiff (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=472%20N.E.2d%20307\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). That legal determination will depend on the court's evaluation of the \"quality and quantity of the identifiable characteristics\" present in the purported portrait (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=472%20N.E.2d%20307\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Here, the Jonas character simply is not recognizable as plaintiff inasmuch as it merely is a generic artistic depiction of a \"twenty something\" woman without any particular identifying physical characteristics. The analysis with respect to the Beach Weather and Stop and Frisk illustrations is the same. Those artistic renderings are indistinct, satirical representations of the style, look, and persona of a modern, beach-going young woman. It is undisputed that defendants did not refer to plaintiff in GTAV, did not use her name in GTAV, and did not use a photograph of her in that game (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787290\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/142/776/#p777\">\n    142 AD3d at 776-777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787290\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/142/776/#p777\">\n    37 N.Y.S.3d 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Costanza v.
