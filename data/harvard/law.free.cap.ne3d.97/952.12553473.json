(Lisa May Depo. at 47). The weather was rainy that day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47). Mrs. May turned right upon entering and was making her way toward the deli area when she slipped on a puddle of water and fell to the floor (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60-63). Mrs. May was pushing a shopping cart at the time she slipped on the puddle (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 68). There were no yellow caution cones near the puddle.\n   <em>\n    (Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60). Mrs. May did not see the water puddle until after she fell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. May stated that he was also unable to see the puddle of water, and could only see it when he moved several feet away from the area and had to bend down to be able to see it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Mr. May testified that the puddle of water was a result of water he observed leaking from the tiles in the ceiling. (\n   <em>\n    ld.\n   </em>\n   at 66-67; Jack May Depo. at 20-21). He stated that the puddle of water was somewhere between 15 inches and 24 inches in diameter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19; Lisa May Dep. at 68). He further stated that at the time of the incident he observed a drop of water falling every 3-5 seconds. (Jack May Depo. at 20). He further observed discoloration on the ceiling tile from where the water was dripping. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} William O'Connell, a co-manager of Kroger store # 591, was called over to the area where Mrs. May fell. (O'Connell Depo. at 29-30). Mr. O'Connell stated that he did not see any water on the floor where Mrs. May fell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:5-21). Mr. O'Connell testified at deposition that there is a history of water-stained tiles on the ceiling of the Kroger store. (\n   <em>\n    ld.\n   </em>\n   at 65). He acknowledged that he has to \"get them repaired all the time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65). He further stated that there are various water spots on the ceiling tiles and that one of the ceiling tiles which was near the produce department appeared to be holding more water than other.

There is no evidence in the record that defendant's officers or employees were aware of any roof leaks. Plaintiffs have offered no evidence that any of the previously repaired tiles were in the same area as the ceiling tile that was dripping on the day of the injury or that defendant had any reason to believe water might drip on the floor apart from the fact that it had previously repaired ceiling tiles.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   There was no evidence offered concerning how long the water had been dripping, nor any other evidence that would suggest the water had been on the floor long enough that defendant's officers or employees should have known of its presence.

Appellant stated that she does not know how long the water had been dripping from the ceiling tile.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67. Appellant also stated that she had never seen a leak in that area at any other time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77. She acknowledged that she had no evidence to demonstrate that Kroger knew if there was a roof leak or that there was water on the floor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 69-70. No one from Kroger, Sedgwick,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   or anyone\n   else told her that Kroger knew the ceiling had been leaking.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70-71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Upon review, we agree with the trial court's determination that Appellants failed to present evidence that Appellee breached a duty to Lisa May. Appellants have not presented evidence that a genuine issue of material fact exists about whether Appellee Kroger had actual or constructive knowledge of the accumulation of water on the floor prior to Appellant's fall. Appellant presented no evidence that anyone from Kroger knew the water was on the floor before she fell, nor did she present any evidence, other than conjecture, of what caused the water to leak from the ceiling onto the floor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cooper v.

Appellants testimony that the puddle was \"up to 24 inches in diameter\" and the water dripping from the ceiling was observed to be falling at a rate of one drop every 3-5 seconds, does not provide the court with enough data to extrapolate how long it took the water to accumulate on the floor prior to the fall in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 25} If a plaintiff cannot establish that the owner or its agents created the hazard or possessed actual knowledge of the hazard, evidence showing the length of time during which the hazard existed is necessary to support an inference that the owner had constructive knowledge of the hazard such that the failure to remove or warn of the hazard was a breach of ordinary care.\n   <em>\n    Presley v.

Accordingly, the theory by which Appellant wishes to establish Kroger's negligence is dependent on an inference upon an inference and is impermissible).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Appellants further argue that the existence of stained ceiling tiles in other areas of the ceiling constituted evidence that Appellee Kroger knew that the ceiling leaked, and that this alone should put Appellee on notice that it had a problem and impose upon it a higher duty to inspect the premises, especially when it rained. Initially, we do not find that the fact that ceiling tiles show water staining, in and of itself, is direct evidence of a leaky roof. There could be many explanations for such staining to occur. Further, we find that the only evidence presented herein was that the stained tiles and/or repaired tiles were located in other areas of the store, not where Appellant fell. There was no evidence presented that the roof was leaking or that a leaky roof was the source of the water dripping from the ceiling in the area where Appellant Lisa May slipped and fell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Based on the foregoing, we find the trial court correctly determined Appellants presented no evidence that Appellee had actual or constructive knowledge of the water on the floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Consortium Claim\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 29} We now turn to Appellants' argument the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Appellee on Appellant Jack May's loss of consortium claim. \"[A] claim for loss of consortium is derivative in that the claim is dependent upon the defendants having committed a legally cognizable tort upon the spouse who suffers bodily injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Donnelly v.

Because Appellee is not liable to Appellant Lisa May for\n   her injuries, there is no legally cognizable tort against Appellee; therefore, Appellant Jack May has no derivative claim to loss of consortium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Appellants' Two Assignments of Error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 31} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Licking County, Ohio, is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Gwin, P.J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Wise, Earle, J., dissents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 32} I respectfully dissent from the majority's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The majority finds at \u00b6 23 that \"Appellants have not presented evidence that a genuine issue of material fact exists about whether Appellee Kroger had actual or constructive knowledge of the accumulation of water on the floor prior to Appellant's fall.\" I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Once the burden shifted to Appellants to set forth specific facts showing there was a genuine issue of material fact for trial, Appellants presented evidence via their depositions and that of Mr. O'Connell. Mrs. May testified she slipped and fell on a puddle of water on the floor that came from the ceiling because she could see it dripping. Lisa May Depo. at 66. A lot of ceiling tiles had water marks on them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 69. The weather was rainy that day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47. Mr. May confirmed it was raining that day, and testified the water was a puddle between 15 and 24 inches in diameter and when he looked up, he observed a drop of water falling every 3-5 seconds from a discolored ceiling tile. Jack May Depo. at 15, 20. Mr. O'Connell did not see any water on the floor. O'Connell Depo. at 34. He acknowledged he needed to repair water-stained ceiling tiles in the store all the time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64-65. Appellants presented a work order of Phinney Industrial Roofing, Inc., dated three days after the incident, indicating a leak had occurred and \"another ceiling tile looks to be holding water (much worse than the others) in front of the produce department.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53-56. The work order noted \"[m]oved ballast to find and repair 1 hole in between rtu 3 and 5\" and \"[h]ole in field membrane. Repaired with a compatible quickseam patch.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Contrary to what the trial court found, based on the evidence presented during the summary judgment phase, reasonable inferences could be made that a leak caused the water dripping from the ceiling and leaks were commonplace since water-stained ceiling tiles needed repaired all the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 36} The trial court also determined there was no evidence that would suggest the water had been on the floor long enough for Appellee to have known of its existence. The majority at \u00b6 24 finds Mr. May's testimony regarding the size of the puddle in relation to the drops falling every 3 to 5 seconds \"does not provide the court with enough data to extrapolate how long it took the water to accumulate on the floor prior to the fall in question.\" I find this is an issue to be proven at trial and to be determined by a factfinder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Youngerman v.

I find the issues of constructive notice and whether the danger existed for a sufficient length of time are genuine issues of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jordan v. Simon Property Group,\n   </em>\n   11th Dist.
