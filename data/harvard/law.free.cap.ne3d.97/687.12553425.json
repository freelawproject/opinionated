Abernathy appeals from a judgment of the county court denying, without a hearing, his petition for relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. In 2014, Abernathy's convictions of breaking and entering during the daytime with intent to commit a felony and of possession of burglarious tools were affirmed by the Appeals Court, and we denied further appellate review. <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Abernathy</em>, <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201117\">85 Mass.

Abernathy filed a motion for a new trial, claiming that the indictments were defective. That motion was denied; the denial was affirmed by the Appeals Court, and we denied further appellate review. <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Abernathy</em>, <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201119\">91 Mass.

In addition, Abernathy filed his G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition, which was denied while the latter application for further appellate review was pending. We affirm the denial of relief.</p><p id=\"p-9\">Abernathy has filed a memorandum and appendix pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 2:21, as amended, <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=434%20Mass.%201301\">434 Mass. 1301</extracted-citation> (2001), which requires a party challenging an interlocutory ruling of the trial court to \"set forth the reasons why review of the trial court decision cannot adequately be obtained on appeal from any final adverse judgment in the trial court or by other available means.\" That rule does not apply, as Abernathy is not challenging an interlocutory ruling of the trial court. Nonetheless, it is clear on the record that Abernathy had, and pursued, an adequate remedy in the ordinary process, namely, his appeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial. \"Our general superintendence power under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is extraordinary and to be exercised sparingly, not as a substitute for the normal appellate process or merely to provide an additional layer of appellate review after the normal process has run its course.\" <em>Bishay</em> v. <em>Land Ct.

Moreover, the single justice did not decide the petition on the merits or report the case to the full court to address [the] claim of systemic error, and we are loath to second-guess [his] discretion in this respect.\" <em>Benjamin B</em>. v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20Mass.%201012\">478 Mass. 1012</extracted-citation>, 1013 n.3, <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20N.E.3d%201252\">84 N.E.3d 1252</extracted-citation> (2017), citing <em>Jackson</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"734988,734975\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/437/1008/\">437 Mass. 1008</extracted-citation>, 1009, <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=770%20N.E.2d%20469\">770 N.E.2d 469</extracted-citation> (2002).</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
