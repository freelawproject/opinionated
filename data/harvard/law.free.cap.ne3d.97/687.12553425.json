Nonetheless, it is clear on the record that Abernathy had, and pursued, an adequate remedy in the ordinary process, namely, his appeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial. \"Our general superintendence power under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is extraordinary and to be exercised sparingly, not as a substitute for the normal appellate process or merely to provide an additional layer of appellate review after the normal process has run its course.\"\n      <em>\n       Bishay\n      </em>\n      v.\n      <em>\n       Land Ct.
