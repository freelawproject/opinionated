A single justice of this court denied relief, and, in November, 2016, the father appealed to this court. He filed a motion for an extension of time to file his brief and was given until December 23, 2016, to file it. He did not do so. The child's mother, with the child's assent, has moved to dismiss the appeal, as has the Department of Children and Families.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See Mass. R. A. P. 19 (c), <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20Mass.%20867\">365 Mass. 867</extracted-citation> (1974). In response, the father does not explain his failure to file a brief in this matter, but makes unsubstantiated allegations concerning the child's treatment outside this country.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The father has had ample time to file a brief in this matter and has not done so. Although the father is appearing pro se, we hold him to the same standards in this regard as litigants represented by counsel. See, e.g., <em>Rasheed</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1346321\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/440/1027/#p1027\">440 Mass. 1027</extracted-citation>, 1027, <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=798%20N.E.2d%201022\">798 N.E.2d 1022</extracted-citation> (2003) ; <em>Solimine</em> v. <em>Davidian</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"890128,890179,890294\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/422/1002/\">422 Mass. 1002</extracted-citation>, 1002, <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=661%20N.E.2d%20934\">661 N.E.2d 934</extracted-citation> (1996). Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed for lack of <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"2\" data-label=\"1031\" href=\"#p1031\" id=\"p1031\">**1031</a>prosecution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-11\"><em>Appeal dismissed</em>.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"
