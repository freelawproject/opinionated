Raider appeals from the judgment of the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas. This Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In the early morning hours of October 12, 2013, Brandon Smith was shot in the head while lying in his bed next to his girlfriend, E.M. Smith died from his injuries. Smith's housemate, Raider, admitted to shooting Smith, but asserted that it was an accident; Raider maintained that the gun went off when he dropped the weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Following an investigation, Raider was indicted on one count of aggravated murder, two counts of murder, and two counts of felonious assault. Each count contained an accompanying firearm specification. The matter proceeded to a jury trial, at which the following testimony was adduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The State's theory of the case was that Raider intentionally shot and killed Smith so that Raider could develop a relationship with E.M. The State argued that the evidence supported that it was Raider's purpose to shoot Smith and that the shot was fired at close range. The defense argued that there was no ill will between Smith and Raider and that the evidence supported that the shot was accidentally fired when Raider dropped the gun while standing in the doorway, a dozen or so feet away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} E.M. lived a couple houses down from Smith's and Raider's house. She spent a fair amount of time with Raider, given that Raider lived with Smith, and thought Smith and Raider seemed to get along and that their relationship seemed pretty normal. E.M. considered Raider to be a friend. He fixed her car once and took her to a doctor's appointment. However, E.M. described Raider as either being in a great mood, or being cranky and tired. One time, about a week before Smith's death, when Raider seemed cranky and tired, E.M. told Raider that she thought he was going to go crazy and kill someone. Raider just laughed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} E.M. testified that, while Smith did not have any firearms, Raider did, and he would take them out constantly. She indicated that he also had a BB gun that he had shot people with, including her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The day before the shooting, in between E.M.'s jobs, E.M. and Smith went to a movie to celebrate Smith's recent birthday. After work, they went to Smith's house and were watching TV with Raider and another friend. The four then went to a nearby bar in Avon. While at the bar, Raider talked with E.M.'s son's father. Raider asked on multiple occasions that night whether E.M.'s son's father had ever thought of getting back together with E.M. and Raider seemed relieved when E.M.'s son's father said no. While at the bar, E.M. had five shots and ended up getting into an argument with her son's father's ex-girlfriend, whom she chased out of the bar with her shoe. Smith was upset by the\n   argument and he and E.M. talked about it outside the bar. The two decided to leave, but Raider would not let them walk home, and insisted on driving them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} After dropping them off at Smith's house, Raider went back to the bar. While Raider had been drinking that evening, E.M.'s son's father indicated that Raider seemed fine and did not seem impaired. E.M.'s son's father was not worried about Raider driving and indicated that he did care about people driving drunk as he had been involved in an accident when he was younger caused by a drunk driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} When Raider returned home, Smith and E.M. were in the kitchen talking. E.M. thought Raider appeared to have been drinking. He brought out a handgun and pointed it at Smith's head and asked E.M. if Raider was a robber, would E.M. let him kill Smith. Smith and E.M. thought Raider was joking around, so they played along and E.M. said no and took the gun and pointed it at her own head. At that point, Raider ripped the gun away from her, unloaded it, and the bullets fell to the floor. E.M. had not realized the gun was loaded, yelled at Raider, and went outside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} While outside, E.M. called her son's father to apologize for her behavior. E.M. came back inside, and saw Smith and Raider sitting on Smith's bed talking. E.M. went in the bathroom and began crying because she was disappointed in herself and her behavior. Raider came in the bathroom and asked if she was alright. She responded that she felt like a bad mother. Raider told her that she was a great mom and that he loved her. He had never told her anything like that before. She thought he was just drunk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Raider picked E.M. up, carried her into Smith's bedroom, and laid her on the bed next to Smith. Smith was lying in the bed, under the blankets, and towards the edge of the bed nearest the door. E.M. was placed even closer to the door, almost at the edge of the bed, in a \"spoon[ing]\" position next to Smith. Raider placed Smith's right arm over E.M. Smith whispered in E.M.'s ear and told her to pretend to be asleep because Raider was being annoying. They both closed their eyes. E.M. heard Raider mumble something and walk out. The next thing E.M. heard was Raider say, \"If you lay there just like that.\" E.M. then heard a really loud sound that caused her to grab her right ear in pain and jumped up. She looked over at Smith and saw blood coming out of his temple. E.M. saw Raider walking out of the room and yelled that he had shot Smith. Raider turned around and told her to call 911. E.M. had been putting pressure on the wound and Raider pushed her away and told her to call 911 and wait outside for the ambulance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Sergeant Kevin Collins with the Avon Police Department was the first to arrive on the scene. He met E.M. in the front yard. She was screaming that someone had been shot and that someone was inside administering first aid. She told Sergeant Collins that she thought the shooting was an accident. Over objection, Sergeant Collins opined that it was not legal to handle a firearm while intoxicated. Sergeant Collins went in the residence and observed Raider administering first aid to Smith when he entered Smith's bedroom. Sergeant Collins had an audio recording device on when he went in the house. Raider can be heard on multiple occasions saying that he dropped the gun and it went off. Raider indicated that he was standing in the doorway near the doorjamb when he dropped the gun. Raider told police that the gun was in the other bedroom, probably under the bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Captain Timothy Barrett, a firefighter and paramedic with the Avon Fire Department testified that by the time he arrived on the scene, Smith had snoring or\n   agonal respirations which was a very serious condition and was indicative of a head injury. When Captain Barrett was lifting Smith onto the backboard to transport him to the hospital, Captain Barrett discovered a shell casing underneath Smith's head and pointed it out to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Sergeant Robert Olds of the Avon Police Department assisted with evidence collection at the scene of the shooting. Two rounds of ammunition were found on the kitchen floor. A gun was located under Raider's bed with blood staining on it. The slide of the weapon was in the backwards position when it was found. On Raider's bed was a magazine for a rifle and an empty holster. Blood smears were also found on the bed. After the bed was moved, in the corner of the room, a magazine that fit the gun found under the bed was located. Blood smears were found on the wall near where magazine was found in the corner. There were six rounds left in the magazine. Raider's room also contained gun safes and several weapons. The only handgun located was the one found under the bed. Additionally, a pellet gun, assault rifles, and shotguns were found in the room. Sergeant Olds estimated that from the doorway of Smith's room to where the large blood spot was found on Smith's bed was 12 to 15 feet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} After E.M. had time to think about the events and after telling the events to various people, she began to think that the shooting was not an accident. On October 14, 2013, E.M. went to the police station to tell the police some details about the evening that she had unintentionally left out and to tell them that her opinion about the events had changed; she no longer believed the shooting was an accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Around October 14, 2013, Sergeant Bryan Rado with the Avon Police Department started looking at the items of evidence that had been collected. He indicated it was important to examine the evidence and to attempt to analyze whether the events could have taken place the way that Raider said that they did. He reiterated that, initially, the shooting was investigated as possibly being accidental. Sergeant Rado indicated that the \"slug\" had not been located and so he searched through the physical evidence and discovered it embedded in one of the pillows that had been on Smith's bed. Subsequently, Sergeant Rado went to the crime scene. In Raider's bedroom, he noticed that some paint had been nicked away from the wall in the corner of the room near the bed, near where prior investigators had located the magazine. Investigators speculated that the magazine had been thrown against the wall. After looking at the photographs and other evidence and talking with other officers, Sergeant Rado became troubled by Raider's version of events. Sergeant Rado testified that based on where the casing was located (on the bed), and because it appeared the slug entered the side of the pillow as opposed to the front, there were concerns with Raider's statement that the gun went off while he was standing in the doorway, as opposed to closer to the bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Several items from the crime scene were tested for DNA evidence, including the .40 caliber handgun and magazine. A sample from a presumptive blood stain from the t-shirt Raider was wearing contained a DNA profile consistent with that of Smith. The trigger of the handgun also contained a profile consistent with Smith's profile. The swab from the slide of the handgun and the swab from the handle and trigger guard contained a mixture consistent with contributions by both Smith and Raider. The profile obtained from the presumptive bloodstain on the handgun was consistent with Smith's profile. The profile from the stain on the magazine was consistent with Smith's and the profile\n   from the swab of the remainder of the magazine was a mixture consistent with both Smith's and Raider's profiles. No DNA profile was obtained from a swab of the rounds found inside the magazine. Gunshot residue testing indicated that particles highly indicative of gunshot primer residue were identified on samples from E.M., Raider, and Smith. The results signified that those individuals discharged a firearm, were near a firearm when it was discharged, or handled an item with gunshot primer residue on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Joshua Barr, a forensic scientist assigned to the firearms section of the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (\"BCI\") examined the handgun from the case. He found it to be an operable Sig Sauer model P226 .40 caliber semiautomatic pistol. Barr determined that the bullet fragments removed from Smith's head were fired from the gun he examined. He indicated that \"[d]uring the firing cycle sometimes [the ejection of the casing] can be unpredictable, but it's designed to go to the right and slightly rearward.\" However, he acknowledged that it is possible the casing could be ejected forward slightly. When asked if the casing could be ejected 20 feet forward, Barr stated that \"would be unlikely, but it's possible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Barr testified that the gun had a single-action and a double-action mode. In single-action mode, it takes approximately 4 pounds of force to fire the gun, while in double-action mode it takes approximately 8 pounds of force to fire the gun. To switch the gun to double-action mode, the decocker lever is pressed. Additionally, Barr averred that an additional safety feature of the gun prevents the hammer from hitting the firing pin without the trigger being pressed. Thus, \"if [the] gun were to drop or you would hit the back of it, it couldn't actually contact the firing pin to fire the cartridge.\" Barr also indicated that the gun has a firing pin block which prevents the firing pin \"from going through\" absent the trigger being pulled. Barr averred that the gun is a safe gun. He testified that absent the gun malfunctioning or something being broken, the gun would not fire without the trigger being pulled and that he found nothing broken or malfunctioning in the weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Dan Galita, M.D., a board certified anatomic and forensic pathologist from the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's office, who performed the autopsy on Smith, testified that Smith died from a gunshot wound to the head with skull and brain injuries. The entrance wound was in the left temple and was slightly oval shaped. Medical personal sutured the wound in an attempt to stop the bleeding. Dr. Galita removed the sutures during the autopsy and was aware that upon removal, 8 puncture wounds, 4 on each side of the wound, remained in the skin. Dr. Galita indicated that wound was surrounded by very dense, or confluent, stippling, as well as isolated stippling marks at the periphery. He testified that the area around the wound was also burned and that there were black gunpowder particles embedded within the wound itself, one inside the wound track, and one in the margin. From those findings, Dr. Galita averred that the shooting was close range, meaning that the gun was less than 6 inches away from the skin when it was discharged. He believed that, more than likely it was probably 1 or 2 inches from Smith's skin when it was fired. He further indicated that one would not expect to see stippling around a wound from a shot fired at distance greater than 3 feet. Dr. Galita testified that he was aware of the phenomenon of pseudostippling, which looks like stippling but is caused by something other than gunpowder, such as the puncture wounds created by sutures. According to Dr. Galita, pseudostippling is \"large, * * * irregular in shape, and * * * easy to identify.\" Dr.\n   Galita stated that he had not confused the puncture wounds for stippling and was aware of where the puncture wounds were because he himself removed the sutures. Dr. Galita pointed out for the jury the areas he believed demonstrated the stippling as compared to the puncture wounds left from the sutures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Dr. Galita also described the exit wound as star shaped and showed it to the jury in the photographs. From the location of the entrance and exit wounds, Dr. Galita asserted that the \"trajectory of the bullet was from front to back, left to right, and upwards.\" The gunshot wound caused extensive damage to the brain and skull and was not a survivable injury. Dr. Galita posited that the shooting caused an instant loss of consciousness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The defense presented three witnesses in an effort to support its theory that the shooting was accidental: on Renuart, Humphrey Germaniuk, M.D., and Jason Thomason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Renuart was a friend of Raider's. During the day of October 11, 2013, Renuart went to the gun range with Raider for approximately 2 to 2.5 hours to target practice with rifles and handguns. Renuart testified that the two traded guns back and forth, and, at one point, Renuart used Raider's Sig Sauer pistol. He averred that the gun had \"a very light trigger pull.\" To Renuart, that meant that when \"you start to pull it, fires.\" He added that if \"you're not used to that, which [he] was not, it almost feels like it goes off unintentionally.\" He claimed that there were three times during the first clip where he shot the weapon \"without even realizing that [he] was going to pull the trigger.\" Renuart said that he laughed about it and stated that, \"This gun scares me.\" When the gun ejected the casings, he indicated that they ejected to the right side of the gun. He testified that the gun at trial looked like the gun he had used. On cross-examination, Renuart admitted that he had never fired a Sig Sauer before that day and so did not know whether he shot it in single-action or double-action mode, or what the safety features of the weapon were.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Dr. Germaniuk, the medical examiner and coroner for Trumbull County, who is also board certified in forensic and anatomic pathology, disagreed with some of Dr. Galita's findings. Specifically, Dr. Germaniuk did not see any stippling around the gunshot wound, soot particles, or burning of the skin based upon his review of the evidence, including the photographs. However, he acknowledged that the person performing the autopsy would be in the best position to view the physical evidence. Dr. Germaniuk thought it was possible Dr. Galita mistook the pseudostippling, caused by the puncture wounds from the sutures, as stippling. Dr. Germaniuk opined that there was no evidence of a contact or close range gunshot wound. He concluded that it was a distant gunshot wound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Thomason, who is an attorney and CEO and general counsel for the Appalachia Group, and also the chief instructor for the firearms safety academy for Ohio Valley Outdoors, performed testing with a Sig Sauer firearm. However, Thomason did not test the specific weapon used in the shooting. The gun he examined had a single action trigger pull of 4.3 pounds and a double action trigger pull of 9.8 pounds. Thomason fired the weapon from different distances through two sheets of paper taped together to examine the penetration and the pattern that was left on the paper. He performed tests from 2 inches away from the paper to 28 inches away. He concluded that up to 6 inches away there was significant burning of the front area of the page and that the punctures created by the unburned propellant\n   were significant up to a distance of 8 inches. Thomason also asserted that there were still punctures in the paper all the way up to a distance around 24 to 28 inches. However, he could not make a comparison to human skin. He noted that the ejection of the casings was erratic but \"[e]ssentially, the shells eject to the right[.]\" He also testified that the firearm could fire if it was dropped from any distance; however he did not test that with the weapon and instead got that information from the manual. He opined that the model was \"somewhat of an antiquated design\" but that it was still \"a popular firearm today.\" He believed that the \"Ohio State Highway Patrol carries them[,]\" however, \"most departments have [gone] to a striker-firing system that doesn't have a hammer, because they are safer than systems that contain a hammer. Because when you have a hammer, you always have the potential of that hammer being struck with some inertia that could cause the system to fire.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 26} On cross-examination, Thomason admitted that he does business with Raider's father because Raider's father is a gun wholesaler. Without objection, he was asked whether he was aware that the State of California drops these types of guns out of planes without them discharging. Additionally, Thomason was asked about, and ultimately disagreed with, a statement from a website that indicated that the type of gun at issue \"drop[s] safe from a reasonable distance,\" and that there would have to be \"enough force to bend some serious metal before the gun could possibly go off.\" Following that, Thomason was asked what if he was told that the State dropper a Sig Sauer \"some 14 times\" and it did not discharge. An objection to that question was sustained but there was no request to strike it or specifically instruct the jury about it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 27} When asked to make the trigger move forward to hit the firing pin without pulling the trigger while in double action mode, Thomason testified that he could not do so. He indicated that there had to be enough force to overcome the safety notch; he did not know how much force would be needed and that it would depend on the individual firearm because each is not exactly identical. When asked if he was suggesting that the murder weapon, if dropped, was going to go off because the hammer would hit the firing pin, he averred that he \"never made that statement[,]\" but \"[a]ny firearm can go off if dropped.\" Thomason specifically stated that he \"wasn't opining about that particular gun [ (the murder weapon) ].\" Instead, he \"was talking about that design in general.\" He agreed that his testimony should not be interpreted to mean that the murder weapon was in any way defective on the day of the shooting. Thomason also acknowledged, without objection, that a person is not supposed to handle a weapon while he has been drinking, as the person would be \"under disability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 28} During trial, Raider's counsel requested that the trial court instruct the jury that \"the Defendant had no obligation to prove anything concerning accident[.]\" The trial court declined to give that particular instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Following deliberations, the jury found Raider not guilty of aggravated murder, but guilty of the remaining counts and accompanying specifications. The trial court sentenced Raider on count two (murder) and merged the remaining counts for purposes of sentencing. Raider was sentenced to 15 years to life for murder and 3 years for the related firearms specification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Raider has appealed, raising three assignments of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL'S FAILURE TO OBJECT TO UNFAIRLY PREJUDICIAL EVIDENCE AND FAILURE TO REQUEST A LESSER INCLUDE[D] OFFENSE DEPRIVED THE APPELLANT HIS RIGHT TO EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF TRIAL COUNSEL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Raider argues in his first assignment of error that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance for several reasons. Specifically, Raider argues that trial counsel was ineffective in that he failed to request an instruction for the lesser-included offense of reckless homicide, failed to object to the prosecutor bringing forth evidence that Raider committed an uncharged offense, failed to object to other acts evidence, failed to object to evidence that was inadmissible under Evid.R. 402 and/or 403, and failed to request a curative instruction. We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 32} In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Raider must show that his \"counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that prejudice arose from counsel's performance.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Reynolds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1132541\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/80/670/#p674\">\n    80 Ohio St.3d 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 674,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=687%20N.E.2d%201358\">\n    687 N.E.2d 1358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998), citing\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

As the issue to request a jury instruction on the lesser-included offense falls squarely within defense counsel's purview of trial tactics, we will not second-guess counsel's decision. Furthermore, we see nothing in the record to demonstrate that counsel's decision not to request a jury instruction on the lesser-included offense was anything other than a tactical election to seek an acquittal rather than a conviction on the lesser-included offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2021185941\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    Offense Not Charged\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Raider challenges counsel's failure to properly object to Sergeant Collins' testimony that it was illegal to handle a firearm while intoxicated. While counsel did object, he did so on the basis that the testimony was improper redirect, not that the testimony was evidence of an uncharged crime. Even assuming that such testimony was improper evidence of an uncharged crime, we cannot say that the failure to object was prejudicial. Thomason, an attorney, also acknowledged during cross-examination, without objection, that a person is not supposed to handle a weapon while he has been drinking, as the person would be \"under disability.\" Raider\n   has not challenged on appeal trial counsel's failure to object to that testimony.

Raider argues that identity was not an issue and thus the only reason to admit that evidence would be to portray Raider as a bad person or to show that he had a propensity for shooting his friends. The State points out that, \"[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts * * * may * * * be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\" Evid.R. 404(B). The State contends that the evidence was admissible to demonstrate the absence of mistake or accident, particularly since Raider argued that the shooting was accidental. Raider has failed to address this point in his argument on appeal. Further, this Court has concluded that, \"a failure to object may be considered sound trial strategy in that '[a] competent trial attorney might well eschew objecting* * * in order to minimize jury attention to the damaging material.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

For example, the State asked Thomason without objection whether he was aware that the State of California drops these types of guns out of planes without them discharging. Additionally, Thomason was asked about, and ultimately disagreed with, a statement from a website that indicated that the type of gun at issue \"drop[s] safe from a reasonable distance,\" and that there would have to be \"enough force to bend some serious metal before the gun could possibly go off.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Raider has not challenged those questions on appeal.

Defense counsel objected to it the first time it was asked and the objection was overruled. When the question was revisited later, defense counsel did not renew his objection.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-92\">\n   CALLAHAN, J., DISSENTING.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 55} I respectfully dissent from the majority's resolution of Mr. Raider's second assignment of error. As noted by the majority, the defense presented in this case was that the shooting was the result of an accidental discharge when the gun was dropped. Given that context and reviewing the entire trial, I would find that the information about the gun being dropped 14 times without discharging that was disseminated to the jury through the prosecutor's improper question prejudicially affected Mr. Raider's substantial rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 56} First, even though defense counsel objected midway through the offending question, the prosecutor, who surely knew better than to continue talking after the objection, pushed forward repeating the number of times the gun allegedly had been dropped. Thus, he made certain the jury heard that the gun was dropped \"some 14 times, and it didn't go off.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Second, the prosecutor's \"question\" was not a question at all. Rather, it amounted to unchallenged testimony about an issue that was at the very heart of the matter in this case, namely whether Mr. Raider's Sig Sauer was capable of accidentally discharging if dropped. The defense argued that any \"tests that the State made should be subject to cross-examination.\" Answers to questions such as who was the \"we\" who dropped the gun, whose Sig Sauer was dropped, under what conditions was it dropped, and in what condition was the Sig Sauer at the time it was dropped, never reached the jurors' ears because defense counsel was unable to conduct a cross-examination on the many issues contained within the prosecutor's \"question.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 58} The prosecutor, in effect, told the jury that Mr. Raider's defense of accident was an impossibility 14 times over. In view of the fact that \"improper suggestions, insinuations, and * * * assertions of personal knowledge\" by the prosecution \"are apt to carry much weight against the accused when they should properly carry none,\"\n   <em>\n    Berger v.

This was not a fact of \"minor relevance,\" rather whether the gun could accidentally discharge was the central issue disputed by the parties in the present case.\n   <em>\n    Contrast\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-279\">\n    2015-Ohio-279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20340936\">\n    2015 WL 340936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 59} Notably, the State called four police officers and a firearms expert from BCI as witnesses-none of whom testified to any such test having been conducted. Surely, if the State had conducted an appropriate test, the results of which it felt were important enough to come before the jury, it could have prepared the requisite expert report and offered a witness to testify to the results, which then could have been subject to cross-examination. Such was not the case here. And it was inappropriate and prejudicial for the prosecutor, using the pretext of a \"question,\" to put information before the jury that was not in evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
