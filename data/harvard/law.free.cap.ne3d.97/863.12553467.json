Plaintiff-Appellee is the state of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On October 15, 2015, Officer Lisa Walls of the Adult Parole Authority, went to 75 Allen Street in Newark to attempt a field contact with Eric Osler, a parolee under her supervision. She was accompanied by Parole Officers Greer and Wells. Walls had information indicating Osler was in possession of a firearm and was dealing drugs. As a person under the supervision of the Adult Parole Authority, Osler is subject to warrantless searches of his person, home, and vehicle pursuant to R.C. 2951.02 and/or R.C. 2967.131. He further was to have no contact with his son, defendant-appellant Martez Eli. Osler signed\n   conditions of supervision outlining his understanding of these conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On arrival at Osler's residence, the officers were admitted by the homeowner, Tisha Aldridge. They found Osler in his bedroom, lying in bed. The officers placed Osler in custody, cleared the living room and had Osler sit on the sofa. Asked where the firearm was, Osler initially denied he had one. He further denied there was anyone in the house besides himself, Aldridge and her 17-year-old son. He later admitted two of his sons, including Eli, were upstairs with one of their girlfriends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Officers had the three come downstairs and sit in the living room. They were not handcuffed, nor were they under arrest. The officers were familiar with Eli and his brother and aware that they are known to possess firearms. Officers therefore wanted to keep the men visible during the search for officer safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Osler finally admitted he possessed a firearm and that it was in the bed where officers had found him. Officers seized the fully loaded weapon. Additional searching of Osler's room yielded methamphetamine, ammunition of different calibers, burner phones and drug paraphernalia. The officers requested assistance from the Central Ohio Drug Enforcement Task Force (CODE), as is their procedure when they find drugs or firearms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Detective Kyle Boerstler of the Licking County Sherriff's Office and assigned to CODE, arrived at the scene. He was assisted by Officer Fumi and Detective Kimble of the Newark Police Department who were also called to the scene. Aldridge gave Boerstler consent to search her home. Before searching Boerstler asked those seated in the living room who lived in the home. Eli stated he lived there \"from time to time.\" Boerstler thus asked is Eli had any belongings in the home, and Eli denied having any possessions in the home. Boerstler asked those in the living room to remain there during the search for officer safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Officer Fumi began the search in an upstairs bedroom where he found a black backpack. Inside the backpack was a baggy containing 254 oxycodone pills, a second baggy containing heroin, and some marijuana. He alerted Boerstler, who took the backpack and its contents downstairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Boerstler asked those gathered in the living room who owned the backpack. Eli stated it belonged to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} A more through search of the backpack produced a Greyhound Bus ticket with Eli listed as the passenger, and dated September 21, 2015, $94.00 in cash, a piece of mail addressed to Eli, a photo of Eli and his girlfriend, small jeweler bags commonly used to package drugs for sale, and a wallet containing Eli's expired driver's license. Eli was not arrested following the search and discovery of the drugs in his backpack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On July 21, 2016, the Licking County Grand Jury returned an indictment charging Eli with one count of aggravated possession of oxycodone in an amount equal to or exceeding five times the bulk amount, but less than fifty times the bulk amount in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)(C)(1)(c), a felony of the second degree, and possession of heroin in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)(C)(6)(a), a felony of the fifth degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On August 26, 2016, Eli filed two motions to suppress. One to suppress his statements for lack of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, and a second to suppress the drugs discovered in the backpack. On October 11, 2016, a hearing was held on the matter. The trial court denied Eli's motions by judgment entry on October 25, 2016. The court found that Eli lacked standing to challenge the search of the backpack because he abandoned the backpack by denying ownership\n   of anything in the home. The court found Eli could not therefore retain a reasonable expectation of privacy in the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The trial court further found that Eli was not in custody and thus\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings were not required. The court explained that while Eli was asked to remain in the living room during the search, he was not handcuffed and there was no evidence presented at the hearing to indicate Eli believed he was under arrest or detained in any manner. Finally, the trial court noted that after the search was concluded, Eli was free to leave and did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The matter proceeded to a jury trial on December 12, 2016. The jury convicted Eli as charged. He was subsequently sentenced to a mandatory four years incarceration for aggravated possession of oxycodone and nine months incarceration for possession of heroin. Eli was ordered to serve the sentences concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Eli filed an appeal and the matter is now before this court for review. Assignments of error are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE WARRANTLESS SEARCH OF THE BACKPACK BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WAS JUSTIFIED BECAUSE APPELLANT HAD VOLUNTARILY ABANDONED IT.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE UNCOUNSELED STATEMENTS OF APPELLANT WERE ADMISSIBLE BECAUSE HE WAS NOT DETAINED.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 17} \"THE JURY'S VERDICTS WERE AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} \"THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT TRIAL WAS INSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE CONVICTIONS.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 19} \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED APPELLANT'S MOTION FOR ACQUITTAL PURSUANT TO CRIM. R. 29.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   I, II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 20} We will address appellant's first and second assignments of error simultaneously as both concern his detention and the search of property belonging to him. In his first assignment of error, Eli contends the trial court incorrectly interpreted the facts when it found he had abandoned the backpack and thus forfeited any reasonable expectation of privacy. In his second assignment of error, Eli argues the trial court erred when it determined he was not in custody for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 21} As recently stated by the Supreme Court of Ohio in\n   <em>\n    State v.
