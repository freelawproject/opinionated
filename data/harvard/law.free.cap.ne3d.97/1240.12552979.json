This Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This case involves the discovery of a methamphetamine lab and Ms. Kittle's involvement with same. Officer Lemonier from the Akron Police Department testified that he and another officer conducted surveillance on an apartment where they believed illegal activity was occurring. The officers observed Ms. Kittle and another woman, J.S., leave the apartment and get into Ms. Kittle's car, with J.S. taking the driver's seat. Shortly thereafter, the officers performed a traffic stop on the vehicle. During the stop, the officers discovered that J.S. did not have a driver's license and that she had an outstanding felony warrant. As a result, they placed her under arrest and searched her, finding three bags of methamphetamine in her purse. The officers did not arrest or search Ms. Kittle, but did request that she empty her pockets, which revealed no illegal substances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The officers then returned to the apartment and knocked on the door. After about twenty minutes of waiting outside, one of the occupants allowed the officers inside. Upon entering, Officer Lemonier immediately smelled the distinct odor associated with the production of methamphetamine. The occupant then consented to a search of the apartment, which revealed a number of items associated with the production of methamphetamine, as well as several small bags containing the finished product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Through his investigation of the matter, including an interview with J.S., Officer Lemonier discovered information that implicated Ms. Kittle. Another officer located Ms. Kittle and brought her to the Akron Police Department for questioning. Officer Lemonier conducted the interview, wherein Ms. Kittle admitted to buying pseudoephedrine for J.S. in exchange for methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} A Grand Jury indicted Ms. Kittle on the following three counts: (1) illegal assembly or possession of chemicals for the manufacture of drugs in violation of Revised Code Section 2925.041(A) ; (2) illegal manufacture of drugs in violation of Section 2925.04(A); and (3) aggravated possession of drugs in violation of 2925.11(A),(C)(1). The State dismissed the latter two counts prior to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The case proceeded to a bench trial. The State presented testimony from one witness: Officer Lemonier. The State also played portions of Officer Lemonier's interview with Ms. Kittle, and introduced records from The National Precursor Log Exchange (\"NPLEX\"), which is a system that electronically tracks purchases of pseudoephedrine. Ms. Kittle did not present any evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The trial court found Ms. Kittle guilty, and subsequently sentenced her to five years of imprisonment. She now appeals, raising three assignments of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT ADMITTED THE NPLEX RECORDS INTO EVIDENCE AND ALLOWED A POLICE OFFICER WHO WAS NOT A QUALIFIED WITNESS TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR INTRODUCING THE NPLEX RECORDS INTO EVIDENCE, IN VIOLATION OF MS. KITTLE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE I, SECTION 10, OF THE OHIO CONSTITUTION AND THE CONFRONTATION CLAUSE OF THE SIXTH AMENDMENT OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In her first assignment of error, Ms. Kittle argues that the trial court erred by allowing Officer Lemonier to lay the foundation for the NPLEX records because he was not the custodian of those records, nor was he otherwise qualified to do so. Ms. Kittle asserts that a de novo standard of review applies because the trial court's error in this regard implicated her rights under the Confrontation Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} We will begin by addressing the standard of review. While Ms. Kittle's assignment of error suggests that she believes NPLEX records are testimonial in nature, thus implicating the Confrontation Clause, she does not develop an argument in that regard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 16(A)(7). Rather, she cites Ohio Supreme Court precedent for the proposition that business records are nontestimonial, and states: \"[a]ssuming that the NPLEX records of the pharmacy admitted into evidence in [this] case were truly nontestimonial in nature, the foundation for their proper authentication as 'business records' under the meaning of Evid.R. 803(6) could not have been established by [Officer Lemonier].\" Ms. Kittle does, however, develop such an argument in her reply brief, arguing that NPLEX records are testimonial because the primary purpose of that system is to \"assist in the interdiction of methamphetamine creation and use[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} As an initial matter, we note that \"[a]ppellate courts generally will not consider a new issue presented for the first time in a reply brief.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Notwithstanding, we are unpersuaded by Ms. Kittle's argument that NPLEX records are testimonial in nature, thus implicating the Confrontation Clause. This is because \"[t]estimonial statements are those created or\n   given with the primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

He testified that he applied for-and was granted-a license to access the system, which requires a username and password. He indicated that he accesses the NPLEX system every day, and that he\n   receives real-time alerts for pseudoephedrine purchases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Regarding the process for electronically tracking purchases, Officer Lemonier explained that a person attempting to buy pseudoephedrine must provide an ID, which is then swiped. As soon as the ID is swiped, the information contained thereon is immediately transmitted to the NPLEX database. Within a few minutes, more specific information is transmitted, including the brand name, pill count, grams of pseudoephedrine contained in the package, and whether the purchase was accepted or denied. He stated that a purchase will be denied if the individual attempts to purchase more than nine grams of pseudoephedrine during a 30-day period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Officer Lemonier testified that he personally obtained the NPLEX record for Ms. Kittle, which was introduced as an exhibit, and that the record is kept in the ordinary course of business. To obtain the record, he entered Ms. Kittle's name, date of birth, and driver's license number into the NPLEX system, which then generated a list of pseudoephedrine purchases associated with that information. Officer Lemonier then testified as to the purchases of pseudoephedrine reflected in the NPLEX record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 16} While not every police officer may have familiarity with the NPLEX system or the ability to explain how those records came into existence in the ordinary course of business, the record reflects that Officer Lemonier did, in fact, have this knowledge. He, therefore, was a \"qualified witness\" for purposes of Evidence Rule 803(6). Thus, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted the NPLEX records into evidence. Accordingly, Ms. Kittle's first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT ABDICATED ITS DUTIES AS A NEUTRAL AND IMPARTIAL FINDER OF FACT BY DIRECTING THE PROSECUTION TO SUPPLEMENT ITS EVIDENCE AGAINST MS. KITTLE MID-TRIAL, IN VIOLATION OF HER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO A FAIR TRIAL AND DUE PROCESS UNDER ARTICLE 1, SECTION 10 OF THE OHIO CONSTITUTION AND THE FIFTH, SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE U.S. CONSTITUTION.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In her second assignment of error, Ms. Kittle argues that the trial court abdicated its duties as a neutral and impartial finder of fact by directing the State to supplement its evidence against her at trial. Similar to her first assignment of error, she contends that a de novo standard of review applies, arguing that the trial court's actions deprived her of a fair trial. We disagree that a de novo standard of review applies, and otherwise find no merit in her argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Evidence Rule 614(B) provides that \"[t]he court may interrogate witnesses, in an impartial manner, whether called by itself or by a party.\" As this Court has stated, \" '[t]he evident purpose of Evid.

The trial court's journal entry indicates that it found Ms. Kittle guilty based upon the December 2, 2014, date only.
