This Court reverses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Mr. Meinke and D.G. had a romantic relationship beginning in 2008. They lived together and have a daughter. According to D.G., around the time of her pregnancy, Mr. Meinke developed a substance abuse problem and began acting violently. Although she ended their relationship, Mr. Meinke would not accept that it was over. He began following her, calling her, and texting her incessantly. D.G. testified that Mr. Meinke took things from her house when she was at work and sent her a text image from inside her house of a shotgun along with a message that he was going to kill himself. He also banged on her windows in the middle of the night. Fearing for her safety, D.G. began staying at her parents' house. She also obtained an ex parte civil protection order against Mr. Meinke pursuant to Revised Code section 3113.31. Among other prohibitions, the protection order prohibited Mr. Meinke from initiating contact with D.G. including \"landline, cordless, cellular or digital telephone; text; instant messaging; fax; e-mail; voice mail; delivery service; social networking media; blogging; writings; electronic communications, or communications by any other means directly or through another person.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} According to D.G., Mr. Meinke was served with the protection order 15 days after she obtained it, while she was on vacation in Florida. D.G. testified that she nevertheless received numerous texts from Mr. Meinke both in Florida and after she returned to Ohio. D.G. took screen shots of some of the messages to the Elyria Police Department. Officers Jacob Webber and Christine Fortune were on duty and met with D.G. As a result of that meeting, Mr. Meinke was charged with domestic violence and violating a protection order in case number 2014CRB01323.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Still Mr. Meinke persisted in sending texts to D.G. In response to one incident, Elyria Police Officer Eric Halvorsen met with D.G. She showed Officer Halvorsen screen shots of Mr. Meinke's texts and informed the officer that she had a protection order against Mr. Meinke. Officer Halvorsen testified that he verified with dispatch that Mr. Meinke had been served with the order and subsequently charged Mr. Meinke with violating a protection order in case number 2014CRB01378.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Mr. Meinke pleaded not guilty in both cases, and they proceeded to a jury trial. Following the close of the State's evidence, Mr. Meinke moved for acquittal on the two counts of violating a protection order. He argued that the State failed to prove that he was served with the protection order. The municipal court denied Mr. Meinke's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Mr. Meinke requested \"an instruction pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State v\n   </em>\n   [.]\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   [,] 136 Ohio St[.]3d 1[,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-1698\">\n    2013-Ohio-1698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=989%20N.E.2d%20972\">\n    989 N.E.2d 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,] that an additional element to a violation of a protection order type of offense is that there be proof beyond a reasonable doubt of service of the order.\" The municipal court denied the request because Mr. Meinke had not submitted a proposed instruction in writing pursuant to\n   Crim.R. 30(A). After deliberating, the jury found Mr. Meinke guilty of both counts of violating a protection order and guilty of domestic violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In case number 2014CRB01323, the municipal court sentenced Mr. Meinke to 180 days in jail for violating a protection order and 30 days in jail for domestic violence. In case number 2014CRB01378, the court sentenced Mr. Meinke to 180 days in jail for violating a protection order. The municipal court ordered the sentences to be served consecutively with credit for time served. Mr. Meinke has appealed, raising three assignments of error.

Because the State cannot retry a defendant following a reversal on the sufficiency of the evidence, \"the interest in the administration of justice dictates that the appellate court review the issue of sufficiency in consideration of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   evidence presented by the [S]tate in its case in chief, whether such evidence was\n   properly admitted or not.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, we consider all the testimony regardless of any alleged error in its admission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Three of the State's witnesses testified that Mr. Meinke was served before the violations, which allegedly occurred between May 4 and May 9, 2014. D.G. testified that, although she had been receiving texts for some time, Mr. Meinke \"wasn't served with [the protection order] until April 18th [2014].\" Officer Webber testified that, when D.G. was at the police station on May 5, 2014, \"[his] partner, [Officer] Fortune, at the time ended up contacting dispatch and confirming that the [protection order] was served[.]\" When asked whether Officer Fortune had relayed to him that the protection order had been served, Officer Webber responded affirmatively. Finally, Officer Halvorsen testified that he called dispatch regarding the protection order and determined \"04-18-14 is when it was served.\" He further explained that dispatch \"verified there was a paper copy on station in a three-ring binder they keep them in with the defendant's signature on it that he accepted it.\" Viewing this testimony in a light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational juror could find that Mr. Meinke was served with the protection order prior to his charged violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Mr. Meinke also argues that the State must prove that service was made in accordance with the Civil Rules and \"[a] certified copy of the return would be irrefutable evidence of proper service and of this element.\" The State responds that this argument goes beyond the holding in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   which requires evidence that the defendant was served, not how he was served. We need not decide this issue because the evidence in this case was sufficient to establish that Mr. Meinke was served in compliance with the Civil Rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The State is not required to present \"irrefutable evidence\" to overcome a sufficiency challenge. Rather, \"the relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Jenks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1708870\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/61/259/\">\n    61 Ohio St.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=574%20N.E.2d%20492\">\n    574 N.E.2d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at paragraph two of the syllabus. Moreover, while documentary evidence may be one way to prove service, testimony may also be used.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist. Wood Nos.

In relevant part, the rule provides: \"Initial service, and service of any ex parte protection order that is entered, shall be made in accordance with the provisions for personal service of process within this state under Civ.R. 4.1(B) * * *.\" Civ.R. 65.1(C)(2). Officer Halvorsen testified that \"the defendant's signature\" was on the protection order, indicating that \"he accepted it.\" From this testimony, a rational juror could find that Mr. Meinke was served personally. Thus, the State presented sufficient evidence that Mr. Meinke was served in compliance with Civ.R. 65.1(C). Mr. Meinke's second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT FAILED TO INSTRUCT THE JURY ON ALL THE ELEMENTS OF VIOLATING A PROTECTION ORDER R.C. 2919.27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In his first assignment of error, Mr. Meinke argues that his convictions\n   should be reversed because the municipal court failed to instruct the jury that service of the protection order was an element of the offense of violating a protection order. \"As a general rule, a defendant is entitled to have the jury instructed on all elements that must be proved to establish the crime with which he is charged.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Following\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , service of a protection order, \"antecedent to the alleged violation, is an essential element that the [S]tate must prove\" to establish a violation of R.C. 2919.27.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13, citing\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4123060\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/136/1/\">\n    136 Ohio St.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-1698\">\n    2013-Ohio-1698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=989%20N.E.2d%20972\">\n    989 N.E.2d 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at syllabus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In the present matter, the municipal court did not provide an instruction regarding service of the protection order. The State argues that any error was harmless, however, because the evidence regarding service was substantial and undisputed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crim.R. 52(A) (\"Any error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Mr. Meinke argues that this situation is not subject to a harmless error analysis because the omitted instruction was for an element of the offense.

The third witness who testified regarding service, Officer Halvorsen, was not cross-examined on that issue. This case is unlike\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , wherein the unrefuted evidence was that the defendant was not served the protection order until after his alleged violation.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In the present case, the jury was presented with three witnesses who testified consistently that they took efforts to confirm, and in fact did confirm, that Mr. Meinke had been served prior to the dates when he violated the protection order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The majority also discounts the witnesses' testimony regarding service as hearsay and notes that the State did not avail itself of other methods to prove service. While Mr. Meinke argued on appeal, in his sufficiency challenge, that the testimony was hearsay, he did not object to this particular testimony below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the witnesses' testimony regarding service of the protection order was before the jury as it deliberated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The fact that the State had other methods to prove service is immaterial. The issue is not did the State present the best evidence of service, but whether the failure to instruct on the service element contributed to the verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Neder v.

Based on the substantial and uncontradicted evidence presented in this case, I would find it \"clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found [Mr. Meinke] guilty absent the [failure to instruct on service.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248184\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/1/#p8\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248184\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/1/#p8\">\n    at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248184\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/1/#p8\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, I would find this error was harmless and overrule the first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Finally, I would find that Mr. Meinke forfeited his allied offenses argument because he did not raise it in the trial court nor has he argued plain error on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
