On May 28, 1927, Albert West conveyed the surface interests of the Property to W. B. Bay. West reserved the mineral interests underlying the Property through an express reservation. Bay transferred the surface rights to Bert Robinson on November 17, 1927. Bay also reserved the mineral interest through an express reservation. On May 16, 1932, the First Trust Savings and Loan of the City of Zanesville obtained the Property via a Sheriff's Deed from Thomas E. Gracy, Sheriff of Guernsey County. On June 29, 1934, the First Trust Savings and Loan conveyed the Property to Henry A. Buerhaus. Buerhaus subsequently conveyed the surface interests of the Property to B.H. Boniphant, but reserved the mineral interests underlying the Property through an express reservation. The surface interests were conveyed a number of times over the years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Charles E. Hutchens and Martha Hutchens obtained 44 acres of real property, which included the Property, via quit claim deed from Caldwell Savings and Loan Company on December 23, 1983.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The 1983 Deed contained the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   * * * excepting and reserving from the above described premises the coal as excepted in the [sic] deed given by Albert J. West to W.B. Bay, said deed being dated May 16, 1927 * * *. Also, excepting and reserving all the oil and gas in and under the aforesaid described premises, together with the right to enter thereon at all times for the purpose\n   of drilling and operating for oil and gas, and the right to erect derricks, tanks, buildings and structures thereon, and to lay all necessary pipe lines thereon for the production and transportation of said oil and gas. Being the same premises conveyed to John W. Hannum by Warranty Deed recorded March 29, 1937 * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Charles Hutchens passed away on September 10, 1990. Martha Hutchens recorded an Affidavit of Survivorship on September 18, 1990. On April 27, 1991, Martha Hutchens sold 14 of the 44 acres to Carmel G. Graham and Phyllis A. Graham. The deed did not include an exception or reservation of the oil and gas rights underlying these 14 acres.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On January 29, 1998, Martha Hutchens sold the Property to Carmel and Phyllis Graham.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The 1998 Deed contained the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Also excepting and reserving all the oil and gas in and under the aforesaid described premises, together with the right to enter thereon at all times for the purpose of drilling and operating for oil and gas, and the right to erect derricks, tanks, buildings and structures thereon, and to lay all necessary pipe lines thereon for the production and transportation of said oil and gas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Carmel and Phyllis Graham transferred the Property to Appellees on January 8, 2008. The 2008 Deed did not include a property description. Instead, a copy of the first page of the 1998 Deed is attached to the document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On January 5, 2012, Appellees published a Notice of Abandonment in the\n   <em>\n    Daily Jeffersonian\n   </em>\n   newspaper, pursuant to the 2006 version of the Ohio Dormant Mineral Act (\"2006 ODMA\"). The Notice was directed to Henry A. Buerhaus, Albert J. West, Anna M. West, and W.B. Bay, and their unknown heirs and assigns. There is no evidence Appellants were ever provided the requisite notice. On March 1, 2012, Appellees executed and recorded an Affidavit of Abandonment pursuant to R.C. 5301.56(E)(2). In order to complete the abandonment process under the 2006 ODMA, Appellees filed and recorded an Affidavit and Request to Memorialize the Record on April 11, 2012. Appellees executed an oil and gas lease with Eclipse Resources I, LP, on September 20, 2012. The lease was recorded on October 5, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellants executed an Affidavit to Transfer Interest in Real Estate on October 22, 2014. The Affidavit was recorded on November 5, 2014. The purpose of the Affidavit was to transfer the mineral rights underlying the Property to Appellants from Martha Hutchens. On March 9, 2015, Appellants executed an Amended Certificate of Transfer from the Estate of Martha L. Hutchens also with the purpose of transferring the mineral interests underlying the Property. The Amended Certificate of Transfer was recorded on March 17, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On May 18, 2015, Appellant\n   George Hutchens and Jack Hutchens\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed suit against Appellees, Stephen Wilson, Henry A. Buerhaus and anyone who might claim the mineral rights through him, and Albert J. West and anyone who might claim the mineral rights through him (\"Berhaus and West\"). The Complaint sought declaratory judgment pursuant to the 1989 Ohio Dormant Mineral Act (\"1989 ODMA\") and to quiet title to the mineral interest underlying the Property. Appellant George Hutchens and Jack Hutchens alleged the reserved mineral interests reverted to Martha Hutchens, who owned the surface rights on March 22, 1992, the date on which the 1989 ODMA became effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellees filed an Answer and Counterclaim on July 17, 2015. In their Counterclaim, Appellees sought declaratory judgment and asserted claims of slander of title and tortious interference with business relationships. Because the other defendants failed to answer or otherwise respond to the Complaint, Appellant George Hutchens and Jack Hutchens filed motions for default judgment against Buerhaus and West on October 5, 2015, and Wilson on October 15, 2015, and requested the trial court quiet title to the mineral interests in their names. Appellees filed a motion in opposition to the proposed default judgment order, arguing the title should be quieted in their names as they had successfully utilized the 2006 ODMA to obtain the mineral interests prior to the filing of the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The parties subsequently submitted an Agreed Order quieting title against Buerhaus and West. On November 4, 2015, the trial court signed the parties' Agreed Order and, in addition, entered an Order quieting title against Wilson. The Orders did not specify in whom title was quieted. Each order included the language, \"THIS IS A FINAL, APPEALABLE ORDER, THERE BEING NO JUST REASON FOR DELAY.\" Neither party nor the defaulting defendants appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On April 19, 2016, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court stayed the matter pending the Ohio Supreme Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

Appellees renewed their motion for summary judgment and moved the trial court to lift the stay. Via Entry filed November 14, 2016, the trial court lifted the stay, returned the case to the active docket, and ordered the parties to complete additional briefing by December 22, 2016. The parties filed their responses and reply briefs in support of their respective positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Via Entry filed January 23, 2017, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees. The trial court dismissed Appellants' Complaint and quieted title to the oil and gas mineral estate in favor of Appellees. The trial court ordered Appellees to submit a proposed judgment entry. The trial court signed the proposed judgment entry on February 6, 2017. The trial court issued a\n   <em>\n    Nunc Pro Tunc\n   </em>\n   Order on February 26, 2017, to include a legal description of the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} It is from these entries Appellants appeal, raising the following as error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   I.

These procedures govern the manner by which mineral rights are deemed abandoned and vested in the surface holder and apply equally to claims that the mineral interests were abandoned prior to June 30, 2006.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Charles and Martha Hutchens acquired the original 44 acres in 1983. The 1983 Deed only conveyed the surface rights to them, and specifically reserved the mineral rights subject to the prior reservations. Following Charles Hutchens' death, Martha Hutchens sold 14 of the 44 acres to Carmel and Phyllis Graham in 1991. The deed did not include an exception or reservation of the mineral rights underlying these 14 acres. In 1998, Martha Hutchens sold the Property to Carmel and Phyllis Graham. The 1998 Deed included an express reservation of the mineral rights. However, Martha Hutchens did not have any rights to the mineral interests underlying the Property at that time, therefore, she could not reserve those interests to herself despite the language in the 1998 Deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Appellants contend the mineral rights were abandoned and reunited with\n   the surface pursuant to the 1989 ODMA; and, as such, they are entitled to have the title to the Property quieted in their names. Although we find Appellants' argument reasonable given the state of the law as it related to the 1989 ODMA prior to the\n   <em>\n    Corban\n   </em>\n   decision, their position is, nonetheless, erroneous. As discussed, supra, the 1989 ODMA was not self-executing pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Corban\n   </em>\n   . In order to have the oil, gas and other mineral rights deemed abandoned and reunited with the surface, Appellants were required to follow the procedures set forth in the 2006 ODMA. Appellants did not follow those procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 31} On the other hand, Appellees acquired the Property subject to prior reservations, and followed the procedures set forth in the 2006 ODMA. Appellants contend Appellees failed to serve them with the requisite notice pursuant to R.C. 5301.56. Because Appellants were not holders of the mineral interests, Appellees were not required to serve notice on them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Based upon the foregoing, we find the trial court did not err in finding Appellees complied with R.C. 5301.56(E), and did not err in ordering title to the Property be quieted in Appellees' names.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Appellants' first and second assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 34} The judgment of the Guernsey County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Delaney, P.J. and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Wise, Earle, J., concur\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The trial court filed its original Judgment Entry on February 6, 2017. The trial court issued the Nunc Pro Tunc Entry to include a legal description of the oil and gas mineral estate.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Sarah Hutchens was substituted as a party plaintiff in place of Jack Hutchens during the course of the proceedings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
