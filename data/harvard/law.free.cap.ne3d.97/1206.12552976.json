We affirm in part, and reverse and remand in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In November 2011, the thirteen-year-old daughter of Frances Slyman (\"M.S.\") answered an ad for farm help that she had seen posted on a bulletin board at the Valley Tack Shop. The ad had been placed by Dr. Toth, who subsequently hired the girl after interviewing her in person. The job entailed working at Dr. Toth's two horse barns: cleaning the horses' stalls, feeding the horses, and letting the horses out. Ms. Slyman drove her daughter to Dr. Toth's barns each day that M.S. worked and would wait there for her to finish. Dr. Toth was present as well, and would converse with Ms. Slyman and her daughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} A friendly relationship developed between Dr. Toth and M.S., with e-mails being exchanged between the two on a regular basis. M.S. also became very fond of one of Dr. Toth's horses: a Lipizzan stallion named Siglavy Kerka, but known more commonly as \"Laci.\" The Lipizzan is a unique and rare breed of horse, to which Dr. Toth had devoted much of her nonprofessional time, including sitting as the Chair of the Board of the Lipizzan Association of North America (\"LANA\"). Dr. Toth began sharing her knowledge of the breed with M.S., e-mailing her pictures and videos of the breed, and giving her books about its history. Dr. Toth also assisted M.S. in writing an article for the LANA magazine, Haute Ecole, about her experiences with Laci. The article, entitled \"Getting to Know You,\" was published in the magazine on the same page as an editorial box stating: \"The above article was written by LANA's newest and youngest member about the thrill of having her first Lipizzan stallion.\" That December, Dr. Toth gave M.S. a Christmas present consisting of a framed copy of Laci's pedigree, with the ownership box stating: \"Owned By: Delphi Toth &amp; [M.S.].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In March 2012, Laci was taken to be gelded by Ms. Slyman, who then returned the horse to Dr. Toth. Dr. Toth paid for the procedure. That spring, it was agreed that Ms. Slyman and M.S. would take Laci to a training facility in Marietta, Ohio. While in Marietta, Laci developed colic, and was taken to a veterinary hospital for treatment. After his release from\n   the hospital, Ms. Slyman paid for the treatment and returned the horse to her own barn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In June 2012, the relationship between Dr. Toth and Ms. Slyman became significantly strained after an apparent misunderstanding regarding Ms. Slyman's request to use some of Dr. Toth's hay. Soon thereafter, Ms. Slyman sent Dr. Toth an e-mail stating that she didn't know how much longer her daughter would be able to work for Dr. Toth, and that she would attempt to find a replacement. On June 8, 2012, M.S. sent Dr. Toth an e-mail expressing a desire to continue their friendship and thanking her for the experience of learning about the Lipizzan breed. Specifically, she wrote: \"[W]hat I really want to thank you for is the experience of having my own[.] [T]here are no words to explain my thank you[.] [L]aci is a wonderful horse[.] [H]e has a lot of background on him[.] [H]e is going to make a fantastic partner[.] * * * I hope you will continue to help me with [L]aci and teach me more about classical dressage[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On June 10, 2012, Dr. Toth received an e-mail from M.S.'s account stating: \"Good Evening Delphi, [n]ow that Laci is officially mine and [l]iving in our barn, [c]ould I please have the original set of his papers, with my name transfer[r]ed on them as the real owner? As well as his passport, [s]o we can add them to our horses['] files[?] Thank You, [M.S.].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In July 2012, Ms. Slyman sent Dr. Toth a text suggesting that it would be a nice gesture if Dr. Toth surprised M.S. with Laci's papers for her upcoming birthday. On July 11, 2012, Dr. Toth sent an e-mail to Ms. Slyman in response, stating in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Last Christmas, I offered to add [M.S.]'s name to Laci's papers. I told you and her that I was doing this primarily so that if I died soon, this young horse could be transferred, after my death, from my name to hers, without difficulty. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   At no time did I say I was removing my name from his papers as the primary owner. I only offered to add her name. I have never indicated otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   This arrangement should not have been a problem. You yourself described this as a free lease of the horse, with you not paying a monthly fee to me to lease the horse from me, and me not paying any of his on-going expenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Since I have not yet died, if you do not want my name on his papers, then the only option is for me to simply sell Laci to you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In response to this communication, Ms. Slyman called Dr. Toth and left a voicemail message indicating that they had never discussed a lease, that Dr. Toth had given her daughter the horse, and that she wanted Dr. Toth to sign Laci's papers over to her so that her daughter could register Laci. She also sent Dr. Toth an e-mail, again stating that the horse had been given to her daughter, asking for Laci's papers, and accusing Dr. Toth of being manipulative. In the following weeks, more e-mails were exchanged, and Dr. Toth wrote a letter asking for the return of Laci, which Ms. Slyman denies having ever received. We note that during the course of events, conversations are alleged to have taken place that are disputed by the other side.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In December 2012, Ms. Slyman, as the next best friend of her minor daughter, filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, seeking to be declared Laci's sole and lawful owner. Dr. Toth filed her answer and a counterclaim for conversion of property. Over the course of the litigation, Ms. Slyman added claims for promissory estoppel and unjust enrichment, and Dr. Toth added claims for declaratory judgment, fraud, unjust enrichment, bailment, breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of process, and\n   loss of consortium. In November 2014, the trial court held a bench trial on the bifurcated declaratory judgment claims and found that Dr. Toth had not given Laci to the Slymans and that Dr. Toth retained sole legal ownership of the horse. Ms. Slyman, upon order of the court, returned Laci to Dr. Toth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In October 2015, a jury trial commenced on the remaining claims. The trial court entered a directed verdict in favor of Dr. Toth on Ms. Slyman's claim for promissory estoppel. Directed verdicts were entered in favor of Ms. Slyman on Dr. Toth's claims for fraud, unjust enrichment, bailment, breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of process, and loss of consortium. At the conclusion of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Ms. Slyman on her remaining claim for unjust enrichment and awarded her zero dollars. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Dr. Toth on her remaining claim for conversion and again awarded zero dollars. The trial court entered final judgment on October 26, 2015. Dr. Toth now appeals, raising five assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR ONE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT MISAPPLIED THE LAW WHEN IT HELD THAT DELPHI TOTH COULD NOT RECOVER ATTORNEY FEES AND EXPENSES INCURRED TO RECOVER CONVERTED PROPERTY AS A COMPONENT OF COMPENSATORY DAMAGES REGARDLESS OF THE AVAILABILITY OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AND AS A RESULT, DEPRIVED DR. TOTH OF HER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY ON THE FULL MEASURE OF HER DAMAGES FOR THE WRONGFUL CONVERSION OF LACI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In her first assignment of error, Dr. Toth argues the trial court erred in ruling that she could not present evidence of attorney fees incurred to secure Laci's return prior to a potential punitive damages stage of the trial. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 11} This Court reviews questions of law under a de novo standard.\n   <em>\n    State v. Trifari,\n   </em>\n   9th Dist.

Thus, even if this Court were to consider adopting the analysis set forth in\n   <em>\n    Fulks\n   </em>\n   , it does not appear the analysis would apply, as the attorney fees incurred by Dr. Toth have been in the prosecution, as well as the defense of, the present action. We are also not inclined to depart from the American Rule, which provides that a prevailing party in a civil action may not recover attorney fees as a part of the costs of litigation, with exceptions to the rule provided for by statute, contractual language, and punitive damages claims.\n   <em>\n    Schiavoni v.

She promised, promised.\" The evidence of a resulting injury was that the horse was not returned to Dr. Toth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 19} With regard to whether the representation was made falsely with the intent of misleading Dr. Toth into relying upon it, Dr. Toth argues that there is substantial circumstantial evidence to satisfy these elements. Under Dr. Toth's theory of the case, the cumulative evidence suggests a narrative whereby Ms. Slyman manipulated the situation in order to take possession of the horse without any intent to return it to Dr. Toth. \"[A] claim of fraud cannot be predicated upon promises or representations relating to future actions or conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

Under Ms. Slyman's own theory of the case, there is evidence that supports the idea that at the time of her taking possession of Laci to take him for training in Marietta, Ms. Slyman had a subjective belief that Dr. Toth had gifted the horse to M.S. As to her understanding of why Laci was gelded in early March of 2012, she testified: \"The horse is being gelded so that we can have the horse.\" She also testified that she had told Dr. Toth that in order for her daughter to have the horse, Laci would have to be gelded and trained. In addition, the initial complaint filed by Ms. Slyman stated that she took \"exclusive possession\" of Laci on March 26, 2012, despite the fact that Ms. Slyman later testified that assertion was inaccurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 21} We are mindful of the fact that to survive directed verdict, Dr. Toth did not have to prove her claims by a preponderance of the evidence. Rather, the court must construe the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, and grant the motion only upon finding that as to any determinative issue, reasonable minds could only come to a conclusion adverse to the nonmoving\n   party. There was evidence regarding Ms. Slyman's conduct that supported an inference of lack of intent to return the horse at the time the promise was made. Likewise, this lack of intent may be inferred from evidence that Ms. Slyman did not make a pretense of carrying out the promise to return the horse and evaded or refused to return it.

Civ.R. 51(A) provides: \"On appeal, a party may not assign as error the giving or the failure to give any instruction unless the party objects before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating specifically the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\" Although Dr. Toth proposed a lengthy addition to the trial court's jury instruction on Ms. Slyman's claim for unjust enrichment, an instruction on bailment and the impact of a bailment relationship were not a part of the requested instructions. In the absence of such a request, there was, consequently, no such refusal by the trial court. Because there was no basis for an objection, and because no such objection was made, this argument lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Dr. Toth did, however, request an instruction on bailment during the discussion with the trial court regarding jury instructions for Dr. Toth's claims. Because the trial court granted Ms. Slyman a directed verdict on Dr. Toth's bailment claim, a bailment instruction was not required. If, however, assuming arguendo that the request had been made at the proper time, Dr. Toth has failed to provide any case law to support the notion that an\n   instruction on bailment would have been a proper addition to the trial court's instruction on Ms. Slyman's claim for unjust enrichment. Furthermore, although the proposed jury instructions she filed with the trial court contained bailment language as to her claims for bailment and for declaratory judgment, Dr. Toth failed to provide any language for the trial court to consider with regard to the claim for unjust enrichment. We therefore conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to instruct the jury on the issue of bailment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Dr. Toth next argues the trial court erred by instructing the jury that any damages for Dr. Toth's claim for conversion were subject to setoff and capped at the market value of the horse. Dr. Toth did not object to any such instruction at trial, and therefore did not preserve this issue for our review as required by Civ.R. 51(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Dr. Toth also argues the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on malice. On October 29, 2014, the trial court granted Ms. Slyman's motion to bifurcate trial as to Dr. Toth's claim for punitive damages. R.C. 2315.21(B)(1) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   In a tort action that is tried to a jury and in which a plaintiff makes a claim for compensatory damages and a claim for punitive or exemplary damages, upon the motion of any party, the trial of the tort action shall be bifurcated as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (a) The initial stage of the trial shall relate only to the presentation of evidence, and a determination by the jury, with respect to whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages for the injury or loss to person or property from the defendant. During this stage, no party to the tort action shall present, and the court shall not permit a party to present, evidence that relates solely to the issue of whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover punitive or exemplary damages for the injury or loss to person or property from the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   (b) If the jury determines in the initial stage of the trial that the plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages for the injury or loss to person or property from the defendant, evidence may be presented in the second stage of the trial, and a determination by that jury shall be made, with respect to whether the plaintiff additionally is entitled to recover punitive or exemplary damages for the injury or loss to person or property from the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   R.C. 2315.21(C) goes on to provide that punitive damages are not recoverable from a defendant in a tort action unless both \"[t]he actions or omissions of that defendant demonstrate malice or aggravated or egregious fraud\" and \"[t]he trier of fact has returned a verdict or has made a determination * * * of the total compensatory damages recoverable by the plaintiff from that defendant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 40} In the present case, malice was not an element of Dr. Toth's claim for conversion; rather, it was an element to be proven in order to determine whether Dr. Toth was entitled to recover punitive damages. As such, an instruction on malice was not appropriate during the initial stage of the jury trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2315.21(B)(1)(a).

While she maintains that a finding by the trial court that Ms. Slyman wrongfully retained Laci should result in a directed verdict because of issue preclusion, she does not provide this Court with her theory of which issue relevant to a claim of unjust enrichment should be precluded. We therefore cannot determine whether a claim of unjust enrichment should be precluded, either for the entire duration or for some portion of time that Ms. Slyman was in possession of Laci.

After a preliminary bench trial on the parties' claims for declaratory relief, the trial court found that Ms. Slyman and M.S. wrongfully retained possession of Laci. The trial court afforded Dr. Toth the opportunity to elect her remedy and ordered that the horse be returned to Dr. Toth in lieu of her seeking damages for permanent conversion of the horse. The trial court set the remaining claims for a jury trial, bifurcating claims for punitive damages and attorney fees. Dr. Toth filed a motion seeking to submit evidence of attorney fees she incurred procuring the return of the horse, which she argued were recoverable as compensatory damages in\n   the conversion claim.

This recovery of the horse was separate and distinct from her pursuit of compensatory or punitive damages on the conversion claim. By excluding evidence of attorney fees incurred to recover the horse, the trial court improperly restricted Dr. Toth's claim for damages arising out of the wrongful conversion. I would hold that it was error for the trial court to prevent Dr. Toth from presenting evidence of attorney fees incurred to secure Laci's return in the compensatory damage phase of the bifurcated jury trial. I, therefore, concur as to the second, third, fourth, and fifth assignments of error and respectfully dissent as to the first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
