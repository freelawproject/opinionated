For the reasons set forth below, this Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In February 2005, the Likelys executed a promissory note that was secured by a mortgage on the real property located at 452 North Arlington Street, in Akron, Ohio. In less than a year, the Likelys defaulted on the promissory note. In January 2006, the Bank filed a complaint against the Likelys for breach of promissory note, foreclosure, and reformation of the mortgage deed. A final decree of foreclosure was granted on January 11, 2007. Between 2007 and 2014, the real property was scheduled for sheriff's sale nine times. Each of those sales was withdrawn due to either bankruptcy filings by the Likelys or negotiations between the Bank and the Likelys. On March 12, 2014, the Likelys filed a motion to vacate the decree of foreclosure arguing it was defective based upon\n   <em>\n    Fed. Home Loan Mtge. Corp. v.

The trial court granted the Likelys' motion to vacate and dismissed the case on March 27, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On May 1, 2014, the Bank re-filed its complaint against the Likelys for breach of promissory note, foreclosure, and reformation of the mortgage deed. After an unsuccessful foreclosure mediation, the Likelys moved to dismiss the complaint alleging the Bank did not have standing and the complaint was barred by res judicata and the statute of limitations. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On February 4, 2016, a bench trial was held before the magistrate, who subsequently issued a decision in favor of the Bank on all three claims. The Likelys timely filed objections to the magistrate's decision, which the Bank opposed. The Likelys filed the trial transcript beyond the time provided by Civ.R. 53 and without leave of court. Without consideration of the untimely filed trial transcript, the trial\n   court denied the Likelys' objections and adopted the magistrate's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The Likelys appealed the denial of their objections. That appeal was dismissed for lack of a final, appealable order due to the lack of a final decree of foreclosure.\n   <em>\n    Bayview Loan Servicing, L.L.C. v. Likely\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist.

Upon the Likelys' motion, the trial court stayed the sheriff's sale pending the current appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The Likelys have timely appealed, raising three assignments of error for this Court's review.

Thus, when a party objects but does not provide the trial court with the transcripts necessary to review the objections, there are serious consequences for appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Motion for extension of time to file transcript\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The magistrate's decision was issued on February 25, 2016. The Likelys timely filed their objections on March 10, 2016, but did not file the trial transcript or the praecipe for the transcript. The Bank filed a brief in opposition to the objections. Pursuant to Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)(iii), the transcript was due on April 11, 2016. The Likelys, however, did not file the transcript or a motion for extension of time by the 30-day deadline. Additionally, Loc.R. 18.05 required the praecipe to be filed by March 14, 2016. The Likelys did not comply with this deadline. In fact, the record does not reflect a praecipe for the trial transcript ever having been filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Eighteen days after the deadline for filing the transcript had expired, the Bank moved to strike the Likelys' objections for failure to file the trial transcript within 30 days of the objections. Twenty-eight days after the filing deadline for the transcript had expired and after the Bank had moved to strike their objections, the Likelys moved for an extension of an unspecified length of time to file the transcript. The Likelys asserted good cause existed for their motion for extension of time to file the transcript \"because this is [a] foreclosure case and the [Likelys] paid for the transcript when they obtained the funds to do so. Since [the Likelys] timely filed objections and made payment for the transcript there are grounds to extend the time to file the transcript [ ].\" The trial court denied both the Bank's motion to strike the objections and the Likelys' motion for extension of time to file the transcript.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 15} While the Likelys' motion put forth a general basis for the extension, it lacked specific facts to establish that they had been diligently attempting to secure the transcript. The motion did not provide any details as to when the Likelys paid for the transcript or the length of the transcript to justify extra time for filing. Nor did the motion advise the trial court as to how much additional time would be needed for the court reporter to produce the transcript. The Likelys failed to provide the trial court with these types of pertinent facts which would have allowed it to make an informed decision as to whether they had shown good cause for an extension. The burden was on the Likelys to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Further, while the Likelys asserted \"this is [a] foreclosure case[,]\" this Court is unaware of any law that excepts foreclosure cases from the previously mentioned rules. Further, the Likelys did not set forth any extenuating financial circumstances\n   to explain why they were unable to pay for the transcript. The Likelys are alleged to have defaulted on the note in 2006. Since ten years had lapsed since the alleged default, an explanation of their\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   financial situation would have been necessary to substantiate their claim that they needed time to obtain the funds for the transcript. In light of these missing facts and the Likelys' failure to comply with Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)(iii) and Loc.R. 18.05, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for extension of time to file the transcript.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The Likelys also argue there was no requirement to file the motion prior to the expiration of the 30-day period, as suggested by the trial court. While that may be true, the timing of the filing of the Likelys' motion-whether it was before or after the deadline-dictates the requirements necessary to support their request and is pertinent to the trial court's decision to grant or deny the motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civ.R. 6(B). Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it considered the timing of the Likelys' motion for extension of time to file the transcript.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Further, while Civ.R. 6(B) governs motions for extension of time, including a motion to extend the time to file a transcript,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cunnane-Gygli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005-Ohio-3258\">\n    2005-Ohio-3258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%201503701\">\n    2005 WL 1503701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 20, citing\n   <em>\n    Vance v.

Instead, they were only seeking leave to file the late transcript.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cunnane-Gygli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005-Ohio-3258\">\n    2005-Ohio-3258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%201503701\">\n    2005 WL 1503701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 18, 20.

Based on the eight-year lapse between the filing of the complaint and the dismissal for lack of standing, the six-year statute of limitations for the breach of promissory note claim had expired and the savings statute was triggered. The complaint was re-filed on May 1, 2014, well within the one-year savings statute timeframe. Accordingly, the 2014 foreclosure complaint was timely filed under the savings statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 40} In light of the foregoing, the trial court correctly applied the savings statute to the foreclosure complaint. The Likelys' first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 3\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT [THE BANK] WAS ENTITLED TO A FORECLOSURE JUDGMENT [ ] AND REFORMATION OF THE MORTGAGE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 41} In their third assignment of error, the Likelys argue that the trial court erred in granting the foreclosure judgment because the Bank did not have standing to enforce the note. This Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Objections to the magistrate's decision must \"be specific and state with particularity\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   grounds for objection.\" (Emphasis added.) Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)(ii). Additionally, Civ.R. 53 provides that, except for a claim of plain error, a party shall not assign error to a factual finding or legal conclusion on appeal unless the party specifically objects to that finding in accordance with the rule. Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)(iv). Failure to object to a magistrate's finding of fact or conclusion of law renders the argument forfeited on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Coleman v. Coleman\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Summit No. 27592,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-2500\">\n    2015-Ohio-2500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203883978\">\n    2015 WL 3883978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9. The party is limited to a plain error argument on appeal. Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)(iv). If the party fails to assert a plain error argument on appeal, then this Court will not sua sponte engage in a plain error analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 43} The Likelys confined their objection to the magistrate's conclusion that the Bank had standing to enforce the note and mortgage. The Likelys' objection further challenged the magistrate's factual findings regarding the evidence that supported the conclusion in favor of standing arguing that: 1) there was no evidence that the Bank was formerly known as Interbay Funding, L.L.C., and 2) the Bank's witness did not have personal knowledge regarding whether the allonge was affixed to the note and the Bank had possession of the note when the complaint was filed. On appeal, the Likelys challenge the trial court's decision that the Bank had standing to enforce the note because the allonge presented at trial belonged to a different note. This argument was not presented in the Likelys' objections challenging the Bank's standing. Accordingly, the Likelys have\n   forfeited this argument. Further, the Likelys have not argued plain error on appeal. Because the Likelys have forfeited their challenge to the factual findings and conclusion at issue and have not argued plain error, this Court will not address this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Moreover, even if the Likelys had alleged plain error, this Court is precluded from reviewing this challenge as to the factual findings because the Likelys failed to timely file the transcript with the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swartz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011-Ohio-6685\">\n    2011-Ohio-6685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206880733\">\n    2011 WL 6880733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 45} The Likelys' third assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 46} The Likelys' assignments of error are overruled.
