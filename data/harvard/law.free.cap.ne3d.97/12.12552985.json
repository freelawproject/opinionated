Smith (\"Smith\"), appeals the judgment of the Meigs County Court of Common Pleas finding him guilty of contempt and sentencing him to 30 days in jail and a $250 fine, plus court costs. In this case, the appellant, William A. Smith, is not the original defendant, Forrest Frazier. Smith was the alleged victim in the case against Frazier. In the proceedings against Frazier, Smith failed to appear pursuant to a subpoena; and he was found to be in contempt of court and sentenced. Smith timely appealed the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On appeal, Smith primarily contends that he was denied his right to counsel during the contempt hearing. He also claims that he was denied the right to sufficient time to prepare a defense, the right to a jury trial, and the right to call and subpoena witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Upon consideration, we conclude that Smith's due process rights were violated during the contempt hearing. \"In a criminal contempt proceeding, a contemnor must be informed of his right to counsel and\n   <em>\n    must knowingly and voluntarily waive this right\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Oak Hill Banks v.

Here, the trial court failed to correctly inform Smith of his right to counsel. The trial court also failed to obtain a valid waiver of counsel before proceeding\n   with the contempt hearing. Thus, Smith's right to counsel was violated; and he is entitled to a new hearing on the charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the matter for proceedings consistent with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On December 28, 2015, a Meigs County Grand Jury indicted Forrest Frazier (\"Frazier\") on one count of felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), a felony of the second degree. The State of Ohio alleged that Frazier bit part of Smith's ear off during a physical altercation in November 2015. Frazier pleaded not guilty; and the case was set for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On September 27, 2016, Smith was personally served with a subpoena requiring him to appear as a witness at the Meigs County Courthouse on September 29, 2016. That morning, however, Smith failed to appear; and after the State was unable to locate him, the case against Frazier was dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Shortly thereafter, Smith was charged with contempt for failing to obey the subpoena. Smith appeared before the trial court on October 4, 2016 where he indicated that he wanted to be represented by counsel. The trial court scheduled the hearing on the charge for the next day, giving Smith roughly 24 hours to find counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The next day, when the parties were back in court, the following exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court: And as I recall, we were here yesterday. Mr. Smith, you asked for additional time in which to seek counsel. And I note that you are here without counsel. * * * [I]t's my understanding this charge is supposed to be heard as quickly as possible. Does that sound about right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Prosecutor Fisher: That's my understanding of it, Your Honor, and in this case, we did issue bail, we did give defendant twenty-four (24) hours to locate an attorney before we proceed on this. The penalties were read to him at that time, which could include up to thirty (30) days in local jail as well as a two hundred and fifty dollar ($250.00) fine and potential costs of the action to be given to him for this. So, the State is ready to proceed. We do have Officer Mark Griffin, or Deputy Mark Griffin here again today as he was here present for it yesterday as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court: Mr. Smith, I think the ball is back in your court. I note you're here without counsel. Did you want to have counsel? And I know it was a short period of time, but according to what I understand from the statute, it's got to be done kind of quickly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [Smith]: Yes, sir. I'd like ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court: Do you have counsel?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [Smith]: No, at, right now, no. I can't use the lawyer that I usually use because he represented Forrest Frazier.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court: Okay. Uh the Court is going to go ahead. This is the second time the officer has been here. I have no idea how this is going to come out, but it ... We're going to go ahead and proceed. Certainly, you have the right to get a counsel, you know, get an attorney or something like that based upon what may or may not happen. So, is there ... Are there any opening statements from either side?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 9} After hearing the parties' evidence, the trial court found Smith guilty of contempt and sentenced him to 30 days in jail and a $250 fine, plus court costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Smith timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Smith assigns the following error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Assignment of Error:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY DENYING APPELLANT'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: THE RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS, RIGHT TO COUNSEL, RIGHT TO SUFFICIENT TIME TO PREPARE A DEFENSE, RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AND RIGHT TO CALL AND SUBPOENA WITNESSES.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On appeal, Smith generally contends that he was denied due process during his contempt hearing. Specifically, he argues that he was denied his right to counsel when the trial court held the contempt hearing without giving him sufficient time to find counsel or obtaining a waiver of counsel. He also argues that by holding the contempt hearing roughly 24 hours after his initial appearance, he was denied sufficient time to prepare a defense and call and subpoena witnesses. Finally, he claims that the trial court did not inform him of his qualified right to a jury trial. Because Smith's brief focuses primarily on whether he was denied his right to counsel, we consider that issue first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Are there any opening statements from either side?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The State concedes that Smith \"did not openly state on the record that he wished to proceed without counsel.\" It argues, however, that Smith waived his right to counsel by not informing the trial court that he wanted more time to obtain counsel or that he wanted the court to appoint him counsel. We find this argument unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 21} A waiver of the right to counsel will not be presumed from a silent record.\n   <em>\n    Carnley v.

Anything less is not waiver.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Here, it was incumbent upon the trial court to inform Smith of his right to counsel and to obtain a waiver of that right before proceeding with the hearing. The trial court told Smith that he \"certainly * * * ha[d] the right to get counsel * * * or something like that based upon what may or may not happen [at the hearing].\" However, Smith had the right to be represented by counsel\n   <em>\n    during\n   </em>\n   the hearing. The record shows that Smith wanted to exercise that right and never waived it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Because the trial court did not correctly inform Smith of his right to counsel nor did it obtain a valid waiver of counsel, Smith's due process rights were violated; and Smith is entitled to a new hearing on the charge.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.
