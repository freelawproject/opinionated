(\"Father\") and A.G. (\"Mother\"), appeal the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee city of Middleburg Heights (\"city\"), finding that the city is immune from liability for an injury sustained by their minor child, O.G., at the city's recreation center (\"Center\"). We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On February 17, 2014, O.G. and his parents attended the basketball game of O.G.'s older sibling at the Center. O.G. and his parents were waiting for the sibling to join them after the game. O.G. was standing by a large cylindrical bar that was part of the machine that operated the roll-up gym divider curtain. The curtain is used to separate the gymnasium into two basketball courts, allowing multiple games to be played at one time. One of the city's employees activated the machine to roll up the curtain after the game.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} O.G. reached out and touched the machine. O.G.'s hand and arm were drawn into the machine, and O.G. was slowly lifted from the floor while Father attempted to help by holding O.G.'s feet. The employee operating the machine was notified, and the machine was deactivated, lowering O.G. to the ground. O.G. suffered a transverse incomplete fracture through the mid-shaft of the humerus bone with mild angulation of the distal fragment of the left arm, resulting in a degree of permanent residual damage to the arm. Appellants state there were no warning signs in the area or sounds indicating the machine's operation. O.G. stated he did not know why he reached out and touched the machine as it began moving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellants filed suit on February 12, 2016, alleging negligence and loss of consortium. After discovery, the city moved for summary judgment on August 26, 2016, asserting political subdivision immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744. Appellants responded that the city is liable under an exception to immunity pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(B). The trial court granted the motion on October 15, 2016, and appellants filed the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Chapter 2744 exculpates political subdivisions of tort liability when performing governmental or proprietary functions, subject to the statutory exceptions. R.C. 2744.02(A)(1). Determination of immunity involves a tripartite inquiry. The first question is whether the political subdivision is involved in a governmental or proprietary function as defined by R.C. 2744.02(A)(1), establishing immunity. The second question is whether immunity is eliminated by the presence of one of the exceptions listed in R.C. 2744.02(B). If immunity remains intact, there is no need to proceed to step three. If immunity is compromised, the final inquiry is whether immunity is reinstated by R.C. 2744.03(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maddox v. E. Cleveland\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.
