This Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In 2006, the Bridges executed a note and mortgage in favor of Nationstar Mortgage, L.L.C. (\"Nationstar\"). Shortly thereafter, Nationstar executed an allonge to the note indorsed in blank. In 2015, Nationstar assigned the mortgage to Bank of New York Mellon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In 2016, Bank of New York Mellon filed a foreclosure action against the Bridges. After seeking and being granted an extension of time, the Bridges filed a pro se answer to the complaint. The Bridges subsequently obtained counsel who filed a motion to dismiss and/or for judgment on the pleadings. After the trial court denied that motion, counsel filed an answer for the Bridges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Bank of New York Mellon moved for summary judgment. In support of its motion, Bank of New York Mellon submitted an affidavit from an employee of its servicing agent. The affiant attached a number of documents which he stated were true and accurate copies of the originals, including the payment history, the note and its allonge, the mortgage and its assignment, and the notice of default that was sent to the Bridges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The Bridges did not file any response to the motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted Bank of New York Mellon's motion for summary judgment and entered a decree of foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The Bridges appeal raising three assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In all three of the Bridges' assignments of error, they challenge the trial court's grant of summary judgment to Bank of New York Mellon.

A copy of the note, which included an allonge indorsed in blank, was attached to the affidavit. A copy of the mortgage and its assignment were also attached. The assignment was dated September 10, 2015, approximately four months before the foreclosure was filed on January 11, 2016. Thus, the affidavit and the documents attached to it met Bank of New York Mellon's initial burden to demonstrate the lack of a genuine issue of material fact regarding its standing to bring the foreclosure action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nationstar Mtge., L.L.C. v.

The affiant averred that the Bridges' account was in default of payment. The affiant attached copies of their payment history and the default notices sent to the Bridges. He verified that these documents were true and accurate copies of the originals. He further stated the amount of the unpaid principal and the interest rate. Thus, Bank of New York Mellon met its initial summary judgment burden. The Bridges did not respond to the motion for summary judgment or present any evidence to contradict Bank of New York Mellon's affiant or documentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 28} On appeal, the Bridges refer to the payment history as \"a convoluted, cryptic document.\" They continue by arguing that without a proper payment history, there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding their default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The Bridges direct this Court's attention to\n   <em>\n    Charter One Bank, F.S.B. v. Kobenald Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. Franklin No. 01AP-886,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%20433621\">\n    2002 WL 433621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mar. 21, 2002) for the proposition that \"[a] competent, credible, and authenticated payment history or testimony is crucial to a plaintiff-bank proving its case in foreclosure cases.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   However,\n   <em>\n    Kobenald\n   </em>\n   is clearly distinguishable from this case. First, unlike the Bridges, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Kobenald\n   </em>\n   opposed the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. Further, while the bank in\n   <em>\n    Kobenald\n   </em>\n   contended that the account was in default for failure to make the December 1999 payment, the payment record it submitted only went through March 1999.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. In addition, an affiant for the defendant stated that he had made regular payments through the end of 1999.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The defendant's affiant further stated that the defendant had two loans with the plaintiff that it paid with a single check each month.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Finally, there was evidence from the bank's records that a payment had been received for the second loan in December 1999.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. Given this conflicting evidence, the court concluded that summary judgment was not appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 30} By contrast, in the present case, there was no conflicting evidence. Bank of\n   New York Mellon submitted a payment history that spanned the time from the loan's origination until after the complaint for foreclosure was filed. This case is unlike\n   <em>\n    Kobenald\n   </em>\n   where the submitted payment history stopped nine months before the alleged default. Furthermore, the Bridges did not respond to Bank of New York Mellon's motion for summary judgment. They did not submit or point to any evidence contrary to that submitted by Bank of New York Mellon. By failing to respond to the motion for summary judgment, the Bridges failed to meet their reciprocal burden to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact remained.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mielcarek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-60\">\n    2016-Ohio-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20111467\">\n    2016 WL 111467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 16 (bare assertion that payments were not accurately reflected does not meet Civ.R. 56 burden);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swartz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004-Ohio-1986\">\n    2004-Ohio-1986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%20840118\">\n    2004 WL 840118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 16 (appellant did not present evidence that the amount owed was incorrect).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Finally, the Bridges set forth various statements of law regarding compensatory damages and contract formation. But, they do not explain how these general legal principles apply to the facts of their case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 16(A)(7). Rather, they simply make the conclusory assertions that \"[Bank of New York Mellon] failed to prove compensable damages\" and \"[the] essential elements [for contract formation] are absent in the instant matter.\" The Bridges do not further develop these arguments or point to any evidence in the record supporting their conclusions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 16(A)(7) and Loc.R. 7(F).
