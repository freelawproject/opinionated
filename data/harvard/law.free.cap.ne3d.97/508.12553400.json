Lodi unilaterally attacks the trial court's rulings of liability pursuant to agency by estoppel. We affirm the trial court's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On October 10, 2014, plaintiffs-appellees Aaron Riedel (\"Riedel\") and his minor daughters Chloe and Paige Riedel (collectively \"appellees\") filed a medical malpractice and loss of consortium action against appellants and several other entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellees complained that the untimely diagnosis of Riedel's spinal epidural abscess was the cause of Riedel's incomplete paraplegia. Dr. Kalapodis testified that, in spite of the presence of an active methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (\"MRSA\") infection that was causing Riedel severe back pain, he failed to diagnose the abscess during Riedel's May 22, 2013 emergency room visit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On June 24, 2016, the jury issued a verdict against appellants, jointly and severally. Riedel was awarded $5,200,000 in economic damages, but no noneconomic damages. Each daughter was awarded $200,000 in noneconomic damages for the loss of consortium claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellees filed a motion for a new trial for noneconomic damages, while appellants filed to set-off economic damages. Appellants' pretrial motion to introduce evidence addressing the impact of the ACA on damage awards was defeated by appellees' motion in limine, granted on May 25, 2016. Appellants filed a post-trial motion, advocating application of the ACA to offset economic damages awarded by the jury in this case. Lodi also filed motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial pursuant to Civ.R. 50(B) and 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On August 17, 2016, the trial court held hearings on the pending motions. On August 31, 2016, the trial court issued three entries resolving the issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In the first entry the trial court denied appellants' motion to set-off economic damages under the ACA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   This court finds that\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Burke calculated the present value of Carruthers's life care plan at $8,725,320 with a life expectancy of 78 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Appellants' expert, John Scarbrough, Ph.D. (\"Scarbrough\"), provided a range of life expectancy and estimate quotes, and determined that the life care plan with a life expectancy of 78 years totaled $4,654,038. Appellees argue that Scarbrough's estimate did not include the higher hourly rate of hiring a home health care agency aide versus a personal attendant, though Riedel's aide at the time of trial was employed by an agency. Scarbrough's estimate also omitted the cost of a handicapped equipped vehicle. Appellees posit that correcting Scarbrough's data to increase the aide cost by seven percent, and adding $30,000 per five-year period for the cost of a handicapped vehicle, would increase Scarbrough's estimate to $5,004,352, close to the $5,200,000 verdict. The jury was provided with the economic experts' figures and could easily have recognized this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Appellants reject appellees' suggestion that adding the omitted costs supports the $5,200,000 verdict, arguing there is no indication that the jury considered this data or that the sums are adjusted for present value. Citing the difference between the $8,725,320 estimate by Burke and the $4,654,038 by Scarbrough, appellees' offer that there is no \"rational basis\" for the jury's determination, and that the \"only explanation for the damages award\" is that it blends \"economic and noneconomic damages,\" and the award amounts to a \"windfall\" of damages exceeding the aforementioned statutory caps on noneconomic damages. Appellants' point to appellees' closing argument asking the jury to award \" '$500,000 for Aaron and $250,000 for each of his daughters that was above and beyond the life care plan' \" as the \"best\" explanation for the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 23} On the issue of damages, the jury was advised:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (1) not to speculate or to consider insurance;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (2) that plaintiffs presented an 81 year average life expectancy for a 31-year-old Caucasian male while defendants offered a life expectancy of 73.7 due to the spinal cord injury, and that the additional factors of obesity and smoking could not be quantified;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (3) the measure of damages is measured as the present value of the pecuniary loss;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (4) a quotient verdict based on an average amount may not be entered unless at least six jury members individually accept the amount;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (5) not to opine based on sympathy;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (6) consideration of a unit value or mathematical formula may not be considered to compensate for pain and suffering, and that deciding on compensation for the disability, pain and suffering is solely the jury's responsibility; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (7) how to complete the jury interrogatories.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Jury instruction No. 17 defined economic and noneconomic loss.

Dr. Kalapodis knew about Bactrim\"for something\" and claims to have read Dr. Gizzo's dictated notes which stated MRSA in medical history.
