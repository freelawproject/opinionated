For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In October 2014, Williams began work as a production operator for FCA US LLC (hereinafter \"Chrysler\") at the company's Jeep assembly plant in Toledo, Ohio. Her job duties required her to perform repetitive overhead work, specifically the repeated use of a mallet to install vehicle door pads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Williams began experiencing right shoulder pain in December 2014-approximately five weeks into her job assignment. Williams sought medical treatment in the plant medical dispensary and then she consulted her own physician, Dr. David Sohn. Williams was diagnosed with a full thickness tear in her right rotator cuff, which is a group of muscles that surround the right shoulder joint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On December 10, 2014, Williams filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits, requesting that it be allowed for \"full thickness tear right rotator cuff.\" Williams alleged that she sustained this injury due to \"constant use of shoulder going up and down to put rubber on door edges.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Following two administrative hearings, the Industrial Commission of Ohio ultimately disallowed the claim, finding that the muscle tear \"primarily resulted from the natural deterioration of the tissues in Ms. Williams [sic] right shoulder\" rather than work activity. Pursuant to R.C. 4123.512, Williams timely appealed that decision to the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, and a jury trial took place on November 14 and 15, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} At trial, the parties each presented a medical expert witness on the issue of causation: Williams presented the expert testimony of her treating physician, Dr. Sohn, and Chrysler presented the expert testimony of Dr. Douglas Gula, an orthopedic surgeon who had performed an independent medical examination of Williams during the course of the proceedings. The experts agreed on several issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Dr. Sohn and Dr. Gula agreed that, at the time of her injury, Williams had three separate, non-work related conditions in her right shoulder. First, Williams was born with a \"Type II acromion.\" The acromion is a bony structure attached to the scapula, or shoulder blade. A \"Type II acromion\" does not lay flat but, rather, is curved or hook shaped. Second, Williams has a bone spur, i.e. an outgrowth, on her acromion. Third, Williams has \"AC joint arthritis,\" which is a degenerative condition of the AC joint at the top of the shoulder. The experts agreed that these three conditions preexisted Williams' rotator cuff tear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Dr. Sohn and Dr. Gula also agreed that Williams did, in fact, suffer a full thickness tear in her right rotator cuff. The experts disagreed as to the cause of that injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Williams' expert, Dr. Sohn, testified that there are three potential causes of a rotator cuff tear : (1) \"acute trauma,\" which he described as some violent episode where the tendon is forcefully torn, like a car accident; (2) \"attritional,\" which he said is a gradual occurrence over time as a person's blood supply to the muscle naturally decreases with age; or (3) \"overuse mechanism,\" which he described as overuse of a repetitive movement involving the ball and socket joint of the shoulder, such as repetitive arm movement. When asked to give his opinion on the cause of Williams' rotator cuff tear, he testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   I think she had an overuse mechanism. I think that she had some-she had the Type II acromion and she had some arthritis of the AC joint that were risk factors that combined with the repetitive overhead activity that she described, I think, is what caused her rotator cuff tear. So I do think that was a direct and proximate injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Dr. Gula, on the other hand, opined that Williams' rotator cuff tear was a \"longstanding chronic condition that didn't happen in December 2014.\" He stated that her rotator cuff tear took \"years to develop\" and occurred due to \"activities of daily living\" rather than her work activities. Dr. Gula also recognized that neither a Type II acromion nor AC joint arthritis are capable of causing a rotator cuff tear on their own but, rather, these conditions are predisposing risk factors that can contribute to the development of a tear. Specifically, he testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Q: Now you mentioned that Ms. Williams had a Type II acromion which I think you said is-is something that she was born with. Does everyone who\n   has a Type II acromion develop a rotator cuff tear ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Q: Well, what about AC joint arthritis -Can you have AC joint arthritis and not develop a rotator cuff tear ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A: That's correct, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Q: So those conditions in and of themselves do not necessarily cause rotator cuff tears ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A: They contribute to the development, but they don't specifically cause, no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Q: Okay. So it is the presence of one or both of those conditions plus something else that culminates in a rotator cuff tear ; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Q: So would it be fair to describe that as a-a predisposing factor or a risk for-something that creates an increased risk of a rotator cuff tear ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A: I agree with that, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Based on the testimony of Dr. Sohn and Dr. Gula, Williams requested the following jury instruction on dual causation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Proximate cause\" is an event that, in the natural and continuous sequence, directly produces the injury and without which the injury would not have occurred. It is not necessary that the Plaintiff's employment was the sole or exclusive cause of the injury. An injury may have more than one proximate cause. Where two conditions or events combine to produce an injury, each of these conditions or events is a proximate cause of that injury.\n   <em>\n    Murphy v. Carrollton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1708864\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/61/585/\">\n    61 Ohio St.3d 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=575%20N.E.2d%20828\">\n    575 N.E.2d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Williams argued that this jury instruction was warranted by the experts' testimony, primarily because Dr. Sohn had testified that the Type II acromion and AC joint arthritis were \"risk factors that\n   <em>\n    combined with\n   </em>\n   the repetitive overhead activity\" to cause Williams' rotator cuff tear, and because Dr. Gula had stated that Williams' predisposing factors \"\n   <em>\n    contributed to\n   </em>\n   the development\" of the rotator cuff tear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Chrysler objected to the proposed instruction, arguing that both experts discussed the Type II acromion and AC joint arthritis as mere predisposing risk factors-not separate, proximate causes. Chrysler argued that the experts presented competing single-causation theories: Dr. Sohn opined that Williams' injury was caused by a work-related \"overuse mechanism,\" while Dr. Gula opined that the injury was caused by natural deterioration. Chrysler argued that a dual-causation instruction was therefore inappropriate because neither expert testified that there was more than one proximate cause of Williams' injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Chrysler also argued that to the extent that Williams' preexisting risk factors were to be viewed by the court as \"particular predispositions, susceptibilities, and sensitivities\" that made Williams more likely to be injured under circumstances that would not injure an otherwise normal, healthy employee, a dual causation instruction was unnecessary because the court intended to provide the following \"eggshell plaintiff\" instruction to the jury:\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Employers take their employees as they find them, and assume the risk that an employee's previous physical condition or state of health may cause him or her to be injured as a result of events or activities that would not harm an otherwise healthy person. An employee's particular\n   * * * predispositions, susceptibilities, and sensitivities are irrelevant to the determination of whether the employee is entitled to participate in the Workers' Compensation Benefits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Ultimately, the trial court sustained Chrysler's objection and found that the proposed dual causation instruction was improper because neither expert had testified that there was more than one proximate cause of Williams' injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The jury found that Williams was not entitled to participate in the workers' compensation fund for \"full thickness tear right rotator cuff\" and disallowed her claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Williams appealed and asserts a single assignment of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The trial court erred, to Appellant's prejudice, in failing to instruct the jury that an injury may have more than one proximate cause, and where two events or conditions combine to produce an injury, each of those conditions or events is a proximate cause of that injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 18} As explained further below, we find that the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury on dual causation because neither expert witness opined that there was more than one proximate cause of Williams' rotator cuff tear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 19} An appellate court will not overturn a trial court's jury instruction on appeal absent a finding of abuse of discretion, when evaluated under the particular facts and circumstances of each case.\n   <em>\n    Kmotorka v.

She also concedes that neither physician expressly stated that there was more than one proximate cause of her injury.

Williams interprets this sentence to mean that where a claimant has one or more risk factors that are incapable of independently causing an injury on their own, such risk factors should nonetheless be viewed as separate, legally-significant \"proximate causes\" if they somehow combined with another event that caused the claimant's injury. Williams argues that a dual causation instruction was therefore appropriate because both medical experts recognized that her predisposing risk factors somehow combined with another event that caused her rotator cuff tear. That is, Dr. Sohn opined that her risk factors \"combined with\" her repetitive work activity to cause her injury, and Dr. Gula opined that, in general, such risk factors can \"contribute to the development\" of a rotator cuff tear if \"something else\" occurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Williams also maintains that the experts' failure to explicitly state that her Type II acromion, bone spur, or AC joint arthritis were separate \"proximate causes\" of her injury is immaterial because such \"magic words of causation\" are not necessary. Williams argues that the experts' testimony, when viewed in their totality, can reasonably be understood as stating that Williams' predisposing conditions did, in fact, proximately cause her injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Dual Causation Requires More than One Proximate Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 25} First, regarding the legal standard for dual causation, Williams misinterprets\n   <em>\n    Murphy.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   , the decedent suffered a work-related lumbosacral strain on October 23, 1964 and then died from a\n   massive pulmonary embolism almost 18 years later. At trial, his widow requested a dual causation jury instruction, which was denied by the trial court and that ruling was affirmed by the appellate court. The Supreme Court of Ohio then reversed, finding that a dual causation jury instruction was warranted because the record contained \"sufficient evidence to allow reasonable minds to conclude that there was more than one proximate cause of death.\"\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   at 591,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=575%20N.E.2d%20828\">\n    575 N.E.2d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is, appellant's medical expert opined that while the decedent died \"from a massive pulmonary embolism,\" he also testified that \"he believed that the decedent's death was directly and proximately caused by the October, 1964 injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 590,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=575%20N.E.2d%20828\">\n    575 N.E.2d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, a dual causation instruction was appropriate because the evidence supported two separate and direct proximate causes of the decedent's death: (1) a massive pulmonary embolism and (2) the October 1964 injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 26} When the Supreme Court of Ohio stated the following in\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   : \"In Ohio, when two factors combine to produce damage or illness, each is a proximate cause,\" this language must be read in conjunction with the underlying facts (which, as explained, supported two separate, direct proximate causes of death) and the controlling point of law stated in the syllabus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   syllabus provides that a jury instruction on dual causation should be given only where \"there was more than one proximate cause\" of the injury, which in that case was death.\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   at syllabus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Accordingly, we interpret the\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   language that Williams relies upon (and that she included in her requested dual causation instruction) to mean that when an injury has more than one proximate cause, then \"\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   is a proximate cause,\" even when they combine to produce damage or illness. Or, in other words, separate proximate causes do not become one, single cause simply because they somehow combined before the injury occurred. It does not mean, as Williams argues, that mere \"risk factors\" or \"predisposing conditions\"-i.e., factors or conditions that cannot cause injury or damage on their own-should nonetheless be viewed as separate and distinct \"proximate causes\" for purposes of dual causation simply because they somehow combined with another event that\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   cause the injury.

We find, however, that the expert testimony in this case, when viewed in its totality, does not contain sufficient evidence from which a reasonable mind could conclude that Williams' rotator cuff tear had more than one proximate cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Dr. Sohn testified that there are three potential causes of a rotator cuff tear : (1) \"acute trauma,\" (2) \"attritional,\" and (3) \"overuse mechanism.\" He was then asked to give his opinion on the direct and proximate cause of Williams' rotator cuff tear, and Dr. Sohn selected one of the three potential causes: a work-related \"overuse mechanism.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Although Dr. Sohn then stated that the Type II acromion and AC joint arthritis were \"risk factors that combined with the repetitive overhead activity,\" this is not sufficient evidence from which a reasonable mind could conclude that these \"risk factors\" were additional proximate causes of Williams' rotator cuff tear. Indeed, if Dr. Sohn believed that Williams' Type II acromion, bone spur, or AC joint arthritis could have proximately caused this injury, he would have included these conditions in his list of potential causes of rotator cuff tears. He did not. We therefore assume that Dr. Sohn meant precisely what he said: Williams' injury was directly and proximately caused by her repetitive work activity, and her non-work related health conditions were predisposing \"risk factors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Moreover, although Dr. Sohn also testified that \"both the bone spur and the repetitive reaching up are\n   <em>\n    contributory causes\n   </em>\n   to the development of the rotator cuff tear,\" we note that he later corrected himself and stated that the presence of a bone spur \"is not a cause\" but can \"make an individual more susceptible to rotator cuff injury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 34} In sum, viewed in its totality, Dr. Sohn's testimony supports a finding that Williams' rotator cuff tear had one proximate cause: work-related \"overuse mechanism.\" His trial deposition does not contain sufficient testimony from which a reasonable mind could conclude that Williams' injury had more than one proximate cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Dr. Gula's testimony does not support a dual causation theory either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Viewed in its totality, Dr. Gula provided only one proximate cause of Williams' rotator cuff tear : natural deterioration. That is, he described the injury as \"a longstanding chronic condition that didn't happen in December 2014,\" and stated that the tear took \"years to develop\" through \"activities of daily living.\" Moreover, Dr. Gula testified that a Type II acromion and AC joint arthritis\"contribute to the development, but don't specifically cause\" rotator cuff tears, and further stated that these conditions are appropriately described as \"predisposing factor[s] * * * that create an increased risk of a rotator cuff tear.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Thus, rather than supporting a dual causation theory, the two medical experts presented competing single-causation theories: Dr. Sohn asserted that the rotator cuff tear was caused by work-related overuse, and Dr. Gula opined that the injury was caused by natural deterioration. Dual causation was not at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 37} A similar situation was recently addressed in\n   <em>\n    Leasure v. UVMC\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist.

There, the court interpreted dual causation to apply in the following situations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Dual causation would only be applicable in the instant case if [the plaintiff] established that her non-work related health problems associated with her obesity and advanced age as well as her 1982 work injury were both separate and independent causes of her lumbar spondylosis. At trial, evidence was adduced which supported only two alternative theories of causation for [plaintiff's] lumbar spondylosis, to wit: flow-through\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   natural deterioration. The theory of dual causation is simply not supported by the record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Similarly here, two alternative theories of causation were presented: work-related overuse\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   natural deterioration. The record lacked sufficient evidence to suggest that Williams' non-work related health problems were separate and independent causes of her injury. Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Leasure\n   </em>\n   , the theory of dual causation is not supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Finally, we note that the experts' trial depositions, when viewed in their totality, are sufficient to support a reasonable conclusion that Williams' Type II acromion, bone spur, and AC joint arthritis made her more susceptible to a rotator cuff tear.
