This Court affirms in part and reverses in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In January 2015, three women came forward and accused Austin of having sexually assaulted them in their youth. Relevant to this appeal, Austin's half-sister, K.R., accused him of sexually assaulting her when she was between the ages of five and ten. Meanwhile, his cousin, L.B., accused him of sexually assaulting her when she was between the ages of five and thirteen. It is undisputed that, at the time Austin allegedly committed the sexual assaults, he was between the ages of ten and nineteen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} A grand jury indicted Austin on thirty-five counts: (1) ten counts of rape and eight counts of gross sexual imposition (\"GSI\") that pertained to L.B.; (2) six counts of rape and six counts of GSI that pertained to K.R.; and (3) four counts of rape and one count of GSI that pertained to a third accuser. Each count of rape or GSI spanned a designated time period. The counts involving L.B. spanned from December 1999 until December 2008. The counts involving K.R. spanned from January 2003 until January 2009. Finally, the counts involving the third accuser spanned from July 2003 until July 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Austin moved to dismiss the indictment, in whole or part, on the basis of pre-indictment delay. He further claimed that subjecting him to prosecution as an adult for crimes he allegedly committed at such a young age offended the Due Process Clause. The State filed a brief in opposition to his motion, and the trial court held a hearing. Following the hearing, the court granted Austin's motion in part and dismissed four of the rape counts and three of the GSI counts involving L.B. The remaining twenty-eight counts remained for trial, but, at the close of its case-in-chief, the State dismissed an additional eight counts as a result of the evidence presented at trial and successful amendments to the dates in the indictment. Specifically, the State dismissed one of the rape counts pertaining to K.R., three of the rape counts pertaining to L.B., three of the rape counts pertaining to the third accuser, and the GSI count pertaining to the third accuser. The jury heard the remaining twenty counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The jury found Austin not guilty of the sole remaining rape count involving the third accuser and one of the GSI counts involving K.R. The jury found Austin guilty of his other eighteen counts, and the court sentenced him on each count. The court imposed a total sentence of life in prison with parole eligibility after thirty-five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Austin now appeals from his convictions and raises seven assignments of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   R.C. 2152.02(C)(3) AND R.C. 2152.12(J) ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS APPLIED TO DANIEL AUSTIN AS TO COUNTS 1, 6, 12, 15 WHEN THE TRIAL COURT PREVIOUSLY RULED THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY REQUIRE MR.

There also is no dispute that his indictment charged him with conduct he allegedly committed when he was between the ages of ten and nineteen. R.C. 2152.12(J) provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [i]f a person under eighteen years of age allegedly commits an act that would be a felony if committed by an adult and if the person is not taken into custody or apprehended for that act until after the person attains twenty-one years of age, the juvenile court does not have jurisdiction to hear or determine any portion of the case charging the person with committing that act. In those circumstances, * * * the case charging the person with\n   committing the act shall be a criminal prosecution commenced and heard in the appropriate court having jurisdiction of the offense as if the person had been eighteen years of age or older when the person committed the act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Likewise, the Revised Code provides that \"[a]ny person who, while under eighteen years of age, commits an act that would be a felony if committed by an adult and who is not taken into custody or apprehended for that act until after the person attains twenty-one years of age is not a child in relation to that act.\" R.C. 2152.02(C)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Before trial, Austin filed a motion to dismiss his indictment, in whole or part, on the basis of pre-indictment delay. He also argued that prosecuting him as an adult for crimes he allegedly committed when he was less than fourteen years of age \"raise[d] a due process fundamental fairness issue\" because he would not have been subject to bindover at that age.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2152.12(B)(1). While the trial court rejected his pre-indictment delay argument, the court agreed that it would be \"fundamentally unfair and an arbitrary and unreasonable abridgment of his due process rights\" to apply R.C. 2152.02(C)(3) and 2152.12(J) to him for conduct he allegedly committed before turning fourteen. The court, therefore, dismissed seven counts in the indictment, all of which were alleged to have occurred between December 21, 1999, and December 20, 2002. The court held in abeyance its ruling on several additional counts because it could not determine, without hearing the evidence at trial, whether Austin was under fourteen when those offenses allegedly occurred. The trial court never revisited its ruling, and the jury ultimately found Austin guilty of the three counts at issue in this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Austin argues that R.C. 2152.02(C)(3) and 2152.12(J) are unconstitutional as applied to him with respect to his three counts because the evidence does not support the conclusion that he was at least fourteen when he committed them. Count 1 was for rape, concerned K.R., and was alleged to have occurred between January 12, 2003, and January 11, 2004. Renumbered count 6 was for GSI, concerned K.R., and was alleged to have occurred during that same time period. Renumbered count 15 was for GSI, concerned L.B., and was alleged to have occurred between December 21, 2002, and December 20, 2003. Austin turned fourteen on October 14, 2003. Accordingly, with respect to the counts involving K.R., Austin was fourteen for almost three months of the indictment period (i.e., between October 14, 2003, and January 11, 2004). With respect to the count involving L.B., he was fourteen for just over two months of the indictment period (i.e., between October 14, 2003, and December 20, 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Notably, this Court need not address the trial court's ultimate conclusion that it would be \"fundamentally unfair and an arbitrary and unreasonable abridgment of [Austin's] due process rights\" to apply R.C. 2152.02(C)(3) and 2152.12(J) to him for conduct he allegedly committed before turning fourteen. The trial court ruled in Austin's favor on that issue, and the State has not appealed from the trial court's ruling. Austin's statutory argument hinges entirely upon his assertion that there was no proof he committed count 1, renumbered count 6, and renumbered count 15 when he was at least fourteen. Accordingly, this Court will assume for purposes of its analysis that the trial court's underlying ruling was correct and limit its review to the issue of whether Austin was at least fourteen when he committed the foregoing offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    K.R.: Count 1 and Renumbered Count 6\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} K.R. testified that she was born in January 1998 and is Austin's half-sibling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   She stated that she was five years old when she started kindergarten and that Austin began raping her during that school year. The first rape occurred in the midst of a game that Austin invented, which he called \"the wormy game.\" K.R. explained that Austin had them remove their clothes, roll up in blankets, and try to get into each other's blankets. During the game, K.R. stated that \"you would touch the other person on their penis or their vagina and then it turned into sex after that.\" She testified that, after the first time, the game \"seemed to happen almost on a daily basis\" through kindergarten and first grade. She stated that, while in first grade, the game stopped and \"it just went right into the sex.\" She estimated that Austin raped her \"three to four times a week\" between kindergarten and third grade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 14} When Austin turned fourteen, K.R. was approximately five years and nine months old. The indictment period encapsulated in count 1 and renumbered count 6 ended when she turned six years old in January 2004. K.R. specifically testified that she was five years old when she started kindergarten and that the sexual encounters with Austin began in kindergarten and continued until third grade. She also specified that the encounters occurred several times each week. K.R. described her sexual encounters with Austin as encompassing both genital touching and vaginal intercourse. Accordingly, with regard to count 1 and renumbered count 6, there was evidence that Austin committed at least one rape and one instance of GSI against K.R. between his fourteenth birthday (October 14, 2003) and January 11, 2004. He has not, therefore, demonstrated that R.C. 2152.02(C)(3) and 2152.12(J) are unconstitutional as applied to him with respect to those two counts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Groch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805678\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/117/192/\">\n    117 Ohio St.3d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-546\">\n    2008-Ohio-546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=883%20N.E.2d%20377\">\n    883 N.E.2d 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 181, quoting\n   <em>\n    Harrold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566773\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/107/44/\">\n    107 Ohio St.3d 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005-Ohio-5334\">\n    2005-Ohio-5334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=836%20N.E.2d%201165\">\n    836 N.E.2d 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 38.

He testified that he had a close relationship with Austin and, at some point in 2015, spoke with Austin on the phone. During that phone conversation, Austin asked him to take a polygraph test for him. Austin's half-brother specified that Austin proposed a meeting between the two so that he (Austin) could provide him with his (Austin's) identification to take with him to the test. He testified that he initially agreed to take the test for Austin, but changed his mind shortly thereafter and let Austin know that he would not be willing to take the test. According to Austin's half-brother, he could not tell if Austin was being sarcastic or joking during their discussion about the polygraph.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Before allowing Austin's half-brother to testify, the trial court spoke with him outside the presence of the jury. The court advised him that, at no point during his testimony, would he be permitted to volunteer information about any polygraph tests Austin might have taken in the past, whether any polygraph test was actually completed, or the results of any polygraph testing. With those restrictions in mind, the court overruled Austin's objection to the testimony. The court determined that the testimony was not unduly prejudicial and, if believed, could indicate consciousness of guilt. The court later instructed the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [T]estimony has been admitted that [Austin] asked another individual to take a polygraph test for him. You are instructed that such conduct alone does not raise a presumption of guilt, but it may tend to indicate [Austin's] consciousness of guilt. If you find that the facts do not support [Austin] attempted to cause another individual to take a polygraph test for him, or if you find that some other motivation prompted [his] request, or if you are unable to decide [his] motivation, then you should not consider the evidence for any purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   However, if you find that the facts support that [he] did attempt to cause another individual to take a polygraph test for him and if you decide that [he] was motivated by a consciousness of guilt, you may, but are not required to, consider this evidence in deciding whether [he] is guilty of the crime with which he is charged. You alone will decide what weight, if any, to give to this evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Accordingly, in its instruction, the court \"emphasized repeatedly the jury's role as factfinder.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

There was no evidence that Austin ever took a polygraph test or even that he was asked to do so. The evidence was that Austin voluntarily broached the subject of a polygraph test with his half-brother because he wanted his half-brother to impersonate him and take the test on his behalf. Austin's statements do not simply reflect an unwillingness to submit to a polygraph. Rather, if\n   believed, they tend to show an attempt to deceive law enforcement and impede an investigation through purposeful manipulation. While the law generally disfavors testimony pertaining to polygraphs, the particular facts and circumstances in this case are in accord with the cases outlined above where courts have admitted evidence of an accused's attempt to \"beat\" a polygraph examination as bearing upon consciousness of guilt.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Samuels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3123224\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/36/96/#p128\">\n    36 Cal.4th at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20105\">\n    30 Cal.Rptr.3d 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20P.3d%201125\">\n    113 P.3d 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Enfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%2031160299\">\n    2002 WL 31160299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-3 ;\n   <em>\n    Bellomo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7654945\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/944/1160/#p1167\">\n    944 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1167 ;\n   <em>\n    McDowell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2141077\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/266/508/#p515\">\n    266 S.C. at 515-516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2141077\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/266/508/#p515\">\n    224 S.E.2d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Upon review, we reject his assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The rape statute prohibits any person from \"engag[ing] in sexual conduct with another who is not the spouse of the offender * * * when * * * [t]he other person is less than thirteen years of age, whether or not the offender knows the age of the other person.\" R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b). Before the enactment of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 260 in January 2007, any offender who violated R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) and, in doing so, \"purposely compel[led] the victim to submit by force or threat of force\" automatically received a life sentence. Former R.C. 2907.02(B). After the bill's enactment, an offender who caused his youthful victim serious physical harm during the commission of a rape could be sentenced to either life without parole,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2907.02(B), or an indefinite sentence of 25 years to life,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2971.03(B)(1)(c).

Meanwhile, the bill exempted offenders who were under the age of sixteen at the time of their offense from any of the foregoing penalties so long as they satisfied certain other criteria, including that they did not subject their victims to any serious physical harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2907.02(B).

The jury found Austin guilty of renumbered count 13 and further found that he (1) was between the ages of fourteen and seventeen when he committed the offense, (2) used force when he engaged in sexual conduct with L.B., and (3) caused her serious physical harm. Austin argues that the jury's third finding is based on insufficient evidence because the State failed to set forth any evidence of serious physical harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 30} It is well settled that, \"[t]o demonstrate reversible error, an aggrieved party must demonstrate both error and resulting prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Princess Kim, L.L.C. v.

With respect to renumbered count 13, the trial court sentenced Austin to life in prison with parole eligibility after ten years. Accordingly, the court did not impose one of the sentences authorized upon a finding of serious physical harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2907.02(B) (authorizing sentence of life without parole); R.C. 2971.03(B)(1)(c) (authorizing an indefinite sentence of 25 years to life).

This Court accepts the State's concession and vacates Austin's convictions on the seven foregoing counts. Accordingly, we only consider whether his two remaining GSI counts, renumbered counts 6 and 7, should have merged with the two rape counts stemming from the same time frames.

She estimated that Austin sexually assaulted her in the foregoing manners three to four times a week between kindergarten and third grade. Accordingly, even assuming that one particular incident of sexual assault should not have resulted in separate convictions for rape and GSI, Austin has not shown that his convictions for any given year stem from a single incident. The record reflects that the jury could have convicted him for rape as to one incident and for GSI as to a separate incident, occurring on a different day or week.

He notes that the two described virtually all the sexual assaults as having occurred in places where other family members could have seen. According to Austin, \"[i]t is simply unbelievable that a minor would commit these acts against other minors in such public places, sometimes with other people present, and that they were never caught.\" He further argues that, contrary to K.R.'s and L.B.'s testimony, there was testimony that he was not frequently alone with either girl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 41} This Court has previously outlined much of K.R.'s testimony in the preceding assignments of error. She described how Austin sexually abused her numerous times over the years, taking advantage of instances when he was alone with her. She testified that she did not disclose the abuse to anyone at first because she did not understand that it was abnormal behavior for brothers and sisters. When she did learn the truth, she still did not disclose the abuse because Austin threatened to kill their mother if she told. K.R. testified that she was hospitalized for a week at age ten because she attempted suicide. She stated that she tried to hang herself so that the abuse would stop and she would not have to worry about her mother. According to K.R., she ultimately told her mother about the abuse at age seventeen because she overheard a conversation between Austin and their mother. During the conversation, Austin became angry with their mother for taking his daughter to an unfamiliar man's house when he did not know whether the man \"[did] drugs * * * [or] touche[d] little girls.\" K.R. testified that the sheer hypocrisy of Austin's statement caused her to breakdown and tell her mother about the abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 42} After K.R.'s disclosure, her mother contacted the police. Her mother confirmed that K.R. told her about the sexual abuse after the aforementioned conversation with Austin in which he accused her of exposing his daughter to a potential pedophile. She confirmed that there were many instances when K.R. and Austin were alone growing up because she had to work. She testified that, at one point, she also attended night school a few nights a week and left the children with their cousins, including L.B. Additionally, K.R.'s mother stated that L.B. walked K.R. home from school when she was in first grade and that the girls and Austin would be unsupervised for about one hour each day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Much like K.R., L.B. testified to a pattern of abuse that began when she was about five years old. She testified that, when she was \"probably seven, maybe eight,\" Austin briefly had vaginal intercourse with her on the carpeted stairs at her house. When she was \"[p]robably eight or nine\" and the weather was warm, she recalled that he made her sit on his lap on\n   the couch so that he could have vaginal intercourse with her. When she was \"[p]robably nine, maybe ten,\" she recalled Austin having intercourse with her in the pool outside by pulling her bathing suit to the side and having her on top of him while attempting to support himself from behind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 44} L.B. testified that she was in fourth grade (i.e., between nine and ten years of age) when Austin and his family moved to a new house, and she began walking his younger sister, K.R., home from school each day. She recalled an incident during that school year when Austin called her to his room, had her undress, and had vaginal intercourse with her. She testified that Austin bit her breast during the incident before \"he pulled out and [ ] ejaculated all over [her] chest, [her] stomach, [and her] legs.\" She further testified that he kissed her and put his tongue in her mouth after she had dressed and was attempting to leave. She stated that there were \"several incidents like that at that location that same school year.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 45} L.B. testified that, during her seventh grade year (i.e., between twelve and thirteen years of age), Austin lived with her family for several months. While he lived there, Austin pushed L.B. onto the couch one day after school and had vaginal intercourse with her. She recalled another incident at the house when he had vaginal intercourse with her in her bedroom. Further, she recalled instances of Austin wanting her to perform oral sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 46} L.B. stated that incidents of penetration would occur whenever Austin \"had the opportunity * * * [to] get [her] alone * * *.\" She specified that, between the fall of 2002 and the fall of 2008, Austin penetrated her \"[w]eekly, maybe biweekly, just depending on the opportunity at the time.\" She also testified: \"every time that we were not in school, [Austin] did not always penetrate me, but there was always some sort of sexually inappropriate conduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 47} L.B. testified that she did not initially disclose the sexual assaults because she was afraid no one would believe her and that they would think she just wanted attention. L.B. indicated that the abuse caused her to engage in self-harm as a teenager and ultimately to tell two very close friends what had happened. She did not officially come forward, however, until after she learned that others were making accusations against Austin. She testified that, at that point, she realized Austin had been harming others as well and \"it needed to stop.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Austin testified in his own defense and vehemently denied ever sexually assaulting either K.R. or L.B. He testified that he was rarely alone with either girl growing up because he preferred to be around his older, male cousins and he played a lot of football after school. According to Austin, he was \"heartbroken\" and \"terrified\" when he learned of the allegations because he did not understand why K.R. and L.B. had wrongfully accused him. Although Austin acknowledged that he suggested his half-brother take a polygraph in his stead, he claimed that he made the statement sarcastically. He also presented the testimony of several other family members who testified that they were close with K.R. and L.B. and that the girls had never given any indications of abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Having reviewed the record, we cannot conclude that the jury lost its way when it found Austin guilty. Although both K.R. and L.B. waited several years to disclose the abuse, they explained their reasons for not disclosing at an earlier date. Further, while Austin claimed that he was rarely alone with either girl and presented some evidence to that effect, the State presented conflicting evidence, including\n   the testimony of Austin's mother.

Thus, a two-prong test is necessary to examine such claims. First, Austin must show that counsel's performance was objectively deficient by producing evidence that counsel acted unreasonably.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Second, he must demonstrate that, but for counsel's errors, there is a reasonable probability that the results of his trial would have been different.\n   <em>\n    Keith\n   </em>\n   at 534,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=684%20N.E.2d%2047\">\n    684 N.E.2d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Austin argues that his counsel was ineffective for two reasons. First, he argues that his counsel was ineffective because he did not renew Austin's motion to dismiss three counts of the indictment (i.e., count 1 and renumbered counts 6 and 15). Austin argues that those three counts ought to have been dismissed because there was no evidence that he committed them when he was at least fourteen years old. Second, he argues that his counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the imposition of allied offenses of similar import.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 53} This Court has already vacated renumbered count 15. Moreover, in analyzing Austin's previous assignments of error, this Court has already determined that he (1) was not entitled to a dismissal on count 1 and renumbered counts 6, and (2) was not sentenced to allied offenses of similar import. Accordingly, even assuming his counsel should have either renewed his motion to dismiss or objected to allied offenses at sentencing, Austin cannot demonstrate prejudice as a result of his counsel's performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=684%20N.E.2d%2047\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Austin's seventh assignment of error is overruled on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Austin's first and fifth assignments of error are sustained in part and overruled in part.
