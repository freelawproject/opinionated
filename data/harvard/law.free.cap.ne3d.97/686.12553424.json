L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, denying leave to appeal from the denial of his fourth motion for a new trial on charges of <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"687\" href=\"#p687\" id=\"p687\">*687</a>murder in the first degree and other offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The single justice also denied Colon's two ancillary motions to transfer his gatekeeper petition, either to the full court or to the Superior Court. The Commonwealth has moved to dismiss the purported appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree that the appeal must be dismissed, as it is well established that the decision of the gatekeeper is final and unreviewable.

In addition, in the circumstances of this case, there was no error or abuse of discretion in denying the ancillary motions. His ancillary motions had no \"realistic potential for demonstrating the existence of a new and substantial question appropriate for appeal,\" <em>Parker</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856516\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/448/1021/#p1023\">448 Mass. 1021</extracted-citation>, 1023, <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=863%20N.E.2d%2040\">863 N.E.2d 40</extracted-citation> (2007), quoting <em>Fuller</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"823671\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/419/1002/#p1003\">419 Mass. 1002</extracted-citation>, 1003, <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=643%20N.E.2d%2036\">643 N.E.2d 36</extracted-citation> (1994), particularly as it appears that Colon raised the same claim in his fourth motion-that the court room was improperly closed during jury selection-as he did in a prior motion.
