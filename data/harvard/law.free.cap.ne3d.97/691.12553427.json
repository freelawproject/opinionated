Higgins, Jr., from a judgment of the county court. In January, 2018, after the appeal was entered in this court, Higgins moved for leave to file a nonconforming brief. In response, we gave Higgins until March 2, 2018, to do so. Some six weeks after that date, Higgins had not filed any brief, and the association filed its motion. See Mass. R. A. P. 19 (c), <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20Mass.%20867\">365 Mass. 867</extracted-citation> (1974). Higgins has not filed any response to the motion to dismiss within the time allotted by Mass. R. A. P. 15 (a), <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20Mass.%20859\">365 Mass. 859</extracted-citation> (1974), nor has he filed a brief. The motion to dismiss is allowed. Although Higgins is appearing pro se, we hold him to the same standards in this regard as litigants represented by counsel. See, e.g., <em>Rasheed</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1346321\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/440/1027/#p1027\">440 Mass. 1027</extracted-citation>, 1027, <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=798%20N.E.2d%201022\">798 N.E.2d 1022</extracted-citation> (2003) ; <em>Solimine</em> v. <em>Davidian</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"890128,890179,890294\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/422/1002/\">422 Mass. 1002</extracted-citation>, 1002, <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=661%20N.E.2d%20934\">661 N.E.2d 934</extracted-citation> (1996).</p><p id=\"p-9\"><em>Appeal dismissed</em>.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
