Pursuant to R.C. 505.38(A), an employee or a fire chief continues in office until removed from that office. In order to be removed from that office, the appointing authority must follow the removal proceedings contained in R.C. 733.35 to 733.39. Consistent with R.C. 505.38(A), a board of township trustees may institute removal proceedings of the employee or fire chief when it has reason to believe the employee or fire chief is guilty of, \"... bribery, misfeasance, malfeasance, nonfeasance,\n   misconduct in office, gross neglect of duty, gross immorality, or habitual drunkenness...\" in the performance of the fire chief's official duties. R.C. 733.35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The board may designate a private citizen or the fire chief to investigate any alleged misconduct by the employee or the fire chief. The fire chief or the private citizen acting as the investigator may prepare any necessary charges in accordance with R.C. 733.35 to 733.39. R.C. 505.38(A). The investigator will prepare charges if the investigation concludes the employee or the fire chief has violated general or specific standards of conduct. R.C. 733.35. The charges written by the investigator must include detailed statements of alleged guilt, and those charges are then filed with the board and served upon the employee or the fire chief. Id. Once the charges are filed, the charges must be heard at the next regular meeting of the Board unless the employee or fire chief seeks an extension of time. R.C. 733.36. The Board of Trustees acts as a quasi-judicial authority during the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} As part of Duckett's investigation, Duckett created and maintained notes related to sixteen interviews of Township trustees, Township employees, and others (defined in the Complaint at \u00b6 5, 6 and 8 as the \"Duckett notes\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Duckett submitted the final copy of his report to Attorney Kim on May 10, 2016. The Board then directed Duckett to prepare charges against Jensen, which he filed on June 6, 2016. (Trustee Eichhorn Affidavit at 5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} A three-day administrative hearing was scheduled for the Board to hear the charges against Jensen, beginning August 8, 2016. (Trustee Eichhorn Affidavit, \u00b6 7). Prior to the administrative hearing before the Board, Jensen's counsel filed a subpoena for the \"notes Mr. Duckett took during the interviews of witnesses during his investigation.\" (Trustee Eichhorn Affidavit, \u00b6 7-8). Duckett objected to the production of the notes. (Id. at \u00b6 8-9; Trustee Leneghan Affidavit, \u00b6 8-9; Trustee Mitchell Affidavit, \u00b6 8-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} At the beginning of the hearing on August 8, the Board of Trustees heard arguments regarding whether or not it should grant attorney Bittner's subpoena. (Trustee Eichhorn Affidavit, \u00b6 10; Trustee Leneghan Affidavit, \u00b6 10; Trustee Mitchell Affidavit, \u00b6 10). After the Board of Trustees heard these arguments, as well as arguments in favor and in opposition of various procedural matters, the Board adjourned to executive session. (Id.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The Board considered the subpoena, \"and announced it was granting Mr. Bittner's subpoena and requiring Mr. Duckett to produce the notes he took during witness interviews to Mr. Bittner.\" (Trustee Eichhorn Affidavit, \u00b6 10-11). The individual trustees and the Township administrator assert in their affidavits that, other than the mechanical process of handing the subpoenaed notes to Jensen's counsel at the August 8, 2016 hearing, the Duckett notes were never in their individual physical possession, and were not introduced into evidence at the hearing. (Id. at \u00b6 12-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} During the third day of the hearing, August 10, 2016, the Board of Trustees, Bittner, and Jensen agreed to pursue mediation and the administrative hearing was stayed pending the outcome of mediation. (Trustee Eichhorn Affidavit, \u00b6 19). The parties engaged in mediation on August 25, 2016, and came to a settlement agreement where the Board agreed to dismiss the charges against Jensen and Jensen agreed to become a Fire Prevention Officer for the Township. (Id. at \u00b6 20). Because of the settlement, the Board did not make any findings or issue a decision based upon the evidence presented at the August 8-10, 2016 hearing, (Id. at \u00b6 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On May 5, 2016, Hurt made the first of his and Requester Gerber's public records requests to Township Administrator Matt Huffman for various items, including the Duckett notes. Over the next three months, Huffman provided some of the requested items, but responded that the interview notes were kept by Duckett as personal records and therefore did not meet the definition of \"records.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On September 2, 2016, Huffman sent an e-mail to Hurt relaying the Township legal counsel's advice that \"[t]hose notes are not a public record since the Township does not have possession of those documents. The documents were never introduced as exhibits and are not in the record. They were given to Mr. Bittner as a result of a subpoena.\" (Requesters' Exhibit C). On October 12, 2016, Hurt and Gerber sent a joint e-mail to both Huffman and Duckett, repeating their requests for the Duckett notes. On October 13, 2016, Duckett sent an e-mail to Gerber that stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   You are incorrect as a matter of law that I am \"holding public records on behalf of Liberty Township....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Under the express terms of Section 149.43(A)(1) of the Ohio Revised Code, \"Public record means records kept by any public office, including ... township[s]....\" I am not a \"public office\"; I am an attorney with a private law practice. My records are thus not \"public records.\" This has nothing to do with attorney-client privilege; none of my records are public records by statutory definition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Accordingly, I am not providing any documents in response to your request. You need to focus your request on the public office, i.e., Liberty Township.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Requesters' Exhibit F). On September 23, 2016, Township employee Cathy Buehrer provided Hurt with transcripts of the Duckett interviews of Jensen, and offered access to the audio recordings of those interviews. (Requesters' Exhibit G).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On November 21, 2016, Requesters filed a complaint against the Township under R.C. 2743.75 alleging denial of access to a public record in violation of R.C. 149.43(B), attaching copies of the original records requests and related correspondence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Consistent with the mandates included in R.C. 2743.75, the parties participated in mediation, which was unsuccessful.\n   <em>\n    Notice Referring Public Records Complaint to Mediation,\n   </em>\n   Ohio Court of Claims, Case No. 2016-00856-PQ (November 22, 2016);\n   <em>\n    Notice of Scheduled Mediation Conference\n   </em>\n   , Ohio Court of Claims, Case No. 2016-00856-PQ (January 3, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Liberty Township filed a motion to dismiss Requestor's Complaint as well as a response to the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss and Response to Complainants ORC 2743.75\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   , Ohio Court of Claims, Case No. 2016-00856-PQ (February 1, 2017). Liberty Township asked the Court to find that Duckett's personal notes were not public records for three reasons: Duckett was a private individual not subject to Ohio's Public Records Act, that\n   Duckett's notes were personal notes not public records, and finally, that Liberty Township did not possess, and had never possessed, Duckett's notes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The Special Master assigned to the case issued a Report and Recommendation on February 22, 2017, finding that Duckett's notes were public records.\n   <em>\n    Report and Recommendation,\n   </em>\n   Ohio Court of Claims, Case No. 2016-00856-PQ (February 22, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The Special Master recommended denying the Township's motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    Report and Recommendation\n   </em>\n   , p. 6). Turning to the merits, the Special Master found that \"with respect to possession of the Duckett notes, I find failure of proof by clear and convincing evidence that the notes, other than the transcripts and audio recordings of the Jensen interviews, have been or are physically kept by the Township.\" Id. at 7. Finally, the Special Master stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Upon consideration of the pleadings and attachments, I find that requesters have established by clear and convincing evidence that the Duckett notes are public records pursuant to R.C. 149.43(A). I further conclude that the failure of the Township to provide the Duckett notes in response to requester's requests, in absence of a valid exception to release, denied requesters access to a public record in violation of division (B) of section 149.43 of the Revised Code. Accordingly, I recommend that the court issue an order GRANTING requesters' claim, and which\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   1) directs the Township to provide requesters with the Duckett notes, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   2) provides that requesters are entitled to recover from the Township the costs associated with this action, including the twenty-five dollar filing fee. R.C. 2743.75(F)(3)(b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Report and Recommendation\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Liberty Township timely filed objections to the Special Master's decision, and objected to the decision on eight separate grounds.\n   <em>\n    Objections to the Special Master's Report and Recommendation,\n   </em>\n   Ohio Court of Claims, Case No. 2016-00856-PQ (March 3, 2017). To summarize, Liberty Township argued the Special Master erred when he concluded Duckett's personal notes were public records, erred when he concluded Duckett was a private individual subject to Ohio's Public Records Act, and erred when he concluded Duckett's personal notes were public records subject to disclosure. Id. Appellees filed a reply to the objections, urging the Court of Claims to adopt the Report and Recommendation.\n   <em>\n    Reply to Respondent's Objections to the Special Master's Report and Recommendations,\n   </em>\n   Ohio Court of Claims, Case No. 2016-00856-PQ (March 22, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 20} On March 29, 2017, the Court of Claims issued an Entry adopting the Report and Recommendation, overruling Liberty Township's objections.\n   <em>\n    Entry Adopting Report and Recommendation,\n   </em>\n   Ohio Court of Claims, Case No. 2016-00856-PQ (March 29, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Assignments of Error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Liberty Township raises three assignments of error,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 22} \"I.

A \"governmental function\" traditionally includes such tasks as providing police, fire, and emergency services, public education, and a free public library system, preserving the peace, regulating the use and maintenance of roads, operating jails, regulating traffic, and collecting refuse. See R.C. 2744.01(C)(2). The decision to remove a firefighter is regulated under R.C. 733.35 to R.C. 733.39. A private party cannot initiate removal proceedings or conduct the removal hearing. A private party is limited to investigating the conduct and preparing the charges if necessary.

Duckett was carrying out a function of the township when he conducted his investigation.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 44} R.C. 505.38 defines a process that is preliminary to the removal of a fire chief. Pursuant to R.C. 505.38(A), a fire chief continues in office until removed from that office, and in order to be removed from that office, the appointing authority must follow the removal proceedings contained in R.C. 733.35 to 733.39. Consistent with R.C. 505.38(A), a board of township trustees may institute removal proceedings of the fire chief when it has reason to believe the fire chief is guilty of, \"... bribery, misfeasance, malfeasance, nonfeasance, misconduct in office, gross neglect of duty, gross immorality, or habitual drunkenness...\" in the performance of the fire chief's official duties. R.C. 733.35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 45} The board may designate the fire chief or a private citizen to investigate any alleged misconduct. R.C. 505.38(A) provides in relevant part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   To initiate removal proceedings, and for that purpose, the board shall designate the\n   <em>\n    fire chief or a private citizen\n   </em>\n   to investigate the conduct and prepare the necessary charges in conformity with those sections. (Emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 46} No special qualifications or expertise is required of the private citizen. In other words, anyone can serve. Compare R.C. 2743.75, which states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (A) In order to provide for an expeditious and economical procedure that attempts to resolve disputes alleging a denial of access to public records in violation of division (B) of section 149.43 of the Revised Code, except for a court that hears a mandamus action pursuant to that section, the court of claims shall be the sole and exclusive authority in this state that adjudicates or resolves complaints based on alleged violations of that section. The clerk of the court of claims shall designate one or more current employees or hire one or more individuals to serve as special masters to hear complaints brought under this section.\n   <em>\n    All special masters shall have been engaged in the practice of law in this state for at least four years and be in good standing with the supreme court at the time of designation or hiring. The clerk may assign administrative and clerical work associated with complaints brought under this section to current employees or may hire such additional employees as may be necessary to perform such work.\n   </em>\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 47} In other words, if the legislature had intended the private citizen to have special powers, qualification, duties or requirements they would have spelled those out in R.C. 505.38(A). They did not. Accordingly, the private citizen and the fire chief stand on equal ground when conducting an investigation. To accept Liberty Township's argument would lead to an incongruous and disparate result. The Township employs the fire chief. When the fire chief conducts an investigation into a firefighter's alleged misconduct the public records laws would apply; however, if a private citizen investigates the alleged misconduct of the fire chief the private citizen's investigation would be shielded from public scrutiny. Nothing in R.C. 505.38(A) or in R.C. 733.35 to 733.39 requires the private citizen be treated any differently than a fire chief when conducting an investigation pursuant to appointment. Nor can it be seen that the legislature intend the investigation of alleged misconduct of a fire chief be accorded more protection\n   than the investigation into the alleged misconduct of any other employee of the department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 48} The fire chief or the private citizen will prepare charges if the investigation concludes a firefighter or the fire chief have violated general or specific standards of conduct. R.C. 733.35. The charges written by the investigator must include detailed statements of alleged guilt, and those charges are then filed with the board and served upon the fire chief.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=943%20N.E.2d%20553\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Once the charges are filed, the charges must be heard at the next regular meeting of the board unless the fire chief seeks an extension of time. R.C. 733.36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Liberty Township Resolution 16-0321-11, which appointed Duckett, provides,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    Authorize Expenditure for Investigatory Review of Fire Department\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   WHEREAS, it is incumbent upon the Board of Trustees to ensure the Liberty Township Fire Department is managed and operating in the most effective and efficient manner, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees has the authority to conduct an investigation and/or review of the operations and management of the Fire Department to assist the Trustees and management in improving the operations and performance of the department, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   WHEREAS, the Trustees approved Resolution # 16-0307-04 which in part designated Laurie Worcester to complete this investigation and since that time Ms., Worcester is no longer able to perform these services and, therefore, another citizen has been selected to conduct this investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LIBERTY TOWNSHIP, DELAWARE COUNTY, OHIO to designate Douglas Duckett to investigate the conduct of Fire Chief Tim Jensen and prepare the necessary charges pursuant to Section 505\"38 of the Ohio Revised Code at a cost not to exceed $7,500.00, any additional expenditures to Mr. Duckett will be considered by the Board prior to the services being performed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Accordingly, Liberty Township recognizes that the statutory process for removing a fire chief from office is a function coming under its jurisdiction. Duckett was to \"file with the legislative authority, except when the removal of such head of department or officer is otherwise provided for, written charges against such person, setting forth in detail a statement of such alleged guilt and, at the same time, or as soon thereafter as possible, serve a true copy of such charges upon the person against whom they are made.\" R.C. 733.35. Because the Board of Trustees must hear the charges and conduct the hearing, an investigator is necessary. The investigator performs the function of the mayor of a municipal corporation under R.C. 733.35. The action remains one for the removal of a township employee governed by R.C. 733.35 to R.C. 733.39 and under the jurisdiction of the Board of Trustees. The investigation and preparation of charges is not a private function. The Board of Trustees must initiate the removal proceedings by appointing an investigator. There is no right provided for a private, third party to initiate the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Accordingly, the Board of Trustees was engaged in the performance of a governmental function when they appointed Duckett to conduct the investigation of the fire chief pursuant to R.C. 505.38(A).

In the case at bar, Duckett was hired to conduct an investigation. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether there were sufficient grounds to prepare charges for the removal of the fire chief. Without question, the provision and maintenance of the fire department is a public function undertaken by the Board of Trustees. The removal of the acting fire chief directly relates to the operation of the fire department, and can only be accomplished by the Board of Trustees. To that end, Duckett prepared his reports and interviews in order to carry out the Board's public responsibilities.

Later, the interviewers verbally compared responses from their notes and prepared a typewritten report of the interview; each interviewer subsequently destroyed their own handwritten notes.

Fox stated that the practice followed by the interviewers during the investigatory interviews with appellant, Roach, and Hasty was in accordance with SIU policy. Fox related that both interviewers took notes during the interviews, and that the interviewers subsequently \"talked and compared verbally\" in the course of preparing the typewritten report.

Rather, Liberty Township relies upon Duckett's billing statement as its sole support for its contention that Duckett's notes were for his personal convenience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   {\u00b6 74} Duckett's Billing Statement reveals that he prepared \"detailed outlines\" of his \"investigatory interview\" with the witnesses before he actually interviewed each witness. Thus, it cannot be said that all of the notes were created contemporaneously with the interviews to provide Duckett a means to refresh his memory. Further, Duckett revised his \"interview outline\" based upon the concerns of Trustee Leneghan. Thus, it appears Duckett reviewed his outlines with the Trustees and the Trustees had input into the content of the outlines. Duckett's billing statement further suggests the he \"debriefed with clients\" after conducting each investigatory interview. Thus, the record suggests that Duckett and the Board discussed each person's interview and how the interview related to the charges against Jensen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   {\u00b6 75} Thus, whether Duckett's notes did in their own right document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations or other activities of the Township is still in question based on the record before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   {\u00b6 76} In our disposition of Liberty Township's First Assignment of Error, we held that the relationship between Liberty Township and Duckett was sufficient to compel compliance with the public records law. Liberty Township does not cite any of the numerous exceptions set forth in R.C. 149.43 as grounds for not disclosing Duckett's notes. Instead, Liberty Township relies exclusively upon its contention that notes were taken only for Duckett's personal convenience. We find that this is the substantial equivalent of an \"exception\" to disclosure. Accordingly, Liberty Township bears the burden of proof on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   {\u00b6 77} \"[E]xceptions to disclosure must be strictly construed against the public records custodian, and the custodian bears the burden to establish the applicability of an exception.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.
