She began her employment with Defendant-Appellant DHS, LLC dba Affinity Medical Center in 1987. Affinity Medical Center is a hospital located in Massillon, Ohio. During Wayt's employment with Affinity, she received outstanding performance evaluations. An Affinity employee nominated Wayt for a nursing award called the \"CAMEOS of Caring Award,\" which Wayt won. Affinity featured Wayt's award in its advertising for the hospital. Before 2012, Wayt had never been disciplined for an employment infraction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In August 2012, Wayt was employed as a nurse in the Affinity orthopedic unit. Wayt's supervisors were Paula Zinsmeister, clinical manager of the orthopedic unit, and John McDonald, orthopedic and therapy services program director.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    The Unionization\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In 2012, Wayt and several nurses employed by Affinity began efforts to unionize the registered nurses. The union organizers argued unionization was necessary to improve patient care and safety at Affinity, and to establish guidelines for staff to patient ratios. Wayt was a vocal supporter of the union and was viewed by some as a leader in the drive for unionization. Wayt's photograph appeared in a pro-union poster displayed in the hospital. Both the hospital management and employees agreed the issue of unionization was a divisive issue in the hospital. Hospital management was generally not in favor of unionization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On August 29, 2012, the Affinity registered nurses voted in favor of unionization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    The Patient\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On August 28, 2012, an elderly patient with dementia was admitted to the hospital from the emergency room. The patient suffered from a broken hip. The emergency room contacted Beth Varner, the housing supervisor, to coordinate the transfer of the patient from the emergency room to the orthopedic unit. Varner spoke with Wayt about the patient and Wayt felt the patient needed a sitter. A sitter is a hospital employee that sits with a patient with special needs, such as dementia. The sitter is assigned for the patient's safety and to address the patient's needs, but the sitter does not take over the duties of the unit nurse. Varner spoke with Susan\n   Kress, director of critical care services and medical surgical services, and stated Wayt refused to take the report on the patient due to the sitter situation. On the week of August 28, 2012, Susan Kress was acting as Wayt's supervisor because Zinsmeister was on vacation. Kress did not support the unionization efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Kress arranged for a sitter for the patient, but another manager selected the sitters. The sitters were Rhonda Smith and Jonalee Lesjak, nurses from the cardiovascular unit. Smith and Lesjak did not agree with the need for unionization. The patient was admitted to the orthopedic unit between 9:15 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. Kress and a student nurse, Sam Burgett were present in the patient's room when the patient arrived. Kress left after 15 minutes without seeing Wayt. Smith arrived in the patient's room at approximately the same time the patient arrived. She began charting at 10:00 a.m. At about 11:00 or 11:15 a.m., Lesjak relieved Smith for a lunch break. At 12:00 p.m., Smith returned to the patient's room to relieve Lesjak. Smith went off-duty at 4:30 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} During the patient's stay at Affinity, the patient suffered no adverse events due to the care from Affinity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    The Investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On August 29, 2012, Smith reported to her manager that while she was in the patient's room, she did not observe Wayt conduct an hourly rounding on the patient that included a head to toe assessment. During a head to toe assessment, the nurse looks at the patient's skin, listens to the patient's heart, lungs, and bowel sounds, and palpates their pulses, abdomen, and legs. A nurse could complete a head to toe assessment in 15 minutes. The manager reported Smith's observation to Kress, who started an investigation into Smith's allegation. Smith told Kress that at around 10:00 a.m., Smith observed Wayt speak with the patient's family. At about 11:00 or 11:15 a.m., Lesjak relieved Smith for a lunch break. At 12:00 p.m., Smith returned to the patient's room to relieve Lesjak and Smith observed Wayt administer pain medication to the patient. At 2:00 p.m., Smith requested clean linens and personnel supplies for the patient, which Wayt brought to the room. Smith went off-duty at 4:30 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Kress reported Smith's allegations to John McDonald that Smith did not see Wayt conduct a head to toe assessment on the patient. On September 4, 2012, McDonald told Paula Zinsmeister there was an allegation that Smith did not see Wayt come into the patient's room to do a head to toe assessment. McDonald and Zinsmeister did not support the unionization efforts at Affinity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On September 5, 2012, Zinsmeister and McDonald told Wayt they were pulling the patient's chart to conduct an audit. The chart reflected Wayt completed a head to toe assessment on the patient on August 28, 2012 at 9:00 a.m. Zinsmeister spoke with Sam Burgett and he reported that he observed Wayt in the patient's room shortly after the patient arrived. No one had spoken to Lesjak at this stage of the investigation. Zinsmeister spoke with Angela Boyle, Human Resources Director for Affinity. On September 6, 2012, Boyle sent an email to the division human resources director stating there was an incident of falsification of a medical record by Wayt. The email read that Wayt documented she performed a head to toe assessment of the patient at 9:00 a.m., but the patient did not arrive on the floor until 9:15 a.m. and three witness stated Wayt never conducted a head to toe assessment or entered the patient's room until noon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    The September 13, 2012 Meeting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Zinsmeister informed Wayt they wanted to meet with her on September 13, 2012 to go over a safety issue with the\n   patient. The meeting was initially planned as a disciplinary proceeding, but was later changed to an investigatory meeting. Zinsmeister, McDonald, and Boyle attended the meeting representing Affinity. Also present at the meeting was Robert McKinney, a registered nurse at Affinity. He was present at the meeting as Wayt's union representative because Michelle Mohan, the national representative of the registered nurses' union could not be present. No one at the meeting told McKinney the matters discussed were confidential. Zinsmeister took notes at the meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} At the meeting, McDonald told Wayt there were four witnesses who would report that on August 28, 2012, Wayt never entered the patient's room from the time of the patient's admission to the orthopedic unit until 12:00 p.m. when she came into the room to give the patient pain medication. Wayt did not speak at the meeting. Due to Wayt's actions in charting that she had completed a head to toe assessment without completing one, Affinity suspended Wayt due to \"falsification of documentation\" and \"failure to comply with hospital policy.\" Wayt refused to sign the suspension notice but McKinney signed as the union representative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} McKinney spoke to hospital employees and Michelle Mohan about what occurred during the September 13, 2012 meeting. Wayt also discussed the meeting with Mohan. On September 19, 2012, Mahon sent a letter to Boyle disputing the allegations of falsification against Wayt. Wayt provided an account of her care of the patient on August 28, 2012. Wayt stated she rounded on the patient hourly, per hospital policy. At some time between 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., Wayt came to the patient's room and saw Lesjak in the room as the sitter. Lesjak asked Wayt if she could stay in the room while she went to the restroom. Wayt agreed and completed the head to toe assessment of the patient while Lesjak was in the restroom. Wayt recorded her head to toe assessment in the patient's chart but entered the wrong time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 15} After the September 13, 2012 meeting, Lesjak's account of August 28, 2012 was taken. At about 11:00 or 11:15 a.m., Lesjak relieved Smith for a lunch break. Between 11:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m., Lesjak observed Wayt come into the patient's room to install an IV pump. Lesjak stated she never left the patient's room while Smith was at lunch. At 12:00 p.m., Smith returned to the patient's room to relieve Lesjak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} After completing the investigation as to Wayt and the head to toe assessment, McDonald and Zinsmeister recommended that Wayt be terminated. On September 26, 2012, Affinity provided Wayt with a termination notice. After her termination, Wayt spoke with a local newspaper to give her account of the events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    The Ohio Board of Nursing Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 17} After Wayt's termination, Bill Osterman, chief nursing officer, sent a complaint regarding Wayt to the Ohio Board of Nursing for the Board to determine whether to revoke or suspend Wayt's nursing license. The complaint included a supplemental information form to be completed by the employer. The supplemental information form asked the employer to answer additional questions by checking the applicable box. In question # 23, the form asked, \"What happened to the patient? Check ALL that apply.\" In the box labeled, \"Other-please specify\", Osterman typed in \"Neglect [sic].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Osterman also attached supporting documentation to the complaint, which consisted of a packet of everything Affinity used in the investigation to support the allegations of falsification of the patient's records. The packet included the meeting notes written by Zinsmeister documenting\n   McDonald stated four witnesses reported Wayt was not in the patient's room from the time the patient was admitted until sometime around 12:00 p.m. Another item was a statement by Kress that she was informed Wayt refused a patient from the emergency room unless the patient had a sitter. The other relevant item in the packet was a verified timeline dated September 6, 2012 written by McDonald or Zinsmeister. The timeline stated Smith reported Wayt never came into the patient's room from 9:10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. except to give the patient pain medication at 12:00 p.m. Finally, included in the packet was a statement made by Smith on September 24, 2012 that Wayt came into the patient's room at 10:00 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Osterman was aware of the September 19, 2012 letter from Mohan, but did not include the letter in the packet to the Ohio Board of Nursing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    The Job Search\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 20} After Wayt's termination from her employment, she attempted to find a new job in the nursing field. She applied to 57 nursing positions and received two interviews. She informed potential employers she was terminated by Affinity due to union activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    The National Labor Relations Board\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 21} On September 26, 2012, the National Nurse Organization Committee filed a National Labor Relations Board (\"NLRB\") charge alleging Affinity engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act (\"NLRA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 22} On July 1, 2013, the NLRB entered its decision that Affinity violated certain sections of the NLRA by disciplining, terminating Wayt's employment, and reporting Wayt to the Ohio Board of Nursing. Affinity filed objections to the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 23} On July 16, 2013, the NLRB as petitioner filed a petition for injunctive relief pursuant to Section 10(j) of the NLRA with the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Petitioner requested Wayt be reinstated to her previous job at her previous wages and other terms or conditions of her employment. The NLRB's motion for injunctive relief was granted on January 24, 2014. The court ordered Affinity to allow Wayt to return to work and to retract the report it made to the Ohio Board of Nursing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    The Return to Affinity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Wayt returned to work at Affinity in February 2014. After Wayt's return to work, Mahon spoke with Boyle while in the presence of six nurses. Boyle told Mahon that just because there was a court order or just because Wayt was back at work did not mean Wayt deserved her job back or was a good nurse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    The Civil Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 25} On November 6, 2012, Wayt filed a civil action in the Stark County Court of Common Pleas against Affinity, McDonald, Smith, and Jane Does alleging claims of tortious interference with employment contract, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Wayt requested compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 26} On December 17, 2012, Affinity removed the action to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. On July 11, 2013, the District Court remanded the case back to the Stark County Court of Common Pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Affinity filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, a motion to stay the action on September 19, 2013. Affinity argued the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and Wayt failed to state a claim. Affinity contended federal law preempted Wayt's claims. On March 19,\n   2014, the trial court overruled Affinity's motion to dismiss/stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Wayt filed a second amended complaint to add a claim of spoliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Affinity filed a motion for summary judgment on December 1, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 30} On December 16, 2014, Wayt dismissed with prejudice her claims of tortious interference of contract and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Wayt also voluntarily dismissed McDonald and Smith as defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The trial court overruled Affinity's motion for summary judgment on January 16, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 32} On January 27, 2015, the matter proceeded to a jury trial on Wayt's claims of defamation and spoliation. The trial was bifurcated on the civil claims and punitive damages. At the conclusion of Wayt's case, Wayt dismissed her claim for spoliation. Wayt claimed Affinity defamed her and caused injury in three instances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   1. False statements made by McDonald in the presence of McKinney at the September 13, 2012 meeting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   2. Boyle's statement to Mohan in the presence of nurses that Wayt did not deserve her job back.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   3. False written statements made by Osterman and sent to the Ohio Board of Nursing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The jury came back with a general verdict in favor of Wayt. The jury awarded Wayt noneconomic compensatory damages in the amount of $800,000. The verdict was tested by interrogatories. The jury heard evidence on the issue of punitive damages and awarded Wayt $750,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    The Post-Trial Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 34} On February 10, 2015, Affinity filed a motion to apply applicable damages caps arguing the jury's award of noneconomic compensatory damages should be reduced to $250,000 and the punitive damages award should be reduced to $500,000 pursuant to statutory limits. Wayt responded that \"injury to reputation\" did not constitute a tort action subject to statutory damage caps. The trial court held an oral hearing on the parties' motions. On August 28, 2015, the trial court overruled the motion and found R.C. 2315.18 did not apply in defamation tort actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Affinity filed a motion for new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Affinity also filed a motion to vacate the judgment based on federal preemption. The trial court overruled the motions on April 25, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Wayt filed a motion for prejudgment interest, which the trial court denied on October 26, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 37} On November 22, 2016, Affinity filed a Notice of Appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Affinity raises ten Assignments of Error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 39} \"I.

At the time of Affinity's motion to dismiss, Wayt's civil claims were defamation, tortious interference with employment contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Only the claim of defamation went forward for trial. Affinity refers to Section 7 of the NLRA, which states that employees have the right to self-organization, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activity for mutual aid and protection. Section 8 of the NLRA makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their rights under Section 7.

The matter went to trial and the jury found in favor of the plaintiff, awarding compensatory damages and punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. The doctor defendant appealed the verdict and the trial court's decision to deny his motion for summary judgment as to fraudulent concealment and punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.

The court found the trial court erred when it failed to grant summary judgment and allowed the fraudulent concealment claim go to the jury, thereby prejudicing the malpractice claim by focusing on the alleged fraudulent concealment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court remanded the matter for a new trial on the plaintiff's medical malpractice claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b6 69} We do not find\n   <em>\n    Wargo\n   </em>\n   supports Affinity's argument that it is entitled to a new trial based on the admission of evidence of alleged unfair labor practices.

Wayt tried only a defamation claim, not two separate claims as in the\n   <em>\n    Wargo\n   </em>\n   case. Wayt did not pursue a wrongful termination claim, requesting lost wages or damages.

Wayt was required to prove with convincing clarity that Affinity was aware of the high probability of the falsity when it made the statements Wayt alleged were defamatory. There must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that Affinity in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of its publication. The evidence presented by Wayt as to the unfair labor dispute was relevant to show Affinity was aware of the high probability of the falsity of the statements Affinity made about Wayt's work performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   {\u00b6 74} There was no dispute in this case that before August 2012, Wayt had a superior employment record while she worked for Affinity. Wayt was nominated for and received a nursing award, which Affinity used in its advertisements. All parties agreed that Wayt was a vocal supporter of unionization. There was also no dispute of fact that that unionization was a contentious issue between staff and administration. On August 28, 2012, the patient was admitted under Wayt's care. On August 29, 2012, the Affinity registered nurses voted in favor of unionization. On August 29, 2012, Affinity began the investigation into Wayt's care for the patient. Early in the investigation, allegations were made that Wayt did not come into the patient's room from the time of her admission, approximately 9:30 a.m., to 4:30 p.m. At the September 13, 2012 meeting where Wayt was given a notice of suspension, Jason McDonald stated that four witnesses reported that Wayt was not in the room from the time the patient was admitted until sometime around 12:00 p.m. when she gave the patient pain medication. After the\n   September 13, 2012 meeting, Affinity continued its investigation and became aware that Wayt was with the patient at 10:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., and 2:00 p.m. On September 19, 2012, Wayt provided Affinity with her statement of what occurred on August 28, 2012, refuting the allegations. On September 26, 2012, Affinity terminated Wayt's employment. After Wayt's termination, Affinity sent a complaint to the Ohio Board of Nursing that included a knowingly false statement that Wayt was not in the patient's room from the time of the patient's admission to 4:30 p.m., when further investigation showed Wayt was indeed with the patient at 10:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., and 2:00 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   {\u00b6 75} Considering the totality of the circumstances of Wayt's exemplary performance evaluations, Wayt's unionization efforts, Affinity's faulty investigation, and the timing of Affinity's termination of Wayt coinciding with unionization, we find the issue of the labor dispute to be relevant to the issue of whether Affinity was aware of the high probability of falsity of the statements and as a motive for termination. The submission of the complaint to the Ohio Board of Nursing, that included statements proven false by Affinity's own investigation, could permit the jury to conclude that Affinity in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of its publication. We find no abuse of discretion because the evidence was relevant to the issue of actual malice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   {\u00b6 76} Affinity's third Assignment of Error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Admission of Wayt's Testimony-Employment Opportunities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   {\u00b6 77} Affinity argues in its fourth Assignment of Error that the trial court abused its discretion by denying its motion in limine to allow Wayt testify about her lost job opportunities and job applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b6 78} Affinity filed a pre-trial motion in limine to preclude Wayt from presenting testimony that she was denied employment opportunities or referring to potential employer's comments. Affinity argued Wayt had no evidence the alleged defamatory statements made by Affinity had any impact on her inability to find employment. (T. 8). Allowing Wayt to testify to that would require the jury to speculate that Wayt did not receive a job offer because of the alleged defamatory statements. (T. 9). Affinity argued Wayt told her potential employers that she was terminated because of her union activity. (T. 8). The trial court ruled Wayt could present evidence of her efforts to secure other employment. (T. 7). The trial court, however, would not permit Wayt to present hearsay evidence as to what potential employers said to her. (T. 7). The trial court found that if Wayt presented evidence that she sent out multiple applications to secure other employment, it could be circumstantial evidence for the jury to make a reasonable inference why Wayt did not receive a job offer. (T. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   {\u00b6 79} Before Wayt's testimony on direct, Affinity renewed its motion as limine as to Wayt's job applications. (T. 1637). The trial court took the matter under consideration. Wayt testified after her termination from Affinity, she submitted 57 job applications to different employers. (T. 1684). She only submitted applications to positions with job openings. (T. 1684). She received two interviews, but no job offers. (T. 1684-1685). On cross-examination, Wayt testified that all the job applications asked the reason for her termination. (T. 1738). Wayt indicated she was terminated for union activity. (T. 1738).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   {\u00b6 80} Affinity also raised the argument its motion for new trial. The trial court stated in its April 25, 2016 judgment entry denying Affinity's motion for new trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   The Court concludes that Plaintiff's failed attempts to regain employment\n   were probative, and that the concerns Defendant addresses go to the weight to be given the evidence, not the admissibility. It was well within the jury's providence to determine what weight, if any, to assign to the fact that Plaintiff unsuccessfully sought other employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   {\u00b6 81} Affinity argues on appeal that Wayt's testimony as to her lost job opportunities left the jury to speculate as to why Wayt was not offered a job. We agree with the trial court's conclusion that Wayt's testimony that she applied for jobs after her termination and did not receive any job offers goes to the weight of the evidence, not admissibility. Affinity had the opportunity to cross-examine Wayt as to her knowledge of why she did not receive any job offers. The trial court previously ruled that any hearsay testimony about what a potential employer told her was inadmissible. Wayt testified on cross-examination that she stated on her job applications that she was terminated because of her union activity. It was the jury's role to weigh the evidence presented in Wayt's direct examination and cross-examination as to why Wayt did not receive any job offers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   {\u00b6 82} Affinity's fourth Assignment of Error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Admission of Evidence-Section 10(j) Injunctive Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   {\u00b6 83} In Affinity's fifth Assignment of Error, Affinity contends the trial court abused its discretion when it allowed Wayt to present evidence regarding the U.S. District Court's judgment entry granting injunctive relief pursuant to Section 10(j). The Section 10(j) decision ordered Affinity to allow Wayt to return to her prior employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   {\u00b6 84} Affinity initially filed a motion in limine regarding the Section 10(j) order. At the start of trial. The trial court found the Section 10(j) order was relevant to explain Wayt's return to work and Affinity's withdrawal of its complaint to the Ohio Board of Nursing. (T. 12). It further found the Section 10(j) order went to the issue of actual malice. (T. 12). While the effect of the Section 10(j) order was relevant, the trial court ruled it was not appropriate for the jury to see the entire decision issued by the U.S. District Court. (T. 12). The trial court stated it would give a limiting instruction to the jury that it would not see the whole judgment entry and the Section 10(j) order was not a final decision on the merits of Wayt's unfair labor practices claim before the NLRB, but a preliminary injunctive type of relief. (T. 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   {\u00b6 85} During Wayt's opening statement, her counsel told the jury that it would hear evidence that Wayt was back at work at Affinity because of a court order. (T. 192). Affinity objected and moved for a mistrial. (T. 192-193). The trial court overruled Affinity's objection and gave a curative instruction to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Zimmerman made a statement that the reason Ann was reinstated at Affinity was due to a court order. You are instructed that that is only by way of explanation, that that was a preliminary proceeding and that the issues in that case have not been ultimately resolved. It is only for the purpose of you understanding that she is now working back at Affinity. That the issues concerning whether or not she was terminated appropriately or not is not an issue in this case and there has not been a final disposition regarding that in the other case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   (T. 194-195).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   {\u00b6 86} During Angela Boyle's cross-examination, counsel for Wayt asked if Wayt received another paycheck until she was ordered back to Affinity. (T. 1056). Affinity objected on the basis that the question violated the trial court's ruling on the motion in limine that Wayt was ordered back to work. (T. 1056). Affinity contended the\n   question gave the jury the impression that Wayt's termination was improper and she was ordered back to work. (T. 1057). The trial court sustained the objection on the grounds of relevancy because Wayt did not claim wrongful termination. (T. 1057). The trial court gave a curative instruction to the jury to reiterate that Wayt returned to work at Affinity because of another court's preliminary order. The preliminary order was not dispositive of whether or not she was terminated for cause. (T. 1060).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   {\u00b6 87} Affinity contends evidence regarding the Section 10(j) order was irrelevant and inadmissible. Relevant evidence is \"evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Evid.R. 401.

We first find the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it found the Section 10(j) order was relevant and admissible to explain why Wayt was working at Affinity after her termination. Without that information, the jury would have been free to speculate why Affinity would terminate Wayt for the reasons it listed to then allow her to return to work, especially in light of her claim of defamation. Such speculation could have been harmful to either Affinity or Wayt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   {\u00b6 89} Further, the Section 10(j) order was relevant to Wayt's claim of defamation. Wayt claimed Angela Boyle made a defamatory statement about Wayt after she returned to work. Wayt returned to work at Affinity in February 2014. After Wayt's return to work, Mahon spoke with Boyle while in the presence of six nurses.

In the fifth Assignment of Error, we affirmed the trial court's admission of such evidence. The trial court next reviewed the trial transcript and did not agree with Affinity's characterization that Wayt requested the jury send a message to union supporters or that Paula Zinsmeister was not being fair to the jury. We have thoroughly reviewed the transcript and agree with the trial court's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   {\u00b6 112} Affinity next argued Wayt improperly used depositions to impeach witnesses. The trial court found, and we concur, that the trial court sustained Affinity's objections when Wayt made references to deposition testimony without proper impeachment. The trial court noted that in reference to other instances where Affinity alleged attorney misconduct, the trial court sustained Affinity's objections to said misconduct. The trial court instructed the jury at the start of trial that if the trial court sustains an objection, the jury was not permitted to speculate about what the answer would have been or why the objection was sustained. The \"presumption always exists that the jury has followed the instructions given to it by the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Peters v. Rock-Tenn Co.\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist.

First, it addressed the September 13, 2012 meeting. Affinity stated Wayt's defamation claim based on the September 13, 2012 meeting was entirely reliant upon the presence of Robert McKinney, Wayt's union representative. It was allegedly McKinney who relayed the information published to him at the meeting to other hospital staff and community. At trial, however, McKinney testified he could not remember everything that was said at the\n   September 13, 2012 meeting or what he said about the September 13, 2012 meeting to others. (T. 1332). McKinney testified he spoke with hospital employees and Michelle Mohan after the September 13, 2012 meeting. (T. 1338-1339).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   {\u00b6 117} In its motion denying the motion for new trial, the trial court found that while McKinney could not remember what statements he made, there was circumstantial evidence to support the jury's conclusion that McKinney published defamatory statements. Michelle Mohan testified she spoke with McKinney after the September 13, 2012 meeting. (T. 1405). Other hospital employees heard gossip in the hospital about Wayt's suspension. The trial court further found defamation occurred when Affinity published false statements in the presence of McKinney during the September 13, 2012 meeting. In so finding, the trial court cited to the Ohio Supreme Court's ruling\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hecht v.

After Wayt's return to work, Mahon spoke with Boyle while in the presence of six nurses. Boyle told Mahon that just because there was an order or just because Wayt was back at work did not mean Wayt deserved her job back or was a good nurse. Affinity argued in its motion for new trial and on appeal that the statement was not presented until the seventh day of trial and the statement was not defamatory as a matter of law. In its motion for new trial, Affinity did not cite to any case law to support its argument the statement was not defamatory. Its appellate argument is likewise conclusory. Affinity discussed the matter more thoroughly in its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and the trial court ruled on the matter in its judgment entry denying the JNOV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   {\u00b6 120} Finally, Affinity argued its reporting of the investigation to the Board of Nursing was proper and not defamatory. Bill Osterman testified he sent all information obtained by Affinity during the investigation to the Board for the Board to take into consideration. There was no testimony as to the process the Board of Nursing uses to determine whether to revoke or suspend a nursing license. The information sent to the Board of Nursing included a knowingly false statement that Wayt was not in the patient's room from the time of the patient's admission to 4:30 p.m., when in fact further investigation showed Wayt was with the patient at 10:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., and 2:00 p.m. The inclusion of false information supported the jury's conclusion that Affinity was not entitled to immunity\n   for reporting to the Board of Nursing due to fraud or bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   {\u00b6 121} The trial court did not abuse its discretion to find the jury's verdict in favor of Wayt was supported by the weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   <em>\n    Excessive Verdict\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   {\u00b6 122} Affinity also asked for a new trial pursuant to Civ.R. 59(A)(4). This section provides that a new trial may be granted on the following grounds: \"(4) Excessive or inadequate damages, appearing to have been given under the influence of passion or prejudice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   {\u00b6 123} An appellate court reviewing whether a trial court abused its discretion in ruling on a motion for a new trial pursuant to Civ.R. 59(A)(4) must consider (1) the amount of the verdict, and (2) whether the jury considered improper evidence, improper argument by counsel, or other inappropriate conduct which had an influence on the jury.\n   <em>\n    Jeffrey Allen Industries, L.L.C. v.

And, that they don't, that they-that means anything at all.\" (T. 1441). Affinity did not object to Mohan's testimony. The statement made by Angela Boyle and testified to by Mohan was one of the defamatory statements Wayt claimed to have caused her injury.

This case arose from Affinity employees' statements as they related to Plaintiff. Throughout Plaintiff's career with Affinity she was recognized as an outstanding nurse; was the recipient of multiple awards; had never once been disciplined; and was featured by Affinity in its advertising.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   In 2012 Plaintiff and several nurses employed by Affinity began efforts to unionize the nurses for the purpose of improving patient care and safety and to establish guidelines for staff to patient ratios. As a result of her lengthy and outstanding nursing career, Plaintiff was viewed by some as a leader in the drive for union recognition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Plaintiff alleged that in 2012, in retaliation for her open support of unionization, a number of Affinity employees accused her of patient neglect, falsification of medical records, substandard work, failing to comply with hospital policy, and violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Plaintiff asserted that the Affinity employees knew that the aforementioned charges were false. Affinity employees also reported the aforementioned charges to the Ohio Board of Nursing, subjecting the Plaintiff to investigation, discipline, the possible loss of her license, and even potential criminal charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   Plaintiff filed the present case against several Affinity employees as well as Affinity.

Plaintiff has asserted that the statutory damage caps do not apply in the present matter due to the Ohio Legislature specifically and repeatedly limiting the damage caps only to \"civil actions for damages for injury or loss to person or property\" and not civil actions for injury to reputation, such as Plaintiff's defamation claim. Plaintiff has also asserted that the Ohio Constitution and the Ohio Supreme Court have always separately distinguished injuries to \"person\", \"property\", or \"reputation\" and have acknowledged that injury to \"reputation\" stands alone and is not part of an injury to person or property. Consequently, Plaintiff asserts that the legislative failure to include \"injury to reputation\" in the damage cap statutes dictates that an award of damages for the separate and distinct injury to reputation is not subject to the statutory damage caps set forth in R.C. 2315.18 and R.C. 2315.21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    R.C. 2315.18(B)-Noneconomic Damages Cap\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   To determine the applicability of R.C. 2315.18 to actions for injury to reputation such as Plaintiff's defamation claim this Court must interpret R.C. 2315.18.

In applying the rules of statutory construction this Court first looks at the plain language of the statute in which a \"tort action\" is specifically limited to \"a civil action for damages for injury or loss to person or property.\" R.C. 2315.18(A)(7). The plain language of the statute repeatedly indicates that the statute does not apply to \"all\" tort actions, but rather is limited to those tort actions where the damages sought to be recovered are \"damages for injury or loss to person or property\". R.C. 2315.18. The plain language found in section (G) which limits reallocation of compensatory damages \"[w]ith respect to a tort action to which division (B)(2) of this section applies...\" is another example of the legislative intent to limit applicability of the statute to only certain tort actions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If the statute applied to \"all\" torts the legislature would not have limited section (G) to those \"tort actions to which division (B)(2) applied\".\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plain language of the statute makes it clear that the statute does not apply to \"all\" tort actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   Further, the language of R.C. 2315.18 specifically delineates certain actions that are and are not affected. Defamation actions are not specifically included in the statute's list of actions to which it applies but are also not specifically excluded. In applying the rules of statutory construction, a court cannot delete words used or insert words not used. Therefore, based upon the fact that the legislature specifically excluded certain actions and included certain actions, this Court cannot now insert an action for defamation, when clearly the legislature could have done\n   so when the statute was drafted had it intended to include defamation. The legislative intent based upon the plain language of R.C. 2315.18 was that the statute was not to be applied in defamation tort actions.

Therefore, based upon the definition of occurrence in the statute which fails to reference injury to a person's reputation and the statutory language that caps damages \"for each occurrence,\" it is evident that defamation damages were not intended by the legislature to be included in the statutory damages cap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     iii. Injuries Arising From R.C. 2315.18 Excluded Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   As previously discussed, the statutory language of R.C. 2315.18(A)(7) defines a \"tort action\" as \"a civil action for damages for injury or loss to person or property.\" To further clarify actions to which R.C. 2315.18 applies, the legislature included language setting forth specific actions \"included\" and \"excluded\". R.C. 2315.18(A)(7) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-287\">\n   `Tort Action' includes a civil action upon a product liability claim or an asbestos claim. `Tort Action' does not include a civil action upon a medical claim, dental claim, optometric claim, or chiropractic claim or a civil action for damages for a breach of contract or another agreement between persons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   Additional actions excluded from the statute's application are set forth in section H of R.C. 2315.18, which states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   This section does not apply to any of the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-290\">\n   (1) Tort actions that are brought against the state in the court of claims, including, but not limited to, those actions in which a state university or college is a defendant and to which division (B)(3) of section 3345.40 of the Revised Code applies;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-291\">\n   (2) Tort actions that are brought against political subdivisions of this state and that are commenced under or are subject to Chapter 2744. of the Revised Code. Division (C) of section 2744.05 of the Revised Code applies to recoverable damages in those actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-292\">\n   (3) Wrongful death actions brought pursuant to Chapter 2125.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   All of the actions that the legislature specifically included or excluded in R.C. 2315.18 contemplate damages for \"injury or loss to person or property\". For example, products liability and asbestos claims involve damages for injury or loss to person, (i.e. bodily injury) or injury or loss to property (i.e. land or goods). However, the aforementioned claims are addressed in other statutes, necessitating language reflective of the legislative intent that the damages cap set forth in R.C. 2315.18 was applicable to said claims. Additionally, medical, dental, optometric, or chiropractic claims all involve damages for injury or loss to person (i.e. bodily injury). Since the damages cap would otherwise apply to the aforementioned claims based upon the plain language of R.C. 2315.18, it was necessary for the legislature to specifically exclude them from the statute's application to avoid conflict with other statutes that address damages for those claims. Further, actions for damages for a breach of contract or another agreement between persons typically arise from injury or loss to property (i.e. injury or loss to lands or goods). Therefore, similar to the above examples, it was necessary for the legislature to specifically exclude them\n   from the statute's application. Finally, the excluded tort actions found under R.C. 2315.18(H) result in damages for injury or loss to person or property and therefore the legislature had to make clear its intent that the damages cap not apply to said actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   As previously stated, absent from the delineated actions to which the statute does and does not apply are defamation actions. It was not necessary for the legislature to specifically include or exclude defamation actions because the plain language of the statute already makes clear that it is not applicable to damages for injury to reputation as opposed to injury to person or property. Therefore it is clear that the legislative intent was that R.C. 2315.18 not apply to cap damages awarded in defamation claims and this Court finds the jury's compensatory damages award of $800,000.00 shall stand undisturbed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   <strong>\n    c.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Defamation Damages Presumed\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   Further evidence that noneconomic damages awarded in a defamation claim are not to be capped pursuant to R.C. 2315.18 exists in the standard of proof necessary for a finder of fact to award damages in a defamation claim.

No. 80, Section 3(A)(6), 2004 Ohio Laws File 144. In issuing its findings and intent regarding noneconomic damages the General Assembly stated the following in Section 3(A)(6):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-299\">\n   (a) ... Pain and suffering awards are intended to compensate a person for the person's loss. They are not intended to punish a defendant for wrongful conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-300\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-301\">\n   (c) With respect to noneconomic loss for either: (1) permanent and substantial physical deformity, loss of use of a limb, or loss of a bodily organ system; or (2) permanent physical functional injury that permanently prevents the injured person from being able to independently care for self and perform life-sustaining activities, the General Assembly recognizes that evidence that juries may consider in awarding pain and suffering damages for these types of injuries is different from evidence courts may consider for punitive damages. For example, the amount of a plaintiff's pain and suffering is not relevant to a decision on wrongdoing, and the degree of the defendant's wrongdoing is not relevant to the amount of pain and suffering.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-302\">\n   (d) While pain and suffering awards are inherently subjective, it is believed that this inflation of noneconomic damages is partially due to the improper consideration of evidence of wrongdoing in assessing pain and suffering damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-303\">\n   (e) Inflated damage awards create an improper resolution of civil justice claims. The increased and improper cost of litigation and resulting rise in insurance premiums is passed on to the general public through higher prices for products and services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-304\">\n   (f) Therefore, with respect to the types of injuries articulated in division (A)(6)(c) of this section, the General Assembly finds that courts should provide juries with clear instructions about the purpose of pain and suffering damages. Courts should instruct juries that evidence of misconduct is not to be considered in deciding compensation for noneconomic damages for those types of injuries. Rather, it is to be considered solely for the purpose of deciding punitive damage awards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   Contrary to both the language of R.C. 2315.18(C) and the legislative intent, the Restatement Law 2d, which is quoted in the Ohio Jury Instructions states \"The tort law of libel and slander has been conceived as of serving three separate functions: * * * 2) to vindicate [the plaintiff] and aid in restoring his reputation and 3) to punish the defendant and dissuade him and others from publishing defamatory statements.\" Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts, unnumbered section entitled \"Special Note on Remedies for Defamation (Other Than Damages)\" following Section 623, at 326 (1977). Pursuant to the Ohio Jury Instructions and based upon the agreement of counsel for the parties herein this Court instructed the jury as follows: \"You must put aside all passion, prejudice, personal dislikes, hatred or anger. You\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   take into consideration\n   <em>\n    all facts and circumstances in evidence\n   </em>\n   to decide the amount of these damages.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Ohio Jury Instructions,\n   </em>\n   CV 431.07(2)(B) (Rev. 9-13-03). There was no request for a jury instruction restricting what the jury could consider in awarding compensatory damages for noneconomic loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   In defamation cases, the finders of facts have the ability to award damages based upon vindicating the plaintiff, punishing the defendant and dissuading the defendant and others from publishing defamatory statements. This ability under the law is in direct contravention to both the language in R.C. 2918(C) setting forth what a finder of fact cannot use to determine\n   noneconomic damages and the legislative intent clearly expressed in Section 3 of S.B. 80. Therefore it is clear that the legislative intent was that R.C. 2315.18 not apply to cap damages awarded in defamation claims and this Court finds the jury's compensatory damages award of $800,000.00 shall stand undisturbed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Separate Occurrences\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   R.C. 2315.18(B)(2) limits noneconomic damages \"for each occurrence that is the basis of that tort action.\" In\n   <em>\n    Simpkins v.

In\n   <em>\n    Simpkins\n   </em>\n   the plaintiff argued that \"the trial court erred in finding that she suffered a single \"injury or loss\" for purposes of R.C. 2315.18 because she suffered two distinct occurrences.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 92. It was also argued in\n   <em>\n    Simpkins\n   </em>\n   that despite the constitutionality of Ohio's damage cap statute, \"the trial court erred when it applied the cap to two separate `occurrences' because it violates her rights under the `open courts' and `right to a remedy' provision of the Ohio Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 94. Finally, the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Simpkins\n   </em>\n   asserted that the\n   <em>\n    Arbino\n   </em>\n   court upheld the constitutionality of the statute because R.C. 2315.18 operates as a limitation on damages not a complete denial of a remedy to an injured person.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Fifth District found that the plaintiff's \"argument assumes that she sustained two separate incidents and is not compensated for one of them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 95. The Fifth District also found that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-309\">\n   the oral and vaginal penetration in this case occurred within a short period of time, in a confined geographic space, and without any intervening factors. The testimony of Smalldon supports the position that there is one indivisible injury as he testified that Simpkins' post-traumatic stress disorder is the direct result of the incident with Williams and he does not distinguish between the two actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 93. Ultimately, the Fifth District held that there was \"a single course of wrongful conduct at the same time and place and there is no evidence Simpkins suffered separate, different, or additional damage from any separate part of the sexual assault. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in determining a single cap applied for purposes of R.C. 2315.18.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 95-96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-311\">\n   In the present action there are clearly separate occurrences of defamation that took place. This is demonstrated by the separate interrogatories (requested by the defendant) for each separate statement made by the defendant, which tested each occurrence of defamation. Further, each occurrence of defamation took place in a different setting and was made to a different individual(s) or entity (i.e. the Ohio Nursing Board). The instant case is therefore distinguishable from the\n   <em>\n    Simpkins\n   </em>\n   case in which there was only one setting and the alleged separate incidents occurred only a minute or so apart. Separate occurrences of defamation are also shown by the jury award of $800,000 which if divided by the number of defamatory statements equals $200,000 in damages awarded per statement or \"occurrence\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-312\">\n   Based upon there being separate occurrences of defamation that took place in the present action this Court finds that even if it is later determined that R.C. 2315.18 does apply to defamation claims, the damage cap is not applicable in the present action. Therefore, this Court finds the jury's compensatory damages award of $800,000.00 shall stand undisturbed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    R.C. 2315.21(D)-Punitive Damages Cap\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   Affinity has requested that this Court reduce the jury's punitive damage award from $750,000.00 to $500,000.00 pursuant to R.C. 2315.21(D), the amount that is two times the amount of the requested capped compensatory damages awarded to Plaintiff. Plaintiff disputes Affinity's calculation of the capped punitive-damages and has asserted that R.C. 2315.21 is not applicable to the jury's punitive damage award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   In applying the rules of statutory interpretation as previously set forth and for the reasons stated above, this Court finds R.C. 2315.21 is not applicable in the present action and thus the jury's punitive damage award shall not be reduced. However, if R.C. 2315.21 is later determined to be applicable and if R.C. 2315.18 does limit Plaintiff's noneconomic damages to $250,000.00 despite the jury's determination that Plaintiff sustained compensatory injuries of $800,000.00, the difference between Plaintiff's capped and uncapped compensatory damages drastically affects the punitive damages calculation. Therefore this Court must interpret whether the legislature intended courts to apply the punitive damages cap upon the plaintiff's capped or uncapped compensatory damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   R.C. 2315.21 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-317\">\n   (D)(1) In a tort action, the trier of fact shall determine the liability of any defendant for punitive or exemplary damages and the amount of those damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-318\">\n   (2) * * * all of the following apply regarding any award of punitive or exemplary damages in a tort action:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-319\">\n   (a) The court shall not enter judgment for punitive or exemplary damages in excess of two times the amount of the compensatory damages awarded to the plaintiff from that defendant, as determined pursuant to division (B)(2) or (3) of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2315.21(D).

Those statutory provisions refer to the uncapped, total compensatory damages the jury awarded. Both R.C. \u00a7 2315.21(B)(2) and (3) direct the trier of fact to make factual findings that specify the total compensatory damages to be awarded to the plaintiff from each defendant. R.C. 2315.21(B)(2) and (3) make no reference to statutory caps on damage awards, and R.C. \u00a7 2315.18(F)(2) precludes the trial court from informing the jury of the existence of statutory caps. The court applies statutory caps on compensatory damages only after the jury has rendered its verdict and made an award of compensatory damages in the case. See R.C. 2315.18(E)(1).

Additionally, the language of R.C. 2315.18(F)(2) provides that \"the court shall not instruct the jury with respect to the limit on compensatory damages for noneconomic loss described in [R.C. 2315.18(B)(2)], and neither counsel for any party nor a witness shall inform the jury or potential jurors of that limit.\" To give effect to both R.C. 2315.18 and R.C. 2315.21 it is necessary to read them in pari materia. In so doing and in accordance with the Tenth and First District decisions, this Court finds that based upon the legislature's explicit indication that a jury cannot be instructed regarding the existence of statutory caps on compensatory damages in R.C. 2915.18, and based upon R.C. 2315.21 not referencing the cap on compensatory damages, the punitive damages cap should be applied to the uncapped compensatory damages award.

However, even if R.C. 2315.21 does apply, for all of the aforementioned reasons, this Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages from Affinity in the amount of two times\n   the total, uncapped compensatory damages awarded to Plaintiff. In the present action the jury awarded Plaintiff $800,000.00 in compensatory damages. Thus Plaintiff was entitled to a potential punitive damages award of $1,600,000.00. The actual punitive damages awarded to Plaintiff by the jury was $750,000.00, substantially less than two times the total, uncapped compensatory damages awarded to Plaintiff. Therefore, this Court finds Affinity's Motion to Apply Applicable Damage Caps to reduce the punitive damages award not well taken and the jury's punitive damages award of $750,000.00 shall stand undisturbed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   Based on the aforementioned reasons this Court finds the statutory caps on compensatory/noneconomic and punitive damages as set forth in R.C. 2315.18 and R.C. 2315.21 do not apply in the present action as a matter of law and therefore\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED\n   </strong>\n   that Affinity's Motion to Apply Applicable Damage Caps is hereby\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n   The jury award of $800,000.00 in compensatory damages and $750,000.00 in punitive damages shall stand undisturbed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   <strong>\n    HON.
