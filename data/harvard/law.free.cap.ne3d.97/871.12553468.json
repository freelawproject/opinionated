Because we determine that the officer who initiated the traffic stop of Kirkpatrick's vehicle for an improper turn made a reasonable mistake of law, the trial court properly denied Kirkpatrick's motion to suppress; therefore, we affirm Kirkpatrick's OVI conviction. As to Kirkpatrick's improper-turn offense, we determine that the trial court erred in finding Kirkpatrick guilty, and we reverse the trial court's judgment on that charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On May 26, 2016, at approximately 2 a.m., a Cincinnati police officer noticed a Honda Civic \"driving significantly faster\" than the posted speed limit. The officer watched the vehicle approach an intersection, stop, and then continue again, still well over the posted speed limit. The officer witnessed the vehicle stop at a red light, and when the light changed to green, the vehicle turned left into the outside right lane, instead of the nearest inside lane closest to the center line. At that point, the officer believed a traffic violation had occurred, and the officer initiated a traffic stop. The officer eventually administered field-sobriety testing to the driver, Kirkpatrick, and arrested her for OVI. At the police station, Kirkpatrick submitted to a breath-alcohol test. As a result, the state charged Kirkpatrick with OVI under R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) and 4511.19(A)(1)(d), as well as making an improper turn under R.C. 4511.36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Kirkpatrick filed a motion to suppress the evidence against her. In the motion, she argued, in part, that the officer lacked probable cause to stop her for an illegal left turn under R.C. 4511.36, because the statute had been found ambiguous by this court in\n   <em>\n    State v. Stadelmann\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist.

The trial court overruled Kirkpatrick's motion to\n   suppress, and she pleaded no contest to all three charges. The trial court found Kirkpatrick guilty of all offenses, but for purposes of sentencing, the trial court merged the OVI offense under R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) with the offense under R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(d). The trial court sentenced Kirkpatrick to 180 days in jail, with 170 days suspended, a $525 fine, and six months of community control. The trial court stayed Kirkpatrick's sentence pending appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Motion to Suppress under the Fourth Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In her first assignment of error, Kirkpatrick argues that the trial court erred in denying her motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} This court reviews a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress as a mixed question of law and fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Hamilton No. C-130138,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-5035\">\n    2013-Ohio-5035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206054748\">\n    2013 WL 6054748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The facts of\n   <em>\n    Stadelmann\n   </em>\n   are similar to the case at bar. In\n   <em>\n    Stadelmann\n   </em>\n   , a police officer initiated a traffic stop of a vehicle after the officer witnessed the driver of the vehicle make a wide left turn, turning into the far, right lane, instead of the lane closest to the center line. The officer believed that the driver had violated R.C. 4511.36(A)(2). R.C. 4511.36(A)(2) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   At any intersection where traffic is permitted to move in both directions on each roadway entering the intersection, an approach for a left turn shall be made in that portion of the right half of the roadway nearest the center line thereof and by passing to the right of such center line where it enters the intersection and after entering the intersection the left turn shall be made so as to leave the intersection to the right of the center line of the roadway being entered. Whenever practicable the left turn shall be made in that portion of the intersection to the left of the center of the intersection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} After stopping the vehicle, the police officer eventually arrested the driver for OVI. The defendant-driver filed a motion to suppress, arguing that he had made a legal left-hand turn, and therefore the officer acted unreasonably in initiating the traffic stop. The trial court overruled the\n   defendant's motion to suppress and found the defendant guilty of OVI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Stadelmann\n   </em>\n   appealed the denial of his motion to suppress, arguing that his actions did not violate R.C. 4511.36(A)(2). A majority of this court determined that R.C. 4511.36(A)(2) could be interpreted two ways: \"First, and more likely, it means that a driver must turn into the lane closest to the center line when making a left turn onto a two-way street. * * * Alternatively, the statute could simply mean that one must complete the turn without driving left-of-center-i.e. into oncoming traffic.\"\n   <em>\n    Stadelmann\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. The majority opined that the second reading \"seems less likely\" given other portions of the Revised Code and the\n   <em>\n    Digest of Ohio Motor Vehicle Laws\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3, 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Ultimately, the\n   <em>\n    Stadelmann\n   </em>\n   majority held that its resolution of the defendant's appeal did not depend upon an interpretation of R.C. 4511.36(A)(2), but upon whether the officer reasonably believed that the defendant had violated R.C. 4511.36(A)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stadelmann\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4, quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

The majority determined that the officer had had an objectively reasonable belief that the defendant had violated R.C. 4511.36(A)(2) by turning left into the far, outside lane, instead of the lane nearest the center line, because \"the language of the statute lends itself to that interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    Stadelmann\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. Therefore, the majority affirmed the denial of the defendant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Former Judge, now Ohio Supreme Court Justice Patrick DeWine dissented in\n   <em>\n    Stadelmann\n   </em>\n   , stating that R.C. 4511.36(A)(2) was clear and unambiguous:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   It simply requires the driver 'square into the turn,' as we are all taught in drivers' education class. The driver must proceed through the intersection and across the center line before turning left. The statute says nothing about whether the driver must make the turn into the right or left side of the right lane. Under the plain language of the statute, a turn into either side is perfectly legal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Stadelmann\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Kirkpatrick argues that once a statute has been found ambiguous by a court, as in\n   <em>\n    Stadelmann\n   </em>\n   , an officer can no longer reasonably rely on that statute in initiating a traffic stop. In support of this argument, Kirkpatrick relies on the rule of lenity, which provides that ambiguous criminal statutes must be construed against the state and in favor of the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2901.04(A) (\"sections of the Revised Code defining offenses or penalties shall be strictly construed against the state, and liberally construed in favor of the accused\");\n   <em>\n    State v.

Lester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4115880\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/130/303/\">\n    130 Ohio St.3d 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011-Ohio-5204\">\n    2011-Ohio-5204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=958%20N.E.2d%20142\">\n    958 N.E.2d 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , paragraph one of the syllabus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 17} As to the merits of Kirkpatrick's second assignment of error, we agree that the trial court erred in finding Kirkpatrick guilty under R.C. 4511.36. As we stated in the disposition of Kirkpatrick's first assignment of error, R.C. 4511.36(A)(2) does not prohibit Kirkpatrick's conduct in this case, namely making a left turn into the far, outside lane, instead of the inside, right lane. Therefore, the trial court's finding of guilt constitutes plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crim.R. 52(B). We sustain Kirkpatrick's second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In conclusion, we affirm the judgment of the trial court convicting Kirkpatrick of OVI under R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(d). We dismiss the appeal from the trial court's judgment finding Kirkpatrick\n   guilty of OVI under R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a), because the trial court merged that offense, and therefore Kirkpatrick was never convicted of that offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crim.R. 32(C) ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Whitfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4093160\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/124/319/\">\n    124 Ohio St.3d 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-2\">\n    2010-Ohio-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=922%20N.E.2d%20182\">\n    922 N.E.2d 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24. Finally, we reverse the judgment of the trial court with respect to Kirkpatrick's conviction under R.C. 4511.36, and Kirkpatrick is discharged from further prosecution in that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Judgment accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Zayas, P.J., and Myers, J., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
