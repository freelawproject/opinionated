Specifically at issue were regulations that \"(1) mandate[d] that parties not meeting the five percent vote threshold in the previous election file a petition 120 days in advance of the primary election in order to qualify; and (2) require[d] that parties participate in the March primary in order to appear on the general election ballot.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3465038\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/462/579/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3465038\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/462/579/\">\n    at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court found the combination of requirements and their resultant impact on LPO's ability to appear on the general election ballot severely burdened LPO's rights. In so finding, the court observed that LPO \"needed to find more than thirty thousand Ohio residents to sign its petition to appear on the 2004 ballot more than one year in advance of the election,\" a requirement that forced \"minor political parties to recruit supporters at a time when the major party candidates are not known and when the populace is not politically energized.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3465038\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/462/579/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court also noted that \"[f]orty-eight states have filing deadlines for minor parties later in the election cycle, and forty-three states allow minor parties to nominate candidates in a manner other than the primary election.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3465038\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/462/579/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3465038\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/462/579/\">\n    at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concluded that Ohio's interests in its primary and early-filing requirement were not sufficient to outweigh the severe burden on LPO's rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Following the decision in\n   <em>\n    Blackwell\n   </em>\n   , \"the Ohio General Assembly [took] no action to establish ballot access standards for minor political parties, leaving no lawful, statutory criteria to be followed by the Secretary of State or the various Boards of Election of each county.\"\n   <em>\n    Libertarian Party of Ohio v.

In the absence of legislation, in 2007, the Ohio Secretary of State issued a directive that maintained Ohio's requirement that minor parties\n   nominate their candidates by primary election, but altered the party-qualification process by requiring minor parties to \"obtain petition signatures equal to one-half of one percent of the votes cast for governor in the 2006 general election,\" and to \"file nominating petitions 100 days before the primary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3088444\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/567/1006/#p1009\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3088444\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/567/1006/#p1009\">\n    at 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} LPO challenged the directive in federal court, and the court granted a preliminary injunction preventing the directive from going into effect. The court found that \"only the legislative branch has the authority, under Articles I and II of the United States Constitution, to prescribe the manner of electing candidates for federal office.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3088444\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/567/1006/#p1009\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3088444\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/567/1006/#p1009\">\n    at 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

No. 194 (\"H.B. No. 194\"), which in part, amended ballot access requirements for political parties. Specifically, H.B. No. 194 required minor parties file petitions with the requisite number of signatures 90 days before the primary, while maintaining the number of signatures required. LPO again filed a challenge in federal court. Finding that H.B. No. 194 imposed severe burdens on LPO's rights without a sufficiently weighty state interest, the court granted a preliminary injunction preventing H.B. No. 194 from taking effect. Following the issuance of the injunction, the General Assembly repealed H.B. No. 194. Thereafter, in 2013, the Ohio Secretary of State issued an additional directive that \"continued the practice of recognizing minor political parties and granting them access to the ballot for both the primary and general elections.\"\n   <em>\n    Libertarian Party of Ohio v.

No. 193, LPO and three persons involved with LPO, filed a complaint and a motion for a preliminary injunction against the Ohio Secretary of State in federal district court. The court granted LPO's first motion for a preliminary injunction. On November 8, 2013, LPO filed an amended complaint challenging the restrictions in S.B. No. 193 on ballot access and asserting in part that S.B. No. 193 violated Article V, Section 7 of the Ohio Constitution. On January 7, 2014, the court granted LPO's second motion for a preliminary injunction, preventing S.B. No. 193 from taking effect for the 2014 election. However, the court declined to address the merits of LPO's claims under the Ohio Constitution at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On March 7, 2014, LPO filed a second amended complaint and third motion for preliminary injunction in the federal district court asserting that the Ohio Secretary of State violated its First Amendment rights by disqualifying its nominating petitions, preventing its candidates from appearing on the Ohio primary ballot in May 2014. The Secretary of State asserted that LPO's nominating petitions were disqualified because the paid circulators who obtained signatures for LPO's nominating petitions failed to disclose the name and address of the entity that paid them in the employer information box on the petitions as required by R.C. 3501.38(E)(1). The district court denied LPO's third motion, finding that R.C. 3501.38(E)(1) placed only a minimal burden on LPO's First Amendment rights and the requirements served a significant interest in detecting and deterring fraud in the signature gathering process.\n   <em>\n    Libertarian Party of Ohio v.

On September 15, 2014, LPO filed a fourth motion for a preliminary injunction and motion for a temporary restraining order, seeking to place its candidates' names on the ballot for the 2014 general election. The federal district court denied the request for a temporary restraining order and the fourth motion for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Following denial of the fourth preliminary injunction, the parties filed motions and cross-motions for summary judgment regarding LPO's claims that S.B. No. 193 violated the Ohio Constitution and the federal Equal Protection Clause. The federal district court found that S.B. No. 193 did not violate the federal Equal Protection Clause, both on its face and as applied. The court also dismissed LPO's claim that S.B. No. 193 violated the Ohio Constitution as barred by the Eleventh Amendment. On May 20, 2016, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on LPO's selective enforcement claim.\n   <em>\n    Libertarian Party of Ohio v.

No. 193 violated the federal Equal Protection Clause by denying them the opportunity to participate in the primary election process. The court concluded that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants on LPO's federal constitutional challenges. Finally, LPO asserted that the district court erred in dismissing its state constitutional claim under Article V, Section 7 of the Ohio Constitution. The court found that LPO was precluded from pursuing its claim under Article V, Section 7 because, as detailed below, the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas reached a final judgment on such claim.\n   <em>\n    Libertarian Party of Ohio v.

No. 193, Ohio had three categories of political parties: major, intermediate, and minor. Following the enactment of S.B. No. 193, two categories of political party were created: major and minor. Minor political parties are defined as those parties which meet one of the following requirements: (1) the party's candidate for governor or nominees for presidential electors received not less than 3 percent but less than 20 percent of the total vote at the most recent regular election for such office, in which case such party would remain a recognized minor political party for a period of 4 years, or (2) the party filed a party formation petition meeting the requirements of R.C. 3517.01, in which case it would remain a recognized minor political party until the next election for governor or president occurring not less than 12 months following the formation of the party. In order for a newly formed political party to qualify as a minor party under R.C. 3501.01(F)(2)(b), the petition must meet the following three requirements under R.C. 3517.01(A)(1)(b) : (1) the petition must be signed by qualified electors equal to at least 1 percent of the total vote for nominees for presidential electors or governor at the most recent election for such office, (2) the petition must be signed by 500 qualified electors from each of at least half of the congressional districts in the state, (3) the petition must declare the intent of forming the party named in the petition and of participating in the next general election held in even-numbered years that occurs more than 125 days after the date of filing, and (4) the petition must designate a committee of 3 to 5 petitioners to represent the petitioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 27} R.C. 3501.01(E), which was unchanged by S.B.

No. 193, a newly formed political party was able to participate in the primary election process. However, as amended by S.B. No. 193, candidates of a newly formed political party are no longer able to participate in the primary election process. Instead, candidates of a newly formed political party must submit: (1) if the candidacy is for a statewide office, a nominating petition signed by at least 50 qualified electors who have not voted as a member of a different political party at any primary election within the current year or the immediately preceding 2 calendar years, or (2) if the candidacy is to be submitted only to electors within a district, political subdivision, or portion thereof, a nominating petition signed by not less than 5 qualified electors who have not voted as a member of a different political party at any primary election within the current year or the immediately preceding 2 calendar years. Then, the committee designated in the party formation petition must certify a slate of candidates who submitted sufficient nominating petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Article V, Section 7 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   All nominations for elective state, district, county and municipal offices shall be made at direct primary elections or by petition as provided by law, and provision shall be made by law for a preferential vote for United States senator; but direct primaries shall not be held for the nomination of township officers or for the officers of municipalities of less than two thousand population, unless petitioned\n   for by a majority of the electors of such township or municipality.

No. 193 violates such provision because it provides for the nomination of party candidates by both primary election and petition. Appellees respond that Article V, Section 7 of the Ohio Constitution cannot serve as a basis for LPO's claim because it is not a self-executing source of independent protection. \"A constitutional provision is self-executing when it is complete in itself and becomes operative without the aid of supplemental or enabling legislation.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Indeed, by stating that petitions are to be made \"as provided by law,\" the provision explicitly reserves the proper construction of such petitions to subsequent enactments by the General Assembly. Although the plain language of this provision suggests that it is not self-executing because nominations by petition cannot be operative without the aid of legislation, we need not so decide in order to resolve LPO's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Indeed, assuming, arguendo, that Article V, Section 7 is self-executing, LPO's contention that S.B. No. 193 violates the provision nevertheless fails. In support of its contention that Article V, Section 7 permits the nomination of candidates by primary election alone, LPO points to the Sixth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Blackwell\n   </em>\n   in which the court stated that Ohio's \"Constitution requires that all political parties, including minor parties, nominate their candidates at primary elections.\"\n   <em>\n    Blackwell\n   </em>\n   at 582.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 36} As the trial court correctly observed, at the time the Sixth Circuit decided\n   <em>\n    Blackwell\n   </em>\n   there was no provision in Ohio statutory law allowing for a nomination by petition for a candidate affiliated with a political party. However, as we have previously stated, the plain language of Article V, Section 7 provides for two methods for nominations to be made: by direct primary election or nomination by petition.

In determining the meaning of the phrase \"nominating petition,\" the court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   <em>\n    Under our statutes\n   </em>\n   the candidates for public office may gain nomination by two methods: One, by filing a declaration of candidacy accompanied by a petition entitling one to be a participant in the direct party primary wherein candidates from all political parties seek their nomination; or, two, by what is designated as a nominating petition, the method by which the independent candidate may seek his place on the elective ballot. In other words, the nominating petition is the method by which the independent candidate seeks his place on the elective ballot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 240-41,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=193%20N.E.2d%20270\">\n    193 N.E.2d 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing former R.C. 3513.252.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Thus, the court's interpretation of the phrase \"nominating petition\" in\n   <em>\n    Sulligan\n   </em>\n   was based upon then-existing statutory provisions, not the constitutional framework of Article V, Section 7. Because Article V, Section 7 provides that \"[a]ll nominations * * * shall be made at direct primary elections or by petition\n   <em>\n    as provided by law\n   </em>\n   ,\" the General Assembly possesses constitutional authority to legislate the scope of a nominating petition. (Emphasis added.) Therefore, Article V, Section 7 does not prohibit the General Assembly from enacting statutes providing for nomination by petition for candidates regardless of whether the candidate is affiliated with a political party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sulligan\n   </em>\n   at 242,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=193%20N.E.2d%20270\">\n    193 N.E.2d 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Mullholand v.

Accordingly, we do not find LPO's contentions regarding\n   <em>\n    Sulligan\n   </em>\n   to be persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Finally, LPO states that the adoption of S.B. No. 193 \"marks the first occasion since Article V, [Section] 7 of Ohio's Constitution was adopted and implemented that Ohio law has had any procedure for any qualified political parties to nominate candidates for federal, state and local office without primaries.\" (LPO's Brief at 27.) For the foregoing reasons, we are not persuaded by LPO's contention that the history of the nomination process in Ohio is controlling over the express terms of the constitutional provision. Therefore, assuming, arguendo, that Article V, Section 7 is self-executing, we conclude that LPO has failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality by demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the challenged provisions of S.B. No. 193 violate Article V, Section 7 of the Ohio Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Mole\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Accordingly, we overrule LPO's first assignment of error. Having reached the merits of LPO's first assignment of error in finding that S.B. No. 193 does not violate Article V, Section 7 of the Ohio Constitution, we need not address LPO's contentions regarding whether Article V, Section 7 is justiciable. Accordingly, LPO's second assignment of error is rendered moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Article I, Section 2 of the Ohio Constitution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   {\u00b6 42} In its third, fourth, and fifth assignments of error, LPO contends that S.B. No. 193 violates the guarantee of equal protection provided in Article I, Section 2 of the Ohio Constitution. Specifically, LPO contends the trial court erred in its analysis of LPO's claim under Ohio's constitutional guarantee of equal protection by applying federal precedent interpreting the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Constitutional Protections\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Article I, Section 2 provides in pertinent part: \"All political power is inherent in the people.

No. 193 placed only a minor burden on its rights because S.B. No. 193 \"prevents new parties from registering members\" and in so doing \"denies [LPO] recognized membership and the resulting official membership lists that are provided to the established political parties.\" (LPO's Brief at 44; 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   {\u00b6 57} In Ohio, party affiliation is recognized based on a voter's request for the ballot of a political party in a partisan primary election. This is demonstrated by R.C. 3513.05 which provides that \"[f]or purposes of signing or circulating a petition of candidacy for party nomination or election, an elector is considered to be a member of a political party if the elector voted in that party's primary election within the preceding two calendar years, or if the elector did not vote in any other party's primary election within the preceding two calendar years.\" Similarly, R.C. 3513.19(A)(3), which describes the process for challenges by precinct election officials to the right of a person to vote at a primary election, provides that \"party affiliation shall be determined by examining the elector's voting record for the current year and the immediately preceding two calendar years as shown on the voter's registration card, using the standards of affiliation specified in the seventh paragraph of section 3513.05 of the Revised Code.\" Thus, Ohio law describes party affiliation only in terms of voting in primary elections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   {\u00b6 58} S.B. No. 193 does not operate to restrict party affiliation to only major party voters. Instead, upon meeting the 3 percent vote requirement in the immediately preceding election necessary to retain its status as a minor party, a minor party may participate in the primary election process and thereby have affiliated voters. Thus, it is true that Ohio's election law scheme places some burden on minor political parties by requiring them to establish a modicum of political support before they can participate in the primary process and thereby have voters declare affiliation with their party. However, we find that LPO has not demonstrated how this amounts to a severe burden on its rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   {\u00b6 59} As stated by the Sixth Circuit in its discussion of LPO's contentions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   [LPO] emphasizes the enormous significance to political parties of having a membership, including a party member's ability to \"develop\" the party, recruit additional members, contribute money, and more. * * * The fundamental importance of these activities is beyond dispute.

Specifically, the court found that\n   <em>\n    Baer\n   </em>\n   was limited to the circumstances of the case and \"was never intended to establish\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   criteria outside [its] state-specific context.\"\n   <em>\n    Kobach\n   </em>\n   at 1149.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   {\u00b6 67} Having reviewed the cases cited by LPO, we disagree that they are dispositive over the instant matter. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Rockefeller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Schulz\n   </em>\n   , in which party membership lists were provided free of charge to major parties but minor parties were required to pay, LPO does not contend that the restrictions at issue favor only major parties. By achieving a lower percentage of the vote than major parties, minor parties are also able to participate in the primary election process and thereby have affiliated voters under Ohio law. Additionally, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Baer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Green Party v. New York State Bd. of Elections\n   </em>\n   , Ohio provides for the affiliation of voters through the primary process, instead of through voter registration forms. These cases do not address the limited circumstances for which Ohio considers party affiliation. Furthermore, as noted by\n   <em>\n    Kobach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Baer\n   </em>\n   was limited to the specific circumstances of that case. Therefore, the cases cited by LPO are distinguishable from the present matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   {\u00b6 68} Next, we must \"identify and evaluate the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   at 789,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200638\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/780/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Appellees supported this interest with the deposition testimony of Richard Winger, LPO's witness who had testified as an expert on ballot access issues in ten states. Winger stated that his area of expertise was in the \"history of ballot access laws in the United States and election returns, especially with focus on how well minor parties have done.\" (Winger Depo. at 9.) Winger testified in his deposition as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   [Appellees' Counsel]: So it's not unusual for a state to make a policy choice that newly qualified political parties do not get to participate in the state run primary election; is that fair?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   [Winger]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   [Appellees' Counsel]: In your mind why would a state make that kind of a policy choice?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   [Winger]: Well, I have communicated with Ohio government officials for many years to make them aware that the nation's leading election administration expert wrote in 1951-Dr. Joseph P. Harris-and he wrote a model direct primary system for the National Civic League, which back then was called the National Municipal League, and he said states should not provide primaries to small parties. It's a waste of money. They seldom have primary contests. And that's one reason.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   Another reason is it makes it very difficult for states to have a reasonable qualifying deadline if it's going to insist that new parties nominate by primary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n   [Appellees' Counsel]: Any other reasons?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n   [Winger]: When there is a contested minor party primary, frequently the voters in that primary are not well-informed. * * * I just feel when minor parties nominate by convention, the people can talk to the nominees and make an informed choice, so just as a policy matter, I favor convention nomination for small parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   (Winger Depo. at 59-61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   {\u00b6 71} Appellees also offered statistics demonstrating a low rate of participation in primary elections in Ohio. Specifically, appellees pointed out that \"[d]uring the 2012 Primary election, [LPO] had only 337 individuals across the entire state cast a ballot for its Senatorial candidate.\" (Appellees' Brief at 49.) In 2010, Ohio had 8,013,558 registered voters, 1,814,244 of whom cast a ballot in the May primary. Of those voters who voted in the primary, 5,476 requested a Libertarian Party ballot. Based on this statistical information in addition to Winger's deposition testimony, we find that the state has demonstrated a legitimate and sufficient interest in ensuring the efficient operation of elections by\n   limiting access to primary elections to those parties that have demonstrated a modicum of support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   {\u00b6 72} Therefore, weighing the limited burden imposed by S.B.

Bridges asserted in his affidavit that LPO could not present facts essential to their opposition to appellees' motion for summary judgment because discovery had not yet commenced and LPO would \"need to conduct formal discovery in order to be able to adequately respond to [appellees'] many denials of allegations contained in [LPO's complaint]\" and \"to be able to adequately respond to [appellees'] factual assertions in their Motion for Summary Judgment.\" (Bridges' Affidavit at 2.) In its motion for a continuance, LPO specifically contended: \"[S.B. No.] 193 lacks any legitimate justification. [LPO] believes it cannot pass the test proposed by [appellees]. In order to prove\n   this, discovery will likely be required.\" (LPO's Mot. for Cont. at 7.) On appeal, LPO contends that it \"was entitled to discover why S.B.
