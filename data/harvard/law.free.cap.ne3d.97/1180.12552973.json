Precision moved to dismiss the complaint or to transfer for improper venue. The Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas granted the motion and transferred the case to the Medina County Court of Common Pleas. Upon the case being transferred to Medina County, the Yeapleses moved the court to refuse the transfer of venue. After a hearing, the Medina County Court of Common Pleas ordered the case transferred back to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, concluding that venue was proper in Cuyahoga County. Subsequently, Cole and Precision moved the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas to refuse venue and reaffirm its prior order transferring the action to Medina. The Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas granted the motion and ordered the matter transferred back to Medina County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} While the case remained pending in Medina County, the Yeapleses filed a complaint in the Ohio Eighth District Court of Appeals seeking a writ of mandamus and a writ of procedendo to compel the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas to vacate that court's orders and adjudicate the underlying action on the merits. The Eighth District concluded that venue was proper in Cuyahoga County.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Yeaples v. Gall\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

The Supreme Court ultimately concluded that venue was proper in Medina County and that the Yeapleses were not entitled to the extraordinary relief provided through the writs of mandamus and procedendo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Accordingly, the Medina County Court of Common Pleas accepted the transfer of venue. Upon leave of court, the Yeapleses filed an amended complaint asserting claims for \"workplace intentional tort,\" negligence, violation of Ohio's frequenter statute, and loss of consortium. Cole filed a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The trial court subsequently denied Cole's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Cole filed this timely appeal raising two assignments of error for our review.

In his second assignment of error, Cole asserts that the trial court erred by failing to conclude that Ohio law does not recognize a common law deliberate indifference or substantial certainty intentional tort committed by one employee against another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 7} As a threshold matter, we must determine if the trial court's orders are properly before this Court as we only have jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a final judgment.

That statute states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   No employee of any employer, as defined in division (B) of section 4123.01 of the Revised Code,\n   <em>\n    shall be liable to respond in damages\n   </em>\n   at common law or by statute for any injury or occupational disease, received or contracted by any other employee of such employer in the course of and arising out of the latter employee's employment, or for any death resulting from such injury or occupational disease, on the condition that such injury, occupational disease, or death is found to be compensable under sections 4123.01 to 4123.94, inclusive, of the Revised Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \"Generally, an order denying a motion to dismiss is not a final order.\"\n   <em>\n    Polikoff v.

Nonetheless, the General Assembly has set forth what orders are final and appealable in R.C. 2505.02(B). That statute states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   An order is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is one of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (1) An order that affects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   R.C. 2505.02(B)(1). A \"substantial right\" is \"a right that the United States Constitution, the Ohio Constitution, a statute, the common law, or a rule of procedure entitles a person to enforce or protect.\" R.C. 2505.02(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 9} To be final pursuant to R.C. 2505.02(B)(1), the trial court's order must determine the action and prevent a judgment in the matter in Cole's favor. Thus, even if we were to presume that the trial court's denial of Cole's motion to dismiss affects a substantial right, such a conclusion would not be determinative in this matter. In this case, the trial court's judgment\n   entry does not prevent a judgment in favor of Cole. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court's order is not a final order pursuant to R.C. 2505.02(B)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bishop v.
