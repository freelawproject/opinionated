The disorderly conduct statute prohibits, inter alia, \"recklessly caus[ing] inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm to another by doing any of the following: * * * [e]ngaging in fighting, in threatening harm to persons or property, or in violent or turbulent behavior.\" R.C. 2917.11(A)(1). R.H. contends that R.C. 2917.11 is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. In particular, he challenges the phrase \"inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm\" in R.C. 2917.11(A) and the words \"violent\" and \"turbulent\" in R.C. 2917.11(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} This Court initially addresses the State's contention that R.H. did not challenge the words in R.C. 2917.11(A)(1) at the trial court level and, therefore, cannot raise a challenge to that portion of the statute on appeal. Prior to the start of trial, R.H.'s attorney stated that he had filed a motion to dismiss the previous day. Although the State acknowledged receiving a copy of the motion, there is no written motion contained in the record. Therefore, this Court's review is limited to the motion as it was orally presented to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In his oral motion, R.H. argued that the disorderly conduct statute, and consequently the aggravated riot statute, was overbroad and vague because it did not give notice to people of \"what inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm is\" and \"encompasses more protected behavior than unprotected behavior.\" R.H. did not mention the language in R.C. 2917.11(A)(1) when presenting his motion to the trial court. Consequently, the State is correct that he may not challenge this portion of the statute for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schneider\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007-Ohio-2553\">\n    2007-Ohio-2553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%201531414\">\n    2007 WL 1531414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 18, citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

R.H. contends that\n   <em>\n    Carrick\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable to his case because it concerned the phrase \"making unreasonable noise\" in R.C. 2917.11(A)(2), whereas he is bringing a challenge to \"R.C. 2917[.11](A) as a whole.\" R.H. is correct in so far as the issue certified concerned \"making unreasonable noise\" under R.C. 2917.11(A)(2).\n   <em>\n    Carrick\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. That, however, does not end the analysis.

The prohibited conduct is then listed in subsections (A)(1) to (5). Aside from the word \"turbulent\" in (A)(1), R.H. does not challenge any of those subsections. By focusing on the words \"inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm\" R.H. has made an argument regarding the effect of a person's conduct. He has not made an argument concerning the conduct that is prohibited. The legislature did not state that a person could be arrested merely for causing \"inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm to another.\" Rather, the legislature specified that the statute only applied if a person did so \"by doing any of the following[,]\" i.e., by engaging in certain conduct.

Similarly, the legislature has stated, \"the [S]tate is not required to allege or prove that the offender expressly agreed with four or more others to commit any act that constitutes a violation of [ R.C. 2917.02 ] prior to or while committing those acts.\" R.C. 2917.031.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The evidence presented at trial consisted of the testimony of Detention Officer Jimmy Oliver and a surveillance video of the classroom. Officer Oliver testified that initially he was the only detention officer in the classroom. Shortly before class was to begin, he was issuing a violation to a juvenile who was being disruptive. That juvenile, then, punched another juvenile. At that point, \"everything just sprung off\" with fights happening around the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Another detention officer in the hall heard the commotion and called for assistance. That officer and three additional ones came into the classroom. Officer Oliver testified that the other officers broke up R.H.'s fight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 31} On cross-examination, Officer Oliver testified that he was not sure how long R.H. had been in the detention center prior to the altercation. When asked if he knew whether R.H. knew any of the other juveniles, Officer Oliver responded that he did not \"know who they associate with when they're out.\" He further indicated that taunting, teasing, and bullying occur in the detention hall, but he did not know if there had been any between R.H. and the juvenile he assaulted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The video shows Officer Oliver, a teacher, and multiple juveniles in the classroom. After the first juvenile throws a punch, other juveniles begin fighting. The video also shows some juveniles backed away, in an apparent attempt to stay out of the melee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 33} R.H. acknowledges that Officer Oliver was present during the incident, but he contends that Officer Oliver \"was only able to testify to what other detention officers had told him and what he had viewed on the video after the incident had occurred.\" R.H. did not object to Officer Oliver's testimony concerning what the other officers told him and the parties stipulated to the video. Moreover, Officer Oliver testified to his personal observations that morning describing the sequence of events including his observation of multiple juveniles fighting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Officer Oliver's testimony as to what the other officers told him was limited. He stated that \"they said it was difficult to separate the two [and R.H.] was the aggressor.\" Whether R.H. was the aggressor relates to the assault charge, which he admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 35} With respect to the video, Officer Oliver testified that \"as the fight was going on, [he] couldn't distinguish which kid[ ] was doing what.\" He further testified that, when the video was reviewed, they could be identified. Officer Oliver's testimony did not indicate that he did not observe what occurred, but rather there was so much\n   going on that all of the participants could not immediately be identified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 36} R.H. makes much of the fact that Officer Oliver was unaware of any relationships among the juveniles. R.H. argues that an aggravated riot requires a relationship among the participants and a plan to act in a unified fashion. R.C. 2917.031 makes clear that there is no such requirement. \"For purposes of prosecuting violations of [R.C.] 2917.02 * * *, the [S]tate is not required to allege or prove that the offender expressly agreed with four of more others to commit any act that constitutes a violation of [that] section prior to or while committing those acts.\" R.C. 2917.031.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 37} While acknowledging the existence of R.C. 2917.031 and this Court's precedent in\n   <em>\n    Covey\n   </em>\n   , the dissent contends, \"the State was required, at a minimum, to demonstrate that R.H.'s behavior was in some way connected to the actions of the other individuals in the classroom.\" The aggravated riot statute, however, is not written so narrowly. The statute simply states, \"[n]o person shall participate with four or more others in a course of disorderly conduct * * *.\" R.C. 2917.02(A). The word \"participate\" is not modified by any phrase indicating that there must be a connection among the participants (or their actions) beyond the fact that they are engaging in disorderly conduct. It is well established that a court cannot add words or phrases to a statute.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rossiter v. Smith\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist.

In reaching this conclusion, we relied on the Second District's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Brandon\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist. Greene No. 88 CA 57,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1989%20WL%2072232\">\n    1989 WL 72232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (June 28, 1989).\n   <em>\n    Brandon\n   </em>\n   involved a scenario where a group of six men, armed with guns, traveled to a local college campus to confront a rival cohort from another town.\n   <em>\n    Brandon\n   </em>\n   at *3. Upon entering campus, the two cars carrying the men separated and traveled down different streets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. The passengers in one of the cars were involved in a gun fight where one of their rivals was shot and killed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7-8. The court recognized that the State was not required to \"establish that the six acted in concert after they reached the campus.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. Significantly, however, the court upheld the aggravated riot conviction of one of the passengers who was in the other vehicle on the basis that all six men went to the campus with the same \"corporate purpose[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, while R.C. 2917.031 notes that the State is not required to demonstrate that R.H. \"expressly agreed\" to engage in a course of disorderly conduct with at least four other people, the State was required, at a minimum, to demonstrate R.H.'s behavior was in some way connected to the actions of the other individuals in the classroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Here, Officer Oliver admitted during his testimony that as the incident was ongoing, he \"couldn't distinguish which kid[ ] was doing what.\" Even upon reviewing the video and conferring with\n   his fellow officers, Officer Oliver's testimony established that, at most, R.H. engaged in a fight with one other individual. Significantly, there is no evidence that R.H.'s actions were connected to the actions of the other individuals involved in the classroom incident. The State did not present evidence in this case that the scope of R.H.'s participation extended beyond his involvement in a one-on-one altercation, nor did the State establish that R.H. acted with the same corporate purpose as other individuals involved in the incident. Under these circumstances, I would conclude that the State failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate that R.H. \"participate[d] with four or more others in a course of disorderly conduct\" with the purpose of facilitating the assault in violation of R.C. 2917.02(B)(2). R.C. 2917.02(A).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
