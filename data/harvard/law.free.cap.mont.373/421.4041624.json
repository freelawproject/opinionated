(Father) and N.W. (Mother) are the biological parents of K.L., born in 2009. K.L. was first removed from her parents\u2019 custody and placed into foster care in July 2011. Her parents split shortly thereafter. In October 2011, K.L. was adjudicated as a youth in need of care. In August 2012, the Department of Public Health and Human Services (Department or DPHHS) filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of both parents. A termination hearing was held in February 2013, and the District Court issued its order of termination on March 28, 2013. Between the time K.L. was removed from her parent\u2019s care in July 2011 and the termination of rights of both parents, K.L. was twice reunified through trial home visits with her father and twice removed and re-placed into foster care. There was no reunification attempt with her mother between the July 2011 removal and the termination of Mother\u2019s parental rights. Both parents appeal the order of termination. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">\u00b62 A restatement of Father\u2019s issues is:</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">\u00b63 Did the District Court abuse its discretion and violate Father\u2019s constitutional rights by improperly granting the Department\u2019s motion for an extension of temporary legal custody over K.L.?</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">\u00b64 Did the District Court abuse its discretion and violate Father\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>constitutional rights when it terminated Father\u2019s parental rights finding that the condition or conduct rendering Father unfit to parent was not likely to change in a reasonable time?</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u00b65 A restatement of the dispositive issue on appeal vis-a-vis Mother is whether the District Court abused its discretion in terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">\u00b66 On July 19, 2011, Mother and Father were living together and raising their daughter, K.L., who was then approximately twenty-five months old. Mother returned home one evening to find Father intoxicated and drinking with an intoxicated male stranger in the home and in the presence of K.L. A verbal argument ensued that subsequently turned violent. One of the parents began hitting the other with a broomstick. The stick broke, yielding one-half of the stick to each parent who continued hitting the other parent with it. The police arrived, both parents were arrested and jailed, and the child was placed into protective foster care. Father later admitted that he was in a \u201cblind, drunken rage\u201d at the time. K.L. remained in foster care and at an October 6,2011 show cause hearing she was adjudicated a youth in need of care.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At some point between July and October, the parents stopped living together and terminated their relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">\u00b67 In November 2011, the Department prepared initial treatment plans for both Mother and Father. Mother signed her initial plan on November 22,2011. In an effort to facilitate reunification, the goals of the treatment plan, in part, were to: (1) preserve the parent-child relationship; (2) assist Mother in acquiring the necessary skills to provide for her child\u2019s safety, permanency, and well-being; and (3) provide DPHHS with the information necessary to determine the strengths, needs, and concerns of the family, and whether it would be safe to return the child to Mother. Mother was specifically tasked with: (1) maintaining a safe home environment; (2) completing an in-home parenting plan and demonstrating what she learned; (3) addressing her mental health needs by completing a psychological evaluation and following the psychologists\u2019 recommendations; (4) attending domestic violence and relationship counseling as well as anger management counseling; (5) maintaining regular visitation with K.L.; and (6) initiating weekly contact with her case worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>\u00b68 Father signed his treatment plan on November 4, 2011, and was tasked with many of the same tasks as Mother, e.g., maintaining a safe home environment, completing a parenting class, and addressing his mental health needs. In addition, given the bearing of Father\u2019s alcohol use on his ability to parent, the Department required that Father address his alcohol abuse or addiction through DPHHS-provided evaluations, therapy, and support.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\u00b69 On December 8,2011, the District Comet conducted a dispositional hearing at which the parents\u2019 treatment plans were presented for approval. Counsel for both parents stipulated to the initial treatment plans but reserved the right to submit written objections after reviewing the plans with their clients. The court issued an order on December 16,2011, that, among other things, approved both treatment plans as appropriate and reasonable. Neither parent\u2019s counsel subsequently objected. In its December 16, 2011 order, the District Court granted the Department temporary legal custody (TLC) and both parents were ordered to complete their court-approved treatment plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u00b610 As Father appeared to be making more progress on his treatment plan than Mother, the Department attempted to reunify K.L. with Father on January 5, 2012, for a trial home visit. Father entered into an agreement with the case worker that he would not drink alcohol when K.L. was in his care. K.L. remained in Father\u2019s custody until March 3, 2012, when the police were called because Father was publicly intoxicated while at a restaurant with K.L. K.L. remained in foster care until early May when she was again reunified with Father in a trial home visit. On June 11, 2012, the Department petitioned the court to extend TLC for an additional six months to allow the parents more time to complete their respective court-ordered treatment plans. Mother stipulated to the extension but Father opposed the petition. At a June 21,2012 review hearing, the District Court granted a sixty-day, rather than a six-month, extension of TLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u00b611 On June 23, 2012, police were again called by a third party who witnessed a \u201chighly intoxicated\u201d Father pushing K.L. in her stroller down a busy street in Great Falls after midnight, and then removing her from the stroller and allowing her to run in the street while he appeared too intoxicated to supervise or protect her. He was charged with child endangerment and K.L. was again removed from Father\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\u00b612 Throughout this time, no attempt was made to reunify K.L. with Mother because Mother failed to make adequate progress with her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u00b613 On August 9,2012, the Department filed its petition to terminate the parental rights of both Mother and Father. The District Court held a termination hearing on February 13, 2013, and issued its order terminating the rights of both parents on March 28, 2013. Both parents filed timely notices of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u00b614 The Department has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the statutory criteria for termination have been satisfied. Clear and convincing evidence in the context of parental rights cases is \u201csimply a requirement that a preponderance of the evidence be definite, clear, and convincing, or that a particular issue must be clearly established by a preponderance of the evidence or by a clear preponderance of the proof. This requirement does not call for unanswerable or conclusive evidence.\u201d <em>In re B.H., </em>2001 MT 288, \u00b6 16, 307 Mont. 412, 37 P.3d 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u00b615 Additionally, in determining whether to terminate parental rights, \u201cthe district court is bound to give primary consideration to the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the children\u201d; thus, \u201cthe best interests of the children are of paramount concern in a parental rights termination proceeding and take precedence over the parental rights.\u201d <em>In re E.K., </em>2001 MT 279, \u00b6 33, 307 Mont. 328, 37 P.3d 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">\u00b616 We review the district court\u2019s rulings on the Department\u2019s evidence to determine if the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous and if the court\u2019s conclusions are correct. <em>In re D.B., 2007 </em>MT 246, \u00b6 18, 339 Mont. 240, 168 P.3d 691. If the court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous and its conclusions are not incorrect, we will not disturb a district court\u2019s order on termination unless we determine that the district court abused its discretion. A district court abuses its discretion when it \u201cacts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>In re R.M.T., </em>2011 MT 164, \u00b6 26, 361 Mont. 159, 256 P.3d 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">\u00b617 We first address Father\u2019s issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">\u00b618 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion and violate Father\u2019s constitutional rights by improperly granting the Department\u2019s motion for an extension of temporary legal custody over K.L. ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>\u00b619 Section 41-3-442, MCA, provides the circumstances under which a district court may grant, or extend, temporary legal custody to the Department, and permits extending TLC upon a showing that \u201cadditional time is necessary for the parent... to successfully complete a treatment plan.\u201d Section 41-3-442(4)(a)(i), MCA. Father did not challenge the original granting of TLC but challenges the District Court\u2019s June 2012 extension of TLC. He maintains that on June 11, 2012, when the Department filed its petition to extend TLC, he had \u201ccompleted his treatment plan goals\u201d; consequently, no additional time was necessary to complete his plan. He further asserts that testimony at the June 21, 2012 TLC extension hearing illustrated that he had done \u201can outstanding job of parenting and compliance\u201d; therefore, the extension should not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b620  The record reveals, however, that Father had not completed his treatment plan, and while he may have done \u201can outstanding job\u201d on some aspects of the plan, several aspects of his plan were wanting, including, but not limited to, maintaining a safe home environment for K.L. Additionally, and most critically in Father\u2019s case, the plan required that he maintain sobriety. It was undisputed that he failed to do so. He was publicly intoxicated on March 3, 2012, in a restaurant with K.L. His intoxication led a third party bystander to call the police out of concern for KL.\u2019s safety and led to the removal of K.L. from Father\u2019s care. The Department expressed ongoing concern at the TLC hearing that Father had not yet demonstrated that he believed his alcohol consumption was a \u201cmajor concern\u201d in his life. The Department wanted additional time to determine whether the March 3 event was an isolated incident or a continuing risk. The District Court\u2019s order clearly states that it was extending TLC out of concerns \u201con the issue of [Father\u2019s] alcohol usage.\u201d The court also noted that extending DPHHS\u2019s temporary legal custody was in KL.\u2019s best interests. The court had substantial credible evidence before it to support an extension of TLC. Despite the commendable successes Father may have achieved, it was not an abuse of the District Court\u2019s discretion to extend TLC for 60 days to allow Father to continue working on the remaining conditions and goals of his treatment plan, particularly his use of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u00b621 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion and violate Father\u2019s constitutional rights when it terminated Father\u2019s parental rights finding that the condition or conduct rendering Father unfit to parent was not likely to change in a reasonable </em>time?</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u00b622 Section 41-3-604, MCA, establishes when a petition to terminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>parental rights <em>must </em>be filed by the Department. The statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">(1) If a child has been in foster care under the physical custody of the state for 15 months of the most recent 22 months, the best interests of the child must be presumed to be served by termination of parental rights. If a child has been in foster care for 15 months of the most recent 22 months or if the court has found that reasonable efforts to preserve or reunify a child with the child\u2019s parent or guardian are not required pursuant to 41-3-423, a petition to terminate parental rights must be filed unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">(a) the child is being cared for by a relative;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">(b) the department has not provided the services considered necessary for the safe return of the child to the child\u2019s home; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">(c) the department has documented a compelling reason, available for court review, for determining that filing a petition to terminate parental rights would not be in the best interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Section 41-3-604(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">\u00b623 Additionally, under \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, the Department <em>may </em>seek termination of parental rights if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-11\">(1) The court may order a termination of the parent-child legal relationship upon a finding established by clear and convincing evidence ... that any of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-12\">(f) the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care and both of the following exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-13\">(i) an appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the court has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-14\">(ii) the conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">\u00b624 On August 9, 2012, approximately 13 months after K.L. was first removed from her parents\u2019 custody, the Department filed a Petition for Permanent Legal Custody and Termination of Parental Rights. As it pertained to Father, the Department asserted he had failed to maintain sobriety, noting the second public intoxication episode on June 23, 2012, in which he was pushing K.L. in her stroller down a busy street after midnight, resulting in a child endangerment charge. The Department claimed that Father had also failed to maintain adequate housing and a safe environment for K.L., and had continually placed K.L. in danger, necessitating removal of her from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>his care. DPHHS further noted that Father failed to address his mental health and chemical dependency needs as recommended after a DPHHS-provided psychological evaluation. The Department therefore sought termination concluding that the conduct and condition rendering Father unfit to parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. A termination hearing was scheduled for December 2, 2012, but at Father\u2019s request, it was vacated and rescheduled for February 21, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b625 While awaiting the termination hearing, the Department continued monitoring Father\u2019s progress with his treatment plan and his visitation interaction with K.L. DPHHS filed supplemental affidavits dated December 4, 2012, and February 14, 2013, updating the District Court. In both affidavits, the Department expressed continued concern that Father could not, or would not, stop drinking and that he failed to recognize how his drinking impacted his parenting and was preventing reunification with K.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b626 In addition to the testimony posited by the Department in these affidavits, there was considerable similar testimony at the termination hearing. The clinical psychologist who conducted a psychological evaluation on Father testified that Father \u201cdidn\u2019t think that he needed to quit drinking but that... he did need to quit [drinking]... while he was caring for his daughter and ... he needed to quit drinking in public.\u201d Several other witnesses testified that Father told them he was merely \u201cjumping through the hoops\u201d until he got his daughter back and that he did not intend to quit drinking as his drinking was not a problem. Further, witnesses presented testimony of the number of times Father failed to appear for court-ordered urinalyses (UA) or failed UA tests, and that Father would at times engage in binge drinking and drink until he blacked out. The psychologist determined that the likelihood that Father would abstain from alcohol over the long-term was \u201crelatively poor\u201d and that \u201cit was unlikely that he would become capable of parenting his child within a reasonable period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b627 By the time the termination hearing was conducted in February 2013, K.L. had been in foster care for the majority of the 19 months since her initial removal. This factor brings this case squarely within the presumption set forth in \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA-\u201c[i]f a child has been in foster care under the physical custody of the state for 15 months of the most recent 22 months, the best interests of the child must be presumed to be served by termination of parental rights.\u201d It is clear from the record here that Father was unable, or unwilling, to abstain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>from alcohol. His testimony to the contrary at the termination hearing is not supported by his previous behavior and is unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b628  While Father made significant progress on some terms, conditions, and tasks set forth in his treatment plan, it is well-established that partial compliance with a treatment plan is insufficient to preclude termination of parental rights. <em>In re S.M., </em>2001 MT 11, \u00b6 44, 304 Mont. 102, 19 P.3d 213. <em>See also In re D.H., </em>2001 MT 200, \u00b6 30, 306 Mont. 278, 33 P.3d 616. Father\u2019s failure to comply with the court-mandated condition that he abstain from using alcohol while K.L. was in his care repeatedly placed K.L. in a dangerous situation. Focusing on KL.\u2019s best interests, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding Father had failed to comply with his treatment plan. Moreover, in determining whether the condition rendering Father unfit to parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time, \u00a7 41-3-609(2)(c), MCA, expressly states that the court shall consider whether the \u201cexcessive use of intoxicating liquor ... affects the parent\u2019s ability to care and provide for the child.\u201d There was significant evidence presented throughout this proceeding that Father\u2019s parenting was adversely affected by alcohol use, and Father\u2019s repeated intoxication despite his awareness that he was being monitored and had lost his daughter as a result of alcohol use, supported the court\u2019s decision to terminate his parental rights. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Father\u2019s condition was unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b629 We affirm the District Court\u2019s termination of Father\u2019s parental rights. We now turn to Mother\u2019s issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\u00b630 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\u00b631 Mother argues on appeal that the District Court abused its discretion when it terminated her parental rights. She claims the District Court\u2019s finding that her treatment plan was appropriate was incorrect because the Department failed to modify the plan to incorporate the recommendations of state psychologist Dr. Mary Jo Jeffreys.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She also asserts the District Court abused its discretion in terminating her rights given the Department\u2019s failure to arrange critical mental health treatments recommended by Dr. Jeffreys. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>therefore maintains that the Department failed to \u201cmake reasonable efforts\u201d to reunify Mother and K.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\u00b632 To reiterate the relevant standard employed by the District Court to terminate Mother\u2019s parental rights to K.L., the court had to find \u201cby clear and convincing evidence\u201d that: (1) K.L. was an adjudicated youth in need of care; (2) Mother had not complied with a court-approved \u201cappropriate treatment plan\u201d or such plan was unsuccessful; and (3) the condition rendering Mother unfit to parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Section 41-3-609(l)(f)(i) and (ii), MCA. The first factor is not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b633 Addressing the second factor, Mother claims the District Court erred in concluding that her treatment plan was \u201cappropriate\u201d given that \u201cthe Department did not modify the plan to incorporate the recommendations ofthe state\u2019s psychologist.\u201d Mother was evaluated by Department-recommended clinical psychologist Dr. Mary Jo Jeffreys on February 2, 2012. The record does not contain Dr. Jeffreys\u2019 report but her testimony at the termination hearing revealed that during her evaluation, she identified numerous concerns about Mother\u2019s ability to parent K.L. According to the doctor, Mother exhibited \u201ca high proclivity to not be able to understand how another person is feeling,\u201d and \u201ca high proclivity to use force to get people to understand where she\u2019s coming from.\u201d Dr. Jeffreys concluded that Mother had an inability to identify with others and was rigid with a strong need to be in control. She also testified that Mother suffered with borderline intellectual functioning and had a severe thought disorder, and that she displayed rapid mood swings and lacked empathy. Consequently, the doctor recommended mental health treatment but expressed reservations, given the severity of Mother\u2019s mental and cognitive issues, about Mother\u2019s ability to \u201cengage\u201d in such treatment. Dr. Jeffreys also stated that even if Mother underwent mental health treatments, Mother is \u201cat high risk of ever being able to parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">\u00b634 There is no indication in the record as to when the Department received a copy of Dr. Jeffreys\u2019 report. However, the child protection specialist assigned by the Department to K.L.\u2019s case completed an affidavit dated June 5, 2012, to support extending TLC. In this affidavit, the Department specialist summarized Mother\u2019s treatment plan for the District Court. The affidavit reiterated the goals and tasks set forth in the initial November 2011 treatment plan and Mother\u2019s progress with each of the tasks. It also contained a new section discussing Mother\u2019s February 2, 2012 psychological evaluation with Dr. Jeffreys. This section of the affidavit indicated that Mother\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>treatment plan required Mother to \u201cseek appropriate mental health treatment, including a psychiatric evaluation to address further mental health concerns.\u201d It also stated, among other recommendations, that Mother must engage in vocational rehabilitation, and participate in supportive psychotherapy and anger management. While the District Court record does not contain a modified treatment plan signed by Mother and the Department, this affidavit indicates that the Department incorporated Dr. Jeffreys\u2019 recommendations into Mother\u2019s treatment plan. Consequently, Mother\u2019s claim that the Department did not modify her plan to incorporate Dr. Jeffrey\u2019s recommendations is incorrect. Moreover, testimony at the hearing illustrated that various service providers became concerned about Mother\u2019s mental and emotional health and cognitive issues early in the proceeding and attempted to help Mother address them. <em>D.B., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b635  We have previously declined to create a \u201csingle, generalized definition of an \u2018appropriate\u2019 treatment plan.\u201d <em>D.B., </em>\u00b6 32. We have suggested the consideration of several factors, such as whether the parent was represented by counsel, whether the parent stipulated to the plan, and whether the plan \u201ctakes into consideration the particular problems facing both the parent and the child.\u201d <em>D.B. </em>\u00b6 32. In the case before us, each of these factors was satisfied, as Mother was represented by counsel throughout the proceedings and she stipulated to the plan and raised no objections to its contents. We therefore conclude the District Court did not err in finding that Mother\u2019s treatment plan was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b636 Mother argues that under \u00a7 41-3-423(1), MCA, the Department was required to \u201cmake reasonable efforts\u201d to reunify her with K.L. Citing primarily extra-jurisdictional authority, she asserts that \u201creasonable efforts\u201d required the Department to provide her with the mental health treatment recommended by Dr. Jeffreys, and that failure to do so precluded the Department from seeking termination of her rights. Acknowledging that the Department attempted to make appointments for Mother with various mental health providers, and that at the time of the termination hearing Mother was on \u201cwaiting lists\u201d with one or more mental health professionals, she asserts that the Department\u2019s efforts were insufficient, and therefore did not constitute \u201creasonable efforts.\u201d Mother\u2019s argument suggests that had she received psychiatric counseling or medications between the date Dr. Jeffreys\u2019 conducted her psychological evaluation in February 2012 and termination of her rights in February 2013, reunification with K.L. may have been possible because she would have completed her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>treatment plan and the condition rendering her unfit would have changed for the better.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b637 The Department counters that while \u201creasonable efforts\u201d toward reunification is a Department obligation, it does not displace the statutory termination test set forth in \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f)(i) and (ii), MCA, i.e., a youth in need of care adjudication, an unsuccessful appropriate treatment plan, and the unlikeliness that the condition rendering a parent unfit will change within a reasonable time. The Department maintains that the record supports the District Court\u2019s finding that these criteria were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b638 The Department worked closely with Mother from the time it removed K.L. in July 2011 until Mother\u2019s termination in February 2013. It provided her with multiple services such as: (1) a program to help develop life skills and parenting skills; (2) parenting classes; (3) domestic violence and crisis management counseling; and (4) anger management counseling. Mother attended the life/parenting skills classes from mid-December 2011 until February 2012, when the service was terminated due to Mother\u2019s lack of progress and her inability to maintain a safe home environment where reunification could occur. Additionally, Mother attended only 4 out of 8 anger management classes and was a \u201cno show\u201d for numerous domestic violence and crisis management counseling sessions. While she completed the required parenting classes, she was unable to demonstrate what she learned in these classes. Without notice, she failed to attend numerous scheduled visits with K.L. causing her visitation privileges to be revoked on at least two occasions. When she did visit K.L., she was distant and indifferent to the child\u2019s attention and needs. She spent much of her visitation time on her telephone, texting, talking or listening to music. She remained unable to read KL.\u2019s cues and made inappropriate comments in front of K.L. about giving K.L. to K.L.\u2019s grandmother once Mother resumed custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\u00b639 Additionally, the record reflects that throughout much of this time, Mother failed to provide a safe environment for herself, at times being homeless or living in a hotel room with three other adults, one of whom was a registered sex offender, and two children. She became involved with at least one other man who physically abused her and repeatedly failed to maintain required communication with her case worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\u00b640 As noted above, the record does not establish when the Department received Dr. Jeffreys\u2019 report of her February 2012 evaluation of Mother or when the Department began trying to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>schedule a psychiatric evaluation or the mental health treatment recommended by Dr. Jeffreys. We know that at the time of the termination hearing Mother was on a waiting list with multiple providers as a result of the Department\u2019s efforts. Given the severity of Mother\u2019s mental, emotional, and cognitive limitations as related by Dr. Jeffreys, it is unlikely that Mother\u2019s ability to parent K.L. would have sufficiently improved within the relatively short period of time between removal and termination had the recommended counseling taken place. Moreover, as Mother was resistant to attending the counseling appointments actually scheduled by the Department, we will not admonish the Department for failing to secure others or for its inability to have Mother moved up on a waiting list.</p>\n<p id=\"Amc\">\u00b641 The Dissent concludes that the Department failed to use \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to ensure that Mother received a psychiatric assessment before there could be a determination that her unfitness to parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Sarah Grotbo, a child protection specialist with the Department and Mother\u2019s case worker, testified that she made referrals for psychiatric services to several different providers. For a psychiatric appointment at Benefis West, the wait was six months, and for Aware Services, the wait was a year. Section 41-3-423, MCA, obligates the Department to make \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to reunify families; however, the statue does not define the term and indeed it would be impossible to do so, as each case must be evaluated on its own facts. But clearly the statute does not require herculean efforts. When faced with balancing the reservations of Dr. Jeffreys about Mother\u2019s prospects of being able to parent even with mental health treatment and the substantial time it would take to secure such treatment, against the child\u2019s need for permanency and stability, we cannot agree with the Dissent that more \u201creasonable efforts\u201d were required.</p>\n<p id=\"A7-\">\u00b642  Considering the paramount importance of K.L.\u2019s best interests and given the abundant evidence presented to the District Court that (1) Mother had not completed the tasks set forth in <em>her initial treatment plan </em>between November 2011 and February 2013; (2) Mother\u2019s condition was unlikely <em>to </em>change for the better within a reasonable time; and (3) significant bonding had occurred between K.L. and her foster parents and K.L. was experiencing an overall well-being in foster care, the District Court\u2019s termination of Mother\u2019s parental rights was not an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\u00b643 We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b458-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-9\"> The show cause hearing was delinquent and not in compliance with \u00a7 41-3-432, MCA, but counsel for parents did not file an objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b453-8\"> Mother also argued that the District Court failed to apply the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard to its determination that Mother\u2019s treatment plan was appropriate.

One such requirement is found in \u00a7 41-3-423(1), MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">The department <em>shall make reasonable efforts </em>to prevent the necessity of removal of a child from the child\u2019s home <em>and to reunify families that have been separated by the state. Reasonable efforts include but are not limited to </em>voluntary protective services agreements, development of individual written case plans specifying state efforts to reunify families, placement in the least disruptive setting possible, <em>provision of services pursuant to a ease plan, </em>and periodic review of each case to ensure timely progress toward reunification or permanent placement. In determining preservation or reunification services to be provided and in making reasonable efforts at providing preservation or reunification services, the child\u2019s health and safety are of paramount concern. [Emphases added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">We have observed that \u201cthe \u2018reasonable efforts\u2019 inquiry is relevant to abuse and neglect proceedings, in preventing the removal of a child or in working towards reunification of a family separated by the state.\u201d <em>In re D.B., </em>2007 MT 246, \u00b6 25, 339 Mont. 240, 168 P.3d 691. The State points out that whether the Department made reasonable efforts is not a separate requirement for termination. But it certainly is not divorced from the analysis. Rather, it is a predicate to finding that the conduct or condition rendering a parent unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time-one of the factors that is required for termination of the parent\u2019s rights. Section 41-3-609(l)(f)(ii), MCA. Except when reunification efforts are not required by law, which is not the case here, a parent\u2019s likelihood of regaining fitness to parent is informed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>her progress on the treatment plan after \u201creasonable efforts\u201d have been made to provide her with the tools to succeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\u00b646 In this case, Mother\u2019s approved treatment plan required her to complete a psychological evaluation and to follow the psychologist\u2019s recommendations and referrals regarding personal and family counseling. As noted by the Court, that evaluation occurred in February 2012. Dr. Jeffreys found Mother to have both cognitive difficulties and a more serious thought disorder, which would require psychiatric evaluation and treatment. Dr. Jeffreys explained that her diagnostic impressions were \u201cdifficult to tease out because it\u2019s hard to determine how much is a psychotic disorder and how much is mood disorder, and as she has not been medicated for any psychosis it\u2019s difficult to determine which is which.\u201d If the mental health issues were under control, Dr. Jeffreys observed, then the cognitive issues would be \u201cmore able to be dealt with.\u201d But the mental health issues \u201care much more serious.\u201d Dr. Jeffreys did not know whether Mother would be responsive to treatment for her \u201csevere\u201d mental health concerns and, as she is not a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffreys could not prescribe medication or a course of treatment for those concerns. She testified, \u201cUntil [Mother] is properly treated, it\u2019s going to be difficult to ascertain exactly what the diagnosis is. Either way, the symptoms are severe and significant and preclude her ability to parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u00b647 The Court responds to this testimony with two conclusions. First, it opines that the treatment plan appropriately required Mother to address her mental health concerns and that various service providers \u201cattempted to help Mother address them\u201d in light of the issues Dr. Jeffreys brought to light. Opinion, \u00b6 34. Second, the Court holds that, given the severity of Mother\u2019s myriad limitations, \u201cit is unlikely that Mother\u2019s ability to parent K.L. would have sufficiently improved within the relatively short period of time between removal and termination had the recommended counseling taken place.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 40.1 do not believe the necessary factual or legal predicates support these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b648 Angela Meyers, Mother\u2019s domestic violence counselor, had not seen Dr. Jeffreys\u2019 report but learned some information about it from the Department\u2019s caseworker. She testified that she also requested a psychiatric evaluation because she felt \u201cthere was more going on with [Mother]\u201d and \u201cwanted her assessed for more intense diagnosis as well as [possible] medication management.\u201d Testimony from other witnesses substantiates Dr. Jeffreys\u2019 concerns about the extent of Mother\u2019s mental health issues. She was noted to have been \u201cmouthing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>words\u201d to a non-existent person during at least one visitation session and to need \u201cdaily assistance\u201d with managing her personal grooming and hygiene and with keeping appointments. The mental health professionals were in agreement that Mother\u2019s mental health issues could not be addressed without psychiatric intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u00b649 Although the Court points out the testimony of the Department\u2019s caseworker at the termination hearing that she had placed Mother on waiting lists for a psychiatric evaluation, she did not indicate when those referrals were made. Dr. Jeffreys\u2019 evaluation occurred in February 2012 and the termination hearing was not until a year later; Grotbo testified at the June 2012 hearing on the motion to extend temporary legal custody that she had received Dr. Jeffreys\u2019 recommendations and Mother had contacted her about moving forward on them. There was no testimony that efforts had been made at that time to get Mother in to see a psychiatrist. Given the testimony at the termination hearing, had the referral been made when recommended, Mother likely could have been evaluated well before that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"AP4\">\u00b650 If Dr. Jeffreys is correct that Mother\u2019s underlying mental health issues are \u201csevere,\u201d counseling alone is not going to address them. Moreover, given her \u201cserious\u201d limitations, Mother should not be faulted for not getting herself to a psychiatrist when even the Department could only get her on a waiting list. Without any assessment of her psychiatric condition, the list of Mother\u2019s failures the Court recounts in \u00b6\u00b6 38-40 of its Opinion cannot be considered conclusive of whether Mother\u2019s condition likely could change within a reasonable time if her underlying mental illness were treated. Until that \u201creasonable effort\u201d is made and mental health treatment is explored, it is premature to conclude that Mother could not regain fitness to parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\u00b651 Further, that the child has been in foster care for many months is not insignificant, but it also is not dispositive. The Court correctly observes that the law requires a petition to terminate parental rights to be filed if a child has been in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months, unless \u201cthe department has not provided the services considered necessary for the safe return of the child to the child\u2019s home.\u201d Section 41-3-604(l)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">\u00b652 There are no easy decisions in these tragic cases. Courts struggle with balancing the child\u2019s interest in permanency and stability against the parent\u2019s fundamental liberty interests. All too often, mental health issues contribute to a parent\u2019s inability to provide for the needs of her child; I recognize the challenges the Department faces to make limited services available to a growing number of parents facing these and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>similar obstacles. I have struggled in this case, knowing that K.L. has been in a foster placement for well over two years and is thriving in her current home and that, under the best of circumstances, Mother has a long road ahead. There are times, however, when the Court must recognize that the parent has not received what the law guarantees before her rights may be terminated. In this case, the law demanded that Mother receive an adequate psychiatric assessment before the Court could make a finding that the conditions rendering her unfit were unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u00b653 Accordingly, I would reverse the order terminating N.W.\u2019s parental rights and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
