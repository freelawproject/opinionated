Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana, Inc. (BCBS) administers the Plan. McKinley Sangwin, the daughter of Steve Sangwin and Amy Sangwin Wicks, is also a beneficiary under the Plan. This case arises out of a dispute over the denial of a preauthorization request for a medical procedure for McKinley on the grounds that the procedure was \u201cexperimental for research.\u201d The State appeals the order of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, granting the Sangwins\u2019 motion for class certification. We affirm the court\u2019s order defining the class, but reverse and remand with respect to the question certified for class treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issues on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">\u00b63 <em>1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in certifying the class </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number><em>under Rule 23(a), Montana Rules of Civil Procedure?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">\u00b64 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in certifying the class under Rule 23(b), Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, and specifying for class treatment the question of whether the State breached its contract of insurance with the plaintiffs?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\u00b65 Steve Sangwin is a teacher at the Montana School for the Deaf and Blind in Cascade County, Montana. As an employee of the State, Steve is a qualified subscriber and beneficiary of the Plan. Steve and Amy\u2019s daughter, McKinley, is also a beneficiary under the Plan. McKinley was diagnosed with a severe degenerative disk disease, and when she was sixteen years old, her physicians recommended that she undergo artificial disk replacement surgery. The Sangwins requested preauthorization for the procedure from BCBS, the . Plan administrator. BCBS denied the request in an October 8, 2009 letter and explained that, because McKinley was a minor, BCBS considered the operation \u201cinvestigational.\u201d The Plan expressly excluded investigational procedures. The letter contained a reference to the exclusions and limitations section of the Employee Benefits Summary Plan Document, which stated: .\u201cThe following services and expenses are not covered: Services or procedures that are experimental procedures, as defined in Chapter 9, which are for research.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under Chapter 9, an experimental procedure or service is defined as a procedure or service that \u201cis experimental, investigational, unproven, or not a generally acceptable medical practice in the predominate [sic] opinion of independent experts utilized by the administrator of each plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ALM\">\u00b66 The Sangwins appealed the decision to the BCBS Medical Review Staff. In a December 8, 2009 letter, BCBS explained that the Medical Review Staff and Associate Medical Director had reviewed the documentation related to the preauthorization request and had decided to uphold the original denial. The Associate Medical Director further clarified that artificial disks were not Food and Drug Administration approved for patients under the age of 18. The Sangwins then filed an appeal with the State of Montana. After a meeting of the Health Care and Benefits Division appeals committee on May 6,2010, the State upheld the denial, stating that there was \u201cno <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>documentation from the Food and Drug Administration showing this procedure is appropriate for someone under the age of 18.\u201d Thus, the State considered it an experimental or investigational procedure that was specifically excluded under the Plan. After the denial, the Sangwins nonetheless proceeded with the proposed surgery, which was successful, incurring medical bills exceeding $55,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">\u00b67 On June 8, 2010, the Sangwins initiated this action by filing a complaint in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County. The Sangwins filed an amended complaint in November 2010 and set forth five counts. The only relevant count for the purposes of this appeal is the request for certification of a class action. The Sangwins alleged that McKinley\u2019s artificial disk replacement surgery was not experimental or for research. They further alleged that BCBS and the State \u201chave been denying the claims of participants and beneficiaries based on the experimental exclusion for research for years and years when the surgeries and other procedures were in no way meant for research and when, at best, the experimental exclusion for research is ambiguous and must be construed against Defendants.\u201d The Sangwins defined class members as \u201cother participants and/or beneficiaries of any such Plan in Montana which have had their employee benefits denied by the State of Montana based on the experimental exclusion for research\u201d in the past eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\u00b68 On September 20,2012, the District Court granted the Sangwins\u2019 motion for class certification. On November 23, 2012, the District Court entered an order defining the class as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">\u201cAll persons who were participants, subscribers and/or beneficiaries of the State of Montana Employee Health Plan, including the State of Montana\u2019s Blue Cross Blue Shield Managed Care Plan, the Traditional Indemnity Plan and any other health plan affiliated with the State of Montana, who have had medical benefits denied by BCBS and/or the State of Montana based on the contention that the benefits were experimental, investigational, unproven, or not generally acceptable medical practice under the language of the State of Montana Employee Benefits Summary Plan Document unless such medical benefits were \u2018for research\u2019 from January 1, 2003, through December 18, 2011. The class includes those individuals whose claims were denied prior to medical benefits being rendered as well as those individuals whose claims were denied after the medical benefits were rendered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The District Court certified four claims for class treatment, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>whether the State breached its contract, whether BCBS acted as an agent of the State and acted wrongfully, whether BCBS intentionally interfered with the contract between the State and Plaintiffs, and whether BCBS acted with malice. The District Court\u2019s order directed BCBS and the State to provide the Sangwins\u2019 counsel with the names and last known addresses of every potential class member.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">\u00b69 On September 19,2012, the District Court granted the Sangwins\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment and determined the Sangwins could pursue general tort damages against the State if they prevailed on their claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. That ruling is not subject to this interlocutory appeal. BCBS filed its notice of appeal on November 28, 2012, but later entered into a settlement with the Sangwins. BCBS is therefore not a party to this appeal. This being so, of the four issues certified for class treatment, the sole issue remaining so certified is whether the State breached its contract. The State filed its notice of appeal on December 6, 2012. The State challenges the District Court\u2019s order certifying the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s decision on a motion for class certification for an abuse of discretion. <em>Chipman v. N. W. Healthcare Corp., </em>2012 MT 242, \u00b6 17, 366 Mont. 450, 288 P.3d 193. The question is not whether this Court would have reached the same decision, but whether the district court acted arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason. <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 17 (quotation marks omitted). When reviewing a decision on class certification, we afford the trial court the broadest discretion because it \u201cis in the best position to consider the most fair and efficient procedure for conducting any given litigation.\u201d <em>Jacobsen v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>2013 MT 244, \u00b6 25, 371 Mont. 393, 310 P.3d 452 (quoting <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 17).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">\u00b611 <em>1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in certifying the class under Rule 23(a), Montana Rules of Civil Procedure?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">\u00b612 The class action is \u201can exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.\u201d <em>Comcast Corp. v. </em>Behrend,_U.S._,_, 133 S. Ct. 1426, 1432 (internal citation omitted). Departure from the usual rule is justified if the class representative is part of the class and has the same interest and injury as the class members. <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 27. \u201c[Cjlass action suits save the resources of courts and parties by permitting an issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>potentially affecting every [class member] to be litigated in an economical fashion ... .\u201d <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 27 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AJK\">\u00b613 The propriety of a class action is governed by Rule 23 of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure. Because the Montana version of Rule 23 is identical to the corresponding federal rule, federal authority on the issue of class certification is instructive. <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 43. Rule 23(a) sets forth four prerequisites necessary to sustain a class action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">\u00b614 The party seeking certification bears the burden of establishing each element of Rule 23(a). <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 43 (citation omitted). Failure to establish the requisite elements is fatal to class certification. <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 43. In addition to satisfying the requirements of Rule 23(a), a party must satisfy at least one of the provisions of Rule 23(b). M. R. Civ. P. 23(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">\u00b615 When deciding whether to certify a class, a district court should not assess any aspect of the merits unrelated to a Rule 23 requirement. <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 44. It \u201cmay be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question.\u201d <em>Comcast </em>Corp.,_U.S. at_, 133 S. Ct. at 1432 (quoting <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, </em>564 U.S._,_, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551 (2011) (internal quotation omitted)). \u201c[Certification is proper only if the trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied.\u201d <em>Comcast </em>Corp.,_U.S. at_, 133 S. Ct. at 1432 (quoting <em>Wal-Mart, </em>564 U.S. at _, 131 S. Ct. at 2551 (internal quotation omitted)). A \u201crigorous analysis\u201d frequently entails some \u201coverlap with the merits of the plaintiffs underlying claim\u201d because the \u201cclass determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiffs cause of action.\u201d <em>Comcast </em>Corp.,_U.S. at_, 133 S. Ct. at 1432 (quoting <em>Wal-Mart, </em>564 U.S. at_, 131 S. Ct. at 2551-52 (internal quotation marks omitted)). Actual, not presumed, conformance with Rule 23(a) is indispensable. <em>Wal-Mart, </em>564 U.S. at_, 131 S. Ct. at 2551 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-21\">\u00b616  In evaluating the Rule 23 requirements, the District Court properly looked beyond the pleadings to the extent necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>determine the propriety of class certification. The District Court reviewed numerous briefs, motions, objections, and over 150 of the proposed class members\u2019 preauthorization request denial letters. The District Court also held a hearing on the motion for class certification where attorneys for the Sangwins, the State, and BCBS appeared and presented arguments. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in certifying this lawsuit as a class action. Each relevant aspect of the Rule 23(a) inquiry is discussed below in further detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">A. Rule 23(a)(l)-Numerosity</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u00b617  The State does not dispute that the number of Plan participants, subscribers, or beneficiaries denied preauthorization requests for procedures that were allegedly experimental, investigational, unproven, or not generally acceptable meets the numerosity requirement. Rule 23(a)(1) requires a proposed class to be \u201cso numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\u201d \u201c[Pjlaintiffs must present some evidence of, or reasonably estimate, the number of class members.\u201d <em>Diaz v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, </em>2011 MT 322, \u00b6 31, 363 Mont. 151, 267 P.3d 756. Though the parties dispute the number of potential class members and the requirements for inclusion in the class, the District Court concluded it was \u201cclear that the numerosity element is met because the State and BCBS denied benefits based upon the \u2018experimental for research\u2019 exclusion in the State Plan and Managed Care Supplement Plan well over one-hundred times.\u201d The District Court determined the large number of potential class members made joinder impracticable. We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the Sangwins have successfully satisfied the numerosity requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">B. Rule 23(a) (2)-Commonality</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\u00b618 The State does not dispute that the commonality requirement is met. The element of commonality requires \u201cquestions of law or fact common to the class.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). Though the requirement has historically placed a relatively low burden on plaintiffs, <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 31, the U.S. Supreme Court \u201csignificantly tightened the commonality requirement\u201d in <em>Wal-Mart. Chipman, </em>\u00b6 47. The claims of class members and class representatives \u201cmust depend upon a common contention\u201d that is \u201cof such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution,\u201d \u201cmean[ing] that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\u201d <em>Wal-Mart, </em>564 U.S. at_, 131 S. Ct. at 2551.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">\u00b619 The District Court determined that the class members raised common questions of fact and law. The District Court identified both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>a uniform course of conduct by the State and BCBS in denying benefits based upon the \u201cexperimental for research\u201d exclusion and a common question of law of whether such denial was unlawful. The District Court concluded that the questions of fact and law raised by the Sangwins were sufficient to satisfy the commonality requirement and support class certification. Though the District Court relied upon the standard Montana followed prior to <em>Wal-Mart, </em>this requirement is met even under Wal-Mart\u2019s more stringent standard. All class members are connected by the denial of a preauthorization request based on the same exclusion. These common facts are related to the ultimate resolution of the dispute, namely the determination of whether such denial was wrongful.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\u00b620  We conclude that the court correctly found that the class members are connected by the denial of a preauthorization request based upon the same exclusion, and that this common connection satisfies the commonality requirement. For the reasons set forth below, however, we do not agree that there exists a predominant question of whether the denial was wrongful.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">C. Rule 23(a)(3)-Typicality</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u00b621 To satisfy the typicality element, a plaintiff must demonstrate that \u201cthe claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). The typicality requirement is designed to ensure that the interests of the named plaintiffs align with the interests of the class members, \u201cthe rationale being that a named plaintiff who vigorously pursues his or her own interests will necessarily advance the interests of the class.\u201d <em>Mattson v. Mont. Power Co., </em>2012 MT 318, \u00b6 21, 368 Mont. 1, 291 P.3d 1209 <em>(Mattson III) </em>(citing <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 53). Typicality is not a demanding standard, and a named plaintiffs claim is typical if it \u201cstems from the same <em>event, practice, </em>or <em>course of conduct </em>that forms the basis of the class claims and is based upon the same legal or remedial theory.\u201d <em>Diaz, </em>\u00b6 35 (quotation omitted; emphasis in original). The event, practice, or course of conduct need not be identical. <em>Diaz, </em>\u00b6 35. The typicality requirement \u201ctends to merge\u201d with the commonality requirement. <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 51 (internal citation omitted). It \u201cprevents plaintiffs from bringing a class action against defendants with whom they have not had any dealings.\u201d <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 51 (citing <em>Diaz, </em>\u00b6 35).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">\u00b622 The District Court concluded the Sangwins successfully established typicality. It was irrelevant to the District Court that McKinley had surgery despite the preauthorization denial because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Sangwins still suffered the same harm as the class members. The District Court found a patterned course of conduct similar to the course of conduct in Diaz. Typicality was satisfied in <em>Diaz </em>because the State\u2019s practice of employing its exclusion to third-party liability coverage constituted an event, practice, or course of conduct that the class representatives shared with the class. Diaz, \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\u00b623 The State argues that the Sangwins mistakenly equate commonality with typicality, and that the facts behind the Sangwins\u2019 claims are unique. Specifically, it notes that the Sangwins decided to go forward with treatment and incur medical bills, presumably unlike many potential plaintiffs, and that McKinley was the only underage patient for whom coverage was sought for implanting artificial intervertebral discs from 2003 to 2010. The State argues no typicality exists because the procedures denied by BCBS varied greatly and some denials were made properly. According to the State, this requirement is not met because each denial will require individual review.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b624 The Sangwins contend \u201c[t]he State has simply ignored the law on typicality under almost identical facts,\u201d including our decision in <em>Diaz. </em>The Sangwins acknowledge that facts vary among the class members. For example, the amount of damages, the desired procedure, and the timing of the denial inevitably vary. However, they argue that the Sangwins had the same dealings with the State as the putative class members, and that they all were wrongly denied benefits under the same exclusion, an exclusion the State misconstrued and misapplied in the same manner for each claim. The Sangwins argue typicality is not destroyed by the individual assessment of damages or by some variation between the claims of the Sangwins and the class members. \u00b625 In its reply brief, the State counters that the Sangwins mistakenly rely on <em>Diaz </em>when the issues and relief sought differ. The State again argues that the Sangwins\u2019 decision to proceed with the surgery and incur medical bills destroys typicality. According to the State, the District Court did not engage in the required \u201crigorous analysis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u00b626  The State misses the point of the typicality requirement by raising issues with the specific facts of the Sangwins\u2019 claim. \u201cTypicality refers to the nature of the claim or defense of the class representative, and not to the specific facts from which it arose or the relief sought.\u201d <em>Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., </em>976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992) (citation omitted). The Sangwins are members of the class as defined by the District Court. McKinley was denied preauthorization for a medical procedure under the \u201cexperimental for research\u201d exclusion. The Sangwins allege the State systematically applied the exclusion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>wrongfully deny benefits. The Sangwins\u2019 claim is based on the same legal theory as the proposed class members\u2019 claims. Despite the State\u2019s contentions, the specifics of McKinley\u2019s injuries or treatment do not render her atypical of the class. The District Court conducted a \u201crigorous analysis;\u201d it probed beyond the pleadings and determined this element actually was met. We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the Sangwins have met the typicality requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">D. Rule 23(a)(4)-Adequate Representation</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u00b627 The State does not dispute that this requirement is met. Montana Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(4) requires that \u201cthe representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\u201d Adequate representation requires that the named representatives\u2019 attorney is qualified, competent, and able to conduct the litigation, and that the named representatives\u2019 interests are not antagonistic to the class interests. <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 57 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\u00b628 The District Court determined the law firm of Hoyt <em>&amp; </em>Blewett PLLC was qualified and competent counsel. The District Court further determined the Sangwins\u2019 interests were aligned with the class\u2019s interests. We conclude that counsel will adequately representthe class, and that no conflicts exist between the Sangwins and the class members.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">\u00b629 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in certifying the class under Rule 23(b), Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, and specifying for class treatment the question of whether the State breached its contract of insurance with the plaintiffs?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\u00b630 Having determined that the Rule 23(a) prerequisites are satisfied, we now turn our inquiry to Rule 23(b). The District Court determined that the proposed class met the two requirements of Rule 23(b)(3). It is on the basis of the requirements of this rule that we reverse and remand with respect to the certified question.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">\u00b631 Rule 23(b)(3) requires a court to \u201cfind[] that the questions of law or fact common to the class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.\u201d In addition, a court must find that \u201ca class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). Matters pertinent to these findings include the class members\u2019 interests in individually controlling separate actions, the extent and nature of any already existing litigation concerning the controversy, the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation in a particular forum, and likely difficulties in managing a class action. M. R. Civ. P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>23(b)(3)(A)-(D). A central concern of the Rule 23(b)(3) predominance test is whether adjudication of common issues will help achieve judicial economy. <em>Mattson III, </em>\u00b6 39 (citing <em>Vinole v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>571 F.3d 935, 944 (9th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">\u00b632 The District Court determined class certification was appropriate because class members may not have the knowledge or resources to bring the claims individually or may be subject to the requirement of exhausting administrative remedies prior to seeking judicial relief. The District Court noted that there was no other litigation concerning the issue, and that a class action suit would be conducive to complex healthcare litigation. After acknowledging the existence of individual issues, such as damages, the District Court concluded that common questions of law or fact nonetheless predominated because BCBS and the State engaged in systematic conduct and the Sangwins and the class members suffered the same or similar injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b633 The State argues the District Court failed to make any findings of fact for Rule 23(b)(3) purposes. The State contends that common issues do not predominate because there were 158 temporally different decisions, and preauthorization denials and damages will need to be investigated individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b634 The Sangwins contend that individual calculation of damages should not preclude class determination when common liability issues predominate. They further argue the District Court\u2019s finding was supported by its \u201cdetermination that the State\u2019s systematic conduct of misconstruing the exclusion and denying claims under the same exclusion is the predominant issue of law and fact and that Sangwin and every putative plaintiff suffered a similar injury.\u201d The State counters that the District Court only superficially analyzed the predominance factors and failed to meet the federal standard set forth in <em>Wal-Mart </em>and <em>Comcast.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u00b635 As indicated, the Sangwins contend the court properly certified the question of whether the State breached its contract with the plaintiffs, and that common liability issues predominate. In this connection, they maintain in their response brief that \u201c[i]f individuals\u2019 claims were properly denied because the medical service was \u2018for research,\u2019 those members will not be a part of the class specially defined by the [District Court.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Otherwise stated, only those individuals whose requested services were <em>not </em>for research will remain in the class, and the court can then decide if the denial of services to these persons constituted a breach of contract. Herein lies the problem with the question certified by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>District Court for class resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b636 In order to make the determination of whether an individual\u2019s claims were properly denied, each claim-together with its underlying documentation including the Consent Form and supporting affidavits-will have to first be separately analyzed. As the Sangwins concede, this will have to be done before there can be a determination as to whether the individual will be part of the class, and it will clearly have to be done before there can be an assessment of whether the State breached its contract with that individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u00b637 Because factual questions must be answered on an individual basis before the plaintiffs will be in a position to establish liability, the predominance requirement under Rule 23(b)(3) is not met. <em>In re Bank of Am. Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) Contract </em>Litig., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126028, 30-39 (D. Mass., Sept. 4, 2013) (where factual questions are not susceptible to routine resolution and must be answered on an individual basis before the plaintiffs can establish liability, predominance is not satisfied). Again, Rule 23(b)(3) requires a court to \u201cfind[] that the questions of law or fact common to the class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.\u201d Common issues must therefore be more prevalent than individual issues. While we agree with the plaintiffs that the necessity to assess damages on an individual basis does not necessarily defeat class action treatment, here there is undeniably a preliminary need for an individual determination of whether each individual qualifies as a class member. As we observed in <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 48, class determination is appropriate when the class members\u2019 claims \u201cdepend on a common contention that is capable of classwide resolution.\u201d The question certified by the District Court is whether the State breached its contract with the plaintiffs. This question cannot be answered until after individual assessments are made; therefore, the certified question is incapable of being resolved on a classwide basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b638 This is not to say that the class itself was improperly certified. Rather, it is the formulation of the certified issue that results in individual issues predominating over common questions. There is seemingly one common issue of law critical to the entire class, and that is the construction of the State Plan\u2019s exclusion language. The construction of the language in the exclusion and definitions sections of the Plan may well present a common issue of law that would be appropriate for class consideration. However, it is not the province of this Court to formulate the certified question.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u00b639  For the foregoing reasons, we decline to disturb the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Court\u2019s certification of the class under the Rule 23(a). However, we reverse the District Court\u2019s certification of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim as to \u201c[wjhether the State of Montana breached its contract\u201d because it fails to satisfy the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). We remand to allow the District Court to consider whether a particular issue may be certified for which individual questions would not predominate.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b640 Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b167-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\"> In December 2011, the State revised its Employee Benefits Summary Plan Document to eliminate the phrase \u201cwhich are for research.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b167-7\">JUSTICE MCKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"A33\">concurring in part and dissenting in part, joined by JUSTICE RICE.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">\u00b641 The Court reverses the District Court\u2019s certification of a class claim-namely, \u201c[wjhether the State of Montana breached its contract\u2019-because this claims fails to satisfy the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). Opinion, \u00b6 36.1 agree with this holding. Our conclusion that \u201cfactual questions must be answered on an individual basis before the plaintiffs will be in a position to establish liability,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 34, is correct and is fatal to class certification under Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s requirement \u201cthat the questions of law or fact common to the class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">\u00b642 The Court, however, affirms the District Court\u2019s certification of the class under Rule 23(a). Opinion, \u00b6 36.1 dissent from this holding. I do not agree that the requirements of commonality and typicality have been met, and I also disagree with our conclusion that class certification is appropriate before a plausible common question of law or fact has even been identified. Although the Court reverses the District Court for certifying the question of whether the State breached its contract with the proposed class members, finding that this question \u201cis incapable of being resolved on a classwide basis,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 34, the Court nevertheless determines that commonality has been met because \u201c[ajll class members are connected by the denial of a preauthorization request based upon the same [policy] exclusion,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 19, and that typicality has been met because the Sangwins\u2019 claim \u201cis based on the same legal theory as the proposed class members\u2019 claims,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 26.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is my opinion that the Court goes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>astray in determining that a class action may be certified despite the absence of a common question of law or fact capable of generating an answer meaningful to the litigation. I cannot reconcile our analysis with that set forth in <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, </em>564 U.S._, 131 S.

It was explained to the Sangwins that artificial discs were not FDA-approved for patients under 18 and that the procedure was therefore excluded from coverage. The denial letter stated: \u201cPer BCBSMT medical policy, the patient must be greater than 18 years of age and skeletally mature to qualify for benefits. Therefore, this is considered investigational. There are significant questions remaining about potential long-term complications in such a young patient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u00b645 Of the 158 claims that BCBS denied because they were for experimental procedures, McKinley\u2019s claim is the only one denied for a minor seeking an artificial disc replacement.

Rigorous analysis is necessary because, as has been observed, \u201c \u2018[a]ny competently crafted class complaint literally raises common \u201cquestions.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551 (brackets in original) (quoting Richard A. Nagareda, <em>Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, </em>84 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 97, 131-32 (2009)). Examples of such questions include: \u201cDo all of us plaintiffs indeed work for Wal-Mart? Do our managers have discretion over pay? Is that an unlawful employment practice? What remedies should we get?\u201d <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2551. Reciting these sorts of questions \u201cis not sufficient to obtain class certification.\u201d <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2551. \u201cCommonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class members have suffered the same injury,\u201d which \u201cdoes not mean merely that they have all suffered a violation of the same provision of law\u201d-or, as here, the same provision of a contract. <em>WalMart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2551 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the class action is an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only, <em>WalMart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2550, the class action device is appropriate only where \u201c[t]he issues involved are common to the class as a whole\u201d and \u201c[t]hey turn on questions of law [or fact] applicable in the same manner to each member of the class,\u201d <em>Califano v. Yamasaki, </em>442 U.S. 682, 701, 99 S. Ct. 2545, 2557 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b647 Here, although the District Court and this Court conclude that there exists \u201ca uniform course of conduct by the State and BCBS in denying benefits based upon the \u2018experimental for research\u2019 exclusion,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 19, alleging that the State uniformly applied a provision of the insurance contract, absent anything more, does not create a common question of law or fact. A common question of law or fact is not generated merely by the Sangwins\u2019 allegations that they are part of a group of insureds who have had a particular contract provision applied adversely to them. Moreover, the Sangwins\u2019 allegation that they were <em>wrongfully </em>denied coverage does not advance their claim that a class action is appropriate. No legal theory, programmatic exclusion, policy, pattern, practice, or conduct that could establish a wrong or liability to the class as a whole has been alleged. The Sangwins\u2019 contention is indistinguishable from <em>any </em>insured who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>alleges that she was wrongfully denied benefits under the Plan and who, for that reason alone, proposes a class action and asserts commonality by virtue of being an insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b648 A review of the Plan\u2019s applicable policy provisions and the reasons for denials clearly demonstrates that the language of the \u201cexperimental\u201d-exclusion provision is both detailed and factually driven, and that the denials of the 158 claims were based on assessments of each individual illness and the type of procedure for which coverage was sought. The Court recognizes this fact in observing that, \u201c[i]n order to make the determination of whether an individual\u2019s claims were properly denied, each claim-together with its underlying documentation including the Consent Form and supporting affidavits-will have to first be separately analyzed.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 33. Yet, contrary to the requirement of a \u201crigorous analysis,\u201d <em>Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, </em>569 U.S._, 133 S. Ct. 1426, 1432 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted), nothing has been alleged or demonstrated here which supports a determination by the District Court that a program or practice exists for the denials, thereby generating a common question.</p>\n<p id=\"ANQ\">\u00b649 The facts of this case are distinguishable from our prior cases in which we have held that a class action is appropriate. <em>See McDonald v. Washington, </em>261 Mont. 392, 862 P.2d 1150 (1993) (common question of law as to whether the defendant breached a duty owed to class members to provide adequate water and service rendered class action appropriate); <em>Ferguson v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., </em>2008 MT 109, 342 Mont. 380, 180 P.3d 1164 (class action appropriate to determine whether insurer programmatically breached the duty to conduct a made-whole determination prior to subrogation); <em>Diaz v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mont., </em>2011 MT 322, 363 Mont. 151, 267 P.3d 756 (whether employees\u2019 made-whole rights were violated by the State\u2019s programmatically failing to conduct a made-whole analysis before exercising subrogation rights was appropriate for class action); <em>Chipman v. Northwest Healthcare Corp., </em>2012 MT 242, 366 Mont. 450, 288 P.3d 193 (whether an enforceable standardized group employment contract exists and what the parties\u2019 legal obligations are under the contract would generate common answers applicable to all class members); <em>Mattson v. Mont. Power Co., </em>2012 MT 318, 368 Mont. 1, 291 P.3d 1209 (whether the power company operated Kerr Dam unreasonably and caused unreasonable damage to shoreline properties was incapable of being resolved on an individual basis and was appropriate as a class action).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\u00b650 In all of these cases, there was a question of law or fact common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>to each member of the class that advanced, to some degree, the litigation of each class member\u2019s claim. In <em>Ferguson </em>and <em>Diaz, </em>the insurer\u2019s obligation of to conduct a made-whole analysis prior to subrogation applied to everyone and existed whether or not the insurance contract addressed made-whole rights. The common question was generated by the insurer\u2019s alleged programmatic conduct of subrogating first, ahead of the insured\u2019s made-whole rights. In <em>McDonald, </em>everyone in the class was drinking the same water in Butte. In <em>Mattson, </em>the dam operator could select only one elevation at which to maintain the lake at any given time, and that elevation necessarily applied to and affected all shoreline properties simultaneously. In <em>Chipman, </em>common questions concerning the employment contract applied to everyone equally and concerned coverage issues that were not factually driven by individual circumstances. The answer to the various common questions advanced the litigation as a whole and, to some degree, each class member\u2019s claim. The distinction to be drawn between these cases and the current dispute is that, here, the Sangwins have presented no common contention \u201cthat it is capable of class wide resolution-which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\u201d <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2551. Merely being \u201cconnected\u201d by the denial of a preauthorization request based on the \u201cexperimental\u201d exclusion, Opinion, \u00b6 20, does not generate a common question where, as the Court acknowledges, the question of whether class members\u2019 claims were improperly denied under this exclusion must be made on an individual basis, Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b651 I understand the desire of the Plaintiffs to have this matter proceed as a class action. The denial of benefits for an admittedly successful medical procedure on behalf of a child cries out for a remedy and a method to prevent future hardship. Such a plea, however, without anything more than a denial under a particular policy exclusion, does nothing to further the requirements of Rule 23(a). In <em>Falcon, </em>for example, the Supreme Court acknowledged that \u201cracial discrimination is by definition class discrimination.\u201d 457 U.S. at 157, 102 S. Ct. at 2370. However, the Supreme Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">[T]he allegation that such discrimination has occurred neither determines whether a class action may be maintained in accordance with Rule 23 nor defines the class that may be certified. Conceptually, there is a wide gap between (a) an individual\u2019s claim that he has been denied a promotion on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>discriminatory grounds, and his otherwise unsupported allegation that the company has a policy of discrimination, and (b) the existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same injury as that individual, such that the individual\u2019s claim and the class claims will share common questions of law or fact and that the individual\u2019s claim will be typical of the class claims. For respondent to bridge that gap, he must prove much more than the validity of his own claim. Even though evidence that he was passed over for promotion when several less deserving whites were advanced may support the conclusion that respondent was denied the promotion because of his national origin, such evidence would not necessarily justify the additional inferences (1) that this discriminatory treatment is typical of petitioner\u2019s promotion practices, (2) that petitioner\u2019s promotion practices are motivated by a policy of ethnic discrimination that pervades petitioner\u2019s Irving division, or (3) that this policy of ethnic discrimination is reflected in petitioner\u2019s other employment practices, such as hiring, in the same way it is manifested in the promotion practices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><em>Falcon, </em>457 U.S. at 157-58, 102 S. Ct. at 2370-71 (footnote omitted). \u00b652 As indicated, the crux of this case is the lack of a question of law or fact common to the class, as required by Rule 23(a)(2), and whether the Sangwins\u2019 claim is typical of the class claims pursuant to Rule 23(a)(3). Although the State argues the impropriety of class certification primarily under the headings of \u201ctypicality\u201d and \u201cpredominance,\u201d the State\u2019s substantive arguments include discussions of \u201ccommonality.\u201d In this regard, we have recognized that the requirements of Rule 23 tend to merge given the facts of the particular case. Opinion, \u00b6 21.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The State, moreover, urges this Court to apply the commonality standard set forth in <em>Wal-Mart </em>rather than the less stringent commonality standard set forth in cases such as <em>Ferguson. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>We again avoid this issue by holding (incorrectly, in my view) that commonality is met under either standard. Opinion, \u00b6 19; <em>see also Jacobsen v. Allstate Ins.

Opinion, \u00b6 15 (citing <em>Comcast, </em>133 S. Ct. at 1432, and <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2551). This Court must review a district court\u2019s determinations despite our perception that a party has not disputed a particular requirement. Here, in my view, we create confusion in our class-action jurisprudence by, on one hand, reversing the District Court\u2019s articulation of a common question of law or fact (breach of contract) while, on the other hand, affirming the District Court\u2019s conclusion that commonality and typicality have been met. While certainly there may exist a factual scenario that substantiates the existence of commonality and typicality, but not predominance, that scenario cannot exist where, as here, the District Court has been reversed on its determination of the common question. In bifurcating the common question required by Rule 23(a)(2) from the common question that must predominate under Rule 23(b)(3)-an approach for which our Opinion cites no authority-I fear we have made it difficult for the District Court in this litigation to know how to proceed, have failed to provide clear guidance regarding the parameters of class-action litigation, and have created inconsistencies within Rule 23 itself.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj3\">\u00b654 Therefore, although I agree with the Court\u2019s holding that Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s predominance requirement is not met here, I disagree with our conclusion that the commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a)(2) and (a)(3) have been satisfied. While the Court remands \u201cto allow the District Court to consider whether a particular issue may be certified for which individual questions would not predominate\u201d pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), Opinion, \u00b6 36,1 believe the District Court necessarily must determine first, as a threshold matter, whether there is a question of law or fact common to the class under Rule 23(a)(2) and whether the Sangwins\u2019 claim is typical of the class claims under Rule 23(a)(3). I would reverse the District Court\u2019s certification order in its entirety and remand accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b655 I concur and dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b175-6\">JUSTICE RICE joins the Concurrence and Dissent of JUSTICE McKinnon.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-10\"> Other than breach of contract, I have been unable to discern any other legal theory offered by the Sangwins.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-5\"> <em>See also Falcon, </em>457 U.S. at 157 n. 13, 102 S.
