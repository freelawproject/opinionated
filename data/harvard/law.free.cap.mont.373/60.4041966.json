The District Court entered summary judgment in favor of Appellee Lincoln County Port Authority (Port) on the issue of whether the Port qualified as an insured under the Allianz insurance policy. The District Court also granted the Port\u2019s motion to dismiss Allianz\u2019s counterclaim that had sought to reform the insurance policy. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-13\">\n<em>1. Whether the Port is an \u201cinsured\u201d as contemplated by the Allianz policy.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-15\">\n<em>2. Whether sufficient collateral evidence entitles Allianz to reformation of the policy.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\n<em>3. Whether the District Court correctly valued the Plywood Plant Building.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\">\n<em>4. Whether prejudgment interest began to accrue on the date of the fire at the Plywood Plant Building.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b63 The Montana Association of Counties (MACo) is a nonprofit corporation that acts on behalf of Montana\u2019s 56 counties. MACo represents the interests of county governments before the Montana legislature, administrative agencies, and the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u00b64 MACo created a property and liability self-insured risk pool, the Montana Association of Counties Joint Powers Insurance Authority (MACo/JPIA), in the 1980s. Through MACo/JPIA, MACo self-insures its member counties and related entities. MACo/JPIA obtained catastrophic property insurance to supplement its pooled fund of public monies used for self-insurance. The catastrophic insurance serves as excess insurance designed to mitigate MACo\u2019s loss on large claims that exceed a designated amount. MACo/JPIA purchased the catastrophic insurance from Allianz to cover damages over $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">\u00b65 Lincoln County is a MACo member. Lincoln County created the Port as a separate public body pursuant to \u00a7 7-14-1104, MCA. The Port seeks to foster economic development in Lincoln County through its operation of an industrial facility in Libby, Montana. The industrial facility consists of several buildings associated with a former lumber mill. The lumber mill includes a Plywood Plant Building. The Port insured the Plywood Plant Building, along with its other buildings at the lumber mill, through the MACo/JPIA self-insured risk pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">\u00b66 Part of the roof of the Port\u2019s Plywood Plant Building collapsed from heavy snow during the winter of 2007-2008. The Port submitted an insurance claim for damages caused by the collapse of the roof. Allianz assessed the damage to the Plywood Plant Building at 29% of its value. Allianz paid the Port over $3 million for the loss of this portion of the Plywood Plant Building consistent with its coverage obligations under the catastrophic insurance policy with MACo/JPIA.</p>\n<p id=\"AM_\">\u00b67 MACo/JPIA thereafter informed the Port in a June 24,2008, letter that it no longer would insure the Plywood Plant Building. The 2009-2010 schedule ofinsured locations omitted the Plywood Plant Building. This omission coincided with the Port\u2019s decision to demolish the part of the Plywood Plant Building that had collapsed due to the heavy snowfall. The Port intended to renovate the part of the Plywood Plant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Building that remained standing after the roof collapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">\u00b68 The Port was in the process of demolishing the damaged part of the Plywood Plant Building when a fire destroyed the building entirely on February 25, 2010. The Port submitted an insurance claim for damages caused by the fire to the Plywood Plant Building. MACo/JPIA and Allianz refused to cover this loss. The Port filed this suit against Allianz.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u00b69 The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Port. The District Court determined that the Allianz policy insures the Port and ordered the parties to conduct appraisal proceedings. The District Court also granted the Port\u2019s motion to dismiss Allianz\u2019s counterclaim that had sought to reform Allianz\u2019s policy to exclude coverage of the Plywood Plant Building.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\u00b6 10 During the following appraisal, the parties disagreed whether the valuation provision in Allianz\u2019s policy limited the Port\u2019s recovery for that portion of the Plywood Plant Building that had been slated for demolition to the increased cost of demolition. The District Court issued an order on May 22, 2012, that clarified that the valuation provision did not apply in appraisal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\u00b611 The District Court entered its final judgment on July 31, 2012. The District Court awarded a principal amount of $6,060,980 based on the findings of the appraisal panel and the parties\u2019 stipulation to the value of certain other damages, $1,474,560 in prejudgment interest beginning on the date of the fire, and $2,511,847 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The total award with fees and interest now exceeds $10 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">\u00b612 We review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment. <em>Bailey v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>2013 MT 119, \u00b6 18, 370 Mont. 73, 300 P.3d 1149. We review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on a M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. <em>White v. State, </em>2013 MT 187, \u00b6 15, 371 Mont. 1, 305 P.3d 795. We review for correctness a district court\u2019s legal determination. <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe v. Roman Catholic Church, </em>2013 MT 24, \u00b6 21, 368 Mont. 330, 296 P.3d 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">\u00b613 <em>Whether the Port is an \u201cinsured\u201d as contemplated by the Allianz policy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">\u00b614 The Port argues that it qualifies as an insured under the Allianz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>policy\u2019s definition. The Port claims that the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cinsured\u201d includes the MACo counties and any other entities that receive insurance through MACo/JPIA. Allianz argues that it intended this language to cover only MACo and MACo/JPIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u00b6 15 We begin our analysis by examining the insurance contract\u2019s plain language. We will not rewrite clear and explicit language in an insurance contract. <em>Monroe v. Cogswell Agency, </em>2010 MT 134, \u00b6 15, 356 Mont. 417, 234 P.3d 79. We interpret an insurance contract\u2019s terms \u201caccording to their usual, common sense meaning,\u201d that is, how they would be understood by \u201ca reasonable consumer of insurance products.\u201d <em>Steadele v. Colony Ins. Co., </em>2011 MT 208, \u00b6 18, 361 Mont. 459, 260 P.3d 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u00b616 The Allianz policy defines the \u201cinsured\u201d as MACo \u201cand its subsidiary, associated or allied company, corporation, firm, organization.\u201d All of the terms used by Allianz describe one single entity, not multiple entities. The language of the contract would lead us to believe that the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cinsured\u201d covers only MACo and one other entity, presumably MACo/JPIA. <em>Steadele, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u00b617 This understanding of \u201cinsured,\u201d however, cannot be reconciled with other provisions in the Allianz policy. We construe an insurance policy in accordance with the entirety of its terms and conditions. <em>Lambert Well Serv. u. Wellington Specialty Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 212, \u00b6 11, 344 Mont. 204, 186 P.3d 1255. In other words, we read the Allianz policy as a whole and attempt to reconcile its various parts to give the entire policy meaning and effect. <em>Lambert, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\u00b618 The Allianz policy defines \u201cinsured property\u201d to include real property and personal property. The personal property covered by the policy includes personal property of the following type: (1) \u201cowned by the Insured,\u201d (2) \u201cof officers and employees of the Insured,\u201d and (3) \u201cof others in the Insured\u2019s custody.\u201d The substitution of \u201cMACo and MACo/JPIA\u201d for the term \u201cinsured\u201d in each of these provisions would undermine the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cinsured property.\u201d MACo counties and other associated entities owned the personal property insured by the policy. MACo or MACo/JPIA did not own the personal property in question. MACo\u2019s or MACo/JPIA\u2019s employees did not own the personal property in question. And none of the personal property contemplated by the policy resided in the custody of MACo or MACo/JPIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">\u00b6 19 We note further that portion of the policy that sets forth the action to be taken in the event of a loss. The policy obligates the insured to protect the subject property from further loss or damage. The insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>also must provide an inventory of lost, destroyed, or damaged items. MACo lacks the ability to undertake the protection of the insured\u2019s properties or to prepare inventories of lost, destroyed, or damaged items. The owner of the property in question undertakes these duties.</p>\n<p id=\"AV\">\u00b620  The use of \u201cinsured\u201d under the policy\u2019s discussion of \u201cinsured property\u201d and \u201crequirements in case of loss\u201d conflict with Allianz\u2019s claim that only MACo and MACo/JPIA qualify as insureds under the policy. These provisions of the policy raise ambiguities. We must reconcile these seemingly contradictory provisions to give meaning and effect to the entire policy. <em>Lambert, </em>\u00b6 11. The disconnect between the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cinsured\u201d and its definition of \u201cinsured property\u201d and \u201crequirements in case of loss\u201d creates ambiguity regarding the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cinsured.\u201d This ambiguity requires us to look beyond the plain language of the Allianz policy\u2019s definition of \u201cinsured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b621 We consider extrinsic evidence to interpret this ambiguous provision and determine who qualifies as an intended \u201cinsured\u201d under the policy. <em>Estate of Irvine v. Oaas, </em>2013 MT 271, \u00b6 22, 372 Mont. 49, 309 P.3d 986 (allowing a court to consider extrinsic evidence when it interprets a contract that contains ambiguous terms). The extrinsic evidence demonstrates that MACo exists for the express purpose of serving as a single entity to represent Montana\u2019s counties, including Lincoln County, before the Montana legislature, administrative agencies, and the federal government. MACo has no existence separate from the collection of Montana counties that comprise its membership.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqc\">\u00b622 Lincoln County created the Port pursuant to \u00a7 7-14-1104, MCA. Section 7-14-1104 provides thatthe Port\u2019s purpose involves \u201cpublic and governmental functions.\u201d These governmental functions include promoting economic development. Section 7-14-1104(1), MCA. Subsection 2 further authorizes the Port to use any property that it owns as security to issue bonds \u201cfor an essential public and governmental purpose.\u201d Section 7-14-1104(2), -1133(4), MCA. This statute indicates that the Port, as a subunit of Lincoln County, exists in \u201cassociation] or alli[ance]\u201d with Lincoln County.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b623 The fact that the Port qualified for insurance through the MACo/JPIA insurance pool in the first place further suggests an \u201cassociation] or alli[ance]\u201d between the Port and MACo. The Port submitted its insurance applications, information, and premium payments to MACo/JPIA, similar to any other MACo/JPIA-member county. MACo/JPIA processed the Port\u2019s application and readily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>accepted its premium payment. MACo/JPIA, one of MACo\u2019s insurance pools, serves as an extension of MACo. The Port\u2019s interactions with MACo/JPIA support the Port\u2019s claim of its \u201cassociation] or alli[ance]\u201d with MACo pursuant to the terms of the Allianz policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b624 Additionally, MACo/JPIA admitted to having adopted the language for its own property insurance policy form directly from the Allianz insurance policy form. MACo/JPIA and Allianz used insurance policy forms with identical language. MACo/JPIA conceded that it insured the Port\u2019s property. The Port\u2019s satisfaction of the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d under MACo/JPIA\u2019s policy suggests that the Port also would satisfy the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d under the same language as used in the Allianz policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b625 \u201cAssociated\u201d as used in insurance policies often connotes entities closely joined with others in a common purpose. <em>Old Colony Ins. Co. v. Jeffery\u2019s Mill &amp; Warehouse, Inc., </em>146 F. Supp. 277, 279 (N.D. Cal. 1956). \u201cAssociated\u201d further implies \u201cparticipation by each of the individuals ... in the achievement of a common purpose.\u201d <em>Old Colony Ins. Co., </em>146 F. Supp. at 279. The Port performs public and governmental functions that include economic development in Lincoln County. Section 7-14-11\u00d34, MCA. Lincoln County, a political subdivision of Montana, created the Port to allow it to pursue these public and governmental functions related to economic development in Lincoln County. The Port and Lincoln County share the common purpose of performing public and governmental functions directly for the benefit of the residents of Lincoln County. The Port and Lincoln County each participate in the achievement of this common purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"AF-\">\u00b626 The Port operates under the auspices of Lincoln County. Section 7-14-1104, MCA. Lincoln County, along with other counties in Montana, in turn, created MACo to represent the interests of its member counties. MACo, too, operates under the auspices of Lincoln County and its other member counties as MACo performs its functions directly for the benefit of Lincoln County and its other member counties. These relationships comport with the common purpose and participation contemplated by the Court in <em>Old Colony Ins. Co., </em>146 F. Supp. at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b627 The Court in <em>Travelers Indem. Co. v. United States, </em>543 F.2d 71, 76 (9th Cir. 1976), explained that \u201caffiliated\u201d and \u201cassociated\u201d as used in an insurance policy should be interpreted \u201cto make them applicable to persons, things, or entities of the same general nature or class\u201d as those entities owned or controlled by the insured. The court relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>this analysis to reject a claim by the United States, acting through the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), that a subrogation waiver clause in an insurance contract shielded it from subrogation efforts by an insurer for a private electric power company. Travelers, 543 F.2d at 73. The insurer sought subrogation from BPA following an explosion at a power generation facility operated by BPA that had destroyed the private company\u2019s property. <em>Travelers, </em>543 F.2d at 73-74. The Court determined that, as a governmental entity, BPA had \u201cobjectives and responsibilities apart from those of private power companies.\u201d <em>Travelers, </em>543 F.2d at 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b628  The Port and Lincoln County perform public and governmental functions. Section 7-14-1104, MCA. MACo promotes the effective operation of its members-local political subdivisions. Entities of the same general nature possess similar responsibilities as contemplated by subrogation waiver clauses. <em>Travelers, </em>543 F.2d at 76. Extrinsic evidence leads us to conclude that the Port and Lincoln County would fit within the scope of entities of the same general nature as MACo as all three exist to promote county governmental functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b629 Further analysis of the policy also leads us to conclude that the Allianz policy does not constitute reinsurance. A policy of reinsurance with the Port, as an \u201coriginal insured,\u201d generally would bar the Port from bringing a direct claim against Allianz as a mere \u201creinsurer.\u201d <em>See </em>Steven Plitt, Daniel Maldonado &amp; Joshua D. Rogers, <em>Couch on Insurance </em>vol. 1A, \u00a7 9:30 (3d ed., West 2010) [hereinafter <em>Couch on </em>Insurancy]. The evidence instead suggests that Allianz simply provided an excess carrier high-deductible plan for the MACo/JPIA self-insurance pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u00b630 MACo/JPIA\u2019s authorizing statute provides that political subdivisions that elect to procure insurance pursuant to the section \u201cmay obtain <em>excess coverage </em>from a surplus lines insurer.\u201d Section 2-9-211(1), MCA (emphasis added). The statute indicates that the political subdivisions themselves would be the insured under any excess coverage policy. The joint powers agreement that established MACo/JPIA further supports this proposition. The agreement provides that member counties decided to create a joint risk-sharing pool to self-insure and \u201cto purchase catastrophe, excess and/or aggregate stop loss insurance when deemed prudent.\u201d Section 2-9-211(1), MCA, authorizes this type of insurance arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">\u00b631 The operation of the joint-insurance pool also supports the notion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>that Allianz provided excess insurance. MACo/JPIA listed Allianz as an insurer on the declarations page of the Port\u2019s policy. The Port negotiated directly with Allianz in handling an earlier claim. All of these items of extrinsic evidence offer further indicia that Allianz served as an excess insurance carrier, rather than as a reinsurer. Allianz\u2019s status as an excess insurance carrier normally would allow the Port to bring a claim directly against Allianz as an insured. <em>See Tex. Dept. of Ins. v. Am. Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>55 Tex. Sup. J. 705 (Tex. 2012) (providing that excess insurance represents \u201can agreement to indemnify against any loss that exceeds the [insured\u2019s] amount of primary or other coverage\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b632 The Port would not necessarily be precluded from bringing a claim against Allianz even if Allianz had served as a reinsurer. The record indicates that the Port dealt directly with Allianz when the Plywood Plant Building\u2019s roof collapsed. Consistent direct contact between an original insured (the Port) and a reinsurer (Allianz) may waive a reinsurer\u2019s right to immunity from being sued by an original insured. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Administratia Asigurarilor De Stat, </em>948 F. Supp. 285, 307-08 (S.D.N.Y. 1996); <em>Couch on Insurance </em>at \u00a7 9:30.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b633  We must construe ambiguous language in a contract against the contract\u2019s drafter. <em>Mary J. Baker Revocable Trust v. Cenex Harvest States, Coops., Inc., </em>2007 MT 159, \u00b6 34, 338 Mont. 41, 164 P.3d 851. Allianz drafted the policy. We construe against Allianz the Allianz policy\u2019s use of \u201cassociated or allied\u201d when combined with the policy\u2019s discussion of \u201cinsured property\u201d and \u201crequirements in case of loss.\u201d <em>Mary J. Baker, </em>\u00b6 34. We agree with the District Court\u2019s determination that the Port qualifies as an insured under the terms of the Allianz policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u00b634 <em>Whether sufficient collateral evidence entitles Allianz to reformation of the policy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">\u00b635 Allianz argues that Allianz and the Port both understood that the Allianz policy would not cover the Plywood Plant Building. Allianz relies primarily upon the notice from MACo/JPIA to the Port that the Plywood Plant Building no longer would be insured. Allianz seeks to reform the contract to conform to what it describes as the parties\u2019 original intent. Allianz seeks to add language to the Allianz policy that specifically would exclude the Plywood Plant Building from any coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">\u00b636 The District Court determined that \u00a7 33-15-302, MCA, prohibits reformation of insurance policies. The Port suggests that we need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>determine whether \u00a7 33-15-302, MCA, bars reformation of an insurance contract as reformation cannot be used to correct an unforeseen legal effect of an insurer\u2019s policy. The Port underscores that the Allianz policy provides insurance for any \u201clocation\u201d listed on the latest schedule. The policy also provides that \u201c[i]nsured [l]ocation(s) includes the area within one thousand (1,000) feet of such \u2018location.\u2019 \u201d The Plywood Plant Building sat within 1,000 feet of an insured building included on the schedule of insured locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b637 We will revise a contract when, through fraud, mutual mistake of the parties, or a mistake of one party which the other at the time knew or suspected, a written contract does not truly express the intention of the parties. <em>Thibodeau v. Bechtold, </em>2008 MT 412, \u00b6 22, 347 Mont. 277, 198 P.3d 785 (citing \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA). To obtain judicial reformation, the parties must have reached a mutual understanding and executed a written contract in furtherance of that understanding, but made a mistake incorporating the understanding that they had reached into the contract that they executed. <em>Thibodeau, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u00b638 The record makes Allianz\u2019s and the Port\u2019s intent clear: to exclude the Plywood Plant Building, and only the Plywood Plant Building, from coverage under the 2009-2010 Allianz policy. Allianz had paid coverage for the Plywood Plant Building following the collapse of the roof in 2008. Allianz canceled coverage for the Plywood Plant Building after the roofs collapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b639 The Trust Administrator for MACo/JPIA attested that \u201cMACo/JPIA [had] sent a letter to Tom Wood, the local insurance agent, cancelling property coverage and premise liability coverage for the Plywood Plant <em>Building.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). MACo/JPIA subsequently informed the Port in writing on June 24, 2008, that the \u201c[p]roperty and [liability coverage for the Plywood [P]lant <em>[B'iuilding </em>for the Lincoln Port Authority ... is cancelled effective July 1, 2008.\u201d (Emphasis added). This letter mentions only the Plywood Plant <em>Building.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\u00b640 Thomas Wood (Wood), the owner of the insurance agency that had helped the Port obtain insurance coverage, forwarded another copy of MACo/JPIA\u2019s letter to the Port with his own cover letter on June 26, 2008. Wood attested in his affidavit that his letter had \u201cadvis[ed the Port] that there were no other insurance markets that would insure the Plywood Plant <em>Building.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Wood further attested that the Port prepared a \u201crevised S.O.V. [Statement of Values] removing the Plywood Plant <em>Building\u201d </em>that was \u201c[b]ased on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>MACo/JPIA\u2019s advisement that it would no longer insure the Plywood Plant <em>Building.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b641 The Port understood that no coverage existed for the Plywood Plant Building, and acted accordingly. The Port submitted a Statement of Values following the notice of canceled coverage under the 2009-2010 Allianz Policy. The Port\u2019s Statement of Values included each building that had been in the prior Statement of Values with the specific omission of the Plywood Plant Building. This sole omission clarified the Port\u2019s understanding of the canceled coverage under the 2009-2010 Allianz Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u00b642 Publicity surrounding the fire that destroyed the Plywood Plant Building is further informative. The <em>Missoulian </em>reported the Port\u2019s belief on February 26, 2010, that \u201cthe <em>building itself </em>was not insured ... \u2018ever since the snow collapsed parts of the roof, the insurance company dropped us.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added). Libby\u2019s <em>The Western News </em>reported the industrial site manager\u2019s statement on March 8, 2010, that \u201cthe industrial site\u2019s insurance on the <em>building </em>had been dropped when the company paid a $3.2 million settlement after the roof collapsed two years ago.\u201d (Emphasis added). The record makes clear that the parties mutually understood that coverage for the Plywood Plant Building, and only the Plywood Plant Building, no longer existed. Thibodeau, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b643 The parties created a revised contract based upon their shared understanding. The 2009-2010 Allianz policy incorporated the Port\u2019s revised Statement of Values, which specifically had excluded the Plywood Plant Building from the schedule of covered properties. The revised schedule of covered properties in the 2009-2010 Allianz policy represents the parties\u2019 incorporation of their mutual understanding into the writing. <em>Thibodeau, </em>\u00b6 22. Allianz now claims, however, that both parties also intended the Allianz policy to exclude coverage of the area within the 1,000 foot radius of other buildings. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u00b644 The record contains no indication that either Allianz or the Port intended to exclude coverage of the area within the 1,000 foot radius of other covered buildings, regardless of what that area contained. The parties agreed that the Plywood Plant Building itself would no longer be covered. They did not agree that any salvage materials located within 1,000 feet of other covered buildings would not be covered. The parties reached a mutual understanding that Allianz no longer would cover the Plywood Plant Building, and only the Plywood Plant Building. The parties committed that understanding to writing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>2009-2010 Allianz policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\u00b645 The evidence in the record upon which Allianz relies to argue for reformation to exclude the 1,000 foot radius fails to indicate any intent to exclude that radius. Allianz relies heavily upon the facts that the Port did not include the Plywood Plant Building in the Statement of Values and that the Port did not pay any premium to Allianz for the Plywood Plant Building. The Port undertook both of these actions, however, in furtherance of its understanding that Allianz would not provide coverage for the Plywood Plant Building in the 2009-2010 Allianz policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b646 Allianz does not identify any other evidence in the record that would indicate the parties\u2019 mutual intent to exclude the 1,000 foot radius. Allianz has failed to establish that the 2009-2010 insurance policy expressed anything other than what the parties mutually had intended. We decline to reform the 2009-2010 Allianz policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u00b647 We need not reach Allianz\u2019s arguments that Montana law allows reformation of an insurance policy. Reformation as a contract remedy remains available only in those situations where a discrepancy exists between the understanding that parties reached and the contract that they executed. <em>Thibodeau, </em>\u00b6 22. The absence of a discrepancy eliminates reformation as a remedy. <em>Thibodeau, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\u00b648  In the absence of a discrepancy, \u201cthe language of a contract governs its interpretation if that language is clear and explicit.\u201d <em>Heggem v. Capitol Indem. Corp., </em>2007 MT 74, \u00b6 22, 336 Mont. 429, 154 P.3d 1189 (citing \u00a7 28-3-401, MCA). The Port and Allianz each agreed to a contract that specified that \u201c[i]nsured [l]ocation(s) include[] the area within one thousand (1,000) feet of such \u201clocation,\u201d\u2019 referring to any location listed in the 2009-2010 schedule of coverage. The Port paid a premium to Allianz in order to receive this 1,000-foot coverage under Allianz\u2019s policy. Neither party disputes that the remnants of the Plywood Plant Building fall squarely within the 1,000-foot radius covered by Allianz\u2019s policy. The language in the 2009-2010 Allianz policy clearly and explicitly indicates that Allianz will provide coverage to the area within 1,000 feet of any covered location. Allianz must provide that coverage. The language of the Allianz policy provides the Port with coverage for the remnants of the Plywood Plant Building. \u00b649 The Dissent posits that the parties never intended for the general provision that insures property within 1,000 feet of an insured location to cover locations deleted from coverage. (J. Rice Dissenting, \u00b6 73.) Allianz would not need to seek reformation if the policy clearly stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>as. much. The fact that Allianz seeks reformation of the policy represents a tacit acknowledgment that the policy as written covers the Plant remnants. The Dissent further maintains that under this Court\u2019s interpretation, coverage for a particular property never could be deleted unless the parties rewrote the policy. Any required rewrite would be simple and easily applied along the following lines: \u201cInsured Location(s) includes the area within one thousand (1,000) feet of such \u2018location,\u2019 <em>unless the location for which recovery is sought specifically has been deleted from coverage. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u00b650 Perhaps Allianz neglected to change its policy to reflect its apparent belief that the Plywood Plant Building would not be covered under any circumstances. Equity does not require us \u201cto reform a contract to correct an error ... when due diligence would have uncovered and corrected the error.\u201d <em>Martin v. Crown Life Ins. Co., </em>202 Mont. 461, 469, 658 P.2d 1099, 1104 (1983). The defendant in <em>Martin, </em>an insurance company, waited more than a year to correct an error that it had made in its insurance policy and certificate of insurance. <em>Martin, </em>202 Mont. at 469, 658 P.2d at 1103. We refused to reform the contract to correct the insurance company\u2019s mistake in the absence of its own due diligence. <em>Martin, </em>202 Mont. at 469, 658 P.2d at 1104. \u00b651 Allianz, too, waited more than a year to modify its policy to eliminate any ambiguity whether it covered the Plywood Plant Building as being located within 1,000 feet of an insured building. Allianz\u2019s exercise of due diligence should have discovered any error in the content of its insurance policy. Allianz has failed to establish that its insurance policy expressed something other than what the parties mutually had intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u00b652 <em>Whether the District Court correctly valued the Plywood Plant Building.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u00b653 The District Court ordered Allianz and the Port each to select an appraiser to determine how much Allianz owes the Port under the policy. Allianz argues that the adjustment procedure in the valuation section of its policy should have guided the appraisers in determining the amount of loss that the Port should receive. The adjustment procedure in section 10(f) addresses property scheduled for demolition. Allianz maintains that section 10(f) limits the Port\u2019s recovery to the \u201cincreased cost of demolition\u201d for the portion of the Plywood Plant Building that the Port had slated for demolition.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u00b654 The section of Allianz\u2019s policy that addresses appraisal does not require appraisers to follow Allianz\u2019s valuation scheme. Indeed, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>section provides no limitations on the valuation of property scheduled for demolition. The valuation provision for property scheduled for demolition applies only when the parties agree on the amount of loss. The valuation provision has no relevance when the parties agree to submit their valuation to an appraiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\u00b655 The fact that the appraisers do not have to follow the Allianz policy\u2019s adjustment procedures does not relieve their valuation of the Plywood Plant Building of all restrictions. Allianz\u2019s policy stipulates that appraisers will determine the amount of loss based upon \u201cactual cash value\u201d and \u201creplacement cost.\u201d Allianz\u2019s policy defines \u201cactual cash value\u201d as the cost of replacement minus depreciation. Allianz\u2019s policy dictates that the insured shall receive \u201cactual cash value\u201d if an insured fails to repair or replace its damaged property within two years. An insured receives \u201creplacement cost\u201d only if the insured repairs or replaces within two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b656 The parties disagree whether the Port should receive \u201creplacement costs\u201d for those portions of the Plywood Plant Building that the Port had slated for demolition. This disagreement revolves around the $1,925,000 that the appraisers have determined represents the \u201creplacement cost\u201d for those portions of the Plywood Plant Building that had been slated for demolition.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u00b657 The District Court allowed the Port to choose \u201creplacement cost\u201d even for those portions of the Plywood Plant Building that the Port had slated for demolition. The District Court waived the requirement in the policy that the Port had to repair or replace the damaged building within two years. This two-year repair window had lapsed since the 2010 fire. The District Court relied on the fact that Allianz\u2019s wrongful denial of coverage had stymied any efforts by the Port to rebuild.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\u00b658 The District Court cited numerous cases to support its determination. The cases focus on the fact that insurers\u2019 refusals to pay recovery to their insureds prevented the insureds from repairing or replacing as the insureds lacked sufficient money for such efforts. <em>See Zaitchick v. American Motorists Ins. Co., </em>554 F. Supp. 209, 217 (S.D.N.Y. 1982), <em>aff'd, </em>742 F.2d 1441 (2d Cir. 1983); <em>Columbia Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sanford, </em>920 S.W.2d 28, 30 (Ark. App. 1996); <em>Pollock v. Fire Ins. Exch., </em>423 N.W.2d 234, 236-37 (Mich. App. 1988). In two of the cited <em>cases</em>\u2014Conrad <em>Bros. v. John Deere Ins. Co., </em>640 N.W.2d 231, 242 (Iowa 2001) and <em>Bailey v. Farmers Union Coop. Ins. Co., </em>498 N.W.2d 591, 598-99 (Neb. App. 1992)-courts determined that the insured parties would have rebuilt, <em>but for </em>repudiation of their policies by their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u00b659 The Port never intended to rebuild the damaged portions of the Plywood Plant Building before the 2010 fire. The Port received over $3 million for the damage to the Plywood Plant Building after the roof collapsed during the winter of2007-2008. The Port in fact affirmatively intended to demolish those portions of the Plywood Plant Building that had been damaged from the roof collapse before the 2010 fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b660 The Port apparently did not replace or repair any portions of the Plywood Plant Building that had been slated for demolition within two years of the fire. The Port would receive far more for the Plywood Plant Building than it had contemplated under the policy if we allow the Port to elect to receive \u201creplacement cost\u201d for those portions of the Plywood Plant Building that it had not intended to repair or replace.</p>\n<p id=\"AeY\">\u00b661  Property insurance serves to place the insured in the same position in which he would have been had there been no loss. <em>See Lee v. Providence Wash. Ins. Co., </em>82 Mont. 264, 276, 266 P. 640, 644 (1928). The Port would land in a better place than it would have without the fire if we allow the Port to receive \u201creplacement cost\u201d for those portions of the Plywood Plant Building that it had slated for demolition. The Port should receive only \u201cactual cash value\u201d for those portions of the Plywood Plant Building that it had slated for demolition. Most likely \u201cactual cash value\u201d for those portions of the Plywood Plant Building that the Port had slated for demolition will amount only to salvage value as these portions of the building have depreciated greatly. We reverse the District Court\u2019s determination that the Port should receive \u201creplacement cost\u201d for the portions of the Plywood Plant Building that had been slated for demolition.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\u00b662 <em>Whether prejudgment, interest began to accrue on the date of the fire at the Plywood Plant Building.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">\u00b663 The Port seeks to recover interest, pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, from the date of the fire that destroyed the Plywood Plant Building. Section 27-1-211, MCA, allows an insured party to recover interest under certain circumstances. A party must fulfill three prerequisites: (1) \u201can underlying monetary obligation must exist,\u201d (2) \u201cthe amount of recovery must be capable of being made certain,\u201d and (3) \u201cthe right to recover must vest on a particular day.\u201d <em>Mont. Petroleum Tank Release Comp. Bd. v. Crumleys, Inc., </em>2008 MT 2, \u00b6 99, 341 Mont. 33, 174 P.3d 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">\u00b664 Conversely, an award of prejudgment interest would not be available \u201cwhen the amount of a party\u2019s damages is uncertain or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>disputed.\u201d <em>Crumleys, </em>\u00b6 99. The insurer in <em>Crumleys </em>had breached its duty to indemnify its insured\u2019s loss that had resulted from a leak in an underground diesel tank. <em>Crumleys, </em>\u00b6 1. The parties could not ascertain the amount of damages that had occurred as a result of the breach until the date that the jury returned a verdict and awarded damages. <em>Crumleys, </em>\u00b6 100. Under those circumstances, \u201cno interest can run until a fixed amount of damages has been arrived at, either by agreement, appraisal, or judgment.\u201d <em>Crumleys, </em>\u00b6 100 (quoting <em>Northern Mont. Hosp. v. Knight, </em>248 Mont. 310, 321, 811 P.2d 1276, 1282 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\u00b665 Allianz disputed whether it insured the Plywood Plant Building from the time that the Port submitted its claim. The amount of damages remains uncertain. The complexity of this case prevents the Port from invoking \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, in order to argue that prejudgment interest should have begun to accrue on the date of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b666 The Port argues alternatively that \u00a7 27-1-312, MCA, not \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, controls the outcome. Section 27-1-312, MCA, provides that the \u201cdetriment caused by the breach of an obligation to pay money only is deemed to be the amount due by the terms of the obligation with interest thereon.\u201d The \u201camount due by the terms of the obligation\u201d in this case remains, however, far from clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u00b667 We agree that Allianz must pay interest. The language of both \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, and \u00a7 27-1-312, MCA, indicates that Allianz must pay interest on the amount that it owes the Port. Section 27-1-312, MCA, remains silent as to the date on which interest should begin to accrue. Section 27-1-312, MCA, refers to \u201cthe amount due by the terms of the obligation.\u201d Section 27-1-312, MCA, provides no guidance regarding timing. On the other hand, \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, entitles a party to recover damages once they are \u201ccertain or capable of being made certain by calculation.\u201d We must rely on \u00a7 27-1-211, MCA, to determine <em>when </em>interest began to accrue on the amount of damages that Allianz must pay to the Port.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">\u00b668 The date of the fire cannot mark the date that interest began to accrue. <em>See Crumleys, </em>\u00b6 99. The amount of damages remained incapable of being made certain by calculation at the time of the fire. A numerical amount for damages actually must be calculated, or be capable of calculation, before interest can begin to accrue. Section 27-1-211, MCA; <em>see also, Northern Mont. Hosp., </em>248 Mont. at 320-21, 811 P.2d at 1282. For example, in <em>Northern Montana Hospital </em>we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>determined that the right to recover interest vested only on the date that the jury returned a verdict for the monetary amount of $1,750,000. <em>Northern Mont. </em>Hosp., 248 Mont. at 321, 811 P.2d at 1282. Here, the parties could not agree on how the appraisers should calculate the damages. No amount could be assigned for the damages to the portion of the Plywood Plant Building that the Port had slated for demolition.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\u00b669 The District Court on remand will determine the amount of damages that Allianz owes the Port for those portions of the Plywood Plant Building that had been slated for demolition. The damages at that point will be \u201ccapable of being made certain by calculation.\u201d Section 27-1-211,'MCA. The Port will receive \u201cactual cash value\u201d for the portions of the Plywood Plant Building that it had slated for demolition. The appraisers can calculate this value. The District Court\u2019s adoption of the appraiser\u2019s new valuation on remand will mark the point at which interest shall begin to accrue. The Port\u2019s loss entitles it to post-judgment interest, but not prejudgment interest for those portions of the Plywood Plant Building that had been slated for demolition. Section 27-1-211, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u00b670 We affirm the District Court\u2019s determination that Allianz\u2019s policy provides coverage for the Plywood Plant Building based upon its location within 1,000 feet of a covered building. We also affirm the District Court\u2019s refusal to reform the Allianz policy. We reverse, however, the District Court\u2019s award of \u201creplacement cost\u201d for those portions of the Plywood Plant Building that the Port had slated for demolition. We further remand to allow the District Court to calculate post-judgment interest owed to the Port for the damages owed under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">\u00b671 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b100-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b100-9\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"A12\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">\u00b672 I agree with the Court that the parties clearly intended to exclude the Plywood Plant Building from coverage, clearly acted to implement this intention, and that the consequence of their action was that coverage for the Building \u201cno longer existed.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 42. However, I disagree with the Court\u2019s further conclusion that the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>nonetheless did not exclude <em>\u201cthe remnants of </em>the Plywood Plant Building\u201d from coverage-as if the remnants of the Building somehow acquired a different character than the Building itself, a conclusion for which no support is offered. Opinion, \u00b6 48 (emphasis added). Thomas Wood\u2019s June 26, 2008 letter advised the Port \u201cthat there is NO COVERAGE (property or liability) on the old plywood plant location\u201d (caps in original, italics added). Following the cancellation of coverage, the Port\u2019s property insurance premium went down from $19,210 to $7,004. Thus, there was no consideration for coverage for the Building. The Court declares Allianz to be an excess insurer, Opinion, \u00b6 31, but there can be no excess coverage if there was no consideration for primary coverage. I disagree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that an insurance contract cannot be reformed. Although we should affirmatively declare that there was no coverage at all because of the failure of consideration, Allianz is at least entitled to reformation of the contract to conform it to the parties\u2019 clear intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\u00b673 I further disagree that the parties\u2019 specific action to delete the Building from coverage was counteracted by the general provision insuring property within 1,000 feet of an insured location, and that it was legally impossible to delete coverage for a particular building unless Allianz \u201cchange[d] its policy to reflect its apparent belief that the Plywood Plant Building would not be covered under any circumstances.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 50. Under the Court\u2019s policy interpretation, coverage for a particular property could never be deleted unless the policy was rewritten. This lacks any sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\u00b674 I would reverse and enter judgment for Allianz.</p>\n<judges id=\"b101-6\">JUSTICE BAKER joins in the dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b101-7\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"A1x\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">\u00b675 I dissent from the decision of the Court holding that the Lincoln County Port Authority (Port) was an insured party under the terms of the Allianz policy. The plain, unambiguous language of the Allianz policy does not include the Port as an insured party. Nevertheless, the Court concludes that the policy is ambiguous and moves on to an analysis of the extrinsic evidence. In so doing, the Court mischaracterizes the relationship between the Montana Association of Counties (MACo) and the Port. The result reached by the Court disregards the general intent of the contract and is supported by neither the facts nor the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">\u00b676 When this Court is asked to interpret a written contract, \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>intention of the parties is to be ascertained from the writing alone if possible ....\u201d Section 28-3-303, MCA. As the Court observes, the plain language of the Allianz policy identifies the insured as MACo \u201cand its subsidiary, associated or allied company, corporation, firm, [or] organization.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 16. The use of the singular form of \u201csubsidiary, associated or allied company, corporation, firm, [or] organization\u201d indicates that the parties contemplated only one such associated or allied entity, specifically, Montana Association of Counties Joint Powers Insurance Authority (MACo/JPIA). Opinion, \u00b6 16. The plain language definition of \u201cinsured\u201d in the Allianz policy clearly indicates that the parties did not intend each of the counties and special districts insured by MACo/JPIA to be named as insured in the Allianz policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b677 Had the parties intended for each county or public entity to be insured directly by Allianz, the policy itself provided a clear way of expressing this intent. The policy includes separate designations for \u201cInsured\u201d and \u201cFirst Named Insured\u201d parties. The \u201cFirst Named Insured\u201d bears responsibility for payment of premiums and is authorized to cancel the policy. The parties could, therefore, have listed the Port and other entities insured by MACo/JPIA as the \u201cInsured\u201d on the Allianz policy and designated MACo as the \u201cFirst Named Insured\u201d responsible for management of the policy. The parties did not do so, and instead chose to designate MACo as both the \u201cInsured\u201d and the \u201cFirst Named Insured.\u201d The contract, on its face, evidences the parties\u2019 intent to name only MACo and its single associated entity, MACo/JPIA, as the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u00b678 The Court concludes that the policy\u2019s definition of insured personal property is ambiguous, and therefore proceeds to consider extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intent. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. This Court has not been asked to construe the policy as applied to personal property, however, and the Court disregards completely the definition of insured real property. The policy\u2019s definition ofinsured real property is unambiguous and fully consistent with the designation of MACo and MACo/JPIA as the named insured. The Allianz policy states that the insured property includes \u201c[r]eal property in which the Insured has an insurable interest.\u201d An insurable interest in property is \u201cany actual, lawful, and substantial economic interest in the safety or preservation of the subject of the insurance free from loss, destruction, or pecuniary damage or impairment.\u201d Section 33-15-205(2), MCA. An insurable interest need not be an ownership or possessory interest. Rather, \u201cany <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>person has an insurable interest in property, by the existence of which he will gain an advantage, or by the destruction of which he will suffer a loss ... .\u201d <em>Harrison v. Fortlage, </em>161 U.S. 57, 65, 16 S. Ct. 488, 490 <em>(1896), Atlas Assurance Co. v. Harper, Robinson Ship. Co., </em>508 F.2d 1381, 1386, (9th Cir. <em>1975); Bird v. Central Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>168 Ore. 1, 6, 120 P.2d 753, 755 (1942) (\u201cIt is sufficient to constitute an insurable interest in property that the insured is so situated with reference to the property that he would be liable to loss should it be injured or destroyed by the peril against which it is insured.\u201d). As an insurer of the Port, MACo/JPIA was financially liable for losses resulting from the destruction of property owned by the Port. Therefore, MACo/JPIA had an insurable interest in real property owned by the Port. Section 33-15-205(2), MCA. The policy\u2019s clear designation of MACo and MACo/JPIA as the insured parties is fully consistent with the policy\u2019s definition of insurable real property. The terms require no additional interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u00b679 The Court also concludes that the duties to be undertaken by the insured in the event of a loss are inconsistent with a reading of MACo and MACo/JPIA as the insured. Opinion, \u00b6 19. The policy requires the insured to protect the property from further loss or damage and to provide an inventory of lost or damaged property. The Court concludes, with no analysis, that MACo and MACo/JPIA lack the ability to undertake these duties. Opinion, \u00b6 19. The Joint Powers Agreement establishing MACo/JPIA, however, authorizes MACo/JPIA to \u201cestablish reasonable and necessary loss reduction and prevention procedures to be followed by the members\u201d and to \u201cprovide risk management and claim adjustment.\u201d Members are obligated to allow MACo/JPIA \u201creasonable access to all premises of the member and all member records.\u201d Members must also \u201ccooperate fully\u201d with MACo/JPIA for the adjustment of claims, \u201cfollow [...] loss reduction and prevention procedures,\u201d and provide MACo/JPIA with \u201cinformation on the value of buildings and contents.\u201d Members may be expelled from the MACo/JPIA pool for failure to comply with loss prevention procedures or failure to provide reasonable access to all facilities and records.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b680 With these powers in place, there is no reason to think that MACo and MACo/JPIA would be incapable of providing to Allianz an inventory of damaged property or acting to prevent further loss or damage to that property. Indeed, preparing an inventory of damaged property would appear to be essential to the exercise of MACo/JPIA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>enumerated power to \u201cprovide risk management and claim adjustment.\u201d MACo/JPIA is explicitly authorized to gain access to the premises of its members and to impose loss prevention procedures, which its members are required to follow. The provisions of the policy defining the responsibilities of the insured are not inconsistent with the designation of MACo and MACo/JPIA as insured parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b681 Moreover, the Court, having determined that consideration of extrinsic evidence is necessary to interpret the policy, mischaracterizes the nature of that evidence. The Court concludes that MACo and the Port are \u201cassociated or allied\u201d because each had a relationship with Lincoln County and because the Port paid insurance premiums to MACo/JPIA. This conclusion is not only inconsistent with case law defining the terms \u201cassociated or allied.\u201d It also defies common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"A4L\">\u00b682 The Court states that MACo exists to represent Montana counties before the state legislature, administrative agencies, and the federal government. Opinion, \u00b6 21. The Court goes on to state that the Port exists for the purpose of promoting economic development in Lincoln County. Opinion, \u00b6 22. The Court then concludes that these two organizations can be considered \u201cassociated or allied\u201d because they serve the common purpose of \u201cpromoting] county governmental functions.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 28. This is an unrealistically broad depiction of the purposes of MACo and the Port. MACo represents the general interests of Montana counties, not only Lincoln County. The Port, on the other hand, serves the limited purpose of promoting commerce and economic development exclusively within Lincoln County. While one does not wish to doubt the existence of collegiality among the governments of Montana counties, it is nevertheless apparent that the economic interests of a single county will not always be identical to the general interests of counties throughout the state. The facts do not support the conclusion that MACo and the Port have a common purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b683 Nor does the law support the conclusion that MACo and the Port are \u201cassociated or allied.\u201d The Court relies on <em>Old Colony Insurance </em>for the proposition that a common purpose is sufficient to establish an association or alliance, but ignores the facts of that case, which established that two entities were associated when they had entered mutual agreements and traded shares of stock in such a way that one entity was effectively placed within the control of the other. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26; <em>Old Colony Ins. Co. v. Jeffery\u2019s Mill &amp; Warehouse, </em>Inc., 146 F. Supp. 277, 279-80 (N.D. Cal. 1956). <em>Old Colony Insurance </em>also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>defined \u201cassociated\u201d entities not simply as those possessing a common purpose, but as those \u201c[cjlosely connected or joined in a united action for a common purpose, interest, activity, objective, or the like.\u201d <em>Old Colony Ins. Co., </em>146 F. Supp. at 279. Undisputedly, MACo did not control the Port, and the Port did not control MACo. MACo and the Port each have a relationship with Lincoln County, but they serve distinct purposes. They are not closely connected or joined, and they are not participants in a united action.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b684 In <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. v. United States, </em>the terms \u201caffiliated\u201d and \u201cassociated\u201d were interpreted to \u201cenvision an intimate business relationship in which significant aspects of financial and managerial control of the insured and the affiliate or associate are integrated. More is required than common ownership and a limited sharing of facilities which aids each owner to pursue his independent and separate objectives.\u201d <em>Travelers Indem. Co. v. United States, </em>543 F.2d 71, 76 (9th Cir. 1976). The Ninth Circuit then concluded that \u201cmutuality of interest\u201d was not sufficient to establish an association between \u201cindependent entities each pursuing separate and distinct objectives.\u201d <em>Travelers Indem. Co., </em>543 F.2d at 76. Here, MACo and the Port have no common ownership. MACo and the Port have no integration of financial and managerial control. Although MACo and the Port share some mutuality of interest, they are independent entities each pursuing separate objectives. The law does not support the conclusion that the Port was a \u201csubsidiary, associated or allied company, corporation, firm, [or] organization\u201d of MACo.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b685 The Court also addresses the only direct relationship between MACo and the Port: the contractual relationship between MACo/JPIA and the Port. The Court suggests that by submitting an insurance application and premium payments to MACo/JPIA, the Port became \u201cassociated or allied\u201d with MACo. Opinion, \u00b6 23. It is clear, however, that \u201can arm\u2019s length contractual relationship would not constitute an association or affiliation.\u201d <em>Travelers Indem. Co., </em>543 F.2d at 76 n. 5 (citing In <em>re Marine Sulphur Transp. Corp., </em>312 F. Supp. 1081, 1103 (S.D.N.Y. 1970), aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 460 F.2d 89 (2d Cir. 1972)). The commonplace act of paying an insurance bill simply cannot be enough to establish a relationship as a \u201csubsidiary, associated or allied company, corporation, firm, [or] organization.\u201d The Court\u2019s holding would transform ordinary consumers into corporate subsidiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b686 Having concluded that the Port is the insured party under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Allianz policy, the Court then characterizes the policy as excess insurance, to be paid directly to the Port only after it has exhausted its primary coverage. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 29-32. This raises the question of what primary insurance coverage, if any, the Port had. The Court notes that MACo/JPIA has conceded that it insured the Port\u2019s property. Opinion, \u00b6 24. If the Allianz policy is to be applied as excess coverage, as the Court asserts, then Allianz\u2019s liability would arise only after MACo/JPIA\u2019s liability had been exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b687 The declarations page of the policy issued by MACo/JPIA to the Port reads: \u201c[Ajuthority agrees to provide coverage as follows:... Real &amp; Personal Property Blanket Replacement $100,000,000/occurrence.\u201d The second page of the policy sets out the \u201cLimits of Liability\u201d for the policy, and states: \u201cProperty Blanket Replacement at $100,000,000/occurrence to building/contents.\u201d The following page defines the deductible for the MACo/JPIA policy, stating that MACo/JPIA\u2019s liability \u201cshall not be charged within the first $1,000 for any loss arising under Section[ ] I,\u201d which includes the real and personal property coverage. The MACo/JPIA policy clearly indicates that MACo/JPIA is the Port\u2019s primary insurer with a liability limit of $100,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\u00b688 The Allianz policy provides up to $100,000,000 in coverage with a $100,000 deductible. The policy states that if the insured has primary insurance with coverage greater than $100,000, the Allianz policy will apply \u201conly after the limits of liability of such other insurance has been exhausted.\u201d The Court does not address when Allianz\u2019s liability as an excess insurer would arise, but appears to assume that Allianz is liable for amounts in excess of the $100,000 deductible. Opinion, \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\u00b689 It is clear from the terms of the Allianz policy, however, that if the Port is insured by both MACo/JPIA and Allianz, Allianz\u2019s liability would arise only after the Port had exhausted its MACo/JPIA policy. As stated on the face of the MACo/JPIA policy and noted in the affidavit of MACo/JPIA\u2019s trust administrator, that liability limit is $100,000,000, not $100,000. In order to support its construction of the Allianz policy as excess insurance to be paid directly to the Port, the Court must either rewrite the MACo/JPIA policy to establish a liability limit of $100,000-which appears nowhere in the text of the MACo/JPIA policy-or hold MACo/JPIA solely responsible for property insurance coverage up to $100,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">\u00b690 The liability limits established by the Allianz and MACo/JPIA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>policies are easily reconciled if the Allianz policy is treated as reinsurance. MACo/JPIA insures the Port for $100,000,000, charging the Port its own deductible. Allianz, in turn, insures MACo and MACo/JPIA for $100,000,000. For any loss over $100,000, the amount of the Allianz deductible, MACo/JPIA submits a claim to Allianz to cover its own liability. This conclusion is not only consistent with the plain terms of both the Allianz and MACo/JPIA policies; it is also consistent with how MACo/JPIA describes its own operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b691 Our statutes provide that \u201c[a] contract may be explained by reference to the circumstances under which it was made and the matter to which it relates.\u201d Section 28-3-402, MCA. Therefore, a consideration of the MACo/JPIA insurance program is appropriate. MACo/JPIA administers a joint risk management pool for the benefit of its members, including the Port. The relationship between MACo/JPIA and the members it insures is governed by a Joint Powers Agreement which authorizes MACo/JPIA to purchase insurance coverage \u201cto cover losses borne by the joint risk management pool,\u201d not losses borne by individual entities. It is pursuant to this authority that MACo/JPIA obtained the Allianz policy. MACo/JPIA is responsible for insuring its members up to the $100,000,000 policy limit. Claims under $100,000 are paid from the joint risk management pool. For claims that exceed $100,000, MACo/JPIA submits its own claim under the Allianz policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b692 By structuring its insurance program in this way, MACo/JPIA achieves several cost-saving measures beneficial to Montana counties and other public entities. MACo/JPIA negotiates for the purchase of insurance based on the combined value of all properties in the pool, giving the pool greater leverage and bargaining power than any single purchaser. The loss history of program participants is also pooled, so that counties with numerous losses, who would otherwise pay more for-insurance, are balanced out by counties with fewer losses. The loss history is further stabilized because MACo/JPIA pays all claims under $100,000 from the pool, thus reducing the number of claims that are presented to the insurer. MACo/JPIA assumes the burden of adjusting claims, ensuring that the insurer is presented only with those claims that are meritorious.- In the event of a catastrophic loss affecting multiple program participants, MACo/JPIA also allocates insurance funds fairly to each of the affected counties, rather than allowing each to make its own claim to the insurer and potentially exhaust the coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>\u00b693 The Port asserts that self-insurance pools, like MACo/JPIA, are not allowed to purchase reinsurance. This argument mischaracterizes both the plain language and the intent of \u00a7 2-9-211(1), MCA, which provides that \u201c[p]olitical subdivisions that elect to procure insurance jointly (pooled fund) under this section may obtain excess coverage from a surplus lines insurer ... .\u201d There is no reason to conclude that authorization of excess coverage implicitly prohibits reinsurance coverage. The language authorizing \u201cexcess coverage from a surplus lines insurer\u201d was added in 1995 not to specifically authorize the purchase of excess or reinsurance coverage, which was already common practice, but to permit the purchase of such coverage from insurance carriers not licensed in the state. H. Local Govt. Comm., Hearing on H. Bill 54, Jan. 5, 1995; Sen. Bus. &amp; Ind. Comm., Hearing on H. Bill 54, Jan. 26,1995. There is no indication in the record of any intent to prohibit reinsurance. H. Local Govt. Comm., Hearing on H. Bill 54, Jan. 5,1995; Sen. Bus. <em>&amp; </em>Indus. Comm., Hearing on H. Bill 54, Jan. 26, 1995. Discussion of earlier amendments to \u00a7 2-9-211, MCA, indicates that reinsurance was considered essential to the viability of self-insurance pools. Sen. Local Govt. Comm., Hearing on Sen. Bill 2, March 25, 1986; H. State Admin. Comm., Hearing on Sen. Bill 2, March 27,1986. The Port\u2019s argument that reinsurance is prohibited is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b694 When interpreting a contract as a whole, we must \u201cgive effect to every part if reasonably practicable,\u201d \u00a7 28-3-202, MCA, but only insofar as \u201cit can be done without violating the intention of the parties,\u201d \u00a7 28-3-201, MCA. Particular clauses must be treated as subordinate to the contract\u2019s general intent. Section 28-3-307, MCA. The Court allows an ambiguity in the definition of personal property, not at issue in determining the coverage of the Port\u2019s real property, to subvert the general intent of the contract and, as a result, restructure MACo/JPIA\u2019s insurance program. The plain language of the Allianz policy, the definition of \u201cassociated or allied,\u201d the facts of the relationship between MACo and the Port, the terms of the MACo/JPIA policy, and the circumstances under which the Allianz policy was issued all support the conclusion that the Port was not, and was never intended to be, an insured party as defined by the Allianz policy. I respectfully dissent from the decision of this Court holding that the Port qualifies as an insured under the terms of the Allianz policy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
