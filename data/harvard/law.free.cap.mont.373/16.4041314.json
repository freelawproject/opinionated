We affirm and address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"AS\">\u00b62 <em>1. Did the District Court err by limiting the Defendant\u2019s cross-examination of the State\u2019s informant ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">\u00b63 <em>2. Did the District Court err by preventing the Defendant\u2019s expert forensic pathologist from testifying about matters not disclosed through </em>discovery?</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">\u00b64 <em>3. Did the District Court err by permitting an undisclosed expert witness to testify for the State ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">\u00b65 This case involves the tragic death of Bronson Parsons (Parsons) due to injuries sustained during a hit-and-run vehicle-pedestrian accident in the early morning hours of January 1, 2008. At approximately 1:40 a.m., Parsons and Daniel Barry (Barry) were walking along the right-hand shoulder of Highway 200 and toward the Reno Casino (the Reno) in East Missoula to participate in the Bar\u2019s last call of the night. When they were about 300 yards from the Reno, a dark-colored SUV struck Parsons from behind and carried him a short distance before he slid off the side of the hood. The SUV veered off the road, corrected itself, and then accelerated westward toward Missoula. Parsons remained on his back in the roadway, having sustained fatal blunt force trauma to the back of his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-13\">\u00b66 In the darkness, Barry was able to identify the fleeing vehicle only as a bigger, dark-colored SUV or truck. Barry also thought the vehicle had a deer guard or something else reinforcing its frontend. Deborah Baylor (Baylor), who was driving east along Highway 200 at the time of the collision, saw a dark-colored vehicle strike Parsons with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>passenger side. Baylor explained that she heard a pop or a bang and then saw Parsons fly off the side of the vehicle and land in the roadway. Neither Baylor nor Barry heard any glass breaking during the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">\u00b67 Trooper Novak of the Montana Highway Patrol soon arrived at the scene and conducted an investigation. He looked for anything of evidentiary value, such as broken glass or damaged vehicle parts, but was only able to find a set of tire tracks on the shoulder of the road, which he later photographed. Trooper Novak was not able to precisely identify the point of impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u00b68 Other law enforcement officers were alerted about the accident, and about ten hours later Trooper Hader of the Montana Highway Patrol stopped Garding to investigate her cracked windshield. Garding was driving a black 1994 Chevy Blazer with a unique, aftermarket steel bumper protruding from the frontend. Trooper Hader then believed that the accident had involved a full-frontal crash and that the subject vehicle would have extensive frontend damage. When Trooper Hader did not observe any such damage, he cited Garding for driving without a license and arrested her boyfriend, James Bordeaux (Bordeaux), who was also in the vehicle, on an out-of-state warrant. Law enforcement would take no further action against Garding for some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\u00b69 Law enforcement initially suspected that Gabrielle Weiss (Weiss) had hit Parsons with her vehicle, a green 1995 S-10 Chevy Blazer, due to an unusual 911 call that she placed around the time of the accident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During that call Weiss mistakenly identified herself as being in East Missoula that night. Law enforcement later confirmed that she had actually been in the Blue Mountain area that night. During the investigation, law enforcement impounded Weiss\u2019s vehicle and submitted its bumper to the FBI for laboratory examination. Although the bumper contained a fabric impression from a pair of jeans,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> no conclusive results were obtained. Weiss was not charged and the case went cold.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">\u00b610 On December 22,2008, almost one year after the accident, Tueray <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Cornell (Cornell), then an inmate at the Missoula County Detention Center, contacted Trooper Hader to report that he had information about the incident. Cornell explained that Garding had driven to his house on January 1, 2008, and told him that she had hit a deer. Cornell used duct tape to repair Garding\u2019s broken light cover by taping it back in place. Following up on this lead, law enforcement discovered that Garding\u2019s Blazer had been repossessed and resold. The new owner explained that the Blazer had broken down almost immediately upon purchase, but otherwise remained in the same condition. The right front fog lamp was affixed with duct tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">\u00b611 Meanwhile, Bordeaux, one of Garding\u2019s passengers on the night of the accident and now her ex-boyfriend, was incarcerated in Missoula on a burglary charge. At the omnibus hearing in Bordeaux\u2019s case, the State checked the omnibus hearing form to indicate that it intended to pursue a Persistent Felony Offender (PFO) designation under \u00a7 46-18-502(1), MCA, against Bordeaux, which would permit a district court to sentence him to up to 100 years in prison. However, the State did not discuss or pursue this possibility further.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u00b612 As part of the investigation into Garding, Trooper Hader contacted Bordeaux, who related that on the day of the accident, Bordeaux and Garding started drinking around 11:00 a.m. After several hours of drinking at Red\u2019s Bar in Missoula, they met Paul McFarling (McFarling) and drove to East Missoula in Garding\u2019s Blazer, drinking Black Velvet and smoking marijuana on the way. The three continued to drink throughout the afternoon and evening, including at the Reno. Sometime after midnight, they drove to Red\u2019s Bar in Missoula and remained there until 1:30 a.m. They then returned to East Missoula in Garding\u2019s Blazer to try to purchase cocaine. McFarling, who was sitting in the backseat, pulled out a gun and attempted to show it to Garding and Bordeaux. Bordeaux, who was sitting in the front passenger\u2019s seat, turned around and started arguing with McFarling, threatening to \u201cslap him\u201d and telling Garding to pull over so he could kick McFarling out of the car. Possibly distracted by these events, Garding struck Parsons from behind with the passenger\u2019s side of her vehicle. Bordeaux stated that he spun around in his seat just in time to see a person flying through the air and hear Garding say, \u201cI hit somebody.\u201d Garding did not stop the vehicle, but instead drove back to Missoula and stayed the night at McFarling\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\u00b613 In exchange for providing this testimony, the State offered Bordeaux a plea deal whereby he would testify against Garding and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>plead guilty to the burglary, and in return, the State would recommend that he receive a five-year suspended sentence. The possible PFO designation was not discussed or mentioned in the parties\u2019 written plea agreement. Obtaining Bordeaux\u2019s cooperation, the State charged Garding with Parsons\u2019 death.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">\u00b614 At trial, Garding sought to impeach Bordeaux\u2019s credibility. In her opening statement, Garding\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cthe State wants you to believe that [Bordeaux] did not get any deal for his original sentence. As I mentioned, he was facing 20 years in prison [for burglary], plus an additional 5 to 100 years for being a persistent felony offender.\u201d However, when Garding\u2019s counsel began her cross-examination of Bordeaux, the District Court granted the State\u2019s objection to any mention of the potential PFO designation, limiting the scope of Garding\u2019s questioning in this regard to the burglary charge and the contents of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">\u00b615 The State called the medical examiner, Dr. Gary Dale (Dr. Dale), who testified that the location and size of Garding\u2019s bumper was consistent with muscle tearing injuries in Parsons\u2019 calves. Garding called Dr. Thomas Bennett (Dr. Bennett), a forensic pathologist, to challenge Dr. Dale\u2019s testimony. Dr. Bennett testified that irregular bruising found on the exterior of Parsons\u2019 calves would not have been caused by a bumper like Garding\u2019s. When asked to explain the muscle tearing discussed by Dr. Dale, the District Court sustained the State\u2019s objection that Dr. Bennett\u2019s report obtained in discovery had failed to mention muscle tearing and limited Dr. Bennett\u2019s testimony to the bruising on Parsons\u2019 calves.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b6 16 The State also called Alice Ammen (Ammen) from the State Crime Lab to testify about her inspection of the victim\u2019s clothing. During cross-examination, Ammen noted that the Crime Lab had the ability to analyze fabric impressions, such as the jeans impression left on Weiss\u2019s bumper, although a different section of the lab handled that responsibility. To address this issue further, the State, still in its case in chief, called Debra Hewitt (Hewitt), a fabric-impression expert from the State Crime Lab, who had not previously been listed as a witness. Over Garding\u2019s objection, the District Court permitted Hewitt to testify regarding why a fabric impression analysis would not have been probative in this case. According to Hewitt, absent some unique defect or stitching, the lab cannot distinguish between the impressions left by different pairs of jeans, and because the impression found on Weiss\u2019s bumper was not unique, the lab did nothing further.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\u00b617 The jury convicted Garding of vehicular homicide while under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>influence, failure to stop immediately at the scene of an accident involving an injured person, and driving without a valid driver\u2019s license. She appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"AqE\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b618 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Bonamarte, </em>2009 MT 243, \u00b6 13, 351 Mont. 419, 213 P.3d 457. A district court \u201cabuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily or unreasonably, and a substantial injustice results.\u201d <em>Bonamarte, </em>\u00b6 13. However, \u201c[a] district court has broad discretion when determining the relevance and admissibility of evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2011 MT 278, \u00b6 11, 362 Mont. 426, 265 P.3d 623. In exercising its discretion, a district court remains bound by the Rules of Evidence or other applicable statutes. We review de novo a district court\u2019s interpretation of an evidentiary rule or statute. We exercise plenary review for questions regarding constitutional law. <em>Daniels, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u00b619 <em>1. Did the District Court err by limiting the Defendant\u2019s cross-examination of the State\u2019s informant ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">\u00b620 Garding argues that the District Court improperly limited her inquiry into Bordeaux\u2019s bias or motive to testify falsely by not allowing her to cross-examine Bordeaux about his possible PFO designation. She explains that the possibility of Bordeaux facing 100 years in prison is exactly the kind of bias or motive that should have been made known to the jury. The State counters that the only reference it made to a PFO designation was the check on the omnibus form, but that the matter was not further discussed and the State did not negotiate away a PFO designation in exchange for anything. The plea agreement contains no mention of a PFO sentencing enhancement, and thus the State argues that the District Court properly exercised its discretion to limit Garding\u2019s inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">\u00b621  The \u201caccused\u2019s right to demonstrate the bias or motive of prosecution witnesses is guaranteed by the [Confrontation Clause of the] Sixth Amendment,\u201d <em>State v. Gommenginger, </em>242 Mont. 265, 272, 790 P.2d 455, 460 (1990) (citations omitted), and the Montana Constitution, Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 24. The accused\u2019s right to confront adverse witnesses is fundamental. <em>State v. Parker, </em>2006 MT 258, \u00b6 20, 334 Mont. 129, 144 P.3d 831 (citing <em>State v. Clark, </em>1998 MT 221, \u00b6 20, 290 Mont. 479, 964 P.2d 766; Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 24). A defendant is to be given \u201cbroad latitude\u201d in questioning the credibility and self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>interest of witnesses. <em>On Lee v. U.S., </em>343 U.S. 747, 757, 72 S. Ct. 967, 973-74 (1952). \u201cThe Confrontation Clause \u2018guarantees an <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Nelson, </em>2002 MT 122, \u00b6 19, 310 Mont. 71, 48 P.3d 739 (citing <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>2001 MT 79, \u00b6 19, 305 Mont. 95, 23 P.3d 201 (additional citations omitted) (emphasis in original)). A district court maintains broad latitude to limit cross-examination to those issues that are relevant. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 15. We have explained that \u201cdiscretion in exercising control and excluding evidence of a witness\u2019s bias or motive to testify falsely becomes operative only after the constitutionally required threshold level of inquiry has been afforded the Defendant.\u201d <em>Bonamarte, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b622 In <em>Nelson, </em>an informant testified against Nelson after reaching a plea agreement with the Ravalli County prosecutor. <em>Nelson, </em>f 11. During Nelson\u2019s cross-examination of the informant, the State objected to the scope of Nelson\u2019s questions. Nelson explained that he wanted to cross-examine the informant about other charges filed against him in order to establish that the informant had a pattern of reaching plea deals and then testifying against co-defendants. The district court refused to allow this line of questioning. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 12. On appeal, Nelson argued that the district court\u2019s limitation on the scope of his inquiry violated his right to confront his accuser. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 16. We disagreed, holding that Nelson had been afforded the constitutionally required level of inquiry. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 19. We found it persuasive that \u201cnothing in the record indicatefd] that Ravalli County offered any plea arrangements to [the informant] based on\u201d his other alleged criminal activity, <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 17, and that Nelson received wide latitude when cross-examining the informant about the actual contents of the plea agreement with Ravalli County, <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b623 As in <em>Nelson, </em>Bordeaux\u2019s plea agreement does not contain any reference to the PFO designation. As the State notes, other than the check on Bordeaux\u2019s omnibus hearing form, he was never notified that the State considered him to be a PFO. Garding generalizes that the state \u201c \u2018routinely\u2019 uses a PFO designation to encourage a deal,\u201d and cites <em>Nelson </em>for the proposition that a defendant\u2019s right to confront is violated \u201cwhen a court precludes questioning on the witness\u2019s potential for bias or prejudice stemming from his interest in receiving leniency on other charges from the prosecuting office.\u201d However, Garding failed to present any evidence that Bordeaux actually received \u201cleniency on other charges\u201d regarding the PFO, as the following exchange between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>counsel for Garding and the District Court illustrates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-4\">[Garding:] Your Honor, I\u2019m arguing, though, I don\u2019t-we don\u2019t have to argue that he received benefit of them not filing for the persistent felony offender. What I\u2019m asking is his sfate of mind when he was charged with the burglary, what he was facing, the penalties that he was facing, the consequences that he was facing for his motive to go and make a statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\">[District Court:] Well, absent the testimony the only thing I have is the plea agreement. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m limited to, the actual motives and-and discussions and focus in this case. Now if there\u2019s something else, some other evidence, I\u2019m happy to consider it, but at this point I\u2019m precluding getting into it [possible PFO designation].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b624  After making this ruling, the District Court, as in <em>Nelson, </em>permitted Garding to cross-examine Bordeaux at length about his plea agreement with the State, including the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">[Garding:] Okay. And so two days after you provide this statement [about Garding], after your burglary charge has been pending for over two months, you go and enter a guilty plea on the burglary, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">[Bordeaux:] Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">[Garding:] Just two days after you give this statement. [Bordeaux:] Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">[Garding:] And you get a sentence that does not call for you to go to prison here in Montana, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-11\">[Bordeaux:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-12\">[Garding:] And you get a sentence that allows you to be on probation, and you get to walk out those doors, and you\u2019ve gone back to Missouri, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-13\">[Bordeaux:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-14\">Based on our review of the record, it is clear that the District Court afforded Garding sufficiently wide latitude in cross-examining Bordeaux about his bias and motivation to testify falsely to satisfy Garding\u2019s right of confrontation. Garding inquired extensively into Bordeaux\u2019s burglary charge, his plea agreement, and the timing of his statement against Garding. This inquiry, coupled with the lack of evidence that Bordeaux\u2019s plea agreement was motivated in any way by a potential PFO designation, satisfies the constitutional requirement of an effective opportunity for cross-examination. <em>See Nelson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-19. Based on the foregoing, we hold that the District Court did not violate Garding\u2019s constitutional rights, nor did it abuse its discretion in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>instance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\u00b625 <em>2. Did the District Court err by preventing the Defendant\u2019s expert forensic pathologist from testifying about matters not disclosed through discovery?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b626 Garding argues that the District Court erred by not permitting Dr. Bennett to refute Dr. Dale\u2019s testimony about the muscle tearing in Parson\u2019s calves. During trial, Dr. Dale testified that Parsons sustained a \u201c3-inch area of tearing or crushing of the muscle, the calf muscles, in both calves ... above his heel.\u201d However, when Garding attempted to question Dr. Bennett about this muscle tearing, the District Court sustained the State\u2019s objection and limited Dr. Bennett\u2019s testimony to the bruising found on Parsons\u2019 calves:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">[District Court:] We\u2019re looking at [Dr. Bennett\u2019s] opinion number four. Specifically limit-it specifically states \u201cbruises\u201d when indicating the linkage to the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">[Dr. Bennett:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">[District Court:] And so that\u2019s what you\u2019re limited to and not to the tearing of the muscle because that\u2019s what was disclosed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-9\">[Dr. Bennett:] Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-10\">[District Court:] And so you understand that rule. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-11\">[Dr. Bennett:] Perfectly fine, judge. That\u2019s the most important part anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-12\">[District Court:] When you disclose you\u2019re generally limited to that area and that\u2019s my ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-13\">\u00b627 The State offers little justification, and, after review, we are unable to conclude there was an appropriate legal basis for the District Court\u2019s exclusion of Dr. Bennett\u2019s testimony. As Garding notes, \u201cdefense counsel may not be required to prepare or disclose summaries of witnesses\u2019 testimony.\u201d Section 46-15-323(8), MCA; <em>State v. Huerta, </em>285 Mont. 245, 253, 947 P.2d 483, 488 (1997) (concluding that it was error to require the defendant to produce summaries of his witnesses\u2019 testimony). Section 46-15-323(6)(b), MCA, states that the names and addresses of defense experts, as well as their reports, shall be made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>available to the prosecutor. This was done here, and Dr. Bennett\u2019s report mentions, contrary to the District Court\u2019s ruling, Dr. Dale\u2019s finding about the muscle tearing. Further, during trial, Garding\u2019s counsel advised the District Court that Dr. Bennett would testify about \u201chow people can obtain muscle tears\u201d and \u201chow blunt force trauma can create muscle tears\u201d in accordance with M. R. Evid. 103(a)(2). Thus, we conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in limiting Dr. Bennett\u2019s testimony to only Parsons\u2019 bruising injuries. We now turn to the question of whether this error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b628 \u201cThe first step in conducting [a] harmless-error analysis is to determine whether the error is structural error or trial error.\u201d <em>State v. Stewart, </em>2012 MT 317, \u00b6 45, 367 Mont. 503, 291 P.3d 1187 (citation omitted). Structural error affects the framework within which the trial proceeds. <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 38, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735. Structural error is of \u201cconstitutional dimensions, precedes the trial, and undermines the fairness of the entire trial proceeding.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 45. Examples include: errors in the jury selection process, deprivation of the right to counsel, and lack of an impartial trial judge. Structural error is not subject to harmless-error review and is automatically reversible. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 39 (citations omitted). Trial error, on the other hand, typically occurs during the presentation of a case to the jury. It can be reviewed qualitatively for prejudice relative to other evidence introduced during trial and, therefore, is not automatically reversible. <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b629 Precluding Dr. Bennett\u2019s testimony was not, in and of itself, an error affecting the framework in which the trial proceeded-it \u201cdid not contaminate the trial mechanism along the lines that a biased judge, lack of counsel, or a jury-selection error would,\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 45. Thus, any error on the part of the District Court was trial error subject to Montana\u2019s harmless error statute. That statute provides, \u201c[a] cause may not be reversed by reason of any error committed by the trial court against the convicted person unless the record shows that the error was prejudicial,\u201d and \u201c[a]ny error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\u201d Section 46-20-701(1), (2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u00b630 Garding argues that the District Court\u2019s decision prejudiced her by barring the jury from properly evaluating whether her bumper \u201ccould have or could not have caused Parsons\u2019 muscle tearing,\u201d thereby preventing her from presenting a complete defense. She further argues that the State capitalized on this exclusion during its closing argument by referencing the muscle tearing several times. Accordingly, Garding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>asserts that the District Court\u2019s decision to limit Dr. Bennett\u2019s testimony contributed to her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b631 In response to a claim that trial error may have contributed to a conviction, it \u201c \u2018becomes incumbent on the State to demonstrate that the error at issue was not prejudicial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Slavin, </em>2004 MT 76, \u00b6 22, 320 Mont. 425, 87 P.3d 495 (citing <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 42). To meet this burden in cases where a court ruling excludes testimony, the State must demonstrate that there was no reasonable possibility that the exclusion contributed to the conviction. <em>Slavin, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b632 Dr. Bennett was permitted to testify at length about the nature of Parsons\u2019 bruises and the features of Garding\u2019s bumper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">The bruises as described on the back and as seen in the photographs would not be caused by a bumper like that in the mechanism as described. That bumper with the square edges and so forth would not produce those irregular marks on the back of the calf. The bruises would be much more characteristic. You would see lines of petechiae and so forth.... Again the bruising is not petechiae. There are regular deep bruises we see on the back of the calves. The bluish discoloration and so forth, the blue, it\u2019s a curved, smooth surface, not this bumper.... [Garding\u2019s bumper is] a 3-inch bumper. The skin markings effectively... indicate this isn\u2019t the bumper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Dr. Bennett repeatedly testified that Garding\u2019s vehicle did not cause the injuries to Parsons\u2019 calves. Each time, Dr. Bennett supported his opinion with extensive analysis of the bruising, which he characterized to the jury as \u201cthe best way to look for the nature of that instrument [Garding\u2019s bumper],\u201d and to the District Court as \u201cthe most important part [of his testimony].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">\u00b633 Although the State mentioned muscle tearing during its closing argument, Dr. Bennett was still allowed to present the most critical aspects of his testimony to the jury-including his ultimate conclusion that Garding\u2019s vehicle did not cause the injuries to Parsons\u2019 calves. We believe this testimony sufficiently enabled the jury to weigh Dr. Bennett\u2019s opinion against Dr. Dale\u2019s. Therefore, we conclude that there was no reasonable possibility that Garding\u2019s conviction resulted from the District Court\u2019s exclusion of this portion of Dr. Bennett\u2019s analysis, and the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">\u00b634 <em>3. Did the District Court err by permitting an undisclosed expert witness to testify for the State?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">\u00b635 Lastly, Garding argues that the District Court abused its discretion by allowing the State to call Hewitt to testify about fabric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>impressions analysis when she had not been previously disclosed as a witness. The State acknowledges that it did not disclose Hewitt as a witness,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but offers that she was called only to briefly explain why fabric impression evidence from Weiss\u2019s bumper was not analyzed after Garding raised the issue on cross-examination of Ammen. Garding counters that the effect of calling a surprise witness is both \u201cdevastating and prejudicial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\u00b636 A prosecutor, upon request, must provide the defendant with \u201cthe names, addresses, and statements of all persons whom the prosecutor may call as witnesses in the case in chief,\u201d together with \u201call written reports or statements of experts who have personally examined the defendant or any evidence in the particular case ... .\u201d Section 46-15-322(l)(a), (c), MCA. If the prosecutor fails to comply with these discovery provisions at any time, the court \u201cmay impose any sanction it finds just under the circumstances ... .\u201d Section 46-15-329, MCA. This statute provides a district court with the flexibility to impose sanctions, but does not mandate automatic exclusion for noncompliance. <em>State v. Waters, </em>228 Mont. 490, 495, 743 P.2d 617, 621 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u00b637 It is generally inappropriate for the State to call an undisclosed expert witness in its case in chief. Here, however, the District Court afforded Garding ample time to interview Hewitt and indicated a willingness to grant more time if necessary. Hewitt\u2019s testimony was to a narrow issue and was brief. Garding thoroughly cross-examined Hewitt about the failure to compare the fabric impressions on Weiss\u2019s bumper to the clothing of the victim or any other relevant party.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u00b638 Further, the State could have called Hewitt as a rebuttal witness to elicit her testimony. \u201c \u2018Rebuttal evidence offered by the State is admissible if it has a tendency to contradict or disprove evidence of the defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Gardner, </em>2003 MT 338, \u00b6 36, 318 Mont. 436, 80 P.3d 1262 (citation omitted). \u201c \u2018Rebuttal testimony is proper only if it tends to counteract a new matter offered by the adverse party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gardner, </em>\u00b6 36 (citation omitted). During her cross-examination of Ammen, Garding asked whether the State Crime Lab had the capability of analyzing fabric impressions, which Ammen answered affirmatively. The State then called Hewitt to address this newly raised issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">\u00b639 Garding cites \u00a7 46-15-322(6), MCA, for the proposition that \u201cthe State is required to disclose the names of rebuttal witnesses \u2018no later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>than five days before trial or at a later time as the court may for good cause permit.\u2019 \u201d However, this statute applies to witnesses called by the State to rebut affirmative defenses that a defendant has raised and notified the State of pursuant to \u00a7 46-15-323(3), (4), MCA. The State did not call Hewitt to rebut any of these defenses. As we have held, \u201c[d]etermining the admissibility of rebuttal testimony is within the sound discretion of the district court... .\u201d <em>State v. Jackson, </em>2009 MT 427, \u00b6 68, 354 Mont. 63, 221 P.3d 1213.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b640  The District Court\u2019s decision to allow Hewitt to testify did not constitute reversible error. Hewitt\u2019s statements were very brief and Garding fully cross-examined her. Even if we were to determine that the District Court abused its discretion, such error would be harmless. <em>See Stewart, </em>\u00b6 45. The fact that the State called Hewitt during its case in chief, rather than as a rebuttal witness later, did not prejudice Garding in any way, nor did it contribute to her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b641 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b52-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b42-8\"> Weiss admitted to being highly intoxicated at the time she called 911.

Having reviewed the applicable documents, we find that our analysis in this case appropriately centers on the District Court\u2019s decision to limit Garding\u2019s cross-examination of Bordeaux at trial, since the PFO issue was ultimately decided at that point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b51-8\"> According to the State, Hewitt was not disclosed because she never produced a report or completed any testing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
