Luke filed a motion to dismiss under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, on the ground that he had not been brought to trial within six months of entering his not-guilty pleas. The Justice Court denied the motion, and the Eleventh Judicial District Court affirmed. Luke now appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether good cause existed for holding Luke\u2019s trial past the six-month deadline in \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. We conclude that good cause existed, and we accordingly affirm the decisions of the Justice Court and the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">\u00b63 Luke was charged on November 26, 2011, with the following offenses: driving under the influence of alcohol or, in the alternative, with an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, first offense, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401(l)(a) or -406(l)(a), MCA, respectively; failure to carry proof of insurance, in violation of \u00a7 61-6-302(2), MCA; possession of an open alcoholic beverage container, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-460, MCA; and speeding, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-309, MCA. Luke appeared in the Justice Court on December 5, 2011, and entered pleas of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"A-X\">\u00b64 The Justice Court held an omnibus hearing on February 7, 2012. Luke and his counsel appeared in person. The Omnibus Hearing Order and Memorandum, which Luke and his counsel both signed, states in pertinent part that \u201c[i]f either party requests a jury trial, the Court will send the parties notice of the jury trial date and will set a date and time for a pretrial conference. The pretrial conference will be set to occur during the week prior to the date scheduled for the jury trial.\u201d The Memorandum further states that, at the pretrial conference, the party requesting a jury trial \u201cshall... [ajppear and confirm the party\u2019s intention to proceed to trial by jury.\u201d The party must also \u201c[flile proposed jury instructions and verdict form and serve a copy upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>opposing party.\u201d Finally, this section of the Memorandum concludes with the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-4\">If the party requesting a jury trial either fails to appear at the pretrial conference and to confirm the party\u2019s intention to proceed to trial by jury or fails to file and serve proposed jury instructions and verdict form at or before the pretrial conference, the party shall be deemed to have waived the party\u2019s right to trial by jury trial and the jury trial shall be vacated and the case re-set by the Court for a bench trial at the next available time. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The Memorandum indicates that Luke requested a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u00b65 The next day (February 8, 2012), the Justice Court notified Luke, his counsel, and the prosecutor that a jury trial would be held May 3 at 9 a.m. and that the pretrial conference would be held April 27 at 4 p.m. The Notice of Pretrial Conference stated: \u201cThe courthereby orders the personal attendance of the defendant at this hearing.\u201d Yet, while Luke\u2019s counsel appeared at the April 27 conference, Luke did not. Although the parties (in their respective briefs on appeal) dispute whether Luke was merely \u201clate\u201d to the conference or instead \u201cshowed up after the [conference had] occurred,\u201d the timing of Luke\u2019s arrival is immaterial. Luke concedes that his failure to appear at the conference on time was enough to trigger the waiver provision quoted above. Luke notes that he \u201chas never contested his waiver of a jury trial\u201d due to his failure of timely appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\u00b66 On April 30,2012, the Justice Court gave notice that a bench trial would be held on June 13 at 4 p.m. On the date of the bench trial, Luke appeared with his counsel and moved to dismiss the case on the ground that trial was being held beyond the deadline imposed by \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. This statute requires a misdemeanor prosecution to be dismissed, with prejudice, if the defendant is not brought to trial within six months of entering his plea, unless the trial has been postponed upon the defendant\u2019s motion or good cause has been shown for the delay. Luke argued that the six-month deadline had passed eight days earlier (on June 5), that he had not filed any motions postponing the trial, and that there was no good cause for delaying his trial past the six-month window.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">\u00b67 The Justice Court denied Luke\u2019s motion. The court reasoned that Luke\u2019s failure to appear at the pretrial conference constituted good cause for vacating his jury trial and rescheduling it as a bench trial. The court stated (in open court) that the bench trial had been \u201crescheduled according to the next available date on the court\u2019s calendar which happened to be today at 4 p.m.\u201d The court then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>conducted the bench trial and found Luke guilty of speeding, driving with an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, and failing to carry proof of insurance. The court acquitted him of the open-container violation and the alternate DUI charge. The court sentenced Luke to six months in jail, with all but one day suspended, and imposed fines totaling $1,035.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\u00b68 Luke appealed to the District Court, which affirmed the denial of his motion to dismiss. The District Court reasoned that there was a connection between Luke\u2019s failure to appear at the pretrial conference and the delay in his trial. The court noted that Luke had been clearly advised that if he failed to appear at the pretrial conference, his jury trial would be vacated and a bench trial would be rescheduled for the Justice Court\u2019s next available date. The District Court rejected Luke\u2019s contention that the Justice Court could have held the bench trial on the May 3 date originally set for the jury trial, noting that Luke had not pointed to any evidence in the record supporting this claim. The District Court also noted that the Justice Court was not required to relinquish its flexibility in the scheduling of cases in order to accommodate Luke\u2019s failure to appear. The District Court concluded that good cause existed to justify the delay in Luke\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u00b69 On Luke\u2019s appeal from the Justice Court, the District Court functioned as an intermediate appellate court. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3-5-303 and 3-10-115, MCA. Acting in its appellate capacity, a district court does not make findings of fact or discretionary trial court rulings; rather, the district court is \u201c \u2018confined to review of the record and questions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stanley v. Lemire, </em>2006 MT 304, \u00b6 25, 334 Mont. 489, 148 P.3d 643 (quoting \u00a7 3-10-115(1), MCA). Like this Court, the district court reviews factual findings under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard, discretionary rulings for abuse of discretion, and both legal conclusions and mixed questions of law and fact de novo. <em>Stanley, </em>\u00b6 25. Since the scope of the district court\u2019s review is the same as this Court\u2019s review of the lower court\u2019s judgment, we review the case as if the appeal originally had been filed in this Court. <em>Stanley, </em>\u00b6 26; <em>State v. Ellison, </em>2012 MT 50, \u00b6 8, 364 Mont. 276, 272 P.3d 646. We examine the record independently of the district court\u2019s decision, applying the relevant standard of review. <em>Ellison, </em>\u00b6 8; <em>Stanley, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\u00b610 Here, the question is whether the charges against Luke had to be dismissed under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. Whether the right to speedy trial has been violated is a question of law, and we review the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>court\u2019s legal conclusions to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of law is correct. <em>City of Helena v. Roan, </em>2010 MT 29, \u00b6 7, 355 Mont. 172, 226 P.3d 601; <em>State v. Martz, </em>2008 MT 382, \u00b6 17, 347 Mont. 47, 196 P.3d 1239. We will not disturb any factual findings underlying the trial court\u2019s application of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, unless those findings are shown to be clearly erroneous. <em>Roan, </em>\u00b6 7; <em>State v. Hass, </em>2011 MT 296, \u00b6 13, 363 Mont. 8, 265 P.3d 1221. The court\u2019s application of controlling legal principles to its factual findings is a mixed question of law and fact, which we review de novo. <em>State v. Weaver, </em>2008 MT 86, \u00b6 10, 342 Mont. 196, 179 P.3d 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b611 <em>Whether good cause existed for holding Luke\u2019s trial past the six-month deadline in \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\u00b612 A criminal defendant has a fundamental constitutional right to a speedy trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6 20, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815; <em>State v. Stops, </em>2013 MT 131, \u00b6 18, 370 Mont. 226, 301 P.3d 811. Distinct from that constitutional right, a criminal defendant also has a statutory right to be brought to trial on a misdemeanor charge within six months of entering his or her plea, with important exceptions discussed below. Section 46-13-401(2), MCA. In the present case, Luke has asserted only his statutory right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u00b613 Pursuantto \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, a prosecution on a misdemeanor charge must be dismissed, with prejudice, if the defendant is not brought to trial within six months after entering his or her plea. This requirement applies, however, only if (1) the trial \u201chas not been postponed upon the defendant\u2019s motion\u201d and (2) the State has not shown \u201cgood cause\u201d for the delay. Section 46-13-401(2), MCA; <em>accord Martz, </em>\u00b6 30.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">\u00b614 In the present case, the first prong is met. Luke did not file any motion requesting a postponement of his trial. Nor did he file any pretrial motions that had the \u201cincidental effect\u201d of delaying his trial beyond the six-month time limit. <em>State v. Fitzgerald, </em>283 Mont. 162, 166-67, 940 P.2d 108, 111 (1997). In fact, Luke did not file any motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>at all until he filed his motion to dismiss under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AsR\">\u00b615 This case, therefore, turns on the second prong: whether \u201cgood cause\u201d was shown for the delay. Good cause is generally defined as a \u201clegally sufficient reason\u201d and is referred to as \u201cthe burden placed on a litigant (usu. by court rule or order) to show why a request should be granted or an action excused.\u201d <em>Roan, </em>\u00b6 13 (internal quotation marks omitted). Good cause necessarily depends on the totality of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. <em>Roan, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u00b616 In arguing that the State failed to establish good cause for the delay here, Luke relies heavily on <em>State v. Bertolino, </em>2003 MT 266, 317 Mont. 453, 77 P.3d 543, where we held that Bertolino\u2019s passive disregard for court-ordered deadlines did not constitute good cause for delaying her trial beyond the six-month time limit. We emphasized that \u201cthe record reveals no connection between Bertolino\u2019s failure to respond to the [court] orders and the failure to bring the case to trial within six months.\u201d <em>Bertolino, </em>\u00b6 15. Luke argues that his situation is analogous because, in his view, his failure to appear as ordered at the pretrial conference did not cause \u201caffirmative procedural delay.\u201d <em>See Bertolino, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Fitzgerald, </em>283 Mont. at 166-67, 940 P.2d at 111).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b617  We agree with the State, however, that <em>Bertolino </em>is distinguishable. Luke was on notice that his \u201cpersonal attendance\u201d at the pretrial conference was mandatory and that, if he failed to appear at the conference, his case would be reset as a bench trial at the next available time. Unlike <em>Bertolino, </em>where there was no indication that Bertolino\u2019s failure to comply with court orders necessitated a continuance of the trial, there is a clear and direct connection between Luke\u2019s failure to appear punctually for the pretrial conference and his trial date\u2019s being rescheduled from May 3, 2012, to June 13, 2012. \u00b618 <em>Bertolino </em>aside, Luke\u2019s primary argument is that the Justice Court\u2019s decision to postpone his trial to June 13 was \u201cunnecessary.\u201d He opines that \u201cholding a bench trial instead of a jury trial on the already scheduled date\u201d would not have been inconvenient for the Justice Court. Luke asserts that his \u201ctardiness in attending his pretrial conference did not disrupt the Justice Court\u2019s schedule,\u201d and he posits that \u201c[w]ith a May 3rd trial date already scheduled, the Justice Court should have simply converted the May 3rd jury trial date into a bench trial date and heard evidence that day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u00b619  In essence, Luke proposes that where a defendant has waived (or forfeited) his right to a jury trial on a misdemeanor charge by failing to appear at a mandatory pretrial conference, the justice court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>must \u201cconvert\u201d the scheduled jury trial into a bench trial so as to accommodate the defendant\u2019s right to be brought to trial within six months. We decline to adopt such a rule. As we have stated, a justice court \u201cmust retain a measure of flexibility over scheduling to hear cases on its docket.\u201d <em>Fitzgerald, </em>283 Mont. at 167, 940 P.2d at 111. In this regard, Luke acknowledged in his brief filed in the District Court that the Justice Court\u2019s practice was to set a number of cases for jury trial on Thursday of each week. The case with highest priority would go to trial that day and the remaining cases would be moved to another date. But if the case with highest priority settled or was continued, then the next priority case would go to trial. We note that jury trials are \u201cstacked\u201d in this manner because a jury trial requires that juror summonses be issued by the trial court normally two weeks in advance. In this State, we do not have juries available on standby for one defendant, waiting to see whether that defendant will plead guilty, request a continuance, or request a bench trial. Trial courts, therefore, must maximize the presence of a jury panel by setting several trials on the day for which it has issued juror summonses. While the Dissent characterizes this as a matter of \u201cthe court\u2019s convenience,\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 28, this is, in fact, the only way in which Montana trial courts can assure defendants that they will receive the jury trial to which each of them is entitled. The Dissent fails to recognize that defendants in other jury trials set by the trial court similarly have speedy trial rights which have not been waived, as here, by the defendant\u2019s failure to appear at the pretrial conference. This is not to say that the Justice Court could simply ignore the statute\u2019s requirement that Luke be brought to trial within six months; however, contrary to Luke\u2019s argument, the Justice Court was not required to convert the jury trial into a bench trial in order to accommodate Luke\u2019s speedy trial right when he had failed to comply with the court\u2019s order requiring him to appear at the pretrial conference. <em>Cf. Fitzgerald, </em>283 Mont, at 167,940 P.2d at 111 (\u201cAfter these delays caused by Fitzgerald, the Justice Court cannot be expected to alter its schedule to ensure that the misdemeanor charge is tried within six months.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b620  Luke\u2019s bench trial occurred eight days beyond the six-month deadline. The only question for purposes of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, is whether, on the totality of the facts and circumstances, there was good cause-i.e., a \u201clegally sufficient reason,\u201d <em>Roan, </em>\u00b6 13-for this delay. The record, in summary, reflects that on February 8, 2012, the Justice Court set a jury trial for the morning of May 3 and notified Luke that he was required to attend personally a pretrial conference set for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>afternoon of April 27. Luke was told that if he did not appear at the conference, the case would be reset for a bench trial \u201cat the next available time.\u201d Luke failed to appear on April 27 at the appointed time. Hence, on April 30, the Justice Court set a bench trial for the afternoon of June 13. As the Justice Court stated when denying Luke\u2019s motion to dismiss, his trial had been \u201crescheduled according to the next available date on the court\u2019s calendar which happened to be today [June 13] at 4 p.m.\u201d We conclude that Luke\u2019s notice of the pretrial conference, his notice of the consequences of not appearing personally at the conference, his unexcused absence from the conference, and the Justice Court\u2019s prompt rescheduling of his trial constituted, together, good cause for holding his trial eight days past the six-month deadline. \u00b621 As a final matter, Luke contends that the Justice Court should have warned him that \u201ctardiness or a failure to appear [at the pretrial conference] will result in the loss of speedy trial rights.\u201d Thus, because he allegedly was not given such warning, Luke argues that his motion to dismiss should have been granted. Luke, however, did not \u201close\u201d his statutory right to a speedy trial by failing to appear at the pretrial conference. Throughout the proceedings, Luke had the right to be brought to trial within six months. That right, however, was not unqualified. It was always subject to delays for \u201cgood cause.\u201d Section 46-13-401(2), MCA. Furthermore, Luke was warned unambiguously that his failure to appear as ordered at the conference would result in his trial being reset for \u201cthe next available time.\u201d Given that the May 3 jury trial setting was already five months after the entry of his pleas, it was certainly plausible that \u201cthe next available time\u201d for his bench trial would fall outside the six-month window. Consequently, even assuming that Luke was required to be given a warning regarding his statutory right to a speedy trial-a requirement for which he cites no authority-he did receive sufficient warning here.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\u00b622 The Justice Court did not err in denying Luke\u2019s motion to dismiss, and the District Court, accordingly, did not err in affirming the Justice Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u00b623 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b429-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-9\"> The statute states, in full: \u201cAfter the entry of a plea upon a misdemeanor charge, the court, unless good cause to the contrary is shown, shall order the prosecution to be dismissed, with prejudice, if a defendant whose trial has not been postponed upon the defendant\u2019s motion is not brought to trial within 6 months.\u201d Section 46-13-401(2), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b429-7\">JUSTICE WHEAT</author>\n<p id=\"Ab0\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">\u00b624 In my view, this Court is wrong to affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Luke\u2019s motion to dismiss because the Justice Court did not grant Luke a trial within six months, as required by statute. Section 46-13-401(2), MCA, <em>requires </em>dismissal of a misdemeanor charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>against a defendant if, after the entry of a plea, the defendant is not brought to trial within six months, the State fails to show good cause for the delay, and the delay is not caused by the defendant\u2019s own motion. As we observed in <em>State v. Bertolino, </em>2003 MT 266, \u00b6 13, 317 Mont. 453, 77 P.3d 543, \u201c[t]he statute itself serves as the sole standard of whether good cause for the delay has been shown.\u201d (Internal citation and quotation omitted.) In <em>Bertolino, </em>we concluded that Bertolino\u2019s \u201cpassive disregard for court-ordered deadlines\u201d was not \u201cgood cause\u201d for a delay beyond the six-month deadline. <em>Bertolino, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">\u00b625 The majority\u2019s opinion relies on the need for flexibility in scheduling we emphasized in <em>State v. Fitzgerald, </em>283 Mont. 162, 940 P.2d 108 (1997). <em>In Fitzgerald, </em>a criminal defendant moved to dismiss pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, even though the delay to his trial was caused by his motions for continuances of his omnibus hearing date. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>283 Mont. at 166-67, 940 P.2d at 110-11. We held that \u201cthe Justice Court cannot be expected to alter its schedule to ensure that the misdemeanor charge is tried within six months\u201d where the defendant\u2019s own motion is the reason for the delay. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>283 Mont. at 167, 940 P.2d at 111. Instead, we observed that \u201c[a] Justice Court must retain a measure of flexibility over scheduling to hear cases on its docket.\u201d <em>Fitzgerald, </em>283 Mont. at 167, 940 P.2d at 111. In contrast, here, Luke did not file any motions or continuances that caused the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\u00b626 The facts of this case are more like those in <em>Bertolino. </em>There, Bertolino and her counsel failed to respond to several court-ordered deadlines, including a deadline to file a waiver of her right to a jury trial. <em>Bertolino, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6-8. The court reset the trial upon the State\u2019s motion because the County Attorney had to appear in Helena on the day set for the trial. <em>Bertolino, </em>\u00b6 7. The court scheduled a non-jury trial, but not within the six months required by statute. <em>Bertolino, </em>\u00b6 8. At the bench trial, Bertolino filed a motion to dismiss because her case had not been brought to trial within six months of the entry of her plea. <em>Bertolino, </em>\u00b6 8. This Court explained there was no connection between the delay to the trial date and Bertolino\u2019s failure to comply with the court orders. <em>Bertolino, </em>\u00b6 15. The State, instead of offering an argument that good cause was established because the County Attorney was not available for trial, simply pointed a finger at Bertolino \u201cin an effort to blame her for the failure to try the case in a timely manner.\u201d <em>Bertolino, </em>\u00b6 15. Since the State failed to demonstrate good cause for the delay, we held that Bertolino\u2019s motion to dismiss should have been granted. <em>Bertolino, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>\u00b627 The State\u2019s attempt to point to Luke\u2019s failure to appear at the pretrial conference as the reason for the delay is an effort to hide the ball that mirrors the argument we rejected in <em>Bertolino. </em>The State blames Luke for its failure to try the case in a timely manner, even though the delay to the trial was not-by the majority\u2019s own admission-caused by any motion of Luke\u2019s. Our decision in <em>Bertolino </em>serves to illustrate that where the State wishes to show good cause for exceeding the six-month limit, it must explain why <em>its </em>actions resulted in that administrative failure. <em>See Bertolino, </em>\u00b6 15. It may not point to the defendant\u2019s actions where the delay has not been caused by some motion or continuance filed by the defendant-the language of the statute forecloses such an argument. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA (providing an exception to the six month limit where trial has been postponed upon the defendant\u2019s motion); <em>Fitzgerald, </em>283 Mont, at 166-67, 940 P.2d at 111 (providing that any pretrial motion with the incidental effect of delaying the trial can be said to \u201cpostpone trial\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">\u00b628 Rather, the State has the burden of showing good cause for the delay sufficient to alleviate its statutory obligation to bring the case to trial within six months. The State has not done so. The record does not reveal why the State failed to bring the case to trial within six months. The court\u2019s routine scheduling practices do not amount to a \u201clegally sufficient reason,\u201d <em>Roan, </em>\u00b6 13, for failing to comply with the statute. Similarly to <em>Bertolino, </em>where the County Attorney\u2019s absence caused the delay to Bertolino\u2019s trial, Luke\u2019s trial date appears to have been delayed solely based on the court\u2019s scheduling practices. Although \u201cthe Justice Court cannot be expected to alter its schedule to ensure that the misdemeanor charge is tried within six months\u201d where the defendant\u2019s own motion is the reason for the delay, <em>Fitzgerald, </em>283 Mont, at 167, 940 P.2d at 111, the court\u2019s convenience does not supersede the State\u2019s obligation to comply with the statute where compliance is possible. The State has provided no reason why the court could not simply have conducted a bench trial during the time scheduled for a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\u00b629 The majority\u2019s opinion does an excellent job explaining the reasons for the scheduling rules. Those reasons, however, are not part of the record and were not set forth in the State\u2019s brief. We review the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\u00b630 Nor should we accept the State\u2019s broad argument that the Justice Court\u2019s need for \u201cflexibility over scheduling,\u201d <em>Fitzgerald, </em>283 Mont, at 167, 940 P.2d at 111, justifies the State\u2019s failure to comply with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>statute. To do so would transform the statutory requirement that misdemeanor cases be brought to trial within six months into a loose guideline subject to the Justice Court\u2019s discretion. Such a result would defy the plain language and intent of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\u00b631 The State has not shown good cause for its failure to bring Luke to trial within the period specified by the statute. I cannot join in the majority\u2019s opinion that the District Court correctly resolved this matter. I would reverse the District Court\u2019s determination and grant Luke\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
