He subsequently obtained new counsel and moved to withdraw his no contest plea. The District Court denied his motion to withdraw, which this Court affirmed. <em>State v. Ellison, </em>2009 MT 408N, 354 Mont. 393 (table), 222 P.3d 645 (table). Ellison then petitioned for postconviction relief, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, and that the District Court misinterpreted the arson statute. The District Court denied Ellison\u2019s petition, and he now appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">\u00b62 On October 23, 2007, Ellison was charged with arson in violation of \u00a7 45-6-103(l)(a), MCA (2005), after a vehicle belonging to Dee Ames sustained fire damage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 1, 2008, Ellison appeared with counsel Jeffrey Michael (\u201cMichael\u201d) and entered a no contest plea to the arson charge. Ellison also filed an acknowledgement of waiver of rights, which indicated that the State would recommend a five-year suspended sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, but that Ellison could argue for a lesser or deferred sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">\u00b63 During the offer of proof at the change of plea hearing, the prosecutor stated that Ellison damaged a vehicle, and that the value of the vehicle exceeded $1,000. Prior to the hearing, Ellison had obtained an appraisal of the vehicle, which identified its market value as $500. Michael, however, determined that the value of the vehicle was irrelevant to the arson charge based upon his interpretation of the statute, and therefore did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s offer of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\u00b64 The prosecutor also proffered that had the State gone to trial it would have presented a surveillance video that showed an individual at the trunk of Ames\u2019 parked vehicle shortly before the fire started. The proffer continued that while it was difficult to make out the identity of the individual seen on the video, the video was completely inconsistent with Ellison\u2019s version of events. In an affidavit Michael later gave in response to Ellison\u2019s petition for postconviction relief, Michael swore that he had reviewed the surveillance video and made the video available to Ellison prior to the hearing. Michael advised Ellison that the surveillance video was inconsistent with Ellison\u2019s story and that the State had enough evidence to find Ellison guilty beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. Michael also explained to Ellison that the State had evidence that Ellison offered to pay a potential witness to tell the same story as Ellison about the fire, and that entering a plea to the arson charge would ensure that the State would not charge him with witness tampering. Michael thus determined that the negotiated plea agreement was in Ellison\u2019s best interest, and advised him to enter a no contest plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b65 After the change of plea hearing, Ellison substituted Michael with attorney Herbert \u201cChuck\u201d Watson (\u201cWatson\u201d). Watson then filed a motion to withdraw Ellison\u2019s no contest plea, arguing that Ellison did not enter it knowingly and voluntarily. The District Court denied Ellison\u2019s motion, finding that Ellison had been aware of the consequences of his decision to enter a no contest plea, and that it was not improperly induced. On May 26, 2009, Ellison was sentenced to five years with all time suspended. Ellison next appealed the denial of his motion to withdraw his no contest plea to this Court and raised the singular issue of whether Ellison\u2019s plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On November 25, 2009, we affirmed the District Court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b66 In February of 2011 Ellison filed a petition for postconviction relief, followed by an amended petition, arguing that the arson statute only applied to property valued at over $1,000, and since the vehicle at issue was worth less than that, there was no factual basis for his no contest plea. His petition outlined three grounds for relief: 1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>District Court erred by accepting a plea on an insufficient factual basis; 2) Michael provided ineffective assistance of counsel by allowing Ellison to enter a plea for a charge that had an insufficient factual basis; and 3) Watson provided ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to raise the issue of the sufficiency of the factual basis of the arson charge on direct appeal. In an affidavit supporting his petition, Ellison swore that Michael never saw the surveillance video, and that Michael did not make the video available for Ellison to view.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u00b67 In its response, the State contended that Ellison\u2019s claims were invalid and procedurally barred. It attached affidavits of attorneys Michael and Watson to refute the ineffective assistance of counsel allegations. On March 15, 2013, the District Court denied Ellison\u2019s petition on the merits, concluding that pursuant to the plain language of the statute, the value of a vehicle is irrelevant to the charge of arson. The District Court summarized its reasoning for denying the petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-5\">Petitioner has failed to demonstrate to this Court that he is entitled to Postconviction Relief. Petitioner entered a knowing and voluntary plea, as determined previously by this District Court as well as the Supreme Court of Montana, waiving all right to challenge nonjurisdictional defects. Regardless, this Court has examined the merits of Petitioner\u2019s claim, and found that Petitioner\u2019s assertion that the State\u2019s offer of proof was insufficient is without merit. Petitioner erroneously interprets the arson statute, arguing that the State was required to demonstrate that the vehicle was valued in excess of $1,000. The plain meaning of the statute proves otherwise. As such, Petitioner cannot demonstrate that the offer of proof was insufficient, nor that his representation was ineffective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Ellison now appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous, and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Camarillo v. State, </em>2005 MT 29, \u00b6 8, 326 Mont. 35, 107 P.3d 1265. Ineffective assistance of counsel claims present mixed questions of law and fact that are reviewed de novo. <em>Miller v. State, </em>2012 MT 131, \u00b6 9, 365 Mont. 264, 280 P.3d 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b69 Ellison argues on appeal that the District Court erred in its interpretation of the arson statute, and in finding that Ellison\u2019s defense counsel did not provide ineffective assistance. Two different attorneys have represented Ellison relative to the arson charge: trial counsel Michael, and appellate counsel Watson. Ellison alleges that both provided ineffective assistance of counsel. For reasons discussed below, we do not find either of Ellison\u2019s arguments convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b6 10 <em>Whether the District Court Erred in its Interpretation of the Arson Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u00b611 The Court\u2019s first step in interpreting a statute is to look at its plain language. <em>State v. Letasky, </em>2007 MT 51, \u00b6 11, 336 Mont. 178, 152 P.3d 1288. \u201cIn the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. If legislative intent can be determined by the plain meaning of the words, the Court may go no further in applying any other meaning or interpretation. <em>State v. Booth, </em>2012 MT 40, \u00b6 11, 364 Mont. 190, 727 P.3d 89 (citing <em>State v. Stiffarm, </em>2011 MT 9, \u00b6 12, 359 Mont. 116, 250 P.3d 300).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\u00b612 Section 45-6-103(l)(a), MCA, states that a person commits the offense of arson when,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">by means of fire or explosives, the person knowingly or purposely ... damages or destroys a structure, vehicle, personal property (other than a vehicle) that exceeds $1,000 in value, crop, pasture, forest, or other real property that is property of another without consent. [Paragraph break omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Ellison argues that the District Court erred in concluding that the arson statute clearly and unambiguously states that the $1,000 threshold only applies to personal property. He proposes that \u201c$1,000\u201d modifies all preceding categories of property listed in the statute, including vehicles, and since the fire-damaged vehicle was worth less than $1,000, there was an insufficient factual basis for which to enter a no contest plea to arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">\u00b613  In considering \u00a7 45-6-103(l)(a), MCA, in its entirety, the plain language clearly states that the $1,000 threshold applies only to the category of \u201cpersonal property,\u201d which does not include vehicles. As the District Court correctly noted, \u201cvehicles are clearly not included in the category of personal property, plainly evidenced by the phrase \u2018other than a vehicle.\u2019 \u201d Ellison\u2019s interpretation of the statute, which he concedes is not supported by case law, is based on a partial reading of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>the statute which omits all the categories of property that follow \u201cpersonal property.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such an interpretation violates our precedent establishing that \u201cstatutes must be read and considered in their entirety and the legislative intent may not be gained from the wording of any particular section or sentence, but only from a consideration of the whole.\u201d <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 126, \u00b6 27, 321 Mont. 280, 90 P.3d 426 (citing <em>Home Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n of Helena v. Fulton, </em>141 Mont. 113, 115, 375 P.2d 312, 313 (1962)). Ellison\u2019s interpretation of the statute also violates \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA, because it does not rely on the plain language of the statute, and instead relies on the omission of the remaining categories of property. <em>See State v. Cooksey, </em>2012 MT 226, \u00b6 74, 366 Mont. 346, 286 P.3d 1174; <em>State v. Gould, </em>273 Mont. 207, 219-20, 902 P.2d 532, 540-41; <em>In re R.L.S., </em>1999 MT 34, \u00b6 12, 293 Mont. 288, 977 P.2d 967; <em>State v. Incashola, </em>1998 MT 184, \u00b6 13, 289 Mont. 399, 961 P.2d 745; <em>Schuff v. A.T. Kelmens &amp; Sons, </em>2000 MT 357, \u00b6\u00b6 115-126, 303 Mont. 274, 16 P.3d 1002. The statute is clear on its face, and therefore we may go no further in applying any other meaning or interpretation. As such, the District Court did not err in determining that the threshold of $1,000 for property crimes does not apply to vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b614 <em>Whether the District Court Erred in Finding that Ellison\u2019s Attorneys were not Ineffective</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b615 The right to effective assistance of counsel is guaranteed by both the United States and the Montana Constitutions. U.S. Const, amend. VI; Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 24. A two part test determines when counsel is ineffective. First, a defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. Counsel is deficient when his or her conduct falls below an objectively reasonable standard measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 20, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. Second, the defendant must also show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. Prejudice occurs when counsel\u2019s errors were so serious that they deprived the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Wilson v. State, </em>1999 MT 271, \u00b6 12, 296 Mont. 465, 989 P.2d 813 (citing <em>Strickland v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number><em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2205, 2064 (1984)). In the context of a guilty plea, a petitioner establishes prejudice by showing that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he or she would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. <em>State v. Henderson, </em>2004 MT 173, \u00b6 9, 322 Mont. 69, 93 P.3d 1231. A defendant must satisfy both parts of this test in order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Thus, if an insufficient showing is made regarding one part of the test, there is no need to address the other part. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b616 Ellison bases his ineffective assistance of counsel claims on Michael\u2019s and Watson\u2019s failure to advance at trial and on appeal, respectively, Ellison\u2019s interpretation of \u201cvalue\u201d in the arson statute. Additionally, Ellison argues that Michael did not review the surveillance video or obtain an expert analysis prior to the change of plea hearing, and that Watson did not raise the issue of the surveillance video on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b617 Value of the Vehicle</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u00b618  Ellison maintains that both Michael and Watson were ineffective for not addressing the factual sufficiency of Ellison\u2019s no contest plea. He again argues that the fact the vehicle was valued at less than $1,000 means that he could not have been charged with arson pursuant to \u00a7 45-6-103(l)(a), MCA. As previously explained, this is an incorrect interpretation of the plain meaning of the statute. A claim of constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel will not succeed when predicated upon counsel\u2019s failure to make motions or objections which, under the circumstances, would have been frivolous, which would have been, arguably, without procedural or substantive merit, or which, otherwise, would likely not have changed the outcome of the proceeding. <em>Heddings v. State, </em>2011 MT 228, \u00b6 33, 326 Mont. 90, 265 P.3d 600; <em>see e.g. State v. Hildreth, </em>267 Mont. 423, 432-33, 884 P.2d 771, 777 (1994); <em>State v. Maki, </em>2004 MT 226, \u00b6\u00b6 10-12, 322 Mont. 420, 97 P.3d 556; <em>State v. Frasure, </em>2004 MT 305, \u00b6 12, 323 Mont. 479, 100 P.3d 1013; <em>Adams v. State, </em>2007 MT 35, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37, 336 Mont. 63, 153 P.3d 601; <em>Foston v. State, </em>2010 MT 281, \u00b6 13, 358 Mont. 469, 245 P.3d 1103. Because the value of the vehicle is immaterial to the arson charge, it would have been frivolous for either of Ellison\u2019s attorneys to object or appeal on this issue. Thus, because Ellison cannot prove that either attorney was deficient in his decisions regarding the value of the vehicle, he cannot establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u00b619 Surveillance Video</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\u00b620 Ellison also argues that Michael was deficient for failing to obtain an expert analysis of the surveillance video prior to the change of plea hearing, and for failing to object to its mention during the prosecutor\u2019s offer of proof. Ellison further contends that Watson was deficient for not raising this issue on' appeal. Ellison relies on a report by an expert in surveillance systems, obtained in support of his petition for postconviction relief, which states that the surveillance video showed fire and smoke coming from an unidentified vehicle, followed by the appearance of \u201cone and two or even three barely visible\u201d unidentifiable individuals in the vicinity of the fire. The report notes, \u201cit is truly impossible to determine anything even remotely associated with actions taken or intent.\u201d Even though the report clearly states that the surveillance video is unreliable due to its quality, Ellison nonetheless relies on the video to corroborate Ellison\u2019s version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b621 Counsel has a duty to conduct reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that particular investigations are unnecessary. \u201cIn any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments.\u201d <em>Dawson v. State, </em>2000 MT 219, \u00b6 75, 301 Mont. 135, 10 P.3d 49. Here, Michael\u2019s decisions not to object to the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the surveillance video at the change of plea hearing, or get an expert analysis of the video prior to the hearing, are reasonable under the circumstances. Michael swore in his affidavit that he watched the video prior to the hearing, and that he explained to Ellison that its contents were damaging to Ellison. The fact that an expert witness later would conclude that the video was not reliable does nothing to establish that Michael\u2019s representation fell below an objectively reasonable standard. In fact, it confirms that Michael\u2019s decision not to retain an expert in video surveillance was reasonable. Ellison therefore fails to establish that Michael\u2019s actions concerning the surveillance video were deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b622 For the same reasons, Watson\u2019s decision not to raise the issue of the video on appeal was also objectively reasonable under the circumstances. Furthermore, it is well established that appellate counsel need not raise every colorable issue on appeal. <em>Rose v. State, </em>2013 MT 161, \u00b6 28, 370 Mont. 398, 304 P.3d 387. Our presumption of effective assistance of appellate counsel will be overcome only when \u201cignored issues are clearly stronger than those presented.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>\u00b6 28. Watson\u2019s affidavit states that he believed Ellison had waived all challenges to the sufficiency of the State\u2019s offer of proof by entering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>no contest plea, and thus chose to argue what he believed was Ellison\u2019s strongest argument-that his plea was not knowingly or voluntarily entered. Ellison has presented no evidence that overcomes the presumption that Watson\u2019s representation was effective. Thus, Watson\u2019s representation of Ellison cannot be deemed deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b623 Because Ellison cannot establish the deficiency portion of the ineffective assistance of counsel test, we need not proceed with the prejudice analysis. As such, Ellison\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims necessarily fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u00b624  The District Court properly interpreted \u00a7 45-6-103( l)(a), MCA, when it found that knowing or purposeful fire damage to a vehicle, regardless of the vehicle\u2019s value, constitutes arson. Therefore, the District Court did not err in its interpretation of the statute. Additionally, Ellison is unable to prove that either Michael or Watson provided ineffective assistance. In sum, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Ellison\u2019s petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<judges id=\"b191-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-12\"> Ellison\u2019s offense was committed on May 19, 2007, and thus the 2005 Montana Code Annotated applies. <em>State v.
