The State was represented by Angela Wetzsteon, Deputy County Attorney for Ravalli County.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-16\">Before hearing the Application, the Defendant was advised that the Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The Defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Division. The Defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-17\">Rule 17 of the Rules of the Sentence Review Division of the Supreme Court of Montana provides that, \u201cThe sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct, and the sentence will not be reduced or increased unless it is deemed clearly inadequate or excessive.\u201d (Section 46-18-904(3), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-18\">The majority of the Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is inadequate or excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-19\">Therefore, it is decision of the Division that the sentence shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>AFFIRMED.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"Ajd\">DATED this 12th day of December, 2013.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Done in open Court this 7th day of November, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Chairperson, Hon. Loren Tucker and Member Hon. Kathy Seeley.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Hon. Bradley G. Newman respectfully dissents. He would increase the sentence as requested by the State (Deputy County Attorney Angela Wetzsteon). The sentence was clearly inadequate to address the repeated nature of Defendant\u2019s violent crimes against other person.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Member, Hon. Bradley G.
