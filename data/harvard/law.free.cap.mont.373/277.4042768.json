We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\u00b63 We have consolidated the appeal and cross-appeal issues into the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">\n<em>1. Did the District Court correctly define the width of the public right-of-way at the intersection of Seyler Lane and the Ruby River?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">\n<em>2.

Did the District Court effectuate an unconstitutional taking of Kennedy\u2019s property when it ruled that the public may access the Ruby River via the right-of-way granted by the Lewis Lane deed?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">\u00b64 Duncan District Road, Lewis Lane, and Seyler Lane are county roads in Madison County, Montana. All three roads cross the Ruby River by way of bridges. The bridges were constructed by, and are currently maintained by, Madison County. Kennedy owns land that abuts the public rights-of-way on both Seyler Lane and Lewis Lane. \u00b65 PLAA filed a complaint against Madison County in May 2004, alleging that individuals who owned property adjacent to the three bridges had erected fences along each county road to the ends of each bridge, preventing the public from using the rights-of-way to access the Ruby River. PLAA twice amended its complaint and ultimately sought, among other things, a declaratory judgment that the public may use Duncan District Road, Lewis Lane, and Seyler Lane, and their bridges and bridge abutments, to access the Ruby River. Kennedy intervened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>as a defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b66 The parties moved for summary judgment, and, after holding a hearing on the matter, the District Court issued an order on October 1, 2008. The court held, in part, that the public rights-of-way at Duncan District Road and Lewis Lane are each 60 feet wide, and the public is entitled to use the entire 60 foot width to access the Ruby River. With respect to Seyler Lane, the court determined at the hearing that, because the right-of-way was established by prescriptive use as opposed to statutory petition (Duncan District Road) or dedication or grant (Lewis Lane), additional fact finding was necessary to determine the width of the right-of-way and whether the public could use it to access the Ruby River. Summary judgment pertaining to Seyler Lane was therefore denied, and a trial was ordered to resolve the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b67 The parties stipulated to the facts set forth below, through paragraph 15, prior to trial. Seyler Lane and Seyler Bridge were constructed by Madison County, but there are no records which verify the date of their original construction. Madison County re-constructed Seyler Bridge in its present location after a 1976 flood. Kennedy owns the fee title to the land underlying Seyler Bridge and the bridge approaches on Seyler Lane, including the bed and banks of the Ruby River. The Seyler Bridge surface is 24 feet wide. The area of the bridge surface between the guard rails on the bridge is 21.35 feet wide. The paved portion of the road approaching the bridge is approximately 20 feet wide and sits atop road fill that slopes down and away from the edge of the pavement. The bottom edge of the road fill is referred to as \u201ctoe of road fill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u00b68 In June 2004, Madison County issued Kennedy an \u201cEncroachment Permit for Fence on County Bridge Right-of-Way Madison, Montana\u201d (the \u201cEncroachment Permit\u201d). Pursuant to the Encroachment Permit, Kennedy installed private fences at three of the bridge corners at Seyler Bridge. Some of the fences are located at the toe of road fill, while others are inside or outside the toe of road fill. The fences do not impede, block, or intimidate the public from reaching the Ruby River. \u00b69 Madison County has assumed jurisdiction over Seyler Lane and Seyler Bridge and is responsible for maintaining them. Madison County maintains the paved surface of Seyler Lane, including the toe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>and shoulder, as well as the areas beyond the travelled surface and adjacent subsurface, by mowing, snow plowing, and weed spraying. Madison County also maintains the subjacent and lateral support of Seyler Bridge, including the bridge abutments, wing walls, and bridge spans.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\u00b6 10 Finally, and of particular import to this appeal, the parties agreed upon the following fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">Seyler Bridge and its approaches on Seyler Lane is a county road right-of-way that was established by prescriptive use. There is no dispute that the public has the right to use the paved portion of Seyler Bridge and its approaches on Seyler Lane for travel across Seyler Bridge over the Ruby River.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\u00b611 A bench trial was held January 9-11, 2012, at which both parties presented exhibits and witness testimony. On April 16, 2012, the District Court issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and final judgment. We will refer to the findings and conclusions in more detail below. The gist of the District Court\u2019s decision, however, was that PLAA failed to prove the existence of a public prescriptive easement beyond the fences at Seyler Bridge by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AZs\">\u00b612 The final judgment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">1. Westerly and southerly of the Seyler Bridge, the public has a prescriptive right to travel and to use Seyler Lane between the fences and likewise upon the Seyler Bridge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">2. Madison County has a prescriptive right independent and separate from public use to lateral and subjacent support for Seyler Lane and Seyler Bridge, together with such additional land as is reasonable and necessary for maintenance and repair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">3. Except as described in paragraph 2 above, there is no public right whatsoever on either side of Seyler Lane outside the fences or beyond the traveled way where there is no fence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">\u00b613 PLAA appeals this decision, and Kennedy cross-appeals from the court\u2019s order regarding the parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">\u00b614 We review for clear error a district court\u2019s findings of fact. <em>Boyne USA, Inc. v. Spanish Peaks Dev., LLC, </em>2013 MT 1, \u00b6 28, 3.68 Mont. 143, 292 P.3d 432. Clear error exists if substantial credible evidence fails to support the findings of fact, if the district court misapprehended the evidence\u2019s effect, or if we have a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. <em>Spanish Peaks, </em>\u00b6 28. We review for correctness a district court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Spanish Peaks, </em>\u00b6 28. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u00b615 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on motions for summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>using the same M. R. Civ. P. 56 criteria used by the district court. <em>Mt. West Bank, N.A. v. Cherrad, LLC, </em>2013 MT 99, \u00b6 25, 369 Mont. 492, 301 P.3d 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\u00b616 The issues PLAA raises on appeal relate to one overarching question: May the public use the Seyler Lane right-of-way to access the Ruby River? This inquiry breaks down into two subsets of questions: What is the width of the Seyler Lane right-of-way, and may the public use the right-of-way for recreational purposes? We address these issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\u00b617 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court correctly define the width of the public right-of-way at the intersection of Seyler Lane and the Ruby River?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\u00b618 The parties stipulated, and the District Court found, that Seyler Bridge and its approaches on Seyler Lane is a county road right-of-way that was established by prescriptive use. Despite this finding, the court determined that the public could only use the portion of the right-of-way \u201cbetween the fences and ... upon the Seyler Bridge.\u201d It reserved use of the areas necessary for maintenance and repairs, which included lateral and subjacent support for Seyler Lane and Seyler Bridge and \u201csuch additional land as is reasonable and necessary,\u201d exclusively for Madison County. By doing so, the District Court effectively split the public right-of-way into a narrower primary public right-of-way for travel and a wider secondary limited easement for maintenance and repairs, and explicitly excluded the public from using the County\u2019s secondary easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">\u00b619  For the reasons stated below, we reverse the District Court\u2019s decision that the County has a secondary easement for purposes of construction, maintenance and repair that is separate from the public road right-of-way. In a public road right-of-way established by prescription, the areas necessary to support and maintain the road, as well as the land needed to make the road safe and convenient for public use, are included in the public right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Secondary Easements</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">\u00b620 PLAA argues that, because Seyler Bridge and its approaches on Seyler Lane is a county road right-of-way acquired by prescriptive use, the public has obtained by prescription the right to use both the portion of the roadway actually traveled or paved and the land needed for the support and maintenance of the paved and traveled portion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>including shoulders and ditches. PLAA asserts that the District Court\u2019s recognition of a secondary easement \u201cwas unnecessary and improperly limited the public\u2019s use of the rights acquired in the Seyler Lane prescriptive easement by granting a <em>de facto </em>private easement to the County for maintenance activities\u201d (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b621 In support of finding that the county holds a secondary easement for repair and maintenance, the District Court relied upon the following cases: <em>Laden v. Atkeson, </em>112 Mont. 302, 116 P.2d 881 (1941); <em>Guthrie v. Hardy, </em>2001 MT 122, 305 Mont. 367, 28 P.3d 467; <em>Kelly v. Wallace, </em>1998 MT 307, 292 Mont. 129, 972 P.2d 1117; and <em>Ferguson v. Standley, </em>89 Mont. 489, 300 P. 245 (1931). Unlike the case at hand, however, these cases all involved private easements. None involved a public road.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u00b622 Our seminal case on secondary easements is <em>Laden. </em>There, the plaintiff landowners had an easement in a ditch that ran through the defendant\u2019s land. The defendant did not contest this right, but did challenge the plaintiffs\u2019 right to enter upon the defendant\u2019s lands in order to reach the ditch and to use lands on the sides of the ditch for maintenance and repair. We ruled for the plaintiffs and recognized that \u201c \u2018[t]he owner of a dominant estate having an easement, has the right to enter upon the servient estate and make repairs necessary for the reasonable and convenient use of the easement, doing no unnecessary injury to the servient estate.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019 Laden, </em>112 Mont. at 306, 116 P.2d at 884 (internal quotations omitted). Such a right is called a \u201csecondary easement,\u201d and is a \u201cmere incident of the easement that passes by express or implied grant, or is acquired by prescription.\u201d <em>Laden, </em>112 Mont. at 305-06, 116 P.2d at 883 (internal quotations omitted). We stated that the secondary easement \u201ccan be exercised only when necessary and in such a reasonable manner as not to needlessly increase the burden upon the servient tenement.\u201d <em>Laden, </em>112 Mont. at 306, 116 P.2d at 884 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\u00b623 Since <em>Laden, </em>we have recognized secondary easement rights in a number of cases involving private ditch easements. <em>See e.g. Shammel v. Vogl, </em>144 Mont. 354, 396 P.2d 103 (1964); <em>O\u2019Connor v. Brodie, </em>153 Mont. 129, 454 P.2d 920 (1969); <em>Sharon v. Hayden, </em>246 Mont. 186, 803 P.2d 1083 (1990); <em>Kephart v. Portmann, </em>259 Mont. 232, 855 P.2d 120 (1993); <em>Engel v. Gampp, </em>2000 MT 17, 298 Mont. 116, 993 P.2d 701; <em>Musselshell Ranch Co. v. Seidel-Joukova, </em>2011 MT 217, 362 Mont. 1, 261 P.3d 570. In 1981, the Montana Legislature codified secondary easement rights. Section 70-17-112, MCA, provides that an owner of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>a canal or ditch easement has a secondary easement to enter the servient tenement to inspect, repair, and maintain the canal or ditch.</p>\n<p id=\"AaNY\">\u00b624 At issue in the present case, in contrast to a private easement, is a county road acquired by prescriptive use. When a county road is established, the public acquires the right-of-way \u201cand the incidents necessary to enjoying and maintaining it.\u201d Section 7-14-2107(3), MCA. We previously have observed that Montana statutes \u201cclarify that a public highway consists of more than the surface of a roadway,\u201d and is not \u201climited to the driving surface.\u201d <em>DeVoe v. State, </em>281 Mont. 356, 369-70, 935 P.2d 256, 264 (1997). Our case law is also clear that the establishment of a public road by prescriptive use contemplates the general public\u2019s use of the roadway as well as the land needed for construction, repairs and maintenance. We do not separate the different uses to create two distinct interests-a public road for travel and a secondary easement for the County\u2019s maintenance-as the District Court did. Rather, we recognize one public road right-of-way. <em>See Rasmussen v. Fowler, </em>245 Mont. 308, 312, 800 P.2d 1053, 1056 (1990) (finding a public prescriptive road easement based upon evidence of county maintenance of the road as well as other public uses); <em>McClurg v. Flathead County Comm\u2019rs, </em>188 Mont. 20, 24, 610 P.2d 1153, 1156 (1980) (finding a public prescriptive road easement based in part upon evidence of \u201cgrading, laying gravel and other maintenance of the road\u201d); <em>Smith v. Russell, </em>2003 MT 326, \u00b6\u00b6 14-17, 21, 318 Mont. 336, 80 P.3d 431 (finding that the public\u2019s use of a road coupled with Toole County\u2019s maintenance of the road established a public highway); <em>Hitshew v. Butte/Silver Bow Co., </em>1999 MT 26, \u00b6 18, 293 Mont. 212, 974 P.2d 650 (\u201c[T]he public\u2019s use coupled with a county government\u2019s regular maintenance of a roadway without the landowner\u2019s permission is evidence of adverse use.\u201d); <em>Swandal Ranch Co. v. Hunt, </em>276 Mont. 229, 235-36, 915 P.2d 840 (1996) (determining that evidence of regular county road maintenance supported the element of adversity in a claim to a public prescriptive road easement); <em>PLAA v. Jones, </em>2004 MT 394, \u00b6 33, 325 Mont. 236, 104 P.3d 496 (finding a public prescriptive road easement based upon evidence of public use, including recreational use, and Teton County\u2019s periodic maintenance of the road).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\u00b625 This approach is consistent with the general rule that the width of a public prescriptive roadway extends beyond the traveled portion of the road to include areas necessary for its support and maintenance. <em>See e.g., McKenzie Co. v. Reichman, </em>812 N.W.2d 332, 344 (N.D. 2012) (\u201cThe width of a prescriptive road must be determined by actual use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>over the prescriptive period and may include shoulders and ditches needed to support and maintain the traveled portion of the road.\u201d); <em>Nikiel v. Buffalo, </em>7 Misc. 2d 667, 670 (N.Y. Sup. 1957) (\u201c[T]he width and extent of a highway established by prescription or use ... is not necessarily limited to the beaten path or traveled tract. It carries with it ... such width as is reasonably necessary for the safety and convenience of the traveling public and for ordinary repairs and improvements. A highway established by user includes the traveled tract and whatever land is necessarily used or is incidental thereto for highway purposes.\u201d); <em>Yturria Town &amp; Improv. Co. v. Hidalgo Co., </em>125 S.W.2d 1092, 1094 (Tex. App. 1939) (\u201cWhen a road is established by prescription, the right is not limited to the beaten path used, but may be made to include sufficient land for drainage ditches, repairs and the convenience of the traveling public.\u201d); <em>Keidel v. Rask, </em>290 N.W.2d 255, 258 (N.D. 1980) (\u201cThe width of a prescriptive public road established in the absence of a law specifying its width ... necessarily includes not only the actual traveled surface area of the roadway, but also any adjacent land which is needed for the prescription to be maintained as a public road, including any land reasonably necessary for ditches, shoulders, and slopes.\u201d); <em>Teadtke v. Havranek, 777 </em>N.W.2d 810, 820 (Neb. 2010) (\u201cIf the public has acquired the right to a highway by prescription, it is not limited in width to the actual beaten path, but the right extends to such width as is reasonably necessary for public travel.\u201d); <em>Campbell v. Covington Co., </em>137 So. 111 (Miss. 1931) (In a highway established by prescription, \u201cthe public are not limited to the actual width used by them-the beaten path. The prescriptive right carries with it the beaten path and whatever is necessary to make the beaten path a usable highway ... .\u201d); <em>see also </em>Jon W. Bruce and James W. Ely, Jr., <em>The Law of Easements and Licenses in Land </em>\u00a7 7:12, 7-29 (Thomson Reuters 2013) (\u201cIn the case of a prescriptive roadway, particularly one acquired by the public, the width may extend beyond the paved or packed road surface to include areas used for cars to pass each other, for drainage ditches, and for shoulders.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\">\u00b626  We agree with these authorities and hold that the concept of a limited secondary easement does not apply to determine the width of a public road right-of-way established by prescriptive use. Here, the parties stipulated that there is a county road right-of-way established by prescriptive use at Seyler Lane and Seyler Bridge. The issue is thus not whether a public road right-of-way exists, but rather the width of that already existing right-of-way. Pursuant to the above discussion, we determine the Seyler Lane public right-of-way is not confined to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>portion of the road actually traveled. Instead, its width extends beyond the traveled way and includes whatever land is reasonably necessary to support and maintain the road and for the road to be safely and conveniently used.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\">Width of Seyler Lane right-of-way</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b627 The District Court did not establish a definite width for the County\u2019s secondary easement. Instead, it defined the easement by reference to \u201cthe lateral and subjacent support for Seyler Lane and Seyler Bridge\u201d and to \u201csuch additional land as is reasonable and necessary for maintenance and repair.\u201d Because we reverse the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the County holds a separate secondary easement, we remand to determine the width of the single public road right-of-way. That determination must be made in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b628 We begin with the well-recognized principle that the minimum 60-foot road width required by \u00a7 7-14-2112(1), MCA, does not apply to roads established by prescriptive use. <em>Wohl v. City of Missoula, </em>2013 MT 46, \u00b6 42, 369 Mont. 108, 300 P.3d 1119; <em>State v. Portmann, </em>149 Mont. 91, 98, 423 P.2d 56, 56 (1967). Rather, the width of a roadway acquired by prescription is \u201cdetermined as a question of fact by the character and extent of its use and may be more or less than the width of highways established by statute.\u201d <em>Portmann, </em>149 Mont. at 95, 423 P.2d at 58 (citing <em>State ex rel. Game, Forestation and Parks Commn. v. Hull, </em>97 N.W.2d 535 (Neb. 1959)) (also citing <em>Descheemaeker v. Anderson, </em>131 Mont. 322, 326, 310 P.2d 587, 589 (1957) (\u201cthe public may obtain title by adverse possession of that only which it has occupied during the full statutory period.\u201d)). <em>See also Lovvorn v. Salisbury, </em>701 P.2d 142, 144 (Colo. App. 1985) (width of public road established by prescriptive use is to be made by reference to the width established by the use). Therefore, the District Court must consider, in addition to the land necessary to support and maintain the road, historical evidence of the nature of the enjoyment by which the public acquired the right-of-way. Section 70-17-106, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u00b629 A bridge is a part of the public road upon which it is built. Section 60-1-103(22), MCA; <em>State ex rel. Furnish v. Mullendore, </em>53 Mont. 109, 113-15, 161 P. 949, 951-52 (1916) (\u201ca bridge is part and parcel of the highway upon which it is built.... If the highways belong to the public, it must follow that anything permanently affixed to them, either in the way of repairs or in the form of completed structures, such as bridges and the like, become a part of them, and as much of public right as the highways themselves.\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Foster v. Ritch, </em>49 Mont. 155, 156-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>57, 140 P. 731, 731 (1914) (\u201cA bridge is to be treated as but a portion of a public highway.\u201d) Abridge includes \u201call appurtenances, additions, alterations, improvements and replacements and the approaches to the bridge, lands used in connection with the bridge, and improvements incident or integral to the bridge.\u201d Section 60-1-103(2), MCA. This statute makes clear that Seyler Bridge, including its appurtenances, additions, alterations, improvements and replacements and the approaches to the bridge, lands used in connection with the bridge, and improvements incident or integral to the bridge, is part of the Seyler Lane county road right-of-way. This public road right-of-way must be considered along with evidence of the public\u2019s use in determining width.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\">\u00b630  Like the Seyler Lane roadway, which requires areas beyond the traveled surface for its support and maintenance, Seyler Bridge\u2019s upkeep necessitates use of adjacent land. Madison County maintains the subjacent and lateral support for Seyler Bridge. Bridge inspectors Daniel Gravage and Shane Escott testified that access to the Ruby River for purposes of performing essential bridge inspections requires use of neighboring land. Consistent with \u00a7\u00a7 60-1-103(2) and 7-14-2107(3), MCA, the District Court should consider the land used for support and maintenance of the bridge in determining the width of the public\u2019s right-of-way. The width of a county road or bridge acquired by prescription must be sufficient to encompass the incidents necessary to enjoying, supporting and maintaining the roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u00b631 This analysis regarding the width of the right-of-way is consistent with the Encroachment Permit Madison County issued to Kennedy in 2004. The Encroachment Permit allowed Kennedy to construct and maintain \u201ca fence on the county bridge right-of-way for the purpose of keeping livestock off the county road[.]\u201d Kennedy installed the fences at Seyler Bridge pursuant to this permit. The right-of-way\u2019s boundaries are not defined by Kennedy\u2019s fences that narrow at the bridge; rather, the fences cut through the public road right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"Aki\">\u00b632 In sum, we reverse the District Court\u2019s determination that the County holds a secondary easement that is independent of the public\u2019s right-of-way. We remand for the court to consider the evidence in the record, and conduct whatever additional proceedings it deems necessary, to establish a definite width of the single, unified, public road right-of-way at Seyler Lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b633 <em>Issue Two: In determining the width of the public right-of-way at the intersection of Seyler Lane and the Ruby River, did the District Court err by excluding evidence of recreational use ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>\u00b634 PLAA argues that the District Court erred by excluding evidence of historical recreational use by the public in determining the width of the public road right-of-way at Seyler Bridge. During the trial, the court determined there was no \u201cbasis to utilize recreational use for purposes of establishing a prescriptive right\u201d and, accordingly, prohibited PLAA from presenting evidence of recreational use of the Seyler Lane right-of-way. Following trial, PLAA submitted an offer of proof regarding recreational use at Seyler Bridge. The court subsequently issued its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, concluding that \u201c[Recreational use is insufficient to establish a prescriptive easement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\">\u00b635 This Court has held that \u201c \u2018seasonal use by hunters, fisherman, hikers, campers, use by neighbors visiting neighbors, and persons cutting Christmas trees and gathering firewood are not sufficient to establish [prescriptive] use.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leisz v.

We have not, however, held that recreational use may never be considered. <em>See e.g. Brown &amp; Brown of MT, Inc. v.

Recreational use may be one factor in \u201cthe nature of the enjoyment\u201d by which the public road right-of-way was acquired by prescriptive use and, thus, may be considered in determining the width of the public road right-of-way. Further, in assessing the nature of such recreational use, we have recognized that implied acquiescence does not amount to permission, to defeat a showing of adverse use. <em>Brown &amp; Brown of MT, Inc., </em>\u00b6 26. In <em>Lunceford v. Trenk, </em>163 Mont. 504, 518 P.2d 266 (1974), we affirmed a judgment finding a prescriptive easement and declaring a public roadway, rejecting the argument that the use was permissive. We followed long-established law that, to prove the existence of a public road by prescription, \u201cit must be shown that the public followed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>definite course continuously and uninterruptedly for the prescribed statutory period together with an assumption of control adverse to the owner.\u201d <em>Lunceford, </em>163 Mont. at 508, 518 P.2d at 268. We noted that \u201c[the] testimony indicated that the use was not permissive, that no request for permission to use the road was asked nor given to a vast majority of the users. Plaintiffs assumed they had a right to use the road and used it.\u201d <em>Lunceford, </em>163 Mont. at 509, 518 P.2d at 268. \u201cOur case law has long recognized that \u2018[continuous use\u2019 does not mean constant use; rather, if the claimant used the property in dispute whenever he desired, without interference by the owner of the servient estate, the use was continuous and uninterrupted.\u201d <em>Brown &amp; Brown of MT Inc., </em>\u00b6 34 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\">\u00b637 On remand, the plaintiffs are entitled to present evidence of recreational use to inform the District Court\u2019s determination of the width of the public right-of-way. As PLAA recognized during trial, that evidence will have to be confined to use pre-dating the 1985 statute that prohibits acquiring a prescriptive easement through \u201cthe entering or crossing of private property to reach surface waters.\u201d Section 23-2-322(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b638  Accordingly, we remand for the District Court to consider the evidence in the record, and conduct whatever additional proceedings it deems necessary, to establish a definite width of the public road right-of-way at Seyler Bridge. The District Court should consider the lands used in connection with the bridge (\u00a7 60-1-103(2), MCA); \u201cthe incidents necessary to enjoying and maintaining it\u201d (\u00a7 7-14-2107(3), MCA); and historical evidence of the \u201cnature of the enjoyment by which it was acquired\u201d (\u00a7 70-17-106, MCA), including evidence of recreational use. Any recreational uses by the public beyond the width necessary for the construction, maintenance and repair of the roadway and the bridge would have to be established through clear and convincing evidence for the requisite statutory period. <em>See Brown &amp; Brown of MT, Inc., </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Portmann, </em>149 Mont. at 95-96, 423 P.2d at 58. \u00b639 <em>Issue Three: Is the use of a public road right-of-way established by prescription limited to historic use, or does it extend to all public uses, including recreation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b640 The essential dispute here is whether the public can access the Ruby River from Seyler Lane for recreational purposes-specifically, whether the public can travel from Seyler Lane down to the high water mark of the river. The District Court determined it could not. The court\u2019s holding was based on its finding that PLAA failed to submit sufficient evidence of adverse public use to establish a prescriptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>easement over the land between the fences that abut Seyler Bridge and the high water mark of the Ruby River; and on its conclusion that usage of a prescriptive road is limited to the original use during the prescriptive period.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b641 The District Court did recognize a prescriptive right for the County to use any land needed for maintenance and repair, but determined that such land is not available for public use. The court concluded that \u201cCounty maintenance does not show usage by the public at large for purposes of public travel over areas utilized for maintenance of the road and bridge,\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is a distinction between the right of the government to maintain the roadway bridge and the right of the public to travel everywhere maintenance activity is undertaken.\u201d Finally, the court determined that the \u201cCounty prescriptive right to use maintenance areas cannot be transformed into a new traveled way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b642  We have reversed the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the areas needed for maintenance and repairs are not a part of the public right-of-way. We must now consider whether PLAA is required to show that particular areas within the public road right-of-way have been used adversely to access the Ruby River in order for the public to now use them as such. We determine it is not. Once a public road is established by prescriptive use, the use of that road is not limited to the adverse usage through which the road was acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u00b643 Section 70-17-106, MCA, provides that \u201c[t]he extent of a servitude is determined by the terms of the grant or the nature of the enjoyment by which it was acquired.\u201d We have applied this statute in many cases involving <em>private </em>prescriptive easements and determined that it \u201climits owners of a prescriptive easement to the use that was established during the prescriptive period.\u201d <em>Kelly v. </em>Wallace, 1998 MT 307, \u00b6 31, 292 Mont. 129, 972 P.2d 1117. However, in cases in which we have found that a <em>public </em>prescriptive road has been established, we have not held that the scope of use was limited to the historic use through which the road was acquired. <em>Seee.g. Swandal Ranch Co., </em>276 Mont. 229, 915 P.2d 840; <em>Granite Co. v.

Portmann, </em>149 Mont. 91, 423 P.2d 56 (1967). The AG Opinion provides that \u201cfor county roads and bridges established by prescription, their use as access to waters is dependent upon their width and use during the prescriptive period,\u201d and cites to <em>Kelly </em>and <em>Portmann </em>for support. 48 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. no. 13, \u00a7 III(c) (2000). Notably, <em>Kelly </em>involved a private easement, and <em>Portmann </em>is not on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b645 In <em>Portmann, </em>we held that \u201cthe rights acquired by adverse use can never exceed the greatest use of the land for the full prescriptive period.\u201d <em>Portmann, </em>149 Mont. at 96, 423 P.2d at 58. However, at issue in <em>Portmann </em>was not the scope of use of an easement, but rather the width of the easement. The Court did not examine the scope of permitted uses within the prescriptive roadway. <em>Portmann </em>thus does not stand for the proposition that the scope of use of a public prescriptive road is limited to historical adverse usage through which the road was acquired. Rather, as discussed above, it supports our conclusion that public uses should be considered in determining the <em>width </em>of the public road right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b646 Our review of case law from other jurisdictions reveals that the scope of use for public prescriptive easements generally is not construed as strictly as the scope of use for private prescriptive easements. \u201cNumerous authorities hold that the scope of public prescriptive easements is broad enough to include reasonably foreseeable public uses.\u201d Bruce &amp; Ely, <em>Law of Easements and Licenses in Land </em>\u00a7 8:12, 8-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\u00b647 In <em>Lovvorn, </em>701 P.2d at 144, the Colorado Court of Appeals determined that a public prescriptive easement created through historical vehicular travel could also be used to trail cattle. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">The ultimate distinction between a public road and a private easement, however acquired, is that the private easement can be, and is, limited to specific individuals and/or specific uses while a public road is open to all members of the public for <em>any </em>uses consistent with the dimensions, type of surface, and location of the roadway. There is no logical way to advise the members of the public as to which portions of the public roads they travel are subject to specific historic uses, much less to enforce the use of the roads for only those limited purposes. Thus, we conclude that once a road has been declared to be public, all uses that are permissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>to the public under the laws of this state are permissible uses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVc\">(Emphasis original). In <em>Boykin v. Carbon Co. Bd. Of </em>Comm\u2019rs, 124 P.3d 677 (Wyo. 2005), the Wyoming Supreme Court adopted the same rule, and held that the restrictive use principle applicable between private parties did not apply to claims for the establishment of public highway right-of-ways. The court adopted the district court\u2019s reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">The use of a public highway right-of-way cannot be limited to historical uses as may be the case for private claimants of particular prescriptive easements. To rule otherwise would take us down a road we should fear to travel.... The use of the road may well increase in the future, and the method of such increased use cannot be foreseen. Such is the nature of a public highway right-of-way. To rule otherwise would defeat the very nature of a public road system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\"><em>Boykin, </em>124 P.3d at 686-87 (citing <em>Heath v.

Co. of Bannock, </em>656 P.2d 1383 (Idaho 1983), the Idaho Supreme Court found that the general rule that prescriptive easements are limited to the actual use which gave rise to the easement applies to private, not public, prescriptive easements. The Court recognized that \u201c[i]n more contemporary decisions, other jurisdictions have held the scope of such [public prescriptive] easements comprehensive enough to include reasonably foreseeable public uses of such roadways ... <em>.\u2019\u2019Bentel, </em>656 P.2d at 1386. The court held that a highway easement acquired by prescription was no less comprehensive than one acquired by grant, dedication or condemnation. <em>Bentel, </em>656 P.2d at 1386. <em>See also Pickett v.

In <em>Kipp v. Davis-Daly Copper Co., </em>41 Mont. 509, 516, 518, 110 P. 237, 240 (1910), the Court recognized that highways may be used \u201cin any manner or for any purpose which is reasonably incidental] to the appropriation of them to public travel\u201d and \u201cfor all uses to which [they] might reasonably be put in view of improved methods and the increasing needs of the public....\u201d We explained that \u201ca highway is created for the use of the public, not only in view of its necessities and requirements as they exist, but also in view of the constantly changing modes and conditions of travel and transportation ... <em>\u201dKipp, </em>41 Mont. at 517, 110 P. at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u00b650 In <em>Bolinger, </em>we observed the following regarding a public prescriptive easement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">[T]he easement is not limited to the particular methods of use in vogue when the easement was acquired, but includes all new and improved methods, the utility and general convenience of which may afterwards be discovered and developed in aid of the general purpose for which highways are designed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">Where land is conveyed for a public highway the implication must be that it will be used as the convenience and welfare of the public may demand, although that demand may be augmented by the increase of population.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">[T]he dedicator is presumed to have intended the property to be used in such a way by the public as will be most convenient and comfortable and according to not only the properties and usages known at the time of dedication, but also to those justified by lapse of time and change of conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-9\"><em>Bolinger, </em>158 Mont. at 514, 520-21, 493 P.2d at 1065-66, 1069 (quoting <em>Cater v.

Eldridge, </em>278 P. 236, 238 (Cal. 1929)).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">\u00b651  When a public roadway is acquired through prescriptive use instead of a grant or dedication, the same issue pertaining to usage arises: Should public use of that easement be limited to the usage that existed at the time the easement was established, or, rather, should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>usage accommodate the passage of time and the public\u2019s ongoing needs? Just as the Court has determined that the uses of a dedicated public highway change over time, so do the uses of a public roadway acquired by prescription. Pursuant to the above discussion, we determine the scope of a public road right-of-way established by prescriptive use is not strictly limited to the adverse usage through which the easement was acquired, as it is in the case of private prescriptive easements. The scope includes public uses that are reasonably incident to the uses through which the easement was acquired and uses that are reasonably foreseeable. Hence, once a public prescriptive road is established, the fact that a certain public use was not adverse does not mean that the use is not permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b652  In the case before us, the District Court determined that the public could not travel on the land between the fences at Seyler Bridge and the high water mark of the Ruby River. The use of the Seyler Lane right-of-way as access to the Ruby River is not dependent upon whether this use was established adversely during the prescriptive period. Foot travel over a roadway is, and has always been, a foreseeable use of the road surface as well as any shoulders, embankments and abutments supporting the roadway. Separate from the question of width, use of the road for access to the Ruby River is a reasonably foreseeable use of a public road right-of-way that crosses a river.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b653 <em>Issue Four: Did the District Court err by rejecting certificates of survey (COS) as evidence of the width of the existing public right-of-way at the intersection of Seyler Lane and the Ruby River?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b654 PLAA maintains that the District Court erred by disregarding the COS presented by PLAA at trial and incorrectly concluded such surveys, as a matter of law, could not establish the existence of a prescriptive easement. The District Court did not determine that the certificates were inadmissible, nor did the court conclude that COS can never prove the existence of an easement. Rather, the court found that the specific surveys PLAA presented did not provide information on the dimensions of the Seyler Lane right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\u00b655 Because we are remanding for the District Court to determine the width of the public road right-of-way and instructing the court to conduct whatever additional fact-finding it deems appropriate, it is not necessary for us to further address this issue at this time.

In its 2008 order, the District Court determined that the public could use the 60-foot-wide right-of-way at Lewis Lane and Lewis Bridge to reach the Ruby River. Kennedy maintains that the court erred for two reasons. First, he argues that the Lewis Lane right-of-way was never intended to be used for access to the Ruby River for fishing, hunting, wading, and boating. Second, Kennedy asserts that the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the public may access the Ruby River where Lewis Lane crosses the Ruby River constitutes an unconstitutional taking of his property because he owns the riverbed underlying the public right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\">\u00b658  We reject Kennedy\u2019s contentions. The District Court did not err, or effectuate a taking, when it ruled the public may access the Ruby River via the right-of-way the County purchased in the Lewis Lane deed. Kennedy\u2019s predecessor in interest expressly granted a public right-of-way without limiting its uses. Further, it is well-settled in Montana that the public may use the beds of non-navigable rivers for recreation without effectuating a taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b659 We agree with the District Court that Kennedy\u2019s contention that the 60-foot-wide right-of-way his predecessor in interest granted cannot be used for river access must fail.

The deed expressly stated that the land was to be used as a \u201cpublic highway\u201d and if it should be abandoned from that use, would revert to the grantor and his heirs and assigns. Thus, the deed\u2019s express terms dedicated the right-of-way for public use. It did not restrict the public from any use on that stretch of the road. Since this grant created a public right-of-way, we presume that Kennedy\u2019s predecessor intended to provide for not only those public uses known at the time, but those justified by lapse of time and change of conditions. These include convenient and comfortable public uses, including access to the Ruby River. We therefore agree with the District Court that the public may use this right-of-way to access and enter the river. We also agree with the District Court\u2019s reasoning that \u201cwhere a county road intersects state waters, the portion of each which is congruent with the other creates two over lapping public rights of way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u00b661 Kennedy\u2019s takings argument is unpersuasive because Kennedy has no compensable property interest in the property he claims has been taken from him. Kennedy contends that, as owner of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>streambed underlying the non-navigable Ruby River, he has the right to control access to the waters above, including the right to exclude persons from wading into the river or floating on the water. He maintains that declaring a public easement between the high water marks of the Ruby River at Lewis Lane amounts to an unconstitutional taking of his private property without due process and just compensation. In making this claim, Kennedy argues our Stream Access Law is unconstitutional and challenges our decisions in <em>Mont. Coalition for Stream Access v. Curran, </em>210 Mont. 38, 682 P.2d 163 (1984), and <em>Mont. Coalition for Stream Access v. Hildreth, </em>211 Mont. 29, 684 P.2d 1088 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\">\u00b662 Kennedy\u2019s argument fails for two reasons. First, when Kennedy\u2019s predecessor in interest deeded Lewis Lane road to the County, he also granted the swath of riverbed underlying the bridge and within the right-of-way to the public. Kennedy\u2019s predecessor did not exclude the land underlying the bridge from the deed conveying the right-of-way. The public retains the right to use this bought-and-paid-for right-of-way. Kennedy has no right to complain that the public is using the right-of-way the County purchased from Kennedy\u2019s predecessor. Yet, even ifKennedy\u2019s predecessor had not expressly granted a right-of-way to the County for use by the public, it is settled law in Montana that the public may use the beds of non-navigable rivers, up to the high watermark, for recreation. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 23-2-301 to 21-2-322, MCA; <em>Curran, </em>210 Mont, at 53, 682 P.2d at 171; <em>Hildreth, </em>211 Mont, at 35-36, 684 P.2d at 1091; <em>Galt v. State, </em>225 Mont. 142, 148, 731 P.2d 912, 916 (1987). Our precedent makes manifestly clear that this public use does not constitute a compensable taking of private property: N o title passes with the use right.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u00b663 In Montana, waters within the state are State property held in trust for the people. Mont. Const, art. IX, \u00a7 3(3). Kennedy\u2019s reliance on <em>Ill. C. R. Co. v. Ill., </em>146 U.S. 387, 13 S. Ct. 110 (1892) (henceforth, <em>\u201cIllinois Central\u201d), U.S. v.

Ct. 383 (1979), to assert he may control use of the water overlying the section of riverbed he owns, is misplaced. We have already explained that our Constitution, statutes and precedent preclude a riparian landowner from excluding public use of a streambed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b664 Kennedy misconstrues <em>Illinois Central </em>to assert that his ownership of the streambed also gives him ownership of the water. The dicta from <em>Illinois Central, </em>to which Kennedy cites, operate to illustrate the difference between the State\u2019s \u201cownership\u201d of submerged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>lands and the State\u2019s ownership of public lands it could sell. <em>Illinois Central, </em>146 U.S. at 452, 13 S. Ct. at 118 (\u201c[The State\u2019s] title [to the beds of Lake Michigan] necessarily carries with it control over the waters above them .... But it is a title different in character from that which the State holds in lands intended for sale.\u201d). The key distinction, the U.S. Supreme Court pointed out, was that the State\u2019s ownership of submerged lands \u201cis a title held in trust for the people of the State that they may enjoy the navigation of the waters, carry on commerce over them, and have liberty of fishing therein freed from the obstruction or interference of private parties.\u201d <em>Illinois Central, </em>146 U.S. at 452, 13 S. Ct. at 118. The State could not grant title to submerged lands where \u201cabdication is not consistent with the exercise of that trust which requires the government of the State to preserve <em>such waters for the use of the public.\u201d Illinois Central, </em>146 U.S. at 452, 13 S. Ct. at 118 (emphasis added). Even upon transfer, the State\u2019s control for purposes of the trust can never be lost. <em>Illinois Central, </em>146 U.S. at 453, 13 S. Ct. at 118. The U.S. Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\">The State can no more abdicate its trust over property in which the whole people are interested, like navigable waters and soils under them, so as to leave them entirely under the use and control of private parties, except in the instance of parcels mentioned for the improvement of the navigation and use of the waters, or when parcels can be disposed of without impairment of the public interest in what remains, than it can abdicate its police powers in the administration of government and the preservation of the peace.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-5\"><em>Illinois Central, </em>146 U.S. at 453, 13 S. Ct. at 118. In fact, <em>Illinois Central </em>illustrates the principle that the State must protect the public\u2019s opportunity to use and enjoy the waters it holds in trust for the people \u201cfreed from the obstruction or interference of private parties.\u201d <em>Illinois Central, </em>146 U.S. at 452, 13 S.

IX, 3(3); \u00a7\u00a7 23-2-301 to 21-2-322, MCA. Article IX, \u00a7 3(3) of the Montand Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaNd\">All surface, underground, flood, and atmospheric waters within the boundaries of the state are the property of the state for the use of its people and are subject to appropriation for beneficial uses as provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The State does not only own navigable waters as a public trust; it also owns non-navigable waters. <em>Galt, </em>225 Mont, at 147, 731 P.2d at 915; <em>see </em>Mont.

In <em>Curran, </em>codified at \u00a7 23-2-302, MCA, we held that \u201cany surface waters that are capable of recreational use may be so used by the public without regard to streambed ownership or navigability for nonrecreational purposes.\u201d <em>Curran, </em>210 Mont, at 53, 682 P.2d at 171. We reaffirmed <em>Curran\u2019s </em>holding that any waters capable of recreational use could be so used in <em>Hildreth. Hildreth, </em>211 Mont, at 35, 684 P.2d at 1091. There, we observed that, because the Montana Constitution provides the State owns the waters for the benefit of its people, and places no limit on their use, \u201cthis Court cannot limit their use by inventing some restrictive test.\u201d <em>Hildreth, </em>211 Mont, at 35,684 P.2d at 1091. The public has a broad use right to surface waters and private landowners may not place obstacles that impede the public\u2019s exercise of its right. <em>Curran, </em>210 Mont, at 52-53, 682 P.2d at 170-71. This use right is not a property right, or an interest in the landowners\u2019 property. <em>See </em>\u00a7 23-2-309, MCA. Rather, it amounts to a recognition of the physical reality that in order for the public to recreationally use its water resource, some \u201cminimal\u201d contact with the banks and beds of rivers is generally necessary. <em>See Galt, </em>225 Mont, at 147, 731 P.2d at 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b667 Because the Montana Constitution grants the State ownership of all waters within its borders, Kennedy\u2019s reliance on <em>Causby, </em>328 U.S. at 259, 66 S. Ct 1064-65, to assert he may control use of the Ruby River\u2019s waters is also misplaced. <em>Causby </em>involved use of airspace over a chicken farm that interfered with the farmers\u2019 business. <em>See Causby, </em>328 U.S. at 259, 66 S. Ct. at 1064-65. To hold that a riparian owner \u201cowns\u201d the \u201cspace\u201d overlying a riverbed, when that space is occupied by water, would be to divest the State of title to waters it owns by virtue of article IX, \u00a7 3(3), of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b668 Similarly, the State\u2019s constitutionally-granted public trust ownership of all waters in Montana distinguishes this case from <em>Kaiser Aetna. </em>That case concerned a \u201cfishpond\u201d on private property in Hawaii, where owners had dredged a channel to connect the pond to the ocean. <em>Kaiser Aetna, </em>444 U.S. at 166-68,100 S. Ct. at 386-87. Significantly to the majority opinion, Hawaiian fishponds like the one at issue had always been considered private property in Hawaii. <em>Kaiser Aetna, </em>444 U.S. at 166, 179, 100 S. Ct. at 386, 392-93. <em>Kaiser Aetna\u2019s </em>recognition that a fishpond could constitute private property hinged on State law. Here, Montana\u2019s Constitution grants the State ownership of waters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>within the state. Mont. Const, art. IX, \u00a7 3(3). Thus, <em>Kaiser Aetna-scnd </em>Hawaiian law-cannot support the proposition that a Montana riparian owner owns the water overlying the bed of a non-navigable river.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\">\u00b669 It is settled law in Montana that public recreational use of State-owned waters is not a taking because title to non-navigable riverbeds does not pass to the public. As we stated in <em>State ex rel. Perry v. District Court, \u201c </em>\u2018[decisions construing the Constitution should be followed, in the absence of cogent reasons to the contrary ... .\u2019 \u201d 145 Mont. 287, 310, 400 P.2d 648, 660 (1965) (quoting <em>State ex. rel. Kain v. Fischl, </em>94 Mont. 92, 20 P.2d 1057 (1933)). Some insignificant use of the riverbeds and river banks is, and always has been, necessary to the public\u2019s use and enjoyment of its resource. That use does not amount to an easement or any other \u201cinterest\u201d in land. <em>See </em>\u00a7 23-2-309, MCA. In <em>Curran </em>we explained that since \u201cthe question of title to the bed is irrelevant to determination of navigability for use, and Curran has no claim to the waters,\u201d no taking of private property could occur. <em>Curran, </em>210 Mont, at 53, 682 P.2d at 171. We also observed in <em>Hildreth, </em>where Hildreth brought a similar claim, that no taking of private property occurs in public use of beds and banks of waters up to the high water mark because title does not pass with the use right. <em>Hildreth, </em>211 Mont, at 36-37, 684 P.2d at 1092. As observed by the United States District Court in <em>Madison v. Graham, </em>no private property right is \u201cbeing extracted\u201d from Kennedy: \u201cIn fact, the public has no interest at all in the private streambed <em>per se, </em>but only in the publicly-owned surface waters that traverse the streambed.\u201d <em>Madison v. Graham, </em>126 F. Supp. 2d 1320, 1324 (D. Mont. 2001). We can see no reason to overturn these longstanding interpretations of our Constitution and our laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b670  The terms of the deed granting the public right-of-way, along with the Montana Constitution, the public trust doctrine and this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Curran, Hildreth </em>and <em>Galt, </em>foreclose Kennedy\u2019s argument. Kennedy\u2019s predecessor in interest granted a right-of-way encompassing parts of the Ruby River\u2019s bed to the County, and the public may use that right-of-way to access the Ruby River. Kennedy never owned a property right that allowed him to exclude the public from using its water resource, including the riverbed and banks up to the high water mark. Nothing has been taken from him. Kennedy has offered no convincing reason to disrupt what has long been settled constitutional law in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"A0u\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\">\u00b671  We conclude that the District Court erred by finding a secondary easement that is independent and separate from the public\u2019s easement. The areas that are reasonably necessary to support and maintain Seyler Bridge, and to ensure the public\u2019s safe and convenient use of it, are included in the Seyler Lane public road right-of-way. We therefore remand for the District Court to consider the evidence in the record and conduct whatever additional proceedings it deems necessary to establish a definite width of the public right-of-way, applying the principles stated in this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b672  We further determine that the scope of use of the public road right-of-way is not limited to the adverse usage through which it was acquired and that any foreseeable uses of a public road right-of-way, including recreational use, are permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u00b673 Finally, Kennedy\u2019s takings argument does not hold water: He presents no persuasive argument that a compensable property interest has been taken from him or that we should overturn our precedent and disrupt long-settled constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u00b674 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b327-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER, DISTRICT JUDGE KRUEGER, sitting for former JUSTICE MORRIS and DISTRICT JUDGE MENAHAN, sitting for CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b306-7\"> The Montana Stockgrowers Association and Hamilton Ranches also intervened as defendants, but have since stipulated to being dismissed from the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b321-5\"> It should be noted that in Montana there is a rebuttable presumption that the owner of land bounded by a road or street takes title to the middle of the road, unless a different intent appears from the deed. <em>McPherson v.

The primary issue on appeal is, having been acquired by prescriptive use, how wide is the public road where the bridge crosses the river? I agree with the Court\u2019s decision to remand this issue for further development in the District Court. I also concur with the Court\u2019s disposition of Kennedy\u2019s cross-appeal. I write separately to address the principal misconception of law on which I believe the Dissent falters.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">\u00b676 The Court correctly notes our long-standing requirement, grounded in \u00a7 70-17-106, MCA, that the width of a roadway acquired by prescription is determined \u201cby the character and extent of its use[.]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Opinion, \u00b6 28. In that regard, the law requires proof by clear and convincing evidence of \u201copen, notorious, exclusive, adverse, continuous, and uninterrupted use over the five-year statutory period.\u201d <em>Brown &amp; Brown of MT, Inc., </em>\u00b6 19. <em>See also Swandal Ranch Co., </em>276 Mont. at 233, 915 P.2d at 843.

The Court also observes two additional statutes that inform the determination of the Seyler Bridge\u2019s width: \u00a7 7-14-2107(3), MCA (when county road established, public acquires right-of-way \u201cand the incidents necessary to enjoying and maintaining it\u201d), and \u00a7 60-1-103(2), MCA (bridge includes, among other things, \u201cthe approaches to the bridge [and] lands used in connection with the bridge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\u00b677 With due respect, Justice McKinnon\u2019s Dissent is wrong in suggesting that the out-of-state authority cited by the Court does not support this holding. Dissent, \u00b6 101. The cited case law uniformly makes clear that the width of a prescriptive public road \u201cnecessarily includes\u201d <em>both </em>the \u201ctraveled surface area of the roadway\u201d <em>and </em>the \u201cadjacent land which is needed for the prescription to be maintained as a public road[.]\u201d <em>Keidel, </em>290 N.W.2d at 258. For similar reasons, her Dissent mischaracterizes the Court\u2019s decision as \u201cexpanding]\u201d the public\u2019s right of way. Dissent, \u00b6 106. The Court\u2019s conclusion is simply that the width of Seyler Road at the Seyler Bridge \u201cis determined by the terms of the grant or the nature of the enjoyment by which [the roadway] was acquired.\u201d Section 70-17-106, MCA. The language of the statutes-\u00a7\u00a7 60-1-103(2) and 7-14-2107(3), MCA-incorporates the principles reflected in the case law that \u201cthe width of a prescriptive road must be determined by actual use over the prescriptive period and may include shoulders and ditches needed to support and maintain the traveled portion of the road.\u201d <em>Reichman, </em>812 N.W.2d at 344. That the prescriptive right does not allow the public \u201c \u2018to lay out and construct an extended and enlarged highway\u2019 \u201d (Dissent, \u00b6 102 (quoting <em>Campbell, </em>137 So. at 112)) is precisely why a definite width of the public road right-of-way must be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\u00b678 Justice McKinnon\u2019s focus on the law of prescriptive easements begins with the proposition that a county road may not be acquired by prescriptive use, but must be formally accepted by the board of county commissioners. Dissent, \u00b6 87. Her Dissent maintains that the laws regarding public highways should not inform the Court\u2019s rulings in this case because the statutes do not apply to prescriptive easements. Dissent, \u00b6 95.1 believe these characterizations of the law to be in error, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>an error that leads the Dissenting Justices astray in their ultimate conclusion that the law governing primary and secondary easements controls the analysis in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\">\u00b679 We have recognized that <em>\u201ca </em>public easement is not the equivalent of a county road. An easement is a nonpossessory interest in land.\u201d <em>Pedersen v. Dawson Co., </em>2000 MT 339, \u00b6 23, 303 Mont. 158, 17 P.3d 393 (citing <em>Kuhlman v. Rivera, </em>216 Mont. 353, 358, 701 P.2d 982, 985 (1985)). With one brief interval,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it has long been the law in Montana that a public road may be established by prescriptive use. <em>See State v. Nolan, </em>58 Mont. 167, 172, 191 P. 150, 152 (1920). Section 2600 of the 1895 Political Code provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\">All highways, roads, streets, alleys, courts, places, and bridges, laid out or erected by the public, or now traveled or used by the public, or if laid out or erected by others, dedicated or abandoned to the public, or made such by the partition of real property, are public highways.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">(later modified and renumbered as \u00a7 1612, R.C.M.

In its place, the new Highway Code defined \u201cpublic highways,\u201d a definition that remains today:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">\u201cPublic highways\u201d means all streets, roads, highways, bridges, and related structures:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">(a) built and maintained with appropriated funds of the United States or the state or any political subdivision of the state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">(b) dedicated to public use;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">(c) acquired by eminent domain,... ; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-10\">(d) acquired by adverse use by the public, with jurisdiction having been assumed by the state or any political subdivision of the state.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">Section 60-1-103(22), MCA. Although not all public highways are county roads, all county roads are public highways. <em>See </em>\u00a7 60-1-201(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>MCA (classification of public highways).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\u00b680 As the Court observes, we have held that a county road may be declared based upon prescriptive use. <em>E.g., Swandal Ranch Co., </em>276 Mont. at 233, 915 P.2d at 843. No party to this case contests that point. \u201cThe law, doubtless, is that a highway may be established by prescription as well as by proceedings taken in conformity with legislative authority!.]\u201d <em>State v. Auchard, </em>22 Mont. 14, 15-16, 55 P. 361, 362 (1898). The Dissent\u2019s contrary suggestion notwithstanding (Dissent, \u00b6 90), this Court in <em>Swandal Ranch Co. </em>expressly affirmed a district court judgment that \u201cdeclared a Park County road\u201d by prescriptive use. <em>Swandal Ranch Co., </em>276 Mont. at 232, 236, 915 P.2d at 842, 844. Distinct from an easement, there is a public possessory interest in a roadway acquired by adverse use. Justice McKinnon largely focuses on a matter that is not at issue in this case: <em>whether </em>Seyler Lane is a county road acquired by prescriptive use.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u00b681 Though not directly an issue here, the discussion is not academic and merits response. Because of Seyler Lane\u2019s nature as a public roadway, the Court concludes that principles of primary and secondary easements do not control the determination of its width at Seyler Bridge. Rather, the width must be determined based on evidence of the \u201clands used in connection with the bridge\u201d (\u00a7 60-1-103(2), MCA), \u201cthe incidents necessary to enjoying and maintaining it\u201d (\u00a7 7-14-2107(3), MCA), and historical evidence of the \u201cnature of the enjoyment by which it was acquired\u201d (\u00a7 70-17-106, MCA). Opinion, \u00b6 38. In contrast, the Dissenting Justices would hold that Madison County has a right to lands beyond the reach of the general public, but only for the singular purpose of maintenance of the road and bridge. Dissents, \u00b6\u00b6 106,126. The distinction is important, and the Court\u2019s construction correct, because once the width of the public road is established, the county does not have infinite rights to chip away at the landowner\u2019s property boundary to meet its maintenance needs. As the Minnesota Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Barfnecht v. Town Bd. of Hollywood Township, </em>232 N.W.2d 420, 424 (Minn. 1975), the government may accomplish its future needs for \u201cupgrading, widening, or improving public ways\u201d acquired by prescription through the process of eminent domain. The Colorado case cited by the Court includes a similar analysis. There, the court agreed that if the width of a public road established by prescriptive use \u201cis to be expanded or the location changed, acquisition of additional land must be established by eminent domain or otherwise.\u201d <em>Lovvorn, </em>701 P.2d at 144. Finally, in my view, the analysis suggested by Justice Rice will apply to roads and bridges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>subject to a public prescriptive easement, but not to cases such as this one, where there is no dispute that the right of way at issue is a public road.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\">\u00b682 By recognizing the legal effect of the District Court\u2019s finding that Seyler Lane is a county road right-of-way that was established by prescriptive use, the Court avoids confusion between possessory and non-possessory interests and protects landowners from future encroachments outside the boundaries ofthe public right-of-way under the auspices of a secondary easement, once width is established. How those principles affect the ultimate outcome in this case, and whether the public has a right to access the Ruby River from Seyler Bridge, are not decided today but must await the development of further evidence in the District Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-11\"> It bears noting that Madison County was a party to the stipulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b329-12\"> Section 2603 of the Political Code of Montana, enacted in 1895, provided that use alone was insufficient to establish a public highway, \u201cuntil so declared by the board of commissioners or by dedication by the owner of the land affected.\u201d The statute was amended in 1913 to delete the prohibition against creating a public highway by use alone. <em>See Richter v.

Width and Use of Public Right-of-Way at Seyler Lane and Seyler Bridge</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u00b684 At the outset, I believe the parties\u2019 formulation of certain stipulated \u201cfacts\u201d has hindered our ability to render a legally sound decision in this case. The Pretrial Order, which was signed by the trial judge and counsel for each party, lists numerous facts that \u201care admitted, agreed to be true, and require no proof.\u201d The confusion arises from the parties\u2019 stipulation that \u201cSeyler Bridge and its approaches on Seyler Lane is a county road right-of-way that was established by prescriptive use.\u201d Elsewhere in the Agreed Facts, the parties appear to have stipulated that Seyler Lane is a \u201cpublic highway,\u201d as defined by \u00a7 60-1- 103(22)(d), MCA-meaning that Seyler Lane was \u201cacquired by adverse use by the public, with jurisdiction having been assumed by [Madison County].\u201d The question arises, therefore, as to the significance of the parties\u2019 separate characterization of Seyler Lane as \u201ca county road right-of-way that was established by prescriptive use.\u201d For the reasons which follow, I believe this characterization is inaccurate and that the Court errs by incorporating it into the analysis of Seyler Lane\u2019s width.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">A. \u201cCounty Roads\u201d are not Established by Prescriptive Use</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">\u00b685 \u201cPublic highways\u201d are classified as (a) federal-aid highways, (b) state highways, (c) county roads, and (d) city streets.

Simply calling something a \u201ccounty road\u201d in the course of litigation-as the parties appear to have done here-does not make it one. \u201cImplicit in all of Title 7, Chapter 14 as well as our prior decisions is that county roads cannot be created without the county\u2019s intent, <em>expressed through its </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>board of commissioners, </em>to do so.\u201d <em>Pedersen v.

A county\u2019s intent to establish a county road must be expressed <em>through its board of commissioners. Pedersen, </em>\u00b6 20. Likewise, the fact that Madison County \u201chas assumed jurisdiction of Seyler Bridge,\u201d Concurrence, \u00b6 79 n. 3, does not transform Seyler Lane into a county road. In fact, Madison County asserted in the District Court that its right to maintain Seyler Lane and Seyler Bridge arose from a prescriptive easement separate from the general public\u2019s prescriptive easement to travel on the roadway. In its post-trial Proposed Conclusions of Law, Madison County proposed that <em>\u201cMadison County and the public </em>have gained a prescriptive easement to travel on the paved portion of Seyler Lane,\u201d but that <em>\u201cMadison County </em>has gained a prescriptive easement to repair, replace and maintain the paved portion of Seyler Lane\u201d and that <em>\u201cMadison County </em>has also gained a prescriptive easement to maintain areas beyond the travelled surface and adjacent subsurface\u201d (emphases added). These separate prescriptive easements for maintenance would have been unnecessary if the County believed-as the Court and the Concurrence mistakenly suggest-that Seyler Lane is a county road governed by county road statutes. <em>See </em>\u00a7 7-14-2107, MCA (when the county commissioners acquire property for county roads, the public gains \u201cthe right-of-way <em>and the incidents necessary to enjoying and maintaining it\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). Significantly, Madison County did not cite this statute in its Proposed Conclusions of Law as authority to maintain Seyler Lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u00b689 A reference to \u201ccounty road\u201d requires application of statutory provisions, while a reference to \u201cprescription\u201d invokes a century of common law jurisprudence governing the creation, width, and scope of prescriptive easements. The parties\u2019 reference to \u201ca county road right-of-way,\u201d while simultaneously stating that it was \u201cestablished by prescriptive use,\u201d is legally inconsistent and thus hinders our ability to provide a sound decision. The Court\u2019s failure to properly address this distinction will not only provide confusing precedent, but will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ultimately prove difficult for the District Court to apply on remand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0v\">\u00b690 The Concurrence asserts \u201cwe have held that a county road may be declared based upon prescriptive use,\u201d citing <em>Swandal Ranch Co. v. Hunt, </em>276 Mont. 229, 233, 915 P.2d 840, 843 (1996), in support of this assertion. Concurrence, \u00b6 80. In <em>Swandal Ranch, </em>we specifically noted that we were not considering the creation of a county road through statutory procedures, but were instead addressing Park County\u2019s claim that it \u201chad established a <em>public easement </em>through prescriptive use\u201d over Wallrock Road. 276 Mont. at 231, 234, 915 P.2d at 842, 843 (emphasis added). As the Concurrence recognizes, \u201c \u2018a public easement is not the equivalent of a county road.\u2019 \u201d Concurrence, \u00b6 79 (quoting <em>Pedersen, </em>\u00b6 23). Although we referred to Wallrock Road at times as a \u201ccounty road,\u201d we did so primarily in the context of acknowledging that the Park County Commissioners\u2019 attempt to declare a county road in October 1950 had been \u201clegally inadequate [under] ... the statutory process.\u201d <em>Swandal Ranch, </em>276 Mont, at 233-34, 915 P.2d at 843. The specific issue addressed in our opinion was \u201cwhether use of the road was permissive or adverse.\u201d <em>See Swandal Ranch, </em>276 Mont, at 232-36, 915 P.2d at 843-45. Contrary to the Concurrence\u2019s suggestion, there is no indication that we considered whether prescriptive use could establish a \u201ccounty road,\u201d as distinguished from a \u201cpublic easement,\u201d under the statutes governing the creation of county roads. Moreover, such a holding would have been inconsistent with the fact that \u201ccounty roads cannot be created without the county\u2019s intent, expressed through its board of commissioners, to do so.\u201d <em>Pedersen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>B. \u201cCounty Road\u201d Statutes are Inapplicable</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\">\u00b691 In spite of the parties\u2019 imprecision in referring to Seyler Lane as <em>\u201ca </em>county road right-of-way that was established by prescriptive use,\u201d the Court and the Concurrence nevertheless treat Seyler Lane as though it is a county road whose width is determined by certain statutes. Citing \u00a7\u00a7 7-14-2107(3) and 60-1-103(2), MCA, the Court observes that \u201c[t]he width of a county road or bridge acquired by prescription must be sufficient to encompass the incidents necessary to enjoying, supporting and maintaining the roadway.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 30; <em>see also </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 29, 38. The Concurrence also contends that these two statutes \u201cinform the determination of the Seyler Bridge\u2019s width.\u201d Concurrence, \u00b6 76.1 believe this approach is mistaken for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b692 As an initial matter, there is no indication in the record that the parties believed the <em>width </em>of the public right-of-way over Seyler Lane and Seyler Bridge should be determined by the Title 7 and Title 60 statutes on which the Court and the Concurrence rely. That approach is of the Court\u2019s and the Concurrence\u2019s own devising. As far back as the July 2008 hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment, and in more recent District Court filings such as the Pretrial Order, the parties referred to Seyler Lane indiscriminately as a \u201cpublic highway by prescription,\u201d a \u201cpublic prescriptive road,\u201d a \u201cpublic prescriptive right-of-way,\u201d and a \u201ccounty road.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The parties did not attribute the same meaning to the term \u201ccounty road\u201d as the Court and the Concurrence have. Instead, PLAA and Kennedy correctly recognized that the right-of-way\u2019s <em>width </em>is governed by common law principles (which I discuss in the next section below).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u00b693 Second, the Court and the Concurrence fail to cite any statutory basis for applying Title 7 and Title 60 statutes to determine the width of a public road established by prescription. Significantly, \u00a7 70-17-106, MCA, contradicts this approach. It states that \u201c[t]he extent of a servitude is determined by [1] the terms of the grant or [2] the nature of the enjoyment by which it was acquired.\u201d Section 70-17-106, MCA. \u201c[T]he terms of the grant\u201d applies in the case of an express easement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>while \u201cthe nature of the enjoyment by which it was acquired\u201d applies in the case of a prescriptive easement. Nothing in this statute indicates that the width of a prescriptive public road is determined by Title 7 or Title 60 statutes. Rather, consistent with common law principles, \u00a7 70-17-106, MCA, recognizes that prescriptive easements are determined by <em>use.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\">\u00b694 Third, the Court\u2019s approach is also contrary to precedent. In <em>State v. Portmann, </em>149 Mont. 91, 423 P.2d 56 (1967), we specifically addressed whether a statute providing that \u201c[t]he width of all public highways ... must be sixty feet\u201d (now codified, as amended, at \u00a7 7-14-2112(1), MCA) applied to extend the width of a public road acquired by prescription. We held that applying this statute to determine the width of such a road would be \u201cinconsistent with the general rule that the user determines the nature and the extent of the easement or title acquired.\u201d <em>Portmann, </em>149 Mont, at 94,423 P.2d at 58. We reaffirmed that, to \u201cgive the fullest recognition to the traditional requirements of adverse possession,\u201d the public \u201cmay obtain title by adverse possession of that only which it has occupied during the full statutory period.\u201d <em>Portmann, </em>149 Mont. at 95-96, 423 P.2d at 58 (internal quotation marks omitted). We concluded that the 60-foot-width statute \u201cwas intended by the Legislature to apply only to public roads which were laid out by the official act of the proper public officials and was never intended to apply to prescriptive easements.\u201d <em>Portmann, </em>149 Mont, at 96, 423 P.2d at 58. We further held that \u201cthe rights acquired by adverse use can never exceed the greatest use made of the land for the full prescriptive period.\u201d <em>Portmann, </em>149 Mont, at 96, 423 P.2d at 58. In so doing, we acknowledged authority from other jurisdictions \u2014 namely, <em>State ex rel. Game, Forestation and Parks Commission v. Hull, </em>97 N.W.2d 535 (Neb. 1959) (the width of a highway acquired by prescription is determined as a question of fact by the character and extent of its use and may be more or less than the width of highways established by statute), and <em>Mulch v. Nagle, </em>197 P. 421 (Cal. App. 1st Dist. 1921) (a road established through public use does not fall within the statutory minimum for public roads; the minimum width applies only to roads formally laid out by the proper public authorities).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b695 Like the Title 7 statute addressed in <em>Portmann, </em>the two statutes invoked by the Court here were \u201cnever intended to apply to prescriptive easements.\u201d 149 Mont, at 96, 423 P.2d at 58. Section 60-1-103(2), MCA, concerns \u201cbridge[s] constructed by the department [of transportation]\u201d; it says nothing about prescription. Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>7-14-2107(3), MCA, states that \u201c[b]y taking or accepting interests in real property for county roads, the public acquires only the right-of-way and the incidents necessary to enjoying and maintaining it.\u201d This provision, however, is part of a statute that concerns county roads established through the \u201cpetition\u201d process. <em>See </em>\u00a7 7-14-2107(1), (2), MCA. The statute says nothing about what the public acquires through prescriptive use.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\">\u00b696 The Concurrence nevertheless posits that these statutes incorporate the principles reflected in caselaw. Concurrence, \u00b6 77. While the statutes may appear to be consistent with common law principles, however, the Court and the Concurrence have construed them as authority for expanding the width of a prescriptive right-of-way, in violation of the longstanding rules that \u201cthe user determines the nature and the extent of the easement or title acquired\u201d and \u201cthe public may obtain title by adverse possession of that only which it has occupied during the full statutory period.\u201d <em>Portmann, </em>149 Mont, at 94-95, 423 P.2d at 58 (internal quotation marks omitted). Section 7-14-2107(3), MCA, clearly is intended to <em>limit </em>the interest that the public acquires when a county condemns or contracts for a right-of-way to \u201conly\u201d the right-of-way and the incidents necessary to enjoying and maintaining it. The Court and the Concurrence twist this provision\u2019s meaning by suggesting, first, that it applies to public highways created by prescription and, second, that it <em>expands </em>the width of a prescriptive public right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b697 I am aware of no precedent in this Court\u2019s history-and neither the Court nor the Concurrence cites any-for using \u00a7\u00a7 7-14-2107(3) and 60-1-103(2), MCA, to determine the width of a public road established by prescription. These statutes were not intended for that purpose, and the Court\u2019s approach here is contrary to well-established precedents which hold that the width of a prescriptive public road is determined by actual \u201cuse\u201d and \u201coccupation.\u201d <em>Maynard v. Bara, </em>96 Mont. 302, 307, 30 P.2d 93, 95 (1934); <em>Portmann, </em>149 Mont. at 95-96, 423 P.2d at 58.

In this regard, the parties argue fundamentally different theories as to the legal significance of the stipulated facts. In Kennedy\u2019s view, the right-of-way to which the parties stipulated does not give the public any rights outside the paved portion of Seyler Lane. As such, Kennedy contends that PLAA must establish a separate prescriptive \u201cfootpath\u201d leading from the pavement down to Ruby River; in other words, PLAA must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the public followed a definite, fixed course between the pavement and the water openly, notoriously, adversely, continuously, and uninterruptedly for the full prescriptive period. In PLAA\u2019s view, however, the right-of-way to which the parties stipulated includes not only the paved portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Seyler Lane, but also \u201csufficient land\u201d alongside the pavement for ditches, repairs, and other public uses-such as \u201caccessing the Ruby River.\u201d PLAA states that it \u201cis not seeking to acquire a new prescriptive easement beyond the existing Seyler Lane right-of-way.\u201d Rather, PLAA believes the stipulated right-of-way is wide enough to enable the public to reach the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\">\u00b6100 In my view, PLAA\u2019s theory-and this Court\u2019s tacit adoption of it-is contrary to over a century of precedent governing prescriptive easements. Where the public claims a right-of-way founded on prescriptive use, this Court has been unequivocal that \u201c[t]he occupancy or use by the public of one portion of the road does not avail it in its claim to another portion not occupied by it....

Hidalgo Co., </em>125 S.W.2d 1092, 1094 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 1939). However, contrary to the Court\u2019s discussion (Opinion, \u00b6 25), these cases do not hold that the maintenance and support area may also be used for public travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u00b6102 In fact, the <em>Semmerling </em>court rejected such an argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuQ\">Here, there is... no evidence that the public used the grassy areas on either side of the road for road purposes. To the contrary, the evidence established that public use was limited to the paved portion of the road. The trial court certainly was not required to conclude in the absence of any other evidence that, just because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the Township mowed those areas, the prescriptive easement encompassed those areas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">630 N.E.2d at 501; <em>accord Campbell, </em>137 So. at 112 (\u201cThe prescriptive right carries with it the beaten path and whatever is necessary to make the beaten path a usable highway, but this does not mean that the prescriptive right carries with it the right in the public to lay out and construct an extended and enlarged highway ... .\u201d). By the same reasoning, the fact that Madison County maintains the areas alongside the paved portion of Seyler Lane does not mean that the public\u2019s right of travel extends to those areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b6 103 In <em>Barfnecht, </em>the court considered a statute which provided for the acquisition of highways by adverse public use. It stated that any road used and kept in repair for at least six years as a public highway is deemed dedicated to the public to the width of two rods (33 feet) on each side of the center line thereof. <em>Barfnecht, </em>232 N.W.2d at 422. The plaintiffs argued that recognizing a prescriptive right-of-way greater in width than the area actually used by the public during the period of prescription would amount to an unconstitutional taking of private property. The court, however, construed the statute so as to avoid this result. The court observed that a prescriptive public easement</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">arises from the fact that [adverse public] use serves to give the owner notice that, if he means to dispute the rightfulness of the public use, he must assert his right within a statutory period by physical action or suit. The statute provides a statute of limitations, the running of which estops an owner from denying the existence of a public easement. Public use cannot be said to apply to lands not actually used. There is no reason that an owner should know that he is required to dispute the rightfulness of a nonexistent user. A property owner thus receives no notice as to a public claim on any property in excess of that which has actually been used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-7\"><em>Barfnecht, </em>232 N.W.2d at 423 (footnote and paragraph break omitted). The court held, therefore, that \u201c[p]rivately owned land cannot become public road by adverse use beyond the portion so used merely by a statutory pronouncement to that effect <em>.\u2019\u2019Barfnecht, </em>232 N.W.2d at 423. Likewise, here, Title 7 and Title 60 statutes cannot be used to expand the Seyler Lane right-of-way beyond the width to which the parties stipulated-\u201cthe paved portion\u201d of the road-without implicating an unconstitutional taking of private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">\u00b6 104 As for the other out-of-state cases, <em>Teadtke </em>and <em>Yturria </em>did not involve issues of maintenance and support in relation to an easement\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>width. <em>Nikiel </em>was based on a New York statute which provided that the width of prescriptive public highways is at least three rods (49.5 feet). 165 N.Y.S.2d at 596-97. This is contrary to Montana law, which states that the width of prescriptive public roads is limited to the area actually occupied and used during the statutory- period. <em>Portmann, </em>149 Mont. at 95-96, 423 P.2d at 58. The <em>Platt </em>decision is consistent with this principle; the court there held that \u201cthough the width of a prescriptive easement in a public highway includes shoulders and ditches needed <em>and actually used, </em>it does not include the allowance of a width for shoulders and ditches <em>not used </em>but needed\u201d-the point being that the easement\u2019s width is determined by actual <em>use. </em>198 N.W.2d at 894 (emphases added). Lastly, <em>Keidel </em>distinguished the \u201cactual traveled surface area of the roadway\u201d from the \u201cadjacent land which is needed for the prescription to be maintained as a public road.\u201d 290 N.W.2d at 258; <em>accord McKenzie, </em>\u00b6 31. Neither <em>Keidel </em>nor <em>McKenzie </em>held that the adjacent land may be used as an expanded travel area.</p>\n<p id=\"ALV\">\u00b6105 My disagreement with the Court, therefore, is with the notion that the adjacent land needed to support and maintain a prescriptive public road may be used by the public for other purposes, such as traversing down to a stream. Admittedly, the Court\u2019s Opinion is inconsistent in this regard. On one hand, we are told that \u201c[rlecreational use ... may be considered in determining the width of the public road right-of-way.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 36. The Court thus implicitly allows recreational use to determine the width of a right-of-way beyond that necessary for maintenance. On the other hand, however, we are told that \u201c[a]ny recreational uses by the public beyond the width necessary for the construction, maintenance and repair of the roadway and the bridge would have to be established through clear and convincing evidence for the requisite statutory period.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 38. Contrary to the language in \u00b6 36, the language in \u00b6 38 indicates that any recreational use beyond the width necessary for maintenance will have to be proved as a separate prescriptive easement. How the parties and the District Court are to analyze recreational use on remand is, therefore, ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\">\u00b6 106 Nevertheless, to the extent the Court is permitting recreational use to expand the width of the stipulated right-of-way beyond the paved surface of Seyler Lane, I strongly disagree. The Montana and out-of-state precedents cited above are clear, at least in my view, that the width of a prescriptive public road is defined by the definite, fixed course that the public actually used during the period of prescription. As we stated in <em>Portmann, </em>to \u201cgive the fullest recognition to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>traditional requirements of adverse possession,\u201d the public \u201cmay obtain title by adverse possession of that only which it has occupied during the full statutory period.\u201d 149 Mont, at 95-96, 423 P.2d at 58 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulations, the occupied area consists only of \u201cthe paved portion\u201d of Seyler Lane. Of course, as explained, a prescriptive road includes an incidental right to use adjacent land-such as shoulders, slopes, and ditches-that is reasonably necessary to support and maintain the roadway. Obviously, without such land, the road would become unusable as a public right-of-way. But I am aware of no authority-and neither PLAA nor the Court nor the Concurrence cites any-which holds that the land needed to support and maintain the beaten path may be transformed into part of the beaten path. That is the crux of my disagreement with our Opinion. In my view, the Court is fundamentally mistaken in holding that the land alongside the beaten path may be used for purposes in addition to simple maintenance and support.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\">\u00b6107 My conclusion is supported not only by the aforementioned precedents, but also by various statutes which limit where particular public uses may occur within a single right-of-way. Although a public right-of-way may be wide enough to encompass several uses-such as vehicular travel, pedestrian travel, bicycle travel, and maintenance work-this does not mean that all of these uses may occur everywhere within the right-of-way. The public\u2019s right to use one area for a specific purpose does not give it the right to use that area for an entirely different purpose. Vehicular travel, for example, is confined to the roadway. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-8-321(1), MCA (requiring vehicles to be operated on the right half of the roadway); \u00a7 61-1-101(66), MCA (defining \u201croadway\u201d as \u201cthat portion of a highway improved, designed, or ordinarily used for vehicular travel, exclusive of the berm or shoulder\u201d). Pedestrians are prohibited from walking on the roadway if a sidewalk is available, and are otherwise required to walk \u201con the shoulder, as far as practicable from the edge of the roadway.\u201d Section 61-8-506, MCA. Similar restrictions exist with regard to bicyclists, \u00a7 61-8-605, MCA, and snowmobiles, \u00a7 23-2-631, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u00b6108 The cases the Court cites at \u00b6 24 of the Opinion do not support the conclusion that maintenance work by Madison County employees in the area along the paved portion of Seyler Lane gives the public the right to use that same area for other, nonmaintenance purposes. In <em>McClurg v. Flathead County Commissioners, </em>188 Mont. 20, 24, 610 P.2d 1153, 1156 (1980), <em>Rasmussen v. Fowler, </em>245 Mont. 308, 312, 800 P.2d 1053, 1056 (1990), <em>Swandal </em>Ranch, 276 Mont. at 234-36, 915 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>at 844-45, <em>Hitshew v.

Jones, </em>2004 MT 394, \u00b6 33, 325 Mont. 236, 104 P.3d 496, we held that evidence of maintenance by local authorities supports a finding of adversity. We were concerned in these cases with whether a prescriptive right-of-way had been proved, not with how wide it was. As for <em>Smith v. Russell, </em>2003 MT 326, 318 Mont. 336, 80 P.3d 431, this case did not involve a road established by prescription.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\">\u00b6109 In holding that there is a \u201csingle, unified, public road right-of-way,\u201d any portion of which may be used by the public for travel, Opinion, f \u00b6 32, 52, the Court disregards long and well-established precedent recognizing that the right to use adjacent land for support and maintenance of a prescriptive public road is <em>incidental </em>to the right to travel on that road. While the Court consumes a large portion of today\u2019s Opinion faulting the District Court\u2019s characterization of this right as a \u201csecondary easement,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 18-32, the fact remains that, whatever the right is called, it is <em>incidental </em>to the right of travel on the roadway and it is limited to the purpose for which it exists: maintenance and support. This principle is simply an application of the maxim that \u201c \u2018[w]hen an easement or other property right is created, every right necessary for its enjoyment is included by implication.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mattson v.

The incidental right of maintenance and support is to be exercised only when necessary and in such a manner as not to needlessly increase the burden upon the servient tenement. <em>Laden, </em>112 Mont. at 306, 116 P.2d at 884; <em>Shammel v.

The Court, mistakenly, construes provisions within Title 7 and Title 60 to support this distinction. The law of prescription, however, is governed by this Court\u2019s precedents. <em>See Swandal Ranch, </em>276 Mont. at 233, 915 P.2d at 843 (\u201cThe elements of prescriptive easement have been defined through case law.\u201d). The only distinction our cases have made between public and private prescriptive easements is the element of exclusivity, which is not required to establish a public prescriptive easement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Heller v. Gremaux, </em>2002 MT 199, \u00b6 12, 311 Mont. 178, 53 P.3d 1259. Kennedy does not deny that Madison County may access his property to maintain and support the Seyler Lane right-of-way. At issue here is whether common law principles of prescription permit the width of a prescriptive easement, whether private or public, to be expanded beyond the area that was used and occupied during the prescriptive period, such that the area alongside the original traveled way may also be used for travel. Under our precedents, the clear answer to this question is no. <em>Maynard, </em>96 Mont, at 307, 30 P.2d at 95 (\u201cThe occupancy or use by the public of one portion of the road does not avail it in its claim to another portion not occupied by it.\u201d); <em>Auchard, </em>22 Mont, at 16, 55 P. at 362 (the prescriptive right is \u201cconfined to the very way claimed and traveled during the period\u201d). The out-of-state cases discussed above are in accord. As Kennedy points out, \u201cif the area used for maintenance could be transformed into a new traveled way, then the easement could be expanded forever simply by paving over that area, which would create a right to more maintenance, <em>ad infinitum\u201d </em>Likewise, the District Court observed in its Conclusions of Law that the County\u2019s \u201cright to use maintenance areas cannot be transformed into a new traveled way. The travel easement could be expanded forever simply by paving the areas used for maintenance which could create a right to use yet more land for lateral and subjacent support. Such a result would be impossible to square with <em>Portmann </em>.... It also defies common sense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u00b6111 Public prescriptive easements are founded on the definite, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>fixed course established during the prescriptive period. There is an incidental right to use adjacent land as <em>support </em>for the traveled way, but there is no authority for our holding that the land used for support and maintenance may also be used by the general public as a supplemental area of travel. In my view, we are misapplying statutory provisions and prescriptive easement law in order to facilitate public access to Ruby River. Stream access laws are for the Legislature to consider and design. House Bill 190, passed by the Legislature in 2009, resulted in a new statute that authorizes any person to gain access to surface waters for recreational use by using (a) a public bridge, its right-of-way, and its abutments, and (b) a county road right-of-way. Section 23-2-312(1), MCA. Other legislation permits fencing within the right-of-way for livestock control or property management, as long as the fencing provides for public passage to surface waters. Sections 7-14-2134(4), 23-2-313(1), MCA. Importantly, this legislation expressly excludes a certain category of public roads from its application: those established through prescriptive use. Section 23-2-312(3), MCA. Our disregard of precedent-justified by a distinction artificially drawn, for the first time, today between private and public easements-upsets the balance achieved by the 2009 Legislature between recreationists and landowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\">D. Remand is Unnecessary</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b6112 Lastly, I do not believe it is necessary to remand this case for a determination of the Seyler Lane right-of-way\u2019s width. Pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulation, the prescriptive public road consists of the paved portion of Seyler Lane and Seyler Bridge, which varies between 20 and 24 feet in width. PLAA has failed to establish that the public has a right to travel anywhere off the paved portion of the road and bridge. While the prescriptive road includes an incidental right to use any adjacent land that is reasonably necessary to maintain and support the traveled surface area, the width of that maintenance and support area is not a question presented in this lawsuit. Kennedy does not dispute that Madison County may access his property to maintain and support the roadway, and Kennedy does not claim that Madison County has exceeded this right. Thus, in my view, there is no need to remand for a determination of the width of the incidental right of maintenance and support. What PLAA wants in this lawsuit is to obtain recognition of a right in the general public to travel over the adjacent land to get to the river. PLAA is clear that it is \u201cnot seeking to acquire a new prescriptive easement beyond the existing Seyler Lane right-of-way.\u201d Rather, PLAA contends that the right to access the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>river is encompassed within the right-of-way to which the parties stipulated. PLAA has failed to establish any legal basis for such a right, however. I accordingly would affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment as to Seyler Lane and Seyler Bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\">II. Access at Lewis Lane and Lewis Bridge</p>\n<p id=\"AHN\">\u00b6113 Lewis Lane and Lewis Bridge are also on Kennedy\u2019s land. In 1910, Kennedy\u2019s predecessor dedicated Lewis Lane to Madison County with the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-4\">A strip of land thirty feet wide on each side of the center of the County road, as at present laid out, running across the S.E.1/4 of Section 23, in Township 4 South of Range 6 West M.P.M. It is intended to convey by this deed a right of way sixty feet wide and running entirely through said S.E.1/4 of Section 23, for a County road.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The District Court concluded that the public could use this 60-foot-wide right-of-way to reach Ruby River. The court noted that Lewis Bridge is less than 60 feet wide, which leaves room alongside the bridge for the public to walk down to the river and still be within the physical boundaries of the 60-foot-wide easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\u00b6114 Kennedy contends that the District Court erred. He argues that the 1910 deed does not express any intent to authorize access to the river for public recreation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This presents a question of deed interpretation. In <em>Bolinger v. City of Bozeman, </em>158 Mont. 507, 493 P.2d 1062 (1972), we agreed with the principle that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">[wjhether or not a particular use amounts to a diversion from that for which the dedication was made depends on the circumstances of the dedication and the intention of the party making it. It has been held that such use is authorized as is fairly within the terms of the dedication and reasonably serves to fit the property for enjoyment by the public in the manner contemplated. In other words, the dedicator is presumed to have intended the property to be used in such way by the public as will be most convenient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>and comfortable and according to not only the properties and usages known at the time of the dedication, but also to those justified by lapse of time and change of conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">158 Mont, at 521, 493 P.2d at 1069 (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\u00b6115 Here, Kennedy\u2019s predecessor dedicated Lewis Lane without any explicit qualifications or limitations on the use of the road: \u201cIt is intended to convey by this deed a right of way sixty feet wide and running entirely through said S.E. 1/4 of Section 23, for a County road.\u201d Kennedy nevertheless contends that, during the period when his predecessor made this dedication, the public did not have the right to use nonnavigable streams-such as Ruby River-for recreational purposes. <em>See Herrin v. Sutherland, </em>74 Mont. 587, 596-97, 241 P. 328, 331 (1925). As we stated in <em>Bolinger, </em>however, the dedicator is presumed to have intended the property to be used in such way by the public as will be most convenient and comfortable and <em>according to not only the properties and usages known at the time of the dedication, but also to those justified by lapse of time and change of conditions. </em>158 Mont, at 521, 493 P.2d at 1069. In this regard, the 2009 Legislature clarified that a person may gain access to surface waters for recreational use by using (a) a public bridge, its right-of-way, and its abutments, and (b) a county road right-of-way. Section 23-2-312(1), MCA. The unqualified language of the 1910 deed is consistent with a dedication for such use.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">III. Kennedy\u2019s Takings Argument</p>\n<p id=\"Av7\">\u00b6116 As an alternative to his arguments concerning the public rights-of-way over Seyler Lane and Lewis Lane, Kennedy argues that the District Court\u2019s and this Court\u2019s recognition of the public\u2019s right to engage in recreational use of Ruby River as it flows through his land amounts to an unconstitutional taking of his property. His theory, which is premised on his ownership of the bed of Ruby River, appears to be that if the public has no right to use Ruby River in the first place, then the public has no need to get there by crossing his land alongside Seyler Lane and Lewis Lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">\u00b6 117 In this regard, Kennedy asserts that a landowner has the right to control the space above his land. He cites a number of out-of-state cases for this principle, including <em>Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Illinois, </em>146 U.S. 387, 452, 13 S. Ct. 110, 118 (1892) (title to the lands under the navigable waters of Lake Michigan \u201cnecessarily carries with it control over the waters above them\u201d); <em>U.S. v. Causby, </em>328 U.S. 256, 264, 66 S. Ct. 1062, 1067 (1946) (\u201c[t]he landowner owns at least as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>much of the space above the ground as he can occupy or use in connection with the land\u201d); <em>Kaiser Aetna v. U.S., </em>444 U.S. 164, 100 S. Ct. 383 (1979) (owner of private pond had right to exclude the public from boating on the pond); <em>People v. Emmert, </em>597 P.2d 1025, 1027 (Colo. 1979) (\u201cownership of the bed of a non-navigable stream vests in the owner the exclusive right of control of everything above the stream bed\u201d); and <em>Butler v. Frontier Telephone Co., </em>79 N.E. 716, 718 (N.Y. 1906) (\u201cspace above land is real estate the same as the land itself\u2019). He also cites our 1925 decision in <em>Herrin, </em>where we stated: \u201c[I]t is held uniformly that the public have no right to fish in a nonnavigable body of water, the bed of which is owned privately.\u201d 74 Mont, at 596-97,241 P. at 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b6 118 Kennedy argues that our 1984 decisions in <em>Montana Coalition for Stream Access, Inc. v.

Hildreth, </em>211 Mont. 29, 684 P.2d 1088 (1984), effectively overruled <em>Herrin </em>\u2014 a point that the State of Montana, which has intervened in this appeal, concedes-and thereby divested landowners of a valuable property right, namely, the right to exclude the public from the waters above privately owned streambeds.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <em>Curran, </em>the Court held that a landowner has no right to control the use of the surface waters of a stream flowing through his property to the exclusion of the public, except to the extent of his prior appropriation of part of the water for irrigation purposes. 210 Mont, at 52, 682 P.2d at 170. The Court further held that \u201cany surface waters that are capable of recreational use may be so used by the public without regard to streambed ownership or navigability for nonrecreational purposes.\u201d <em>Curran, </em>210 Mont, at 53, 682 P.2d at 171. The Court supplemented this holding in <em>Hildreth </em>to include \u201cthe bed and banks up to the ordinary high water mark.\u201d 211 Mont, at 35-36, 684 P.2d at 1091. The Legislature codified these holdings in 1985. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 23-2-301(12), -302(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b6119 Citing <em>Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. v. Florida Department of Environmental Protection, </em>560 U.S. 702, 130 S. Ct. 2592 (2010), Kennedy contends that our decisions in <em>Curran </em>and <em>Hildreth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>effected an unconstitutional judicial taking of property without just compensation. <em>Citing Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., </em>458 U.S. 419, 102 S. Ct. 3164 (1982), he contends that the enactment of statutes based on <em>Curran </em>and <em>Hildreth </em>amounted to an unconstitutional legislative taking of property. The State responds that these \u201cclaims\u201d are barred by the statute of limitations. The State cites \u00a7 27-2-207, MCA, which prescribes a limitation on \u201cthe commencement of an action\u201d for injury to property. Yet, Kennedy has not commenced an action for injury to property. He has no cross-claims or counterclaims pending. He asserts no claims for damages due to a taking or inverse condemnation of property. He states that he is asserting his takings argument as a <em>defense </em>to PLAA\u2019s claim that the public has the right to cross his land in order to access and use Ruby River. As we have recognized, \u201cstatutes of limitations ... [are] limitations on actions only and not of defense.\u201d <em>Hagerty v. Hall, </em>135 Mont. 276, 280, 340 P.2d 147, 149 (1959). Thus, I believe the State\u2019s procedural argument is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\">\u00b6120 Nevertheless, the judicial and legislative takings alleged by Kennedy occurred in 1984 and 1985, when the right of landowners to exclude the public from the waters over privately owned streambeds, recognized 59 years earlier in <em>Herrin, </em>was changed by our decisions in <em>Curran </em>and <em>Hildreth </em>and the ensuing statutes enacted by the Legislature. Kennedy did not own the Ruby River streambed in 1984 or 1985, and thus nothing was taken from him. When he purchased his property in 1993, <em>Curran and Hildreth </em>were the law of this State, and he thus acquired no right to exclude the public from using Ruby River during anytime when he has owned his property. Simply acknowledging, in the context of the present lawsuit, the rights held by the public under <em>Curran </em>and <em>Hildreth </em>does not effect any taking of Kennedy\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b6121 \u201c[Significant controversy has existed related to public access to streams and rivers from county road and bridge rights-of-way.\u201d Laws of Montana, 2009, ch. 201, preamble to House Bill 190. In 2007 and 2008, \u201ca group of stakeholders met to address the controversy and agreed in principle that a legislative solution was preferable.\u201d Laws of Montana, 2009, ch. 201, preamble to House Bill 190. That legislative solution took the form of House Bill 190, which the Legislature passed in 2009. Nearly every member of the 2009 Legislature voted in favor of the bill; the final vote was 96 to 3 in the House and 48 to 2 in the Senate. The bill struck a balance, allowing the public to gain access to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>surface waters for recreational use at public bridges and county road rights-of-way, while allowing landowners to run their fences up to the edge of the bridge as long as the fences did not prevent public passage to surface waters. The bill expressly excluded a certain category of public roads from its application: those established by prescriptive use.</p>\n<p id=\"AjQ\">\u00b6122 With today\u2019s decision, this Court nullifies the exclusion of prescriptive easements from the 2009 legislation and alters the balance struck by the Legislature. We do so by ignoring a century of precedent recognizing that the public may obtain a prescriptive easement over only the land which the public adversely possessed-confined to the way actually occupied during the prescriptive period-and that the incidental right of support and maintenance extends to only the adjacent land that is reasonably necessary for these purposes and must be exercised in such a way as not to needlessly increase the burden on the servient estate. The Court effectively grants a public prescriptive easement where the Legislature has determined none should exist. I believe the Court\u2019s decision lacks any support in precedent and embroils this Court in a controversy that we are not properly suited to resolve. I would apply our well-settled principles of prescriptive easements and hold that PLAA has failed to establish a public right of passage from Seyler Lane to Ruby River.</p>\n<p id=\"AO5\">\u00b6123 I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to the contrary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\"> As to Issue Four, the Court is remanding this case for further proceedings on the width of the Seyler Lane right-of-way. As the Court acknowledges, the District Court \u201cfound that the specific surveys PLAA presented did not provide information on the dimensions of the Seyler Lane right-of-way.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 54. The Court then states, however, that PLAA is not precluded \u201cfrom presenting to the [District Court] on remand any COS that provide information regarding the dimensions of the right-of-way.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 55. To the extent the Court is implying here that PLAA\u2019s surveys may somehow be relevant, I believe the District Court has considered this issue already and that the District Court\u2019s evidentiary determinations were appropriate. PLAA has not shown that the District Court abused its discretion when deciding the evidentiary value of the surveys, and I thus would affirm the District Court\u2019s rulings under Issue Four.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\"> Contrary to statements by the Court (Opinion, \u00b6 18) and the Concurrence (Concurrence, \u00b6 75), the District Court did not make a \u201cfinding,\u201d based on evidence, that Seyler Lane is a county road. Because the stipulated facts were \u201cadmitted, agreed to be true, and <em>require no proof\u2019 </em>(emphasis added), those facts were not issues at trial. Indeed, following a review of the trial transcript, it is clear that the parties were focused on other issues in the case. Correspondingly, in their respective Proposed Findings of Fact submitted post-trial, PLAA and Kennedy each distinguished between the \u201cagreed facts\u201d (the ones to which they had stipulated pretrial, as set forth in the Pretrial Order) and the \u201cdetermined facts\u201d (the ones found \u201cbased upon the evidence presented at trial\u201d). The \u201ccounty road\u201d designation was a stipulated fact, not one \u201cfound\u201d by the District Court as the Court and the Concurrence mistakenly identify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b333-11\"> The one exception to this statement is recognition of a legal route by a district court pursuant to \u00a7 7-14-2622, MCA.

The origin of this terminology-which is inconsistent with the provisions just discussed-is not clear. It may have derived from a 2000 opinion of the Montana Attorney General, upon which House Bill 190 (2009) was based. <em>See </em>Laws of Montana, 2009, ch. 201, preamble; Mont. Atty. Gen.

AG LEXIS 6 (May 26, 2000) (providing an opinion on access to Ruby River at three bridge crossings, including Seyler Bridge, and referring to \u201ccounty roads and bridges created by prescription\u201d). The terminology also could have derived from the District Court\u2019s September 30, 2008 order in the present litigation, which refers to the roads at issue, including Seyler Lane, as \u201ccounty roads.\u201d (PLAA states in its opening brief on appeal that the District Court\u2019s 2008 order was \u201cessentially codified\u201d in \u00a7\u00a7 7-14-2134(4), 23-2-312, and 23-2-313, MCA.) Regardless of its origin, however, \u201ccounty road\u201d means a public highway established by a county in accordance with statutory formalities. <em>Pedersen, </em>\u00b6 20; \u00a7\u00a7 7-14-2101, 60-1-103(7), 60-1-201(3), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b336-6\"> It should be noted that \u201chighway\u201d and \u201croad\u201d are not the same as \u201ccounty road.\u201d \u201cHighway\u201d and \u201croad\u201d are \u201cgeneral terms denoting a public way for purposes of vehicular travel and include the entire area within the right-of-way.\u201d Section 60-1-103(19), MCA. \u201cCounty road\u201d means \u201cany public highway opened, established, constructed, maintained, abandoned, or discontinued by a county in accordance with Title 7, chapter 14.\u201d Section 60-1-103(7), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b339-5\"> The statutory period was five years prior to 1893, ten years from 1893 to 1953, and five years since 1953. <em>Yellowstone River, LLC v.

There is no reason why traveling a definite, fixed course over private land in an open, notorious, adverse, continuous, and uninterrupted manner for the full statutory period should not ripen into a prescriptive right-of-way merely because the people who do so are recreationists.

The Court further holds that <em>\u201cthe width </em>of a county road or bridge acquired by prescription must be sufficient to encompass the incidents necessary to enjoying, supporting and maintaining the roadway.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 30 (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>\u00b6 26. I disagree that the width or area of an easement is so determined. The width of a roadway easement obtained by prescription, as the Court notes but does not enforce, is \u201c \u2018determined as a question of fact <em>by the character and extent of its use </em>....\u2019\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 28 (quoting <em>Portmann, </em>149 Mont, at 95,423 P.2d at 58 (emphasis added)). As <em>Portmann </em>further explains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>about public highway prescription cases, \u201c \u2018the public may obtain title by adverse possession of <em>that only which it has occupied </em>during the full statutory period.\u2019 \u201d <em>Portmann, </em>149 Mont, at 95,423 P.2d at 58 (citation omitted) (emphasis added). The precise area of a public prescriptive easement is that which the public <em>used </em>or <em>occupied </em>during the prescriptive period, as determined by the evidence. This is the law of Montana, consistent with the statutory directive that the \u201cextent of a servitude is determined by ... the nature of the enjoyment by which it was acquired.\u201d Section 70-17-106, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\">\u00b6126 Then, \u201c \u2018[w]hen an easement or other property right is created, every right necessary for its enjoyment is included by implication.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mattson v. Mont. Power Co., </em>2009 MT 286, \u00b6 37, 352 Mont. 212, 215 P.3d 675 (citation omitted). As the Court notes, a public road obtained by prescriptive use \u201ccontemplates the general public\u2019s use\u201d of additional area necessary for \u201crepairs and maintenance.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 24. This is so, because in addition to the easement itself, those \u201cnecessary incidents\u201d without which the easement cannot be enjoyed must accompany the easement. \u201cThe right to enter upon the servient tenement for the purpose- of repairing or renewing an artificial structure constituting an easement, is called a \u2018secondary easement,\u2019 a mere incident of the easement that passes by express or implied grant or is acquired by prescription.\u201d <em>Sharon v. Hayden, </em>246 Mont. 186, 190, 803 P.2d 1083, 1086 (1990) (citation omitted). About necessary incidents, we have likewise explained that \u201c[t]hese rights are in the nature of a \u2018secondary easement,\u2019 i.e., \u2018[a]n easement that is appurtenant to the primary or actual easement; the right to do things that are necessary to fully enjoy the easement itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mattson, </em>\u00b6 37 <em>(citingBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>587 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9th ed., West 2009)). Although the Court eschews the term \u201csecondary easement,\u201d this has long been fundamental easement law, as explained in \u00b6 109 of Justice McKinnon\u2019s dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b6127 However, the Court has departed from these principles and has instead created a new \u201csuper easement,\u201d or what is denominates as a \u201csingle, unified, public road right-of-way,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 32, wherein -the necessary incidents of the easement\u2019s enjoyment, and the area associated with the necessary incidents, become part of the easement width itself-expanding the area of the easement beyond that actually acquired by the public\u2019s use or occupancy. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 26, 32. It cites inapplicable statutes as authority for doing so, as noted by Justice McKinnon. Dissent, \u00b6 95. The error here is that the necessary incidents are of a different character than the acquired easement, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>do not merge with it. The incidents are not part of \u201c[t]he extent of a servitude\u201d because they are not \u201cthe nature of the enjoyment by which it was acquired.\u201d Section 70-17-106, MCA. They are acquired only \u201c \u2018by implication.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mattson, </em>\u00b6 37 (citation omitted). \u201cOf course, nothing passes by implication as incidental to the grant of an easement except that which is reasonably necessary to its fair enjoyment.\u201d <em>Mattson, </em>\u00b6 37. Incidents, as an implied interest, cannot merge with an easement because they are subject to change, both expansion and contraction, depending upon the circumstances that are necessary for the easement\u2019s enjoyment.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\">\u00b6128 Nonetheless, the Court declares the additional area or width accommodating the incidents of a publicly acquired prescriptive easement has the character of the easement itself, such that all other \u201cuses that are reasonably foreseeable\u201d may be made, Opinion, \u00b6 51, and that \u201call uses that are permissible to the public under the laws of this state are permissible uses,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 47 (citing <em>Lovvorn, </em>701 P.2d at 144). The Court thus uses authority standing for the proposition that a publicly acquired prescriptive easement can be used for all public purposes, and then extends that proposition to any area necessary for the implied incidents as well, opening the entirety of the area that is incidentally necessary for the easement\u2019s use to full public enjoyment of \u201call uses that are permissible.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 47. I believe this is a sweeping departure from established law and agree with \u00b6 100 of Justice McKinnon\u2019s dissent in this regard. If the area incidentally necessary can be so used, then, as Kennedy argues, \u201cthe easement could be expanded forever\u201d because an additional area will always be incidentally necessary for use of the primary area. If \u201c[f]oot travel over... embankments and abutments\u201d is reasonably foreseeable, as the Court posits, Opinion, \u00b6 52,1 surmise that most any other use would be as well. I dissent from this holding under Issue 1, and to those portions of Issue 3 expanding the necessary incidents of an easement to other uses and enjoyment.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b6 129 I agree with the Court that recreational use should likewise be considered in determining the area of the easement that was acquired by the public. I join the Court in remanding for consideration of that evidence under Issue 2, but I would limit that remand to the easement principles discussed above. Because Seyler Lane is a public road acquired by prescription, and PLAA\u2019s claim is based upon prescriptive use, the issue on remand-\u201cthe scope of a public road right-of-way established by prescription],\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 51-necessarily requires application of these principles. I join the Court on Issues 4 and 5.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
