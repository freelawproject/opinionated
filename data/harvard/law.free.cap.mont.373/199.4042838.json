We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u00b62 The following issues are raised on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u00b63 <em>Issue One: Whether \u00a7 46-16-215, MCA, requires production of independent evidence to corroborate an offender\u2019s admission of a violation of the conditions of his or her suspended sentence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\u00b64 <em>Issue Two: Whether the District Court violated Macker\u2019s right to confront adverse witnesses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">\u00b65 On March 31,2009, Macker was charged with forgery and issuing bad checks. He pled guilty to both counts on December 17, 2009. On February 25, 2010, he received a deferred sentence of two consecutive three-year terms, a total of six years, during which he was subject to the supervision of the Department of Corrections, Adult Probation and Parole Bureau. After about two years, Macker violated the conditions of his supervision. At a hearing on October 18, 2012, Macker admitted the violations, and the District Court imposed two consecutive three-year commitments to the Department of Corrections, with all time suspended. During his suspended sentence, Macker remained under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Bureau. The conditions of his supervision prohibited him from possessing or consuming intoxicants, including alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">\u00b66 On November 8,2012, Probation Officer Paul Parrish learned that Macker had been treated for alcohol poisoning at Kalispell Regional Medical Center the night before. Parrish visited Macker\u2019s home, and Macker admitted that he had consumed a bottle of vodka on the night in question. Parrish also spoke with Macker\u2019s mother, who confirmed that her son had been treated at the hospital, and expressed concern about his increased drinking. She told Parrish that Macker had consumed a fifth of alcohol for each of the three previous nights. Parrish obtained a urine sample from Macker, which initially tested positive for opiates. Further analysis by the state crime lab determined that Macker had not been using drugs. The sample was not tested for alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">\u00b67 A revocation hearing was held January 31,2013, at which Parrish was the only witness. Parrish testified that Macker had admitted being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>treated, for alcohol poisoning. Parrish also repeated the statement of Macker\u2019s mother that he had been drinking for the three nights prior to November 8, and that she was concerned about his \u201cspiraling\u201d alcohol use. Parrish had not obtained any hospital records and the State presented no other evidence of the alleged violation. The District Court found that the State had proven the violation by a preponderance of the evidence. The District Court revoked Macker\u2019s suspended sentence and committed him to the custody of the Department of Corrections for a total of six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b68 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute de novo. <em>State v. Triplett, </em>2008 MT 360, \u00b6 13, 346 Mont. 383, 195 P.3d 819. We exercise plenary review to determine whether a court has violated a probationer\u2019s right of due process. <em>Triplett, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u00b69 A district court may revoke a suspended sentence if the prosecution has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the offender has violated the terms and conditions of his or her suspended sentence. Section 46-18-203(6), (7), MCA. A revocation hearing is subject to the minimum requirements of due process. <em>State v. Pedersen, </em>2003 MT 315, \u00b6 21, 318 Mont. 262, 80 P.2d 79. The offender is entitled to receive written notice of the alleged violation and disclosure of the evidence against him or her. <em>State v. Finley, </em>2003 MT 239, \u00b6 31, 317 Mont. 268, 77 P.3d 193. He or she is also entitled to the opportunity to be heard by a neutral arbiter, to confront and cross-examine witnesses, and to present evidence in his or her defense. <em>Finley, </em>\u00b6 31. Finally, the offender is entitled to receive a written statement of the evidence relied upon by the arbiter and the reason for the revocation. <em>Finley, </em>\u00b6 31. Our statutes also require that prior to a revocation hearing, the offender must be advised of the allegations against him or her, the opportunity to appear and to present evidence, the opportunity to question adverse witnesses, and the right to be represented by counsel at the revocation hearing. Section 46-18-203(4), MCA. A revocation hearing is not, however, a criminal trial. <em>State v. Baird, </em>2006 MT 266, \u00b6 20, 334 Mont. 185, 145 P.3d 995. It is instead a civil proceeding, and the offender is not entitled to the full spectrum of rights and protections that exist in a criminal trial. <em>Finley, </em>\u00b6 29. Notably, the Rules of Evidence do not apply in a revocation hearing. M. R. Evid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>101(c)(3); <em>Baird, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b610 <em>Issue One: Whether \u00a7 46-16-215, MCA, requires production of independent evidence to corroborate an offender\u2019s admission of a violation of the condition of his or her suspended sentence .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u00b611  Macker argues that the District Court erred by not requiring the State to produce independent evidence corroborating his admission. Macker cites \u00a7 46-16-215, MCA, which states: \u201cBefore an extrajudicial confession of the defendant to the crime charged may be admitted into evidence, the prosecution shall introduce independent evidence tending to establish the commission of the crime charged.\u201d Macker asserts that this rule should be applied to revocation proceedings as well as to criminal trials. We hold that \u00a7 46-16-215, MCA, does not apply to revocation hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u00b612 We first note the comments of the Commission on Criminal Procedure, which state that \u00a7 46-16-215, MCA, \u201cconcern[s] the usefulness of extrajudicial confessions <em>at a criminal trial.\u201d </em>Section 46-16-215, MCA, Commission Comments at 667 (2012) (emphasis added). We also observe that \u00a7 46-16-215, MCA, appears in the chapter titled \u201cTrial,\u201d and more specifically, the part titled \u201cRules of Evidence for Criminal Cases.\u201d As we have stated, a revocation hearing is not a criminal trial, and the Rules of Evidence do not apply. M. R. Evid. 101(c)(3); <em>Baird, </em>\u00b6 20. The provisions governing revocation hearings appear in the chapter titled \u201cSentence and Judgment.\u201d Section 46-18-203, MCA. Those provisions set forth certain due process protections, which do not include restrictions on the use of extrajudicial admissions. Section 46-18-203, MCA. It is apparent that the Legislature contemplated the application of different rules in trials compared to revocation hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\u00b613  Federal case law also states that a conviction may not rest solely on an uncorroborated confession. <em>Opper v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 84, 93, 75 S. Ct. 158, 164 (1954). We are persuaded by the decisions of other courts, both state and federal, concluding that due process does not require application of this rule to revocation hearings. <em>United States v. Hilger, </em>728 F.3d 947, 950 (9th Cir. 2013); <em>State v. Lay, </em>546 P.2d 41, 42 (Ariz. App. Div. <em>11976); People v. Monette, </em>25 Cal. App. 4th 1572, 1575 (Cal. App. 4th Dist. 1994); <em>State ex rel. Russell v. McGlothin, </em>427 So. 2d 280, 282 (Fla. 2d Dist. App. 1983); <em>People v. Woznick, </em>663 N.E.2d 1037, 1039 (Ill. App. 4th Dist. 1996); <em>Smith v. State, </em>504 N.E.2d 333, 334 (Ind. App. 3d Dist. 1987); <em>State v. Sanchez, </em>790 P.2d 515, 517, (N.M. App. 1990); <em>Commonwealth v. Kavanaugh, </em>482 A.2d 1128, 1133 (Pa. Super. 1984). Revocation hearings are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>criminal proceedings, and do not implicate the \u201cfull panoply of rights\u201d due a criminal defendant. <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 480, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 2600 (1972). We therefore hold that neither our statutes nor due process require the State to produce independent evidence corroborating an offender\u2019s admission of a violation of the conditions of his or her supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">\u00b614 <em>Issue Two: Whether the District Court violated Macker\u2019s right to confront adverse witnesses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b615 Though the State was not required to produce evidence corroborating Macker\u2019s admission, it did so by offering Parrish\u2019s testimony that Macker\u2019s mother had expressed concern about her son\u2019s drinking habits. Macker argues that the admission of this evidence violated his right to due process, because he was not given the opportunity to confront and cross-examine his mother as an adverse witness. The adverse witness appearing at the revocation hearing was Parrish. Macker was given the opportunity to confront and cross-examine Parrish, and counsel did so. Moreover, the admission of the hearsay statements of Macker\u2019s mother was not error, because the Rules of Evidence, including the hearsay rules, do not apply in revocation hearings. M. R. Evid. 101(c)(3); <em>Baird, </em>\u00b6 20. Macker\u2019s right to due process was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b616 We affirm the order of the District Court revoking Macker\u2019s suspended sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b227-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, McKINNON, BAKER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
