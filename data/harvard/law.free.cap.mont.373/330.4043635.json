We affirm and restate Johnson\u2019s sole issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b354-24\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court abuse its. discretion when it denied </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number><em>Johnson\u2019s motion to excuse Juror Harsell for cause?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\u00b63 On February 11, 2012, Johnson drove to the home of his ex-girlfriend, Kristy Horvath (Horvath), and her roommate, Tye Diamond (Diamond). As the result of a previous disagreement between Johnson and Diamond, Johnson had been told by Diamond that he was not welcome there. When Johnson arrived that night, Horvath asked him to leave because Diamond was present. Johnson complied, but continued to drive around the neighborhood for some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u00b64 Later that night, Johnson returned to the home and knocked at the door, which was answered by a guest, Katrina Brenna (Brenna). Although Brenna opened the door to Johnson in the hope of calming him down, he pushed his way into the home and punched another guest, Tommy McDonald (McDonald), in the face, breaking his nose. Diamond attempted to intervene and was struck several times by Johnson. Eventually, the parties went outside where the altercation continued until Johnson said \u201cI\u2019m done\u201d and law enforcement arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"AHF\">\u00b65 The State subsequently charged Johnson with one count of burglary and two counts of misdemeanor assault. On July 17, 2012, Johnson pleaded guilty to the assaults, but proceeded to a jury trial on the burglary charge. During <em>voir dire, </em>Johnson\u2019s counsel asked the venire panel if anyone \u201cwould inherently think that a law enforcement officer is more believable than a non-officer, a citizen?\u201d Juror Harbaugh responded in the affirmative, and was dismissed by the District Court after explaining his view that law enforcement officers never lie under oath. Johnson\u2019s counsel then asked again if \u201c[a]nybody ... believes that officers are more inherently believable,\u201d whereafter the following exchange took place with Juror Harsell (Harsell):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">[ ] HARSELL: Well, yeah. I-I had occasion to work with a lot of police officers when I was-and sheriffs deputies, when I was involved with the Fair. They provide the security. And I generally found them to be a very trustworthy bunch. On the other hand, I do know of a case where one of the people that I trusted most ended up being charged with a crime, you know. I want to say a City police officer. I believe a detective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So similar question, then, like to what the judge asked Mr. Harbaugh. Do you believe that law enforcement officers always tell the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-9\">[ ] HARSELL: Not always, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. So would you be able to take any-just like any other witness, their testimony with a grain of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>salt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\">[ ] HARSELL: Whether you-I think a grain of salt is way too light. I just tend to find them more believable than the average person. [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So, again, you would find-for example, if Mr. Johnson were to testify you would find the officer more believable than Mr. Johnson; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">[ ] HARSELL: Well, as-as Mr. Harbaugh said, it would-I\u2019d look at the-I\u2019d have to look at the people to decide. But I\u2019m inherently more likely to believe a police officer than the general public, I think.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\u00b66 Following this discussion, Johnson\u2019s counsel challenged Harsell for cause. The District Court did not immediately rule on the motion, but instead questioned Harsell further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">[DISTRICT] COURT: Mr. Harsell, do you think you could, I mean, assess each witness on their own merits and make your own decision, based on the way they perform on the witness stand or demeanor, their- [ ] HARSELL: (Nods head.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">[DISTRICT] COURT: -intelligence, apparent intelligence, their means of knowledge of the issues that they\u2019re testifying about and so forth, and make a balanced decision about who to believe and-when they testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">[ ] HARSELL: On a person-by-person basis, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-10\">[DISTRICT] COURT: Regardless of what their occupation is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\">[ ] HARSELL: I believe so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">The District Court then denied Johnson\u2019s motion to excuse Harsell for cause, which resulted in Johnson\u2019s decision to exercise his final peremptory challenge on Harsell.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">\u00b67 Johnson was convicted and sentenced to ten years to the Montana State Prison with three years suspended on the burglary charge, and six-month sentences on each of the assaults, running concurrent with the ten-year prison term. Johnson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b356-15\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a challenge for cause using an abuse of discretion standard. <em>State v. Golie, </em>2006 MT 91, \u00b6 6, 332 Mont. 69, 134 P.3d 95 (citation omitted). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it fails to grant a challenge for cause when a juror\u2019s statements during <em>voir dire </em>raise serious doubts about the juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial,\u201d <em>State v. Allen, </em>2010 MT 214, \u00b6 25, 357 Mont. 495, 241 P.3d 1045 (citations omitted), or \u201cactual bias is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>discovered,\u201d <em>State v. Rogers, </em>2007 MT 227, \u00b6 18, 339 Mont. 132, 168 P.3d 669 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Johnson\u2019s motion to excuse Juror Harsell for cause ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b6 10 Both the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution guarantee the right to a trial by an impartial jury. <em>State v. Hausauer, </em>2006 MT 336, \u00b6 20, 335 Mont. 137, 149 P.3d 895. During <em>voir dire, </em>\u201c[e]ach party may challenge jurors for cause, and each challenge must be tried by the court.\u201d Section 46-16-115(1), MCA. A specified ground for a challenge for cause is that a potential juror has \u201ca state of mind in reference to the case or to either of the parties that would prevent the juror from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of either party.\u201d Section 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. We evaluate challenges for cause under this provision in light of the statutory language and the totality of the circumstances presented. <em>State v. Marble, </em>2005 MT 208, \u00b6 10, 328 Mont. 223, 119 P.3d 88. We have held that \u201cjurors should be disqualified based on their prejudices only where they have Torm[ed] <em>fixed opinions </em>of the guilt or innocence of the defendant <em>which they would not be able to lay aside and render a verdict based solely on the evidence presented in court.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 State v. Falls Down, </em>2003 MT 300, \u00b6 23, 318 Mont. 219, 79 P.3d 797 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). However, we have also clarified that the \u201c \u2018fixed opinion\u2019 rule is only one argument that may be made under the \u2018state of mind\u2019 basis for a challenge for cause set forth in \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA.\u201d <em>Golie, </em>\u00b6 25. When reviewing a challenge for cause, we emphasize a juror\u2019s \u201cspontaneous, and usually initial, statements or responses.\u201d <em>Hausauer, </em>\u00b6 23. If a district court improperly denies a challenge for cause, \u201csuch an abuse of discretion is conclusively prejudicial and requires automatic reversal.\u201d <em>State v. Freshment, </em>2002 MT 61, \u00b6 14, 309 Mont. 154, 43 P.3d 968. However, we will affirm a district court\u2019s denial of a challenge for cause if \u201cthe juror convincingly affirms his ability to lay aside any misgivings and fairly weigh the evidence.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\u00b611 Johnson does not argue that Harsell expressed a \u201cfixed opinion\u201d of his guilt or innocence, but rather, that Harsell raised serious questions about his ability to act with entire impartiality when he said, \u201cI\u2019m inherently more likely to believe a police officer than the general public, I think.\u201d Johnson also argues that Harsell \u201cupped the ante <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>when he stated that he could not take law enforcement testimony with a grain of salt... because he thought <em>\u2018a </em>grain of salt is way too light.\u2019 \u201d Johnson asserts that these remarks amounted to a \u201cstated bias\u201d which prevented Harsell from acting impartially in a case relying heavily on law enforcement testimony. In support, Johnson notes that \u201cdismissal for cause is favored when a serious question arises about a juror\u2019s ability to be impartial,\u201d citing <em>State v. Richeson, </em>2004 MT 113, \u00b6 14, 321 Mont. 126, 89 P.3d 958.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b612 The State maintains that Harsell\u2019s responses as a whole \u201cdid not establish that he harbored actual bias or that his state of mind prevented him from acting impartially.\u201d The State notes Harsell\u2019s stated belief that law enforcement officers do not always tell the truth and his assurance that he would judge the credibility of each witness individually. The State also points to other remarks by Harsell indicating some negative feelings about law enforcement and his willingness to set aside his personal experiences and listen impartially to the evidence presented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">[ ] HARSELL: I have a lot of respect for the law enforcement people, particularly in this area. I just have had a lot of disappointments in the legal system, just in how slow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">[STATE]: Yeah?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">[ ] HARSELL: And how just lack of follow-up around some things. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to affect anything. But I thought since you asked, it\u2019s worth mentioning. I\u2019ve had some disappointments. [STATE]: Personal disappointments?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">[ ] HARSELL: Um, pretty much, yeah. Just an example, my wife, working in a county office, had her purse stolen-had her checkbook stolen and knew who did it. And the police knew who did it, but no action was taken until this person was finally brought in for something else. And at that time, they got around to charging her. But it\u2019s just one of-some of the-[STATE]: You think that that-you can separate those?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\">[ ] HARSELL: I can, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-10\">[ ] HARSELL: I have been a victim of burglary and theft many times. I don\u2019t know how much you want me to go into detail. [STATE]: Well, my main concern is how that will affect the way that you listen to this case. If you\u2019re going to come in thinking that he\u2019s guilty already or-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-11\">[ ] HARSELL: I\u2019m not going to come in thinking he\u2019s guilty already, but with a certain amount of anger about this for people that do such.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>[STATE]: Are you able to sit and listen to the evidence and not put him in the situation of where you were-he didn\u2019t do it to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">[ ] HARSELL: I believe so, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">[STATE]: Okay. How many people think he did something wrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">[ ] HARSELL: At this point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">[STATE]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">[ ] HARSELL: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">\u00b613 The State analogizes the circumstances here to <em>State v. Normandy, </em>2008 MT 437, 347 Mont. 505, 198 P.3d 834 (juror expressing bias against the crime of domestic violence but asserting that he could be fair and impartial did not require dismissal for cause); <em>Marble </em>(juror expressing religious bias against homosexual activity but insisting that he could follow the law did not require dismissal for cause); <em>Falls Down </em>(two jurors admitting to holding preconceived opinions about the defendant\u2019s guilt but stating that they could follow the district court\u2019s instructions and listen to the evidence did not require dismissal for cause); <em>State v. Robinson, </em>2008 MT 34, 341 Mont. 300, 177 P.3d 488, <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Gunderson, </em>2010 MT 166, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74 (juror struggling with the presumption of innocence but convincing the district court that she could lay aside her concerns did not require dismissal for cause); <em>Rogers </em>(juror initially proclaiming a lack of objectivity in regard to sexual abuse but later indicating that he could be unbiased and impartial did not require dismissal for cause); and <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 58, 320 Mont. 211, 89 P.3d 947. We find <em>Heath </em>particularly instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">\u00b614 <em>In Heath, </em>the State charged the defendant with sexual intercourse without consent. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 5. During <em>voir dire, </em>prospective juror Caldwell explained that she had volunteered as a rape-survivor advocate in college and that her ex-boyfriend had stalked her. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 17. When asked by defense counsel for more details, Caldwell admitted that she would not want someone with her experience to serve on the jury if she was on trial and then said \u201cI feel I probably shouldn\u2019t be on this particular <em>case.\u201dHeath, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-22. During follow-up questioning by the State, Caldwell expressed her belief that the State is required to prove its case and that a defendant is innocent until proven guilty. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 23. Caldwell also stated that she would base her decision on \u201cthe facts of the case,\u201d although she wanted everyone to be aware of her past experiences. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 24. In affirming the district court\u2019s denial of the defense\u2019s challenge for cause, this Court evaluated the entirety of Caldwell\u2019s statements, noting particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>that she \u201crepeatedly stated that she would focus solely on the facts of the case and set her prior experiences aside.\u201d <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b615 Like the juror in <em>Heath, </em>Harsell acknowledged his biases but confirmed that he could set aside his prior experiences and \u201clook at the people to decide.\u201d He also stated that he had not come to the case believing Johnson was guilty. Although Harsell mentioned positive experiences that he had with law enforcement officers in the past and expressed a belief that they are inherently credible, he also stated his belief that law enforcement officers don\u2019t always tell the truth and assured the District Court that he would assess each witness\u2019s credibility without regard to occupation, evaluating each witness \u201c[o]n a person-by-person basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b616 Johnson argues that <em>Heath </em>is distinguishable because the Court determined that defense counsel had \u201cmanipulat[ed]\u201d some of Caldwell\u2019s initial responses, citing <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 25. While the manipulation issue was a part of our analysis, it was not the only factor considered and does not diminish the similarities between the statements offered by Caldwell and Harsell regarding their ability to set aside their subjective concerns and view the evidence impartially, as required under \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b617 Johnson maintains that Harsell\u2019s rehabilitating remarks to the District Court followed a series of improper leading questions, which should be disregarded. Johnson argues that \u201c[district courts may ask \u2018open-ended questions to allow a veniremember to clarify initial, suspect statements,\u2019 <em>{Allen, </em>\u00b6 26) but should not elicit \u2018coaxed recantations\u2019 in order to rehabilitate a potential juror,\u201d citing <em>State v. Braunreiter, </em>2008 MT 197, \u00b6 11, 344 Mont. 59, 185 P.3d 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u00b618  We conclude the District Court did not elicit a \u201ccoaxed recantation\u201d in this case. Turning again to <em>Heath, </em>we observe that the District Court there questioned the juror (Caldwell) in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">[DISTRICT] COURT: Can you put aside everything that you know, that you have learned from your education and from your volunteer work, can you put that aside and base your judgment solely on the testimony and evidence presented in this courtroom? CALDWELL: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">[DISTRICT] COURT: And follow the law as given to you by the court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-10\">CALDWELL: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">We determined that \u201c[t]his questioning was not an attempt by the District Court to shift the focus from Caldwell\u2019s beliefs or to cause her-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>to recant her initial statements. The District Court merely attempted to clarify.\u201d <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 29. Here, the District Court questioned Harsell in a nearly identical fashion to determine whether he could assess each witness on their own merits. This was not an attempt to prompt Harsell to recant, but rather, to clarify his initial statements. The District Court merely sought to determine the extent to which Harsell\u2019s prior experiences with law enforcement would impact his ability to fairly judge each witness\u2019s credibility, and did not engage in improper rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b6 19 Finally, Johnson argues that \u201c[e]ach of the cases cited by the State can be distinguished from the case at hand because these cases presented situations where the initial, spontaneous statements by the potential jurors indicated an ability to set aside any concerns and act with entire impartiality.\u201d Johnson asserts that, in contrast, Harsell\u2019s \u201cspontaneous statements clearly established his bias.\u201d We disagree. From the outset, Harsell qualified his positive statements in regard to law enforcement officers by spontaneously adding that he would look to witnesses individually and listen to their testimony to decide their veracity. Moreover, while a juror\u2019s initial, spontaneous statements are important, we do not view them in a vacuum, but instead look at the juror\u2019s responses as a whole, including later responses to questioning. <em>Braunreiter, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-11. Here, Harsell\u2019s statements as a whole establish his ability to set aside any preconceptions and judge the witnesses fairly. <em>See Allen, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u00b620 We conclude by noting that we give deference to a district court\u2019s determination regarding a challenge for cause. <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 13 (\u201c[T]he decision whether to grant a challenge for cause is within the discretion of the trial judge, who has the ability to look into the eyes of the juror in question, and to consider her responses in the context of the courtroom.\u201d); <em>State v. Hatten, </em>1999 MT 298, \u00b6 28, 297 Mont. 127, 991 P.2d 939 (\u201cBecause the trial court is best able to observe the jurors and to decide the potential for prejudice when allegations of juror misconduct are raised, the trial court has significant latitude when ruling on such matters.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u00b621 We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b361-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, McKINNON and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
