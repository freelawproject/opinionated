The Department also appeals the separate findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order that determined that Bresnan owns exclusively class eight cable television system properties under \u00a7 15-6-138(l)(k), MCA. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-11\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court properly determined, that Bresnan owned exclusively class eight property?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-12\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court properly concluded that the Department lacked authority to impose retroactive property tax assessments?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-13\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b54-14\">\u00b63 Bresnan challenged the Department\u2019s decision to tax Bresnan as a single entity rather than allowing Bresnan to apportion unilaterally its assets among tax classifications. Bresnan is a Delaware Limited Liability Company that operates in Montana. Bresnan purchased the cable television network infrastructure in Montana that is at the center of this dispute in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-15\">\u00b64 Bresnan\u2019s 2003 network was typical of cable systems. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u201cheadend\u201d of that network received and broadcasted data that Bresnan chose. The headend broadcasted data over the \u201ctrunk cable,\u201d the industry name for the networked cable system that connected Bresnan\u2019s data feed to each customer\u2019s neighborhood. Once the data reached a customer\u2019s neighborhood, the \u201cfeeder cable\u201d transmitted data throughout the neighborhood. Each individual customer had a \u201cdrop cable\u201d that connected the feeder cable to the customer\u2019s home. The drop cable connected to the customer\u2019s \u201cterminal equipment.\u201d The terminal equipment, commonly known as the set-top box, interpreted which data to play on a television.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\u00b65 Bresnan began to upgrade the network\u2019s infrastructure to include new services shortly after the purchase. Bresnan sought to integrate services beyond basic television programming. Bresnan wanted to bundle expanded cable programming (cable), on-demand video services, high-speed internet data services (internet), and voice-over internet protocol telephony services (VoIP). Bresnan labels these services its \u201cTriple Play\u201d package. The upgrades necessary to include these services altered Bresnan\u2019s network from its 2003 form.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u00b66 Bresnan\u2019s expert accounting and valuation report describes Bresnan\u2019s \u201csignificant investment in system engineering, costly new equipment, upgraded distribution plant, and installation labor\u201d in order to expand its cable programming. Bresnan improved its satellite receiver dishes, installed signal combiners, optical laser transmission equipment, and added optical fiber between the headend and feeder cable distribution nodes. Bresnan invested in video-on-demand servers and upgraded distribution node equipment. Bresnan also distributed new set-top boxes to customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u00b67 Bresnan made additional investments to prepare its system for internet services following its cable upgrade. Bresnan made business arrangements to provide connection to the internet and upgraded its physical system to affect the addition of internet services. Physical upgrades included data switches in each headend to interface with the internet connections in Seattle and Denver, local data servers in main headends, and a \u201cCable Modem Termination System\u201d (CMTS).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u00b68 The CMTS allowed Bresnan to combine the internet data with the cable data into a single electrical signal for transfer over Bresnan\u2019s system. Bresnan also provided cable modems to subscribers who purchased internet service. To achieve the transfer of internet service to its customers, Bresnan used both the CMTS and the recently-installed signal combiners, optical fiber between headends and distribution nodes, and existing drop cables.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u00b69 Bresnan upgraded its network further to provide VoIP residential telephone services. Bresnan contracted with Net2Phone, a joint venture partner, to effect this upgrade. Net2Phone provided most of the necessary capital and software to bring about residential VoIP capabilities. Bresnan provided use of the CMTS to combine the residential VoIP data with the cable and internet data into a single electrical signal for transfer over Bresnan\u2019s network. Bresnan used both the CMTS and the recently-installed signal combiners, optical fiber between headends and distribution nodes, and existing drop cables to achieve the transfer of residential VoIP service to its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u00b610 Bresnan also engaged in the \u201c[sjystem [hjardening\u201d process for its network after upgrades to enable residential voice services. System hardening included further physical changes to Bresnan\u2019s network. Specifically, Bresnan installed battery backups and other unspecified equipment to identify and reduce interference for residential VoIP service. System hardening reduced interference that specifically would have affected the data and VoIP traffic on its network.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u00b6 11 Bresnan made further upgrades to enable commercial VoIP. These upgrades included new switches in select headends and data servers for commercial subscriber voicemail services. Bresnan used the CMTS to combine the commercial VoIP data with residential VoIP, cable, and internet data into a single electrical signal for transfer over Bresnan\u2019s network. Bresnan used both the CMTS and the recently-installed signal combiners, optical fiber between headends and distribution nodes, and existing drop cables to achieve the transfer of commercial VoIP service to its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u00b612 Bresnan lastly began to provide the same terminal equipment to customers in 2010, without consideration of which services the customer had purchased from Bresnan. This new terminal equipment provided an integrated experience to customers. Regardless of which services the customer had purchased from Bresnan, all data arrived into a single piece of terminal equipment. The single terminal equipment processed that data and delivered the appropriate service to the customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\u00b613 Although Bresnan functionally had bundled its Triple Play services for consumers, Bresnan segregated each service for taxation purposes. Montana imposes an excise tax upon voice services, such as Bresnan\u2019s telephony operations. Section 15-53-128 <em>et seq., </em>MCA. Montana imposes no excise taxes upon cable television or high speed internet. Section 15-53-128 <em>et seq., </em>MCA. Bresnan paid separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>franchise fees to local governments for the right to install its cable television system in public rights of way. Bresnan needed to pay no franchise fees, however, for high speed internet or telephony.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\u00b614 The Montana legislature amended the Montana tax code in 1999 to include language central to this dispute. The amendment specifically incorporated \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d into the tax code when it created an assessment classification for \u201ctelecommunications services companies.\u201d Section 15-6-156(l)(d), MCA (2001). The Department would for the first time assess centrally allocations of \u201ctelecommunications services companies\u201d under the new amendment. Section 15-6-156(l)(d), MCA (2001). Comments at the hearings on the bill show that the bill\u2019s sponsor intended to provide a tax decrease from the pre-1999 assessment and taxation rates for \u201cthe assets of telecommunications\u201d in future telecommunications developments. Mont. Sen. Tax. Comm., Hearing on HB 174, 1999 Legis., Reg. Sess. 11-13 (Apr. 12, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u00b615 Montana\u2019s administrative rules require the Department to value centrally reported property through the unit method of valuation. Admin. R. M. 42.22.111 (2011). Unit valuation considers the market value of the company as a functional whole instead of the value of individual components. Whether a taxpayer uses local filing, as compared to central filing, dictates the method that the Department uses to value property.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u00b616 Bresnan unilaterally apportioned company assets when Bresnan made its tax reports in order to segregate its property. Bresnan used centralized, statewide reporting for its voice operations. Bresnan included roughly 10% of company assets in its voice operation tax declaration. Bresnan reported voice operations as \u201cBresnan Digital Services, LLC\u201d doing business as \u201cMontana Telephony\u201d from 2007 to 2009. Bresnan also centrally reported its microwave satellite operations as a portion of the same 10% of company assets. The Department had classified Bresnan\u2019s voice operations as class thirteen property from 2007 to 2009 because the voice operations were \u201callocations of [a] centrally assessed telecommunications and services compan[y].\u201d The class thirteen classification resulted in a 6% centralized assessment on Bresnan\u2019s voice property.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">\u00b617 Bresnan included the remaining 90% of its assets in locally reported cable and internet properties assessments as \u201cBresnan Communications, LLC.\u201d Local communities assessed Bresnan\u2019s cable and internet properties from 2007 to 2009. Local assessments resulted in a 3% local assessment on cable and internet properties. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Department knew of Bresnan\u2019s decision to report its cable and internet properties for local assessment as class eight properties from 2007 to 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b618 The Department audited Bresnan in December 2008 for tax years 2007 and 2008. The Department determined upon completion of the audit in August 2009 that Bresnan should report its property as a single entity rather than as three separate entities. The Department informed Bresnan that Montana law required the Department to assess Bresnan centrally as one unit, and to classify Bresnan\u2019s property under class thirteen as allocations of a centrally assessed telecommunications services company.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\u00b619 The Department issued revised assessments for Bresnan for tax years 2007, 2008, and 2009 following the audit. The Department\u2019s revised assessments centrally assessed all of Bresnan\u2019s property under class thirteen. The Department submitted the revised assessments to Bresnan. Bresnan paid parts of the assessments under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">\u00b620 The Department similarly assessed Bresnan centrally on May 26, 2010, as one unit for the 2010 tax year. The 2010 assessment subjected all of Bresnan\u2019s Montana properties to class thirteen central assessment at a 6% tax rate. Section 15-6-156(4), MCA. The reclassification increased Bresnan\u2019s tax burden from $1,711,365 in tax year 2009 to $7,337,692 in tax year 2010. Bresnan filed this declaratory judgment action in response on July 28, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">\u00b621 Bresnan sought to prevent the Department from issuing revised assessments of Bresnan for tax years 2007, 2008, and 2009. Bresnan also sought to prevent the Department from issuing any other revised assessments. Bresnan additionally sought a declaration that the Department illegally had assessed all of Bresnan\u2019s property as class thirteen property. Bresnan further asked the District Court to require the Department to refund taxes that Bresnan had paid under protest. Bresnan lastly challenged the legality of the Department\u2019s method of assessment for the 2010 tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">\u00b622 The District Court granted Bresnan\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the Department\u2019s ability to issue retroactive assessments in a written order on September 26, 2011. The District Court conducted a bench trial on October 24, 2011. The District Court concluded that Bresnan owned class eight properties. The District Court directed the Department to refund with interest the payments that Bresnan had made under protest. The District Court also vacated the Department\u2019s retroactive assessments of Bresnan. The Department appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\u00b623 We review for clear error a district court\u2019s findings of fact. <em>Roland v. Davis, </em>2013 MT 148, \u00b6 21, 370 Mont. 327, 302 P.3d 91. Clear error exists if substantial, credible evidence fails to support the findings of fact, if the district court misapprehended the evidence\u2019s effect, or if we have a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. <em>Roland, </em>\u00b6 21. We review for correctness a district court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Roland, </em>\u00b6 21. We review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment. <em>Bailey v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>2013 MT 119, \u00b6 18, 370 Mont. 73, 300 P.3d 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u00b624 <em>Whether the District Court properly determined that Bresnan owned exclusively class eight property ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\u00b625 We first address whether Montana law allows the Department to classify Bresnan\u2019s property in class eight or class thirteen. Montana law defines class eight properties to include \u201ccable television systems.\u201d Section 15-6-138(l)(k), MCA. Montana taxes class eight properties at 3%. Section 15-6-138(3), MCA. Class thirteen properties comprise \u201callocations of centrally assessed telecommunications services companies.\u201d Section 15-6-156(l)(d), MCA. Montana taxes class thirteen property at \u201c6% of its market value.\u201d Section 15-6-156(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">\u00b626 These statutory definitions pose the question of whether Bresnan\u2019s property should be classified as a \u201ccable television system\u201d or a \u201ctelecommunications services company.\u201d The District Court concluded as a matter of law that Bresnan\u2019s property qualified as a \u201ccable television system.\u201d The District Court evaluated Bresnan\u2019s \u201c[o]ne-way transmission of video programming,\u201d \u201cset of closed transmission paths,\u201d and \u201csystem that receives and amplifies the signals broadcast by one or more television stations\u201d to reach its conclusion. The District Court relied both on the legislature\u2019s definition of a \u201ccable television system,\u201d and the language in Bresnan\u2019s Montana Cable Television Franchise Agreements that matched the language in the Federal Cable Act. Bresnan fit the definition of a cable television system under these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">\u00b627 The District Court further concluded as a matter of law that \u201cBresnan\u2019s addition of voice and data services did not change the character of its cable television systems.\u201d The District Court relied upon the Department\u2019s apparent failure to \u201creconcile the necessity of Franchise Agreements for Bresnan to deliver its video programming\u201d with the Department\u2019s contention that \u201cBresnan, as a whole, is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>telecommunications company.\u201d The District Court applied a use test to measure Bresnan\u2019s \u201cPPE [property, plant, and equipment], bandwidth, subscribers, or revenue\u201d to \u201cconclude that Bresnan owns property subject to [c]lass [e]ight property taxation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u00b628 The Department challenges the District Court\u2019s focus on Bresnan\u2019s physical attributes to the exclusion of the use and productivity of Bresnan\u2019s property. The Department alleges that the District Court erroneously considered only \u201ca portion of [Bresnan\u2019s] use and productivity.\u201d The Department argues that the District Court should have evaluated Bresnan\u2019s classification based upon Bresnan\u2019s use of all of its property and the productivity that results from that use. <em>Chicago, M. &amp; St P. Ry. Co. v. Powell Cnty., </em>76 Mont. 596, 599, 247 P. 1096, 1097 (1926); <em>Wheir v. Dye, </em>105 Mont. 347, 73 P.2d 209 (1937). The Department further takes issue with the District Court\u2019s lack of \u201canalysis on the physical attributes or use and productivity of Bresnan\u2019s internet property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u00b629 The District Court relied heavily upon our decision in <em>Omimex Canada, Ltd. v. State Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>2008 MT 403, 347 Mont. 176, 201 P.3d 3. In <em>Omimex, </em>we considered whether a natural gas company\u2019s property fell within \u00a7 15-6-141(l)(b), MCA (2007). <em>Omimex, </em>\u00b6 17. Section 15-6-141(l)(b), MCA(2007), encompasses \u201callocations for centrally assessed natural gas companies having a major distribution system in this state.\u201d Omimex\u2019s lack of a major distribution system within Montana excluded it from \u00a7 15-6-141(l)(b), MCA (2007). <em>Omimex, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u00b630 \u201c[C]able television systems\u201d comprise class class eight property. Section 15-6-138(l)(k), MCA. \u201c[A]llocations of centrally assessed telecommunications services companies\u201d comprise class thirteen properties. Section 15-6-156(l)(d), MCA. Neither classification statute contains the requirement that a taxpayer have \u201ca major distribution system in this state,\u201d similar to the provision in \u00a7 15-6-141(l)(b), MCA (2007), at issue in <em>Omimex. </em>This physical attribute requirement in <em>Omimex-in </em>the form of a major distribution system-remains unique for purposes of property tax classification statutes. Not surprisingly, <em>Omimex </em>represents the sole case where we have determined that the physical attributes of a taxpayer\u2019s property alone govern property tax classification. <em>Omimex, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">\u00b631 The District Court\u2019s analysis focused upon a physical attribute of Bresnan\u2019s property-the transfer of electrical data signals. Physical attributes do not represent the standard that Montana courts use to classify property. The District Court\u2019s focus upon the physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>attributes of Bresnan\u2019s network confines the Department\u2019s ability to classify Bresnan\u2019s entire property in proportion \u201cto its use, its productivity, its utility, [and] its general setting in the economic organization of society.\u201d <em>Yellowstone Pipe Line Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, </em>138 Mont. 603, 621, 358 P.2d 55, 64 (1960). The physical attributes of Bresnan\u2019s property <em>and </em>the productivity that results from the use of that property represent the proper metric to classify Bresnan. <em>Wheir, </em>105 Mont, at 354-55, 73 P.2d at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">\u00b632 Bresnan argues that we should uphold the District Court\u2019s conclusion regardless because Bresnan qualifies as a \u201ccable television system\u201d under the definition of a rural cooperative utility cable television system, \u201cthat receives and amplifies the signals broadcast by one or more television stations.\u201d Section 35-18-102, MCA. Bresnan cites to its cable franchise agreements with Montana cities to bolster its position. Bresnan also correctly identifies that both parties\u2019 experts agree that Bresnan operates a cable television system. The Department concedes \u201cthat Bresnan\u2019s systems are capable, at least in part, of these utilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u00b633 This definition of a \u201ccable television system\u201d fails to capture all of the uses to which Bresnan puts its network. Nothing restricts the use and productivity of Bresnan\u2019s network to the delivery of an electrical data signal only for cable television. Bresnan\u2019s expert report from Dr. Walter Stanley Ciciora describes cable as the \u201cpredominant,\u201d but not exclusive, \u201cuse of even the most technologically advanced cable television systems today.\u201d Bresnan\u2019s accounting and valuation report describes a \u201cmulti-million dollar commitment to enhance[] [cable] that required a significant investment in system engineering, costly new equipment, upgraded distribution plant, and installation labor.\u201d That same report describes additional investments \u201cneeded to provide data services\u201d and \u201cneeded to provide V[o]IP residential telephony services,\u201d as well as the \u201cincremental cost of enabling commercial V[o]IP services.\u201d Dr. Ciciora concluded that \u201c[m]ost of [Bresnan\u2019s] cable television systems are technologically advanced, providing cable television programming, and high speed data and voice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u00b634 Bresnan altered its network from one with the limited ability to broadcast only cable in 2003, to the multi-service capable network at issue in this litigation. Bresnan\u2019s argument that its network operates exclusively a \u201ccable television system\u201d denies the obvious fact of the actual use and productivity of Bresnan\u2019s upgraded network. This upgraded network, combined with Bresnan\u2019s attendant property, has expanded Bresnan\u2019s operation beyond a \u201ccable television system\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>defined by any section of the Montana code, including \u00a7 15-6-138(l)(k), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b635 Various provisions within Title 15 and the administrative rules of Montana explain what constitutes a telecommunications services provider for property tax purposes. We must construe statutes that address the same subject matter and that are consistent with one another to ensure that all statutes have effect. <em>Mountain W. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hall, </em>2001 MT 314, \u00b6 23, 308 Mont. 29, 38 P.3d 825.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u00b636 \u201c[Ajllocations of centrally assessed telecommunications services companies\u201d comprise class thirteen properties. Section 15-6-156(l)(d), MCA. The definitions section of Title 15 defines the parameters of a telecommunications services company. A \u201ctelecommunications services provider\u201d offers retail telecommunications services. Section 15-53-129 (14), MCA. \u201cRetail telecommunications,\u201d in turn, involve \u201cthe two-way transmission of voice, image, data, or other information over wire, cable, fiber optics, microwave, radio, satellite, or similar facilities that originates or terminates in this state and is charged to a customer with a Montana service address.\u201d Section 15-53-129(10)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u00b637 The administrative rules of Montana clarify that a \u201ctelecommunications service provider\u201d includes \u201ca telecommunication services company or a person providing retail telecommunication services as provided in 15-53-129, MCA.\u201d Admin. R. M. 42.22.101(31) (2011). The administrative rules further define \u201ctelecommunications for <em>property tax purposes\u201d </em>as \u201cthe transmission of information between or among points specified by the user. The transmission must be without change in the form or content as sent and received. The transmission includes all related services associated with providing the information by the telecommunication service provider.\u201d Admin. R. M. 42.22.101(30) (2011) (emphasis added). We construe these statutes and regulations on the same subject matter so that all statutes have effect. <em>Mountain W.

Sections 15-53-129 (14), -129(10)(a), MCA. We decline to parse the number and type of electrical data signals that Bresnan transmits over its network or the allocations of the network\u2019s physical elements when the use and productivity of the network as a whole fits the statutory definition of a telecommunications network. An analysis of the use and productivity of Bresnan\u2019s entire network results in the inescapable conclusion that Bresnan uses a single transmission line to deliver three separate services. This analysis imparts the Department with the authority to classify Bresnan\u2019s property accordingly under class thirteen as a telecommunication service. <em>Powell Cnty., </em>76 Mont, at 599, 247 P. at 1097; <em>Wheir, </em>105 Mont, at 347, 73 P.2d at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\u00b641 The legislature\u2019s exemption of certain properties from class thirteen further supports this outcome. The expression of one thing in a statute implies the exclusion of another. <em>Omimex, </em>\u00b6 21. The legislature explicitly excluded from class thirteen any class five property owned by an organization that provides telecommunications services. Section 15-6-156(2)(f), MCA. This express exclusion of class five property implies that the legislature intended to include all other property that a telecommunications services provider owns in class thirteen. Section 15-6-156(2)(f), MCA. If the legislature had intended to exclude class eight \u201ccable television systems\u201d from class thirteen, the legislature could have added the additional language of \u201cand under 15-6-138 [class eight]\u201d to the class thirteen exemptions. Section 15-6-156 (2)(f), MCA. The legislature did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\u00b642  To limit Bresnan\u2019s classification to a \u201ccable television service\u201d fails to achieve the purpose of Montana\u2019s taxation classification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>statutes. Statutory definitions and administrative guidelines taken together, and in the absence of an applicable exclusion, make clear that Bresnan\u2019s use and productivity fits the definition of a \u201ctelecommunication services provider.\u201d Bresnan, as a result, remains subject to assessment under class thirteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b643 The Dissent argues that the Department\u2019s failure to value Bresnan\u2019s property in different classes \u201cdisregards the basic premise of our property classification system.\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 65. Nothing in the classification statutes requires, however, that the Department apportion Bresnan\u2019s property among Montana\u2019s various property tax classifications. This Court previously has defined \u201callocation\u201d for taxation purposes as \u201cthe process of attributing to the taxing state the value of a portion of an interstate system for tax purposes.\u201d <em>Yellowstone Pipe Line Co., </em>138 Mont, at 612, 358 P.2d at 60. The class thirteen definition of \u201callocations of centrally assessed telecommunications services companies\u201d requires only that the Department consider all of Bresnan\u2019s property located within Montana for taxation purposes. Section 15-6-156(l)(d), MCA; <em>Yellowstone Pipe Line Co., </em>138 Mont, at 612, 358 P.2d at 60. This decision allows the Department to address properly \u201can administrative matter within its broad discretion.\u201d <em>State v.

The Department\u2019s audit of Bresnan revealed, however, that very little of Bresnan\u2019s use of its system involves exclusively cable television that relies on one-way transmissions that receive and amplify broadcast signals. In fact, most of Bresnan\u2019s system, as currently used, has the capacity to support the two-way transmission of electrical data signals. The operation of a \u201ctelecommunications services compan[y],\u201d involves the two-way transmission of electrical data signals. Section 15-6-156(l)(d), MCA. The Department\u2019s audit of Bresnan confirms that \u201cBresnan upgraded their equipment and lines to two-way transmission capacity, fiber optic in most cases, to offer many of their advanced services that are available today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b645 Our determination that the Department appropriately classified the use and productivity of Bresnan\u2019s property under class thirteen instead of class eight requires us to analyze the assessment of class thirteen property. The District Court determined that central assessment did not apply to Bresnan. The District Court exempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Bresnan from central assessment based upon its determination that Bresnan qualified as a class eight \u201ccable television system.\u201d The District Court further reasoned that the central assessment statute, \u00a7 15-23-101, MCA, \u201comits any reference to cable television system[s].\u201d A class thirteen classification, conversely, denotes by its terms \u201ccentrally assessed telecommunications services companies.\u201d Section 15-6-156(l)(d), MCA. Bresnan\u2019s qualification as a telecommunications service company requires us to determine whether class thirteen classification of Bresnan would be appropriate under the \u201ccentrally assessed\u201d element of \u00a715-6-156(l)(d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b646 Montana law requires the Department to assess centrally \u201cproperty owned by a corporation ... operating a single and continuous property operated in more than one county.\u201d Section 15-23-101(2), MCA. Properties that enjoy a unity of ownership and devotion to a single use qualify as single and continuous properties. <em>W. Union Tel. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, </em>91 Mont. 310, 322-23, 7 P.2d 551, 552-53 (1932). \u201cSingle and continuous\u201d properties are functionally integrated over a wide area and enjoy a unity of use and management. <em>W. Union Tel. Co., </em>91 Mont, at 322-23, 7 P.2d at 552-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u00b647 Bresnan operates a single and continuous network in the twenty Montana counties where Bresnan delivers three services. Bresnan operates in an integrated fashion. Bresnan\u2019s customers pay one bill for the purchase of all three services. Bresnan manages its operations from the Network Operations Center in Billings. Customers use a single piece of terminal equipment. Bresnan owns class thirteen property in those locations where Bresnan operates a single transmission line to deliver three services to customers. Bresnan fits the statutory definition of a property that the Department must assess centrally. Section 15-6-156(l)(d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b648 <em>Whether the District Court properly concluded that the Department lacked authority to impose retroactive property tax assessments?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u00b649 We next address whether the Department possessed authority to issue revised assessments for Bresnan\u2019s property for tax years 2007, 2008, and 2009. The District Court determined that \u00a7 15-8-601(b), MCA, controlled its analysis. The District Court interpreted our revised assessment case law to allow reassessment only in circumstances where there had been a clerical error or a ministerial mistake. The District Court determined that our case law foreclosed reassessments \u201cmade to comport with a change in assessor judgment\u201d to avoid impermissible prejudice to the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">\u00b650 The District Court reasoned that the Department\u2019s shift away <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>from Bresnan\u2019s prior income statement and balance sheet to a centralized assessment represented a shift in assessor judgment. The District Court concluded that the \u201cchange in appraisal judgment\u201d placed the Department\u2019s reassessment \u201coutside the definition of an-erroneous assessment\u2019 \u201d allowed under \u00a7 15-8-601, MCA. The Department argues that it \u201clacked the information necessary to make a determination on central assessment before its audit of Bresnan.\u201d The Department contends that it \u201cperformed unit valuations on Bresnan for tax years 2007-2009\u201d upon discovery of \u201cthe information necessary to make a determination on central assessment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b651 The Department points out that none of our revised assessment cases \u201cinvolve[d] centrally assessed property.\u201d The authority to issue revised assessments is critical because appraisers must \u201cannually test whether a property requires central assessment.\u201d The Department contends that restraint on its ability to \u201cexercise judgment to determine whether the property requires central assessment\u201d would render the Department unable to perform its duty under Montana law. \u00b652 We have defined the contours of revised assessments only twice. We determined first in <em>Evans Products Co. v. Missoula Cnty., </em>201 Mont. 337, 342, 654 P.2d 523, 526 (1982), that \u201ca clerical error falls under the plain language meaning of \u2018erroneous assessment\u2019 as it is used in section 15-8-601, MCA <em>.\u2019\u2019Evans Products, </em>201 Mont, at 342,654 P.2d at 526. We further noted that \u201c[t]he bulk of authority and prior Montana case law suggest that appraisal, the setting of market value, is an integral part of the taxation process.\u201d <em>Evans Products, </em>201 Mont, at 343,654 P.2d at 526. This Court analyzed revised assessments more recently in <em>Kruse v. Cascade Cnty., </em>244 Mont. 126, 796 P.2d 568 (1990). We clarified in <em>Kruse </em>that \u201c[pjroperty which has not been fully taxed according to appropriate tax procedures may be properly reassessed.\u201d <em>Kruse, </em>244 Mont, at 129, 796 P.2d at 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u00b653 Neither <em>Evans Products, </em>nor <em>Kruse, </em>specifically examined revised assessments in the context of property that must be assessed centrally. <em>Evans Products </em>and <em>Kruse </em>make clear, however, that \u00a7 15-8-601, MCA, allows the Department to reassess property that has not been taxed fully according to appropriate tax procedures. <em>Evans Products, </em>201 Mont, at 343, 654 P.2d at 526; <em>Kruse, </em>244 Mont, at 129, 796 p.2d at 570. Unit valuation involves a specific type of appraisal. Appraisal represents an \u201cintegral part of the taxation process.\u201d <em>Evans Products, </em>201 Mont, at 343,654 P.2d at 526. The Department logically possesses the authority under \u00a7 15-8-601, MCA, to reassess property subject to central assessment when the Department determines that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>property has not been taxed fully according to appropriate tax procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">\u00b654 The Department must \u201cdiscover\u201d property that has escaped assessment before it has authority to issue a revised assessment. Section 15-8-601(b), MCA. Many taxpayers in Montana, including Bresnan, self-report their assets into different assessment classes. A more thorough look at the taxpayer\u2019s property through an audit constitutes the only vehicle for the Department to \u201cdiscover\u201d property that has escaped assessment when the taxpayer self-reports. The Department completed its audit of Bresnan in 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u00b655 The Department\u2019s audit revealed that Bresnan should be classified properly as a class thirteen \u201ctelecommunication services provider.\u201d This reclassification resulted in Bresnan being subject to central assessment. The audit further revealed past improper classification of property on the part of Bresnan. This improper classification apparently arose through Bresnan\u2019s self-reporting of its assets. The historic improper classification of Bresnan\u2019s property represents property that escaped full taxation according to appropriate tax procedures. Section 15-8-601(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u00b656 The Department\u2019s audit determined that Bresnan\u2019s allocations of percentages of its property as cable, data, or voice failed to \u201cappropriately represent the operations ofthe segments.\u201dThe property that Bresnan had classified as \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d property contained only that property dedicated exclusively to voice service. Bresnan had cl\u00e1ssified the remaining lion\u2019s share of its property as \u201ccable television services.\u201d This substantially larger portion included any property that involved cable or data in any way. The audit found that \u201c[ujsing this methodology [Bresnan\u2019s] [c]able operations are overstated and [t]elephony is understated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">\u00b657 Kory Hofland (Hofland) worked as the unit manager of centrally assessed and industrial properties at the Department. Bresnan deposed Hofland. Hofland described property that had not been taxed fully. Hofland identified that Bresnan had limited its property that would be assessed centrally by \u201conly reporting [to class thirteen] property of a receiver of [Bresnan\u2019s] services that only had telephony.\u201d Hofland explained that \u201c[i]f that recipient subscribed to telephony and [i]nternet, they weren\u2019t [reported] in the telephony portion.\u201d Hofland similarly explained that \u201c[i]f they subscribed to telephony and cable, they weren\u2019t in [Bresnan\u2019s telephony reporting].\u201d Hofland expressed further concerns about Bresnan\u2019s lack of backup to \u201caudited financial data\u201d with regard to Bresnan\u2019s historic reporting arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>\u00b658 The Department\u2019s audit of Bresnan and Hofland\u2019s testimony indicate that the audit of Bresnan enabled the Department to discover property that had not been taxed fully according to appropriate tax procedures. The Department reclassified Bresnan as a class thirteen telecommunication services provider, subject to central assessment, in order to value the full property taxes due on Bresnan\u2019s property. Section 15-8-601, MCA, grants the Department the authority to issue a revised assessment of Bresnan in order to capture the value of property that has not been taxed fully according to appropriate tax procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\u00b659  Bresnan challenges the Department\u2019s decision to issue a revised assessment as the result of a \u201cchange in assessor judgment.\u201d Evidence in the record directly contradicts Bresnan\u2019s argument. The Department\u2019s discovery and subsequent reclassification arose from the audit\u2019s revelation of inaccuracies in Bresnan\u2019s self-classification. We decline to characterize the discovery of property that has not been taxed fully according to appropriate tax procedures due to a misclassification on the taxpayer\u2019s part as a mere \u201cchange in assessor judgment.\u201d We will not presume Bresnan\u2019s bad faith in self-allocation. We similarly will not tie the Department\u2019s hands simply because it discovered the improper classification through an audit when the taxpayer self-reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u00b660 We reverse the decision of the District Court. We remand and direct the District Court to enter a judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b68-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b68-7\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AU\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">\u00b661 The Court eschews any attempt to analyze the extensive record evidence and instead relies heavily on the presumption that because Bresnan provides some telecommunications services, nearly all of its property can be assessed by the Department under class thirteen. I believe that the Court has disregarded the plain wording and intent of Montana\u2019s property classification statutes and failed to properly apply the \u201cphysical attributes\u201d and \u201cuse and productivity\u201d tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">\u00b662 The proper application of these tests results in companies being taxed under multiple property classes, depending on the use of their property. The District Court extensively analyzed and entered findings about this system, including the property tax classifications applied to companies such as Montana Dakota Utilities, Northwestern Energy, Avista Corporation, Portland General Corporation, and Yellowstone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Valley Electric Cooperative, all of which are taxed in multiple classes. More specifically, regarding the telecommunications industry, the District Court found that \u2018\u2018[telecommunications companies that report for central assessment under Class Thirteen also report and are assessed locally for certain of their Montana property under Class Eight, including Sprint Nextel, Qwest, and CenturyTel.\u201d The court found that the Cable &amp; Communications Corporation, a company that provides cellular telephone and cable television services, \u201creports its cellular telephone properties for central assessment under Class Thirteen while reporting its cable television properties for local assessment under Class Eight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">\u00b663 Regarding Bresnan, the District Court found from the extensive evidence presented that \u201c[o]ver 97% of Bresnan\u2019s Montana bandwidth is used exclusively for the one-way transmission of video programming.\u201d Further, \u201c[s]tate-wide, 917 [of Bresnan\u2019s] channels were devoted exclusively to the one-way transmission of video programming, while 26 channels were devoted to voice/data, and 28 channels were used for Video-on-demand (which also is one-way video transmission).\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To summarize its lengthy findings, the court found that Bresnan\u2019s properties \u201cprimarily were and are used to provide the one-way transmission to subscribers of video programming.\u201d The District Court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence and have not been overturned. The Court\u2019s approach is simply to assume that because Bresnan has telecommunications capabilities, the Department is authorized to tax nearly all of its property under class thirteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u00b664 Turning to the statutes, we are to start with the principle that \u201c[t]ax statutes must be construed in favor of the taxpayer.\u201d <em>Omimex, </em>\u00b6 25. The statutes make clear that holding commercial property that facilitates the two-way transmission of voice, image, and data qualifies an entity as a telecommunications services company. <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-53-129(10)(a), MCA (\u201cRetail telecommunications\u201d means \u201cthe two-way transmission of voice, image, data, or other information over wire, cable, fiber optics, microwave, radio, satellite, or similar facilities that originates or terminates in this state\u201d). Indeed, the Court correctly notes that by definition, \u201c[a] \u2018telecommunications services provider\u2019 offers retail telecommunications services.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 36 (citing \u00a7 15-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>53-129(14), MCA). Because Bresnan holds some two-way telephony and internet property, it operates, in part, as a telecommunications company. However, the Court gets sidetracked by then deducing that \u00a7 15-6-156(l)(d), MCA, allows the Department to classify nearly all of Bresnan\u2019s property under class thirteen, Opinion, \u00b6 40, when in reality, only some of that property-a very small fraction of it-actually facilitates the two-way transmission of voice, image, and data.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u00b665 The statute does not require that <em>all property </em>of a telecommunications services company is to be taxed under class thirteen. By allowing the Department to tax Bresnan\u2019s one-way property under class thirteen, the Court disregards the basic premise of our property classification system-different types of property are taxed in different classes. <em>N. Pac. Ry. v. Sanders Co., </em>66 Mont. 608, 615-16, 214 P. 596, 599 (1923) (determining \u201c[cjlassification must be based upon substantial distinctions which make one class really different from another.\u201d); <em>see </em>\u00a7 15-6-101(2), MCA. The Legislature made a conscious decision to tax cable television systems at a 3% rate under class eight, \u00a7 15-6-138(l)(k), MCA, and telecommunications services property at a 6% rate under class thirteen, \u00a7 15-6-156(l)(d), MCA. We should not permit the Department to ignore this distinction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consistent with the classification system as a whole and the duty to construe the statutes in favor of the taxpayer, only property that actually meets the definition of telecommunications services property should be so classified. Thus, the statutes require an apportionment of taxes between Bresnan\u2019s two-way transmission property-which demarcates a telecommunications services company in the first place-and its predominately one-way cable television property.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b666 The Court\u2019s determination that the \u201clegislature intended to include all other property that a telecommunications services provider owns in class thirteen,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 41, does great harm to not only Bresnan, but potentially to the property tax system as a whole. This holding runs directly counter to the property classification structure and to the manner in which telecommunications companies-and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>companies-are actually taxed. For example, class nine property includes \u201callocations for centrally assessed natural gas distribution utilities ....\u201d Section 15-6-141(l)(d), MCA. Under the Court\u2019s analysis, this language would necessarily incorporate all properties of natural gas distribution utilities into this class and tax them at a 12% rate, <em>see </em>\u00a7 15-6-141(2). Clearly, this is not the case, as other utility property, such as \u201cair and water pollution control equipment,\u201d is classified under class five and taxed at a rate of 3%. <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-6-135(l)(b), (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">\u00b667 Moreover, the Court fails to apply our use and productivity test with any precision. During oral argument, Bresnan analogized its property to a superhighway consisting of800 lanes. 796 of these lanes are filled bumper-to-bumper with trucks travelling one way, 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. The remaining 4 lanes contain cars travelling two ways. These cars do not move all the time, only sporadically. The trucks in this analogy represent Bresnan\u2019s one-way cable television property. The cars represent Bresnan\u2019s two-way telecommunications services property. Accordingly, after making extensive findings, the District Court determined that the overwhelming use of Bresnan\u2019s property is one-way transmission that receives and amplifies television broadcast signals. The Court\u2019s wholesale reliance on the Department\u2019s audit does not render these findings clearly erroneous-M. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6) requires that we \u201cgive due regard to the trial court\u2019s opportunity to judge the witnesses\u2019 credibility.\u201d Both parties\u2019 experts testified that Bresnan operates a cable television system. Class eight property includes \u201ccable television systems,\u201d \u00a7 15-6-138( l)(k), MCA, which by definition \u201creceiveG and amplif[y] the signals broadcast by one or more television stations.\u201d Section 35-18-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u00b668 The Court sidesteps the hard work of analyzing the record evidence, declining \u201cto parse the number and type of electrical data signals that Bresnan transmits over its network or the allocations of the network\u2019s physical elements ....\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 40. However, nothing could be more indicative of a network\u2019s use than the number and type of data signals actually being transmitted over it. In sum, the Court claims to be classifying property on the basis of use, Opinion \u00b6\u00b6 31,34, 40, but ultimately fails to do so by allowing the Department to place nearly all of Bresnan\u2019s property into class thirteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\u00b669 Bresnan has been changing the services it provides from cable television to telecommunications services. Consistent therewith, Bresnan has been reporting those changes, listing properties that are utilized for telecommunications services under class thirteen. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>However, the Department of Revenue got up one morning and decided to flip the entire company into class thirteen, thereby increasing Bresnan\u2019s taxes by an incredible 329% overnight, from $1.7 million to $7.3 million, even though the overwhelmingly predominant use of Bresnan\u2019s property is for class eight purposes. This disincentive for companies to expand their telecommunications services was not created or intended by the Legislature, but is the work of the Department. It should be called highway robbery-perhaps the first case of information superhighway robbery by the tax authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b670 I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b72-5\">JUSTICE McKINNON joins in the dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-6\"> \u201cAnalog electronic communication long has been measured in \u201cbandwidth\u201d in units of MegaHertz (\u201cMHz\u201d).
