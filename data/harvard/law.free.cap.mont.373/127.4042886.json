On December 21, 2001, Dr. Harper treated Mrs. Darleen Anderson (Darleen) by placing a graft in her arm, also known as a \u201cfistula,\u201d to facilitate kidney dialysis. Darleen\u2019s graft began to scab over in July, 2008, and the scab slowly expanded in size. On January 11, 2009, the scab ruptured and Darleen bled to death. Steve Anderson and Pamela Murphy, as personal representatives of Darleen\u2019s estate (the Andersons), filed this action against Dr. Harper.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">\u00b64 At trial, the Andersons presented testimony from an expert witness and board certified vascular surgeon, Dr. Willis Wagner (Dr. Wagner). Dr. Wagner testified that he would have revised the graft upon seeing the scab. Dr. Harper presented testimony from Dr. Charles Swannack (Dr. Swannack), a board certified general surgeon who had performed dialysis grafts and graft revisions in the past. When settling jury instructions, the Andersons sought an instruction that Dr. Harper should be held to the standard of care of a board certified vascular surgeon, rather than a general surgeon. The District Court refused the Andersons\u2019 instruction on the grounds that no evidence had been presented to justify a heightened standard of care. The Andersons also objected to Dr. Harper\u2019s proposed instruction that \u201cthe mere fact of injury, standing alone, is not proof of negligence against the defendant in a malpractice action.\u201d The Andersons\u2019 objection was overruled and the instruction was given by the court. The Andersons now seek a new trial on the grounds that the District Court abused its discretion in refusing their instruction on the standard of care, and in giving the \u201cmere fact of injury\u201d instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\u00b65 We review jury instructions for an abuse of discretion. <em>Williams v. United Fidelity Life Ins. Co., </em>2005 MT 273, \u00b6 46, 329 Mont. 158, 123 P.3d 213; <em>Christofferson v. City of Great Falls, </em>2003 MT 189, \u00b6 9, 316 Mont. 469, 74 P.3d 1021. In reviewing whether a particular jury instruction was properly given or refused, we consider the instruction in its entirety, as well as in connection with the other instructions given and with the evidence introduced at trial. <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 46; <em>Christofferson, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\u00b66 The Andersons argue that the District Court erred by refusing to give their proposed jury instruction regarding the standard of care applicable to Dr. Harper. Although the Andersons never specifically objected to Dr. Harper\u2019s contrary instruction, they argue that they preserved the issue under M. R. Civ. P. 51(d)(1)(B) when they requested their contrary instruction and it was rejected by the District Court. Dr. Harper counters that the Andersons stipulated to the very instruction they now contest and that this made the instruction \u201cthe law of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">\u00b67 Dr. Harper\u2019s \u201claw of the case\u201d theory is inapposite to the present issues. Montana cases invoking the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine all pertain to instructions actually given by the court. <em>See Selzer v. Morton, </em>2007 MT 62, \u00b6\u00b6 144-45, 336 Mont. 225, 154 P.3d 561; <em>State v. Crawford, </em>2002 MT 117, \u00b6\u00b6 25-27, 310 Mont. 18, 48 P.3d 706; <em>DeBruycker v. Guaranty Natl. Ins. Co., </em>266 Mont. 294, 301, 880 P.2d 819, 823 (1994). We find no authority holding that stipulated instructions are automatically precluded from future objection during the actual settling of instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">\u00b68  We now examine whether the District Court abused its discretion in refusing the Andersons\u2019 instruction. It is a matter of law for the court to determine the proper standard of care applicable to the case and instruct the jury on that standard. <em>Aasheim v. Humberger, </em>215 Mont. 127, 129, 695 P.2d 824, 826-27 (1985). A doctor\u2019s standard of care towards a patient is judged against \u201cthe skill and learning possessed by other doctors in good standing practicing in the same specialty and who hold the same national board certification.\u201d <em>Aasheim, </em>215 Mont. at 130, 695 P.2d at 826-27. It is the plaintiffs burden to establish the standard of professional care in a medical malpractice case. <em>Gilkey v. Schweitzer, </em>1999 MT 188, \u00b6 17, 295 Mont. 345, 983 P.2d 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">\u00b69  The Andersons\u2019 proposed instruction No. 3 provides: \u201cA doctor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>who performs professional services which should be performed by a specialist has a duty to use the care and skill of a specialist in that field of medicine.\u201d In refusing the instruction, the District Court noted that it \u201cdidn\u2019t hear any dispute or evidence\u201d concerning whether the surgery should have been performed by a specialist board certified vascular surgeon. Our review of the record confirms this absence. Even the Andersons\u2019 expert, a board certified vascular surgeon, never testified that the creation and management of a fistula required a vascular surgeon nor did he testify that Dr. Harper was acting outside of his specialty when caring for Darleen. The court also found that Dr. Harper was \u201cperforming the very same kind of surgery\u201d described in the testimony of Dr. Swannack, \u201cwho is not a board certified vascular surgeon; he is a board certified surgeon... .\u201d We conclude that the District Court acted well within its discretion in refusing the Andersons\u2019 proposed instruction on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\u00b610 The Andersons also objected to Defendant\u2019s Proposed Instruction No. 3. That instruction reads, in relevant part: \u201cThe mere fact of injury, standing alone, is not proof of negligence against the defendant in a malpractice action.\u201d The Andersons claim that the use of the word \u201cmere\u201d was argumentative and unduly prejudicial to their position at trial. We have previously found this instruction to be proper in professional negligence actions. <em>Juedeman v. Montana Deaconess Medical Ctr., </em>223 Mont. 311, 321, 726 P.2d 301, 307 <em>(1986); Hunsaker v. Bozeman Deaconess Foundation, </em>179 Mont. 305, 329, 588 P.2d 493, 507 (1978). The Andersons address neither of these cases in their brief to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\u00b611  Instead, the Andersons rely on a case wherein the South Dakota Supreme Court found prejudice in an instruction defining medical negligence as an \u201cerror in judgment.\u201d <em>Papke v. Harbert, </em>738 N.W.2d 510 (S.D. 2007). But that decision singled out only \u201cerror in judgment\u201d as prejudicial, and further noted that \u201ccourts are still permitted to instruct a jury that the fact that an unfortunate or bad condition resulted to the patient does not alone prove that the defendant was negligent.\u201d <em>Papke, </em>738 N.W.2d at 527, n. 15. (internal quotations omitted). Thus, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in approving Dr. Harper\u2019s proposed instruction No. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">\u00b612 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b154-8\">JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
