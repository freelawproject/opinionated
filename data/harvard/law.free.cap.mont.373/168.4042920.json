We affirm and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\">\u00b62 After years of complying with his monthly child support obligation, Kenck, who was serving in the U. S. military, agreed via counsel to an increase in his monthly support obligation. The increase was applied retroactively to the date the request for an increase was filed by the child\u2019s mother, creating an administrative arrearage of several months in Kenck\u2019s account. Kenck arranged to pay off the arrearage with increased deductions from his military pay. Nonetheless, CSED reported the arrearage to the national consumer credit reporting agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b63 Upon completing active duty with the U. S. Air Force (USAF), Kenck was provisionally hired by U. S. Department of Homeland Security but the offer of employment was withdrawn when TSA discovered the credit report indicating that Kenck\u2019s child support was delinquent. After other prospective law enforcement employers cited the same reason for rejecting him as an otherwise qualified candidate, Kenck filed this action against CSED and Lori Fleming, regional manager for the Billings CSED office, for its erroneous report to the credit agencies. The District Court dismissed all claims against CSED and Fleming under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (Rule 12(b)(6)). Kenck appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b64 A restatement of the dispositive issue on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">\u00b65 Did the District Court err in dismissing Kenck\u2019s claims against CSED and Fleming?</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">\u00b66 Christopher Kenck is the biological father of a child born in May 2003. Shortly after the child\u2019s birth, Kenck joined the United States Air Force and regularly sent money to the child\u2019s mother for support. In June 2004, the couple split and in September 2004, CSED established a child support account for Kenck and ordered him to pay $186/month in child support. Kenck agreed and provided CSED with the necessary information to allow the military to withhold child support payments from his military wages. This State-calculated monthly support amount was slightly higher than the amount Kenck had been paying; therefore, the retroactive application of the new amount caused an administrative arrearage that Kenck paid. Kenck also put the child on his military medical insurance plan. There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>nothing in the record to suggest Kenck was ever late with his payments. To the contrary, he has consistently provided monthly support for his child-even at times when he was not under a State order.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u00b67 In March 2008, the child\u2019s mother petitioned the State for a child support increase. Kenck, who was serving in Iraq at the time, was not notified of the requested increase in support until a later date. However, in August 2008 when Kenck was stateside on leave, he went to the Billings CSED office and, without objection, accepted service of the modification request. Following an October 2008 administrative hearing in which Kenck was represented by counsel, CSED raised Kenck\u2019s monthly child support obligation from $186/month to $458/month. The State retroactively applied the increased obligation which resulted in an administrative arrearage of approximately $1,200 in Kenck\u2019s child support account. Again Kenck paid the increased monthly payments directly from his military wages. He also agreed to pay off the administrative arrearage in accordance with State law by paying 1/24 of the debt per month.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There was no discussion at the administrative hearing of CSED notifying the national credit reporting agencies of the arrearage. However, CSED subsequently reported the arrearage in his account to the consumer credit reporting agencies, listing it as a bad debt and delinquent child support. Kenck acknowledges that around this time, he received a notice letter from CSED that he did not fully -understand, but he did not follow up with the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b68 Kenck completed his active duty service on July 7, 2009, and moved to Washington, where he joined the Washington Air National Guard. Shortly thereafter he obtained a copy of his credit report and discovered the entry of the child support delinquency. Kenck contacted CSED and verbally contested the accuracy of the delinquency reporting. Subsequently, and with the assistance of his counsel, he obtained a letter from CSED\u2019s Legal Services Bureau Chief dated August 3,2009. In this letter, CSED\u2019s attorney explained that Kenck\u2019s arrearage \u201carose by reason of law\u201d and that Kenck had \u201cfaithfully\u201d paid his child support obligation. The letter further stated that the arrearage \u201cwas not caused by any failure of Mr. Kenck to pay his ordered child support obligation,\u201d and that Kenck was \u201cretiring\u201d the arrearage by monthly payments of l/24th of the total \u201cin accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>with Montana law.\u201d CSED\u2019s legal counsel also agreed to take steps in an effort to have the delinquency removed from the consumer reporting agencies\u2019 records. Either no such steps were taken or they were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\">\u00b69 Subsequently, believing the matter was resolved, Kenck sought employment with U. S. Department of Homeland Security as a TSA agent in Washington. After passing the necessary tests and being provisionally hired, TSA withdrew its offer of employment based upon a credit report indicating that Kenck\u2019s child support was in arrears. He was also told by recruiters from the Seattle Police Department and other local agencies that delinquent child support was an automatic disqualification for employment. Kenck subsequently filed this action against CSED and CSED\u2019s Billings\u2019 office regional manager, Lori Fleming.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u00b610 Kenck asserted both federal and state claims against CSED and Fleming. He argued that the agency\u2019s reporting to the credit agencies of an arrearage that arose through no fault of his own and resulted in the denial of employment opportunities with governmental law enforcement agencies was a violation of his federal rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. He also claimed CSED violated certain mandatory provisions of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA), 50 U.S.C. app. \u00a7\u00a7 501-597.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u00b611 Kenck further alleged under common law that CSED defamed him, acted with malice, invaded his privacy by placing his child support payment history in a false light, and intentionally and negligently inflicted emotional distress upon him. He also claimed CSED violated his State constitutional rights provided in Article II, sections 10, 17 and 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b612 The District Court, in an Order dated December 27, 2012, dismissed Fleming from the action holding that she had statutory immunity from liability arising from actions taken during the course and scope of her employment. Relying on Rule 12(b)(6), the court also dismissed all of Kenck\u2019s claims against CSED with the exception of his claim that CSED violated the SCRA. The court requested additional briefing on this issue and then dismissed it as well. Kenck appeals these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">\u00b613 A district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) is reviewed as an issue of law to determine whether it is correct. This Court will construe the complaint in a light most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>favorable to the plaintiff, deeming all factual allegations to be true. This Court will affirm the dismissal only if it finds that the plaintiff is not entitled to relief under any set of facts that could be proven in support of the claims. <em>Fellows v. Office of Water </em>Comm\u2019r, 2012 MT 169, \u00b6 11, 365 Mont. 540, 285 P.3d 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b614 <em>Did the District Court err in dismissing Kenck\u2019s claims against CSED and Fleming?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u00b615 This case is complicated and confounded by the interplay of state and federal child support statues and guidelines, state and federal credit reporting statutes, and lastly by the fact that Kenck was serving in the United States military at the time his arrearage was reported by CSED to credit reporting agencies, thus invoking the provisions of the SCRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u00b616 On appeal Kenck asserts the District Court erred in concluding: (1) he was \u201cdelinquent\u201d in his child support obligation; (2) he had no private right of action for violations under SCRA; (3) that violation of the SCRA was not a violation of a federal right for purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; and (4) his state constitutional claims were preempted by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Kenck also argues that the District Court erred by not viewing his Complaint in a manner most favorable to him as required by Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">\u201cDelinquent\u201d child support</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">\u00b617 Kenck argued to the District Court and to this Court on appeal that despite the existence of an administrative arrearage, he was not delinquent in his child support. Consequently, CSED should not have reported him to the credit reporting agencies or seized his income tax refund. The District Court concluded, based upon applicable federal statutes, that Kenck\u2019s administrative arrearage constituted \u201coverdue support\u201d and CSED was authorized to report this to the credit reporting agencies under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-l and \u00a7 40-5-261, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AqL4\">\u00b618 As noted above, when CSED increased Kenck\u2019s monthly child support obligation, it imposed the increased obligation retroactively creating an immediate administrative arrearage of approximately $1,200 in Kenck\u2019s account. Kenck acknowledges the agency\u2019s right to impose the increased amount retroactively under \u00a7 40-5-226(3)(c), MCA. Kenck also does not dispute that CSED has the authority to report child support account information to national consumer reporting agencies. Specifically, \u00a7 40-5-261(1), MCA, authorizes the department to \u201cmake information about a support debt available to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>consumer reporting agencies... upon request.\u201d Kenck argues, however, that an administrative arrearage is not a delinquency. He maintains that by voluntarily reporting his arrearage to credit agencies-which arrearage was construed by prospective employers as a delinquency-CSED effectively destroyed his prospects of being employed by any governmental agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\">\u00b619 As the District Court correctly observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-4\">Montana\u2019s Child Support Enforcement Program is rooted in federal law, specifically Subchapter IV, Part D of the Social Security Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(7)(A) specifically requires the State to periodically report the names of noncustodial parents who are delinquent in the payment of their support and the amount for which they are overdue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">CSED is therefore obligated \u201cto report periodically to consumer reporting agencies ... the name of any noncustodial parent who is <em>delinquent </em>in the payment of support, and the amount of <em>overdue </em>support owed by such parent.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(7)(A) (emphasis added). Moreover, under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-l of the FCRA, a credit bureau is required to include in credit reports information about \u201coverdue\u201d child support furnished by a State child support enforcement agency. There is thus no question that CSED has the authority and the obligation to report child support delinquencies and that credit bureaus are required to report such delinquencies. However, the question remains whether Kenck\u2019s administrative arrearage constitutes a delinquency or \u201coverdue\u201d child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b620 While Montana\u2019s child support enforcement statutes do address the concept of an \u201carrearage,\u201d (see <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7 40-5-27 l(3)(c)(i), MCA, and \u00a7 40-5-601(6) and (7)(a), MCA), the statutes do not define this term. The term \u201cdelinquency\u201d is defined in \u00a7 40-5-701(2), MCA, as \u201ca support debt or support obligation due under a support order in an amount greater than or equal to 6 months\u2019 support payments as of the date of service of a notice of intent to suspend a license.\u201d However, this definition is pinned to proceedings that are commenced to suspend a license for nonsupport. Moreover, the federal statutes set forth in the Social Security Act that govern child support payments provide no definition of \u201cdelinquent\u201d or \u201cdelinquency.\u201d There is thus surprisingly little statutory guidance on whether an arrearage created by imposition of a retroactive increase in support should properly be construed or reported as overdue child support or a child support delinquency, nor has this Court squarely addressed the issue. We therefore look first to a Montana District Court decision and then to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>federal and other state jurisdictions for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b621 In <em>Albright v. Bemis, </em>1996 Mont. Dist. LEXIS 732, Bemis was ordered by the State of Idaho in September 1994 to pay $166/month in \u201ccurrent\u201d monthly child support beginning December 1993. The Idaho court also ordered Bemis to pay an additional $17,124 (\u201cretroactive child support\u201d) in back child support for the period of time between the child\u2019s birth in December 1983 and December 1993 when the \u201ccurrent\u201d obligation was established.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Albright, </em>1996 Mont. Dist. LEXIS 732.</p>\n<p id=\"AR_\">\u00b622 In February 1995, the Montana district court ordered that Bemis pay his current child support and a portion of his retroactive child support through monthly income deductions. The court determined that Bemis should pay 25% of his monthly income toward child support-$166 would be applied to his current obligation and the balance of the amount paid would be applied to the retroactive amount due. Albright challenged this ruling, arguing that Bemis should pay $166/month for current child support and $713.50/month in \u201cdelinquent child support\u201d in order to pay the delinquent debt in full within 24 months in accordance with \u00a7 40-5-309(l)(a), MCA (1995). The district court disagreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">[T]his Court determines that [Albright] mis-characterized in her Petition the $ 17,124.00 child support for 1983 through 1993 as \u201cdelinquent\u201d or \u201cpast due\u201d child support, when in fact the amount represents \u201cretroactive\u201d child support dating back to the time of the child\u2019s birth in December 1983... . Prior to the date of the Idaho judgment, there was no Court ordered child support obligation for the years 1983 through 1993, and [Albright\u2019s] characterization of the judgment amount of $ 17,124.00 as \u201cdelinquent\u201d or \u201cpast due\u201d child support is neither factually, nor legally, sustainable. Rather, the judgment amount of $ 17,124.00 represents \u201cretroactive\u201d child support which did not become due and payable until awarded by the Idaho Court in September 1994, and Sec. 40-5-309(l)(a)(ii), MCA, mandating that any delinquent child support must be paid off within two years does not apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acg\"><em>Albright, </em>1996 Mont. Dist. LEXIS 732. <em>Albright </em>is instructive because the court recognized a distinction between \u201cdelinquent\u201d and \u201cretroactive\u201d arrearages. Kenck, unlike Bemis, agreed to and did pay off his \u201cretroactive\u201d arrearages within 24 months and he does not appeal CSED\u2019s imposition of the deadline set forth in \u00a7 40-5-309, MCA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u00b623 Other courts have recognized a similar distinction between \u201cdelinquent\u201d and \u201carrearage.\u201d In <em>Gladysz v. King, </em>658 N.E.2d 309 (Ohio App. 2nd Dist. 1995), <em>superceded by statute as stated in Turner v. Burley, </em>2005 Ohio App. LEXIS 723 (Ohio App. 10th Dist. 2005), the Ohio court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-3\">We believe that CSEA\u2019s [Child Support Enforcement Agency] argument misconstrues the past-due support obligation to which the federal program applies. Section 644(c)[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>], Title 42, U. S. Code defines \u201cpast-due support\u201d as \u201cthe amount of a delinquency.\u201d As applied to a debt or claim, \u201cdelinquent\u201d means simply \u201cdue and unpaid at the time appointed by law or fixed by contract; as, a delinquent tax.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed. 1979), at 385. Thus, a delinquency is created by a default in performance, not merely by the existence of an outstanding debt. An <em>arrearage </em>for purposes of Ohio Adm. Code Chapter 5101:1-30, therefore, is the amount of a delinquency resulting from the failure of an obligor to pay an amount when it is due according to the terms of a child support order, not simply the amount of a child support debt outstanding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><em>Gladysz, </em>658 N.E.2d at 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b624 In <em>Dep\u2019t. of Revenue v. Cessford, </em>100 So. 3d 1199 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2nd Dist. 2012), the court considered the correctness of the Department of Revenue\u2019s (DOR) interception of Cessford\u2019s federal tax refund to apply to a child support obligation that had been imposed retroactively to the child\u2019s birth. The court order obligating Cessford to pay child support indicated that the retroactive portion of his monthly obligation would be satisfied by paying an additional $30/month. <em>Cessford, </em>100 So. 3d at 1201. DOR subsequently intercepted Cessford\u2019s tax refund and applied the refunded amount of $4,089 to his $5,678 retroactive arrearage. Cessford challenged the DOR and both an administrative officer and the trial court ruled in his favor. <em>Cessford, </em>100 So. 2d at 1201. DOR appealed. In affirming the trial court, the Florida Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">The trial court found that the administrative order of support merely determined a retroactive child support amount and that Cessford was not delinquent in the payment of any court-ordered support. The court further ruled that Cessford was \u201cnot in arrears and is not delinquent\u201d and noted that \u201c[t]he establishment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>retroactive support is not intended to establish arrears, nor is it properly considered a delinquency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\"><em>Cessford, </em>100 So. 2d at 1201. DOR was required to reimburse Cessford. \u00b625 Lastly, in <em>Laub v. Zaslavsky, </em>534 A.2d 1090 (Pa. Super. 1987), the Pennsylvania court was asked to review whether the IRS Intercept Unit for Philadelphia County correctly intercepted Zaslavsky\u2019s federal tax return to apply to \u201cpast-due support\u201d as that term is defined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 664(c). After restating the applicable federal law sections and looking to both Black\u2019s and Webster\u2019s dictionaries, the court turned to cases in the federal courts that had dealt with the federal intercept program to collect delinquent child support. The court concluded, \u201cWe share the view reflected by these federal tribunals and conclude that the federal intercept program does not encompass situations where a parent has continually complied with his child support obligation, but where, nonetheless, arrearages are created as a result of the retroactive effect of an order of support.\u201d <em>Laub, </em>534 A.2d at 1093.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u00b626  We are persuaded by these cases and the reasoning set forth in them. The District Court in the case before us relied upon the definition of \u201coverdue support\u201d codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(e), to conclude that Kenck was delinquent in the payment of child support. That definition begins with the phrase \u201coverdue support means the amount of a delinquency....\u201d (Emphasis added by this Court.) As the above cases reflect, not all past due child support constitutes a \u201cdelinquency\u201d on the part of the obligor. As was the case here, Kenck\u2019s arrearage was the result of an agreement to pay a higher amount of child support to his son retroactive to the date of the child\u2019s mother\u2019s petition for modification. Kenck timely paid these arrearages pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 40-5-309(l)(a)(i)(B), MCA. We conclude this arrearage does not constitute a delinquency or overdue child support, and the District Court erred in concluding otherwise. Having so concluded, however, we are nonetheless unfortunately constrained to uphold the dismissal of Kenck\u2019s Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u00b627 Section 40-5-261, MCA, sets forth the procedures under which CSED makes information available to consumer reporting agencies. According to Subsection (1), \u201cthe Department may make information about a support debt available to consumer reporting agencies ... upon request.\u201d The section further provides that the Department shall provide advance notice to the obligor concerning the proposed release of information, but that \u201clack of actual notice does not preclude the release of information to consumer reporting agencies.\u201d Subsection (2) provides that \u201c[i]f contacted by an obligor wishing to contest the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>accuracy of information proposed for release to consumer reporting agencies,\u201d CSED must conduct a review or a hearing to reevaluate the accuracy of the information. Kenck does not contest that while on active duty he received a notice from CSED of its intent to report his arrearage to credit reporting agencies. Unfortunately, there is no allegation by Kenck nor is there any evidence in the District Court record that Kenck timely contacted CSED after receiving such notice, challenging the action or requesting a hearing. Consequently, Kenck did not avail himself of the statutory and administrative processes for challenging this action by CSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\">\u00b628 It is well established that \u201cno one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted.\u201d The purpose of this \u201cexhaustion doctrine\u201d is to \u201callow a governmental entity to make a factual record and to correct its own errors within its specific expertise before a court interferes.\u201d <em>Shoemaker v. Denke, </em>2004 MT 11, \u00b6 18, 319 Mont. 238, 84 P.3d 4. Because this procedural bar would preclude Kenck from pursuing further legal action against CSED for reporting his arrearage to credit reporting agencies, we decline to remand his complaints against CSED concerning this report. As Kenck could not prevail on his claim that CSED erroneously reported his arrearage as delinquent if the matter was remanded for trial, we decline to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Private right of action under SCRA</p>\n<p id=\"A4G\">\u00b629 Kenck asserts that the District Court erred in rej ecting his private right of action under SCRA. We conclude that whether or not a private right of action under the SCRA would exist in this case-in itself a complicated question-Kenck would nonetheless be procedurally precluded from pursuing his claims- under this Act. 50 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 521 of SCRA (upon which Kenck relies) provides specific methods for servicemembers to challenge, vacate or have default judgments set aside. Kenck received notice of CSED\u2019s intent to report his arrearage to the consumer credit agencies shortly after the October 2008 hearing at which he was represented by counsel. As noted above, he did not timely protest this action. Kenck obtained a credit report shortly after being discharged from the USAF on July 7, 2009. The credit report revealed that his arrearage had been reported as a \u201cdelinquency.\u201d At that time, he visited the Billings CSED office and verbally protested the accuracy of the report, and his counsel requested a written clarification on Kenck\u2019s payment record and the administrative arrearage from CSED counsel. The agency\u2019s attorney agreed and issued a written statement as discussed in \u00b6 8 above. However, it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>not appear that Kenck knew or was informed that under 50 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 521(g)(1) and (2) of the SCRA, he could file an application within 90 days of his discharge from active service to have the default judgment vacated or set aside. It is undisputed that Kenck did not file such an application. As discussed above, Kenck\u2019s failure to avail himself of the prescribed method for obtaining a remedy unfortunately precludes him from doing so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b630 Kenck conceded earlier in the proceeding that his \u00a7 1983 claim against CSED should be dismissed as CSED is not a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1983. To the extent he claims his \u00a7 1983 claim vis-a-vis Fleming should not have been dismissed, Kenck fails to present a legal argument as required by M. R. App. P. 12(l)(h) (Rule 12). Rule 12 states that an appellant must set forth in his or her brief \u201cthe contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes, and pages of the record relied on.\u201d We have held that we will not consider unsupported issues or arguments, and that failure to comply with the rules of appellate procedure is fatal to an appeal; therefore, we decline to further address Kenck\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against Fleming. <em>In re Marriage of McMahon, </em>2002 MT 198, \u00b6 6, 311 Mont. 175, 53 P.3d 1266.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Fair Credit Reporting Act claim</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">\u00b631 Kenck claims that CSED\u2019s report of his administrative arrearage to the consumer credit reporting agencies violated his State Constitutional rights to privacy and due process. Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 17. He argues that these constitutional rights were not preempted by FCRA as the District Court concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">\u00b632 As discussed above, while we agree that Kenck was not delinquent in his child support, we conclude nonetheless that the provisions of FCRA preempt Kenck\u2019s claim. As noted above, states are required to report child support information to credit reporting agencies. Section 40-5-261, MCA, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 666. FCRA mandates that consumer credit reports include the child support information provided by the state agency. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-l. Furthermore, FCRA protects reporting state agencies from liability. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681h. Lastly, FCRA prohibits states from imposing state laws \u201crelating to the responsibilities of persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies\u201d with some inapplicable exceptions. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 168 It. Given that these statutes occupy the field from reporting to protection from liability, we conclude FCRA preempts Kenck\u2019s privacy claim. <em>See Purcell v. Bank of Am., </em>659 F.3d 622 (7th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>\u00b633 We now turn to Kenck\u2019s claim that he was deprived of due process. Under both federal and state jurisprudence the requirements for procedural due process are: (1) notice, and (2) opportunity for a hearing appropriate to the nature of the case. <em>Montanans for Justice v. State, </em>2006 MT 277, \u00b6 30, 334 Mont. 237, 146 P.3d 759. In the case before us, Kenck acknowledged that he was given notice of CSED\u2019s intention to report his administrative arrearage to the consumer reporting agencies. Under both state and federal law, Kenck had the opportunity at several junctures to timely challenge CSED\u2019s action but failed to do so. For these reasons, we conclude Kenck\u2019s constitutional procedural due process rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\">Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of Kenck\u2019s Comnlaint</p>\n<p id=\"Aa\">\u00b634 Having reached the conclusions set forth above, we need not address Kenck\u2019s claim that the District Court erred in dismissing his Complaint by failing to view it in a manner favorable to Kenck as required by Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b635 While being bound by statutory and procedural bars to reach the conclusions we do, we recognize the resulting injustice. A servicemember who has both an exemplary record in the military and an exemplary record in his payment of child support has been branded a \u201cdelinquent\u201d obligor in the eyes of potential employers. Consequently, he has lost significant career opportunities-opportunities that would have benefited his child as well as himself. It appears that CSED had opportunities to help Kenck understand and protect his rights but did not do so. For example, CSED could have implemented \u00a7 40-5-262(3), MCA, allowing it to consider Kenck\u2019s payment record, the availability of other remedies and other matters relevant to determining whether to release the administrative arrearage information to the credit reporting agencies. There is no evidence that it considered this discretionary opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b636 Moreover, Kenck visited the Billings CSED office within days of being discharged from the USAF, contesting the characterization of his child support account as delinquent and the reporting of his arrearage to the consumer reporting companies in the first place. It does not appear that CSED assisted Kenck in understanding what steps he could take to challenge the inaccurate report, nor did it advise him that such actions must be taken within 90 days of his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u00b637 We determined above that Kenck\u2019s arrearage did not constitute a delinquency or overdue child support. Opinion, \u00b6 26. While we cannot resurrect Kenck\u2019s claims for damages, we can and do remand this matter to the District Court with instructions that it direct CSED <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>to provide notice of this Opinion to the credit reporting agencies to whom it reported Kenck\u2019s arrearage, with a request that said agencies remove from their data base any and all reference to Kenck having been in arrears or delinquent in the payment of his child support obligations. We further direct the District Court to monitor CSED\u2019s compliance with this directive, and ensure that Kenck\u2019s counsel is copied with all documents CSED submits to and receives from the credit reporting agencies in its efforts to accomplish this objective. \u00b638 Finally, it is evident that the problem we confront here is occasioned by the fact that there is no distinction made in either the child support or reporting statutes between arrearages and delinquencies. We therefore urge the legislature to address this statutory shortcoming so as to ensure that in the future, an administrative arrearage created by operation of law shall not be reported by CSED to consumer reporting agencies, nor shall it be deemed as delinquent or overdue child support for any reporting purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b639 Affirmed'and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b204-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-6\"> Section 40-5-309(l)(a)(i)(B), MCA, requires that an outstanding child support debt be paid within 24 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b198-6\"> The parties disputed whether the father knew of the child\u2019s birth before July 1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b199-7\"> This is an incorrect statutory reference.
