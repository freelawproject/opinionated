He appeals, arguing that the District Court erred in instructing the jury on the elements of the offense prior to the delivery of opening statements. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issue on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court err in instructing the jury on the elements of the offense prior to opening statements ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">\u00b64 On November 4, 2010, Missoula County Sheriff Detective Jon Gunter (Gunter) observed a man, later identified as Otto, leave the Big Sky Medical Marijuana Dispensary and enter a vehicle. A short time later, Gunter saw the vehicle\u2019s driver smoking from a pipe while driving. Gunter initiated a stop. He smelled marijuana as he approached the vehicle. Three individuals were in the car: the driver, Jordan Lambert, the front-seat passenger, Samantha Lambert, and Otto. Otto had a medical marijuana card, but the others did not. Gunter determined that Otto had purchased medical marijuana at the dispensary and then shared it with the Lamberts. Upon learning that Otto was on felony probation, Gunter contacted Otto\u2019s probation officer, who authorized a probation violation hold on Otto. Otto was subsequently taken into custody and searched. Otto had two small bags of marijuana and a glass pipe in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">\u00b65 Otto was charged with criminal distribution of dangerous drugs, a felony. On March 30, 2011, Otto\u2019s case proceeded to trial. After the District Court read the standard preliminary instructions to the jury, the State requested that the court also read the instructions setting out the elements of the offense, Instructions 21 and 22. The Instructions provided that \u201c[a] person commits the offense of criminal distribution of dangerous drugs if he purposely or knowingly exchanges or gives away the dangerous drug marijuana,\u201d and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8I\">[t]o convict the Defendant of criminal distribution of dangerous drugs, the State must prove the following elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-10\">1. That the Defendant did exchange or give away the dangerous drug marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-11\">AND</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-12\">2. That the Defendant acted purposely or knowingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-13\">If you find from your consideration of the evidence that each of these elements have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>you should find the Defendant guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\">If, on the other hand, you find from your consideration of the evidence that either of these elements has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt then you should find the Defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZR\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b66 The court agreed to read the instructions, stating: \u201cI believe that upon request, that\u2019s appropriate and probably is helpful to the jury because they know, then, what the issues are that they should be looking for in the case.\u201d Otto\u2019s counsel first objected to the language of the instructions as \u201ca dumbed-down version of what the offense is.\u201d The prosecutor responded that the instructions \u201csimply parse out the unnecessary language and actually help the jury focus on what the real issue is.\u201d The court overruled Otto\u2019s objection, concluding that jury instructions should correspond with the facts of a specific case. Otto\u2019s counsel then raised an objection because \u201cthis gives undue influence over the other instructions that are normally read as a group, rather than emphasiz[ing] that one unduly.\u201d The court likewise overruled this objection, stating that \u201cI am aware that other judges do this, and I think it\u2019s helpful to the jury.\u201d The court subsequently read Instructions 21 and 22 before the State\u2019s opening statement. Although the remaining instructions were read at the close of the evidence, the foregoing two instructions were not reread to the jury. The jury found Otto guilty of criminal distribution of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b67 Otto filed a timely appeal. On appeal, Otto argues that the District Court erred and prejudicially affected Otto\u2019s substantial rights by reading Instructions 21 and 22 prior to opening statements without finding good cause as required by \u00a7 46-16-402, MCA. The State counters that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it read the instructions before opening statements, and that Otto\u2019s substantial rights were not prejudicially affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s decision pertaining to jury instructions for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Christiansen, </em>2010 MT 197, \u00b6 7, 357 Mont. 379, 239 P.3d 949 (citation omitted). To constitute reversible error, jury instructions must prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. E.M.R., </em>2013 MT 3, \u00b6 16, 368 Mont. 179, 292 P.3d 451 (citing <em>Christiansen, </em>\u00b6 7; quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court err in instructing the jury on the elements of the offense prior to opening statements ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b610 The order of a trial is established by statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">(1) After the jury is sworn but before the introduction of any evidence, the court may give the jury general instructions concerning the conduct of the trial. The court shall give the jury such cautionary instructions as may be required during the course of the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">(2) The prosecutor may make an opening statement and shall offer evidence in support of the prosecution. The defendant may make an opening statement prior to the prosecutor\u2019s offer of evidence or at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case but prior to the defendant\u2019s offer of evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">(3) The prosecutor and the defendant may, respectively, offer rebutting testimony only. However, the court, for good cause, may permit either party to offer evidence upon the original case at any time before the close of evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">(4) Prior to final arguments, the court shall inform the parties as to the instructions that will be given and read them to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">(5) A written copy of the instructions, both general and special, must be delivered to the jury for its consideration during deliberations following the final arguments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">Section 46-16-401, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">\u00b611 \u201cFor good cause shown and in the discretion of the court, the order prescribed in 46-16-401 may be departed from.\u201d Section 46-16-402, MCA. \u201cIt has long been the rule in Montana that the order in which proof is admitted at the trial is within the sound discretion of the trial court... and that the usual order of trial may be departed from in the proper case.\u201d <em>State v. Snaric, </em>262 Mont. 62, 69, 862 P.2d 1175, 1179 (1993) (citation omitted); <em>See State v. Hocevar, </em>2000 MT 157, \u00b6 76, 300 Mont. 167, 7 P.3d 329 (\u201c[Departing from the usual order of trial and permitting the State to reopen its case-in-chief is left to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">\u00b612 Preliminary instructions on the law are appropriate in some cases. For example, we held that they were proper in <em>State v. </em>McKenzie, 186 Mont. 481, 508, 608 P.2d 428, 445 (1980) (overruled in part on other grounds), a complex case in which the defendant was convicted of deliberate homicide by means of torture and aggravated kidnapping and was sentenced to death. <em>McKenzie, </em>186 Mont. at 488, 608 P.2d at 434. We noted that \u201c[i]n a less complex case which was not based only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>on circumstantial evidence, such preliminary instructions might not be necessary and there would not be the required good reasons for varying the usual order of the trial.\u201d <em>McKenzie, </em>186 Mont. 508-09, 608 P.2d at 445. In the instant case, there was only one charge, and the evidence was testimonial. The State told the jury it was a \u201csimple\u201d and \u201cpretty clear-cut\u201d case. Though a district court has broad discretion to change the trial order, we conclude that there was no \u201cgood cause shown\u201d to do so here, as this is exactly the type of \u201cless complex case\u201d envisioned in <em>McKenzie.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\u00b613 Otto maintains that the effect of the District Court\u2019s ruling was to permit the prosecutor to inject argument into his opening statement. Otto argues that \u201c[t]he variance in the order of instructing the jury during trial allowed the prosecutor to focus the jury on argument at the outset of the case and to qualitatively assess the State\u2019s case as clear-cut, instead of requiring the prosecutor to outline the evidence that was going to be presented and informing the jury the State was going to meet its burden of proof.\u201d In his opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury that \u201c[t]he judge just instructed you that a person commits the offense of distribution of dangerous drugs if he exchanges or gives away the illegal drug marijuana,\u201d and that \u201c[ajfter you\u2019ve heard all the evidence, I\u2019m going to come back and ask you to find him guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b614 The scope of an opening statement is limited. \u201c[U]nder Section 25-7-301, MCA, either counsel may briefly state his or her case and the evidence he or she expects to introduce to support the same, and to refer in opening statements to evidence to be adduced, if those statements are made in good faith and with reasonable ground to believe the evidence is admissible.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Fitzgerald v. Dist. Ct., </em>217 Mont. 106, 121-22, 703 P.2d 148, 158 (1985). \u201cIt is improper to expound or argue legal theories or to attempt to instruct the jury as to the law of the case\u201d in an opening statement. <em>State v. Martinez, </em>188 Mont. 271, 285, 613 P.2d 974, 982 (1980) (citation omitted). In previous cases challenging improper remarks made by counsel during trial, \u201cthis Court has warned the prosecution and discussed the risk of reversal in the event the prosecution makes improper comments either in opening statements or in witness examinations.\u201d <em>State v. Mix, </em>239 Mont. 351, 356, 781 P.2d 751, 754 (1989) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u00b615  Errors injury instructions or alleged prosecutorial misconduct constitute reversible error only when they prejudicially affect a defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Christiansen, </em>\u00b6 7 (citation omitted); <em>State v. Aker, </em>2013 MT 253, \u00b6 24, 371 Mont. 491, 310 P.3d 506 (\u201cWe do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>not presume prejudice from the alleged prosecutorial misconduct; rather, the \u2018defendant must show that the argument violated his substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d). In this case, there was no such prejudice. The instructions accurately set out the elements of the offense, and while the prosecutor referenced the legal instructions, he did not otherwise engage in legal argument in his opening statement. Further, the jury was properly instructed that the State had the burden of proving the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence submitted by the State, including the testimony of the witnesses, clearly established Otto\u2019s guilt. <em>See e.g. </em>Tr. Trans. 115:6-7 (March 30, 2011) (Jordan Lambert testified that Otto shared the marijuana with him.). Given these circumstances, we conclude that, though the District Court erred in reading the instructions before opening statements, Otto\u2019s substantial rights were not prejudicially affected by the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\u00b616 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b414-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
