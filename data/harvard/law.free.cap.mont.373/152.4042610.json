Calvert (Calvert) with a fourth offense of driving under the influence of alcohol, a felony. The District Court for the Eighteenth Judicial District, Gallatin County, denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Calvert\u2019s motion to dismiss the felony charge, and Calvert subsequently pled guilty, reserving the right to appeal the District Court\u2019s ruling. We restate Calvert\u2019s sole issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"A4i\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err by denying Calvert\u2019s motion to dismiss the felony DUI charge on the ground that two of his prior offenses were imposed under a Nevada statute not sufficiently similar to Montana\u2019s DUI statutes?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b63 On September 2, 2011, Officer Courtis of the Bozeman Police Department received a tip from a pedestrian that a visibly intoxicated man was attempting to wash his car at the Chevron Super Save. Officer Courtis located the vehicle and followed it to a residence. Upon making contact with the driver, who eventually proved to be Calvert, Officer Courtis noticed a strong smell of alcohol emanating from the vehicle. Calvert stated that he had had \u201ctoo much\u201d to drink and provided a breath sample registering .223 blood alcohol content (BAC). Officer Courtis then arrested Calvert and took him to the police station for booking where he registered .226 BAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b64 On September 23, 2011, the State charged Calvert with fourth-offense DUI, a felony pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-731(1), MCA. As the basis for the felony charge, the State cited Calvert\u2019s three prior DUI convictions in Nevada:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">1. Carson City Justice Court, Nevada: Case No. A-09096, violation on March 7, 1996 (conviction on October 16, 1997), pursuant to Carson City Municipal Code 10.22.020.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">2. First Judicial District Court, Carson City, Nevada: Case No. 98-00523C, violation on July 17, 1996 (convicted on July 20, 1998), pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 484.379.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-10\">3. Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County, Nevada: Case No. CR01-2520, violation on August 12,2001 (convicted on March 1, 2002), pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 484.379.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">Calvert admitted to these convictions, but moved to dismiss the felony charge on the ground that his second and third DUI convictions were premised on a Nevada statute that was not sufficiently similar to Montana\u2019s DUI and DUI <em>per se </em>statutes to constitute prior convictions for purposes of supporting a felony charge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Calvert\u2019s argument, concluding that the Nevada statute was \u201csufficiently similar\u201d to Montana\u2019s statutes, and denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b65 Calvert then pled guilty to felony DUI, reserving his right to appeal the District Court\u2019s ruling on his motion to dismiss. The District Court sentenced him to a thirteen month commitment to the Department of Corrections for placement in an appropriate correctional facility or program, followed by a consecutive four-year term that was suspended with conditions. Upon Calvert\u2019s motion, the District Court stayed execution of the sentence pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b66 \u201cWhether a prior conviction may be used for sentence enhancement is generally a question of law.\u201d <em>State v. Maine, </em>2011 MT 90, \u00b6 12, 360 Mont. 182, 255 P.3d 64. This Court reviews a District Court\u2019s conclusions of law when applying a statute for correctness. <em>State v. McNally, </em>2002 MT 160, \u00b6 5, 310 Mont. 396, 50 P.3d 1080 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err by denying Calvert\u2019s motion to dismiss the felony DUI charge on the ground that two of his prior offenses were imposed under a Nevada statute not sufficiently similar to Montana\u2019s DUI statutes?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">\u00b68 Pursuant to Montana\u2019s statutory scheme, driving under the influence of alcohol is \u201cgenerally charged under either \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA (DUI),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or \u00a7 61-8-406, MCA (DUI <em>per </em>se).\u201d <em>McNally, </em>\u00b6 7. A fourth or subsequent conviction under either of these statutes constitutes a felony. Section 61-8-731(1), MCA. For purposes of this provision, \u201cconviction\u201d includes a conviction under \u201ca similar statute or regulation in another state.\u201d Section 61-8-734(l)(a), MCA. In evaluating whether another state\u2019s statutes are similar to Montana\u2019s statutes, we compare the statutes in effect at the time the offense was committed. <em>See State v. Polaski, </em>2005 MT 13, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 325 Mont. 351, 106 P.3d 538. It matters not whether another state organizes its statutes differently than Montana, so long as they contain analogous provisions. <em>State v. Hall, </em>2004 MT 106, \u00b6 20, 321 Mont. 78, 88 P.3d 1273. However, if another state allows a defendant to be convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\u201cusing a lesser standard than would be required in Montana for a conviction, the statutes are not similar for purposes of \u00a7 61-8-734(l)(a), MCA.\u201d <em>Polaski, </em>\u00b6 22 (citing <em>McNally, </em>\u00b6 22).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b69 Calvert\u2019s second (1996) and third (2001) DUI charges, and his later convictions on these charges, were based on violations of Nevada Revised Statutes \u00a7 484.379. The record does not clearly demonstrate under which specific subsection of this Nevada statute Calvert was charged and convicted in either instance. In 1996, the statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al\">1. It is unlawful for any person who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">(a) Is under the influence of intoxicating liquor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">(b) Has 0.10 percent or more by weight of alcohol in his blood;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">(c) Is found by measurement within 2 hours after driving or being in actual physical control of a vehicle to have 0.10 percent or more by weight of alcohol in his blood,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">to drive or be in actual physical control of a vehicle on a highway or on premises to which the public has access.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 484.379(1) (1995). The statute also provided that \u201cit is an affirmative defense under paragraph (c) of subsection 1 that the defendant consumed a sufficient quantity of alcohol after driving or being in actual physical control of the vehicle, and before his blood was tested, to cause the alcohol in his blood to equal or exceed 0.10 percent.\u201d Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 484.379(3) (1995). By 2001, all references to \u201cin his blood\u201d had been amended to include \u201cin his blood or breath.\u201d \u00b610 Turning to our law, in 1996, Montana\u2019s DUI statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\">(1) It is unlawful... for any person who is under the influence of: (a) alcohol to drive or be in actual physical control of a vehicle upon the ways of this state open to the public;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-12\">(3) \u201cUnder the influence\u201d means that as a result of taking into the body alcohol, drugs, or any combination thereof, a person\u2019s ability to safely operate a motor vehicle has been diminished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">Section 61-8-401, MCA (1995). Montana\u2019s DUI <em>per se </em>statute then provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-14\">It is unlawful ... for any person to drive or be in actual physical control of a vehicle upon the ways of this state open to the public while the person\u2019s alcohol concentration, as shown by analysis of the person\u2019s blood, breath, or urine, is 0.10 or more.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-15\">Section 61-8-406, MCA (1995). Both of these statutes remained largely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>unchanged through 2001.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b611 Calvert argues that Nevada\u2019s statute is not sufficiently similar to Montana\u2019s DUI and DUI <em>per se </em>statutes to support his felony conviction of fourth or subsequent DUI. He focuses on the language in subsection 1(c) of Nevada\u2019s statute, which criminalizes the act of having a BAC of 0.10 or higher <em>within two hours after driving </em>\u201cregardless of whether it was over the limit while driving.\u201d <em>See </em>Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 484.379(l)(c). Calvert contrasts this subsection with Montana\u2019s DUI <em>per se </em>statute, which criminalizes the act of maintaining a BAC of 0.10 or higher <em>while driving. See </em>\u00a7 61-8-406, MCA. Calvert asserts that the Nevada statute proscribes behavior that would be legal in Montana, and argues that this distinction creates a \u201clesser standard of culpability\u201d for conviction under Nevada law. He offers a scenario wherein Nevada\u2019s statute would criminalize conduct that Montana\u2019s would not. He contends that a defendant could consume alcohol either before or during driving, but never actually exceed the legal limit until after driving, due to rising blood alcohol levels. In this situation, he explains, a person would be liable for exceeding the legal limit <em>within two hours after driving </em>in Nevada, but would not be hable for exceeding the legal limit <em>while driving </em>in Montana. For support, Calvert cites the Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Sereika v. State, </em>955 P.2d 175, 179 (Nev. 1998) that \u201ca defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level at the time of driving is simply irrelevant to his violation of NRS 484.379(l)(c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b612 We, however, view Calvert\u2019s distinction as contrived and not realistic. The Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s further comments in <em>Sereika </em>demonstrate that the function of the Nevada statute, like Montana\u2019s statute, is to criminalize high alcohol levels <em>while driving. </em>\u201c[T]he state has a legitimate interest in prohibiting people from driving at the onset of inevitably impending intoxication.\u201d <em>Sereika, </em>955 P.2d at 180. Noting that \u201c[w]hen people step behind the wheel of a car, they have no certain knowledge of the time that will be required to reach their destination,\u201d the Nevada Court reasoned that the Nevada statute served the State\u2019s interest \u201cin <em>preventing people from driving after ingesting </em>any substance that will render them incapable of driving safely at any time in the following several hours.\u201d <em>Sereika, 955 </em>P.2d at 180 (emphasis added). The statutes are thus similar in their function.</p>\n<p id=\"AgV\">\u00b613  Regarding culpability, both statutes require the State to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>that a defendant was driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle, and that his BAC was at or above the legal limit in relation to his driving. <em>See </em>Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 484.379(l)(c); \u00a7 61-8-406, MCA. As the State notes, neither the Nevada nor the Montana statute actually requires the State to prove the precise BAC level that existed during the time of driving. In Montana, law enforcement may administer tests within a \u201creasonable amount of time after the alleged act of driving while under the Influence\u201d in order to satisfy the burden of proof. <em>State v. McGowan, </em>2006 MT 163, \u00b6 17, 332 Mont. 490, 139 P.3d 841. We reasoned in <em>McGowan </em>that requiring law enforcement \u201cto determine a person\u2019s alcohol concentration while driving\u201d would be impossible and lead to absurd legal results. <em>McGowan, </em>\u00b6 17. While we recognize a temporal distinction between criminalizing the act of being intoxicated <em>within two hours after driving </em>and admitting the results of a test administered within \u201ca reasonable amount of time after\u201d driving to prove intoxication <em>while driving, McGowan, </em>\u00b6 17, we agree with the District Court that this difference between the two statutes is not significant for purposes of \u00a7 61-8-734(l)(a), MCA, and that the statutes are sufficiently similar to support Calvert\u2019s felony conviction under Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b614 Further, our cases generally analyze culpability in regard to the level of impairment a statute criminalizes. <em>McNally, </em>\u00b6 22 (determining that impairment \u201cto the slightest degree\u201d under Colorado law was a lesser standard than \u201cdiminished\u201d under Montana law); <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-22 (determining that \u201clessened in any appreciable degree\u201d along with a 0.10 percent <em>per se </em>subsection under Washington law was not a lesser standard than under Montana law). Here, the level of impairment under subsection 1(c) of Nevada\u2019s statute is the same as in Montana\u2019s DUI <em>per se </em>statute-0.10 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b615 Lastly, Calvert argues that in situations where a defendant does not start drinking until after driving, but is tested within two hours of driving, Nevada\u2019s statute creates a lower standard of culpability by shifting the burden to the defendant to prove that he started drinking after driving. <em>See </em>Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 484.379(3). Calvert argues that, in Montana, the State always bears the burden of proving that the defendant actually drove with a BAC above the legal limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b616 Notably, when the Nevada Supreme Court was presented with a constitutional challenge to the statute under this \u201cdrinking after driving\u201d scenario, it refused to undertake review of the issue, reasoning that there was no evidence the statute \u201chas ever been enforced\u201d in this manner and that \u201cwe can conceive of no rational basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>for enforcement of [the statute] in such a situation. ... [W]e decline to strike down an otherwise valid statute based on the unsubstantiated possibility of unconstitutional enforcement.\u201d <em>Sereika, </em>955 P.2d at 180. The Court further concluded that such an interpretation of the statute would lead to \u201cabsurd or unreasonable results.\u201d <em>Sereika, </em>955 P.2d at 180 (citations omitted). Calvert has presented no evidence that he started drinking only after he ceased driving in either of his Nevada convictions. Again, we do not believe that this distinction provides a realistic basis to conclude the statutes are not similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b182-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-12\"> Calvert did not challenge his first DUI conviction under Carson City\u2019s Municipal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b178-10\"> Calvert\u2019s guilty plea in this case resulted from a charge under \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\"> In 2003, the Legislature lowered the <em>per se </em>BAC standard to 0.08.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
