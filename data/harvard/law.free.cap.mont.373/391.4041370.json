(JEM) appeals the order of the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, granting summary judgment to defendant Morrison-Maierle, Inc. (MMI). The dispute arose out of a construction contract between JEM, as contractor, and defendants Gallatin County and Madison County (County Defendants) for a road improvement project. MMI was hired by County Defendants to provide engineering services and supervision on the project. JEM filed suit against MMI alleging detrimental reliance and fraudulent inducement for promises allegedly made during the job by MMI that JEM would be paid for unanticipated costs incurred during pulverization of the old road. MMI moved for summary judgment, arguing that JEM could not prove that it had been harmed by its alleged representations. The District Court granted MMI\u2019s motion, dismissing all claims against it.</p>\n<p id=\"AKl\">\u00b62 We affirm and address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">\u00b63 <em>1. Did the District Court err by concluding that JEM was required to continue performance pending approval of a change order under a contract provision that JEM claims is void as against public policy?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AHn7\">\u00b64 <em>2. Did the District Court err by granting summary judgment to MMI on the ground that JEM had failed to show it was harmed by the representations made by MMI?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">\u00b65 Defendant Counties retained JEM to provide construction services on a road improvement project over a 3.6 mile stretch of road near Big Sky that passed through both counties. MMI was retained by the Defendant Counties to provide engineering services and to act as the owner\u2019s representative on the project. No contract was entered directly between JEM and MMI.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">\u00b66 JEM alleged that on June 21, 2010, the first day of the project, it encountered subsurface conditions that differed significantly from the plans and specifications upon which it had based its bid, and which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>would require increased time and costs for pulverization of the old road surface. JEM discussed the discrepancy with MMI\u2019s on-site representatives over the next few days, some of whom agreed with JEM that the conditions differed from the plans, and at least one who disagreed. JEM proceeded with the job and did not provide written notice to MMI of the alleged differing conditions until July 9, 2010. That same day, JEM and MMI met to discuss the situation. JEM alleged that MMI agreed in this meeting that the site conditions varied from the contract specifications and promised JEM it would be paid for the increased costs related to the differing subsurface conditions if JEM could find savings on the rest of the job to complete it within the contract price. Specific dollar costs were not discussed at this time as JEM did not know the amount of the change order it would be seeking.</p>\n<p id=\"A-BB\">\u00b67 On July 29, 2010, JEM submitted a claim for additional compensation. MMI reviewed the claim and determined that JEM had provided insufficient evidence to support its claim and additionally had failed to follow the notification procedure set out in the contract for nonconforming site conditions. JEM and MMI met to discuss the matter, and MMI again concluded that JEM had failed to provide sufficient evidence to substantiate its claim that site conditions differed from the plans. JEM presented its request directly to Defendant Counties on November 4, 2010. This request was reviewed by the counties\u2019 administrative committee for the project and was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\">\u00b68 JEM completed its work on the project, contending that it had found savings in the remaining work, as requested by MMI, to cover the increased cost of subsurface work. Nevertheless, Defendant Counties continued to deny JEM\u2019s change order. The Counties also refused to release a portion of the retainage withheld from monthly progress payments under the contract pending \u201csubstantial completion\u201d of the project, due to JEM\u2019s failure to provide certain documents required by the contract. On June 13, 2011, JEM filed its complaint against Defendant Counties and MMI alleging breach of contract, detrimental reliance, quantum meruit, fraud by inducement, and punitive damages. JEM later clarified that the claims for breach of contract, quantum meruit, and punitive damages were made against Defendant Counties, while the claims for detrimental reliance and fraud by inducement were made only against MMI. JEM subsequently settled with Defendant Counties and dismissed its claims against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u00b69 MMI moved for summary judgment, arguing that JEM\u2019s claims of detrimental reliance and fraud by inducement failed because (1) JEM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>failed to state cognizable claims for relief; (2) MMI\u2019s alleged promises were nothing more than \u201cagreements to agree;\u201d and (3) the claims contradicted the clear and unambiguous terms of the contract. The District Court granted MMI\u2019s motion. JEM appeals from the order granting summary judgment to MMI.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the same M. R. Civ. P. 56 criteria as the district court. <em>Dick Anderson Constr., Inc. v. Monroe Constr. Co., LLC, </em>2009 MT 416, \u00b6 20, 353 Mont. 534, 221 P.3d 675. Summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3). All reasonable inferences which may be drawn from the evidence must be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Dick Anderson, </em>\u00b6 20. We review the district court\u2019s conclusion that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law for correctness. <em>Dick Anderson, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\u00b611 1. <em>Did the District Court err by concluding that JEM was required to continue performance pending approval of a change order under a contract pi'ovision that JEM claims is void as against public policy ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AvO\">\u00b612 The contract between JEM and Defendant Counties (the Contract) contained the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">6.18 <em>Continuing Work</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">A. Contractor shall carry on the Work and adhere to the Progress Schedule during all disputes or disagreements with Owner. No Work shall be delayed or postponed pending resolution of any disputes or disagreements, except as permitted by Paragraph 15.04 or as Owner and Contractor may otherwise agree in writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">(Paragraph 6.18.) JEM asserts this provision is void under \u00a7 28-2-2116(2), MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-11\">A provision, covenant, clause, or understanding that is in, collateral to, or affects a construction contract and that states that a party to the contract may not suspend performance under the contract or terminate the contract if another party to the contract fails to make prompt payments under the contract as provided in 28-2-2103 is against the public policy of this state and is void and unenforceable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">In turn, \u00a7 28-2-2103, MCA, requires that a construction contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>contain a procedure for monthly billing by the contractor. The contractor must submit payment requests to the owner \u201cbased upon actual or estimated work performed and materials supplied during the preceding monthly billing cycle.\u201d Section 28-2-2103(l)(a), MCA. After receipt of the request, the owner has 21 days to disapprove all or a portion of the requested amount for a defined list of reasons, \u00a7 28-2-2103(l)(c), MCA, but the owner is required to pay the contractor the \u201capproved amount\u201d of the bill within seven days of approval. Section 28-2-2103(1X0, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">\u00b613 JEM argues that because Paragraph 6.18 of the Contract references \u201call\u201d and \u201cany\u201d disputes and disagreements, it is broad enough to encompass an owner\u2019s failure to make progress payments. JEM argues that the provision thus prohibits a contractor from work stoppage when progress payments are not made in violation of \u00a7 28-2-2116, MCA, and is void. However, JEM ignores the exception stated within Paragraph 6.18: \u201cexcept as permitted by Paragraph 15.04.\u201d Paragraph 15.04 explicitly provides that the contractor may terminate performance if monthly progress payments are not made. Thus, Paragraph 6.18 clearly limits its applicability to disputes that do not involve an owner\u2019s failure to make progress payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b614 JEM then asserts that a change order nonetheless equates to a progress payment because a change order is merely a request to be paid additional sums for \u201cwork performed and materials supplied\u201d under \u00a7 28-2-2103(l)(a), MCA. JEM thus reasons that the statutory prohibition of contracts that require a contractor to continue working despite not receiving progress payments likewise prohibits contracts that require a contractor to continue working despite not being paid for a change order. However, JEM reads the statute too broadly. Section 28-2-2103, MCA, clearly recognizes an owner\u2019s right to dispute all or part of a progress payment request for a litany of reasons, including \u201cdisputed work or materials,\u201d \u00a7 28-2-2103(l)(c)(iii), MCA, and requires an owner to promptly pay only the \u201capproved amount.\u201d JEM\u2019s argument would turn a statute meant to protect contractors\u2019 progress payments for agreed-upon work into a mandate that owners progressively pay contractors for billed amounts regardless of work quality or conformance with the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b615  The District Court correctly rejected JEM\u2019s assertion by holding that Paragraph 6.18 is not void as against public policy under the statute, and by concluding that JEM was obligated to continue its performance under the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\u00b616 2. <em>Did the District Court err by granting summary judgment to MMI on the ground that JEM had failed to show it was harmed by the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number><em>representations made by MMI?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\u00b617 To succeed on either of its claims, JEM was required to prove harm as an element. <em>See Keil v. Glacier Park, </em>Inc., 188 Mont. 455, 462, 614 P.2d 502, 506 (1980) (party asserting promissory estoppel, must have been injured by the reliance on a promise); <em>In re Estate of Kindsfather, </em>2005 MT 51, \u00b6 17, 326 Mont. 192, 108 P.3d 487 (party asserting fraud must prove \u201cconsequent and proximate injury or damages caused by their reliance on the representation\u201d). Though JEM acknowledges that there is no contract between it and MMI, it asserts that the amount it would have been owed under the Contract, but was subsequently denied, from the damages it sustained as a result of MMI\u2019s representations. Thus, JEM\u2019s claims against MMI are contingent upon benefits arising from the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\u00b618 MMI argued it was entitled to summary judgment because JEM could not prove that it had been harmed by MMI\u2019s alleged representations because (1) Paragraph 6.18 obligated JEM to continue working during the dispute over the change order, (2) JEM\u2019s claim for a change order was barred because JEM failed to follow the procedure outlined in the Contract governing notification of nonconforming subsurface conditions, and (3) its alleged promises that JEM would be paid for a change order if savings were made throughout the remaining work were merely \u201cagreements to agree,\u201d rather than a clear and unambiguous promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b619 After holding that Paragraph 6.18 was not void, the District Court concluded that JEM could not show that it had suffered harm as the result of MMI\u2019s representations because JEM was contractually obligated by Paragraph 6.18 to continue working on the project despite the dispute over the change order. It reasoned that \u201ca party cannot assert claims for promissory estoppel or fraud based on allegations that a misrepresentation induced the party to do what the party\u2019s contract required them to do in any event,\u201d and thus, even if MMI had notified JEM on the first day that it would not receive a change order, JEM would have been required to continue working. The court declined to consider MMI\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\u00b620 JEM argues the District Court\u2019s analysis was in error for considering only the harm related to JEM\u2019s ability to stop working. JEM also alleged that it was harmed by finding cost savings on the remaining work, based upon MMI\u2019s alleged promise that JEM would be paid for the pulverization change order if savings were found elsewhere. Because JEM\u2019s profit was calculated as a percentage of the total cost per item, it suffered a loss in profit by reducing the costs of other items. Because the Contract did not obligate JEM to reduce costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>on these other items, but JEM did so based upon MMI\u2019s representations, JEM argues that it sufficiently demonstrated harm to prevent summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u00b621 However, we decline to address JEM\u2019s claim of harm for lost profits in light of MMI\u2019s argument that the change order request was properly denied by reason of JEM\u2019s failure to comply with the Contract\u2019s notification procedure for nonconforming conditions. The Contract contained the following provision regarding notification of the owner upon discovery of subsurface conditions that were materially different from the conditions indicated in the Contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">4.03 <em>Differing Subsurface or Physical Conditions</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">Contractor shall notify the Owner and Engineer in writing about differing subsurface or physical conditions within 5 days of discovery and before disturbing the subsurface as stated above. No claim for an adjustment in the contract price or contract times ... will be valid for differing subsurface or physical conditions if procedures of this paragraph 4.03 are not followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">\u00b622 JEM did not provide written notice to Defendant Counties until 18 days after discovery of the allegedly differing conditions, and during that time proceeded to disrupt and remove the subsurface material at issue. MMI raised this defense before the District Court and before this Court. JEM has presented no reason why its failure to comply with the Contract notification procedure should not bar its claim under the clear language that \u201c[n]o claim for an adjustment in the contract price ... will be valid for differing subsurface or physical conditions if procedures of this paragraph 4.03 are not followed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">\u00b623  Even if the District Court erred by failing to consider JEM\u2019s argument that it was harmed by losing profits, we nonetheless conclude that summary judgment in favor of MMI was appropriate for the reasons stated above. <em>See Knutson v. State, </em>211 Mont. 126, 129, 683 P.2d 488, 490 (1984) (\u201cAlthough the reason given by the District Court in granting summary judgment was incorrect, its result can be sustained under the wrong-reason, right-result appellate rule.\u201d). It is undisputed that JEM failed to follow the specific notification procedure in the Contract for differing subsurface conditions that was required for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b421-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
