We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">\u00b62 The Jefferson County High School Board established a budget subcommittee, composed of three members of the full Board. The subcommittee\u2019s task was to consider budget issues and to report recommendations to the full Board. The Board met in a regular meeting on July 10, 2012, and discussed a number of issues, including several personnel positions. The Board reviewed four applicants for a principal position, and asked the budget subcommittee to meet on July 13, 2012 \u201cto see if there is any significant savings that could be identified\u201d regarding the salary for the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">\u00b63 In addition to the discussion at the July 10 Board meeting as noted in the minutes of that meeting, the Board gave public notice of the July 13, 2012 meeting of the subcommittee. The notice indicated that the subcommittee would discuss the 2012-2013 school district budget, and noted that: \u201cNo decisions are made by a subcommittee of the Jefferson High School Board of Trustees unless authorized by action of a majority of the membership of the board in a regular meeting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">\u00b64 The Boulder Monitor is a weekly newspaper covering Jefferson County and its county seat, Boulder. The Monitor, and more specifically its publisher Jan Anderson, claims that its policy is to attend each meeting of the full School Board and that it has done so for several years. The Monitor was aware of the context of the budget subcommittee meeting, having attended the July 10 regular meeting of the full Board. The Monitor admits that it knew about the notice of the July 13 subcommittee meeting but decided not to send a reporter to cover it because it was not noticed as a meeting of the full School Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">\u00b65 Pursuant to the discussion and directive at the regular Board meeting July 10, the three designated members of the subcommittee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>met on July 13. A fourth member of the School Board who was not a designated member of the budget subcommittee checked to insure that three Board members were present to participate. Her affidavit indicated that she was concerned that one of the subcommittee members had recent surgery and might not be able to attend. All three subcommittee members attended, so the fourth School Board member sat in the audience to observe the discussions about the 2012-2013 budget. The subcommittee discussed the salary level to allocate to a principal position and to a part-time athletic director position. The fourth Board member asked some questions during the discussion. The budget subcommittee, by consensus of its three members, decided to recommend to the School Board a salary of $55,000 for the principal position and a salary of $10,000 for the part-time athletic director position. After the subcommittee set the salary levels, there was a discussion of whether or not full benefits would also need to be paid. The school superintendent was present, and he opined that two of the four applicants for the open principal position would likely not be interested at the salary level recommended by the subcommittee.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b66 One of the subcommittee members took notes of the discussion and intended to send her notes to the full School Board as a report of the subcommittee\u2019s recommendations. She sent a draft of her notes of the meeting to each person who attended, including the fourth board member. The fourth Board member sent back some suggested revisions. The full School Board considered and acted upon the subcommittee\u2019s recommendations at its next regular meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b67 Jan Anderson attended the next scheduled meeting of the full School Board. She determined, based upon what she heard there and upon the notes of the budget subcommittee meeting, that the subcommittee meeting had actually been a meeting of the full School Board. Anderson concluded that the presence of the fourth board member meant that a quorum of the School Board had met. Anderson further determined that the subcommittee had done more than discuss the 2012-2013 budget, and had acted in some way to eliminate two of the candidates for the principal position. Anderson determined that the notice of the subcommittee meeting had not disclosed that it would be a meeting of the full School Board and that the notice had not disclosed that the subcommittee would take action to reduce the number of candidates from four to two.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b68 The Monitor sued the District contending that the meeting of the budget subcommittee violated the open meeting and public participation requirements of Montana law, Title 2, chapter 3, MCA. The complaint alleged that there was a quorum of the School Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>present at the subcommittee meeting on July 13; that the meeting discussed \u201cpersonnel matters\u201d in addition to the 2012-2013 budget; that all four Board members present participated in the discussion; and that the public notice of the subcommittee meeting was inadequate. The complaint requested a declaration that the Board had violated the open meeting and public participation requirements of Montana law; requested that if any decision was made at the July 13 meeting, it be voided; and requested an injunction against the School Board\u2019s conducting any . other official business until its members completed a course in the open meeting and public participation requirements of Montana law. The Monitor also requested that the School District be ordered to pay its attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b69 The parties conducted limited discovery and both sides filed motions for summary judgment. The District Court entered an Order filed March 27,2013, granting summary judgment to the Monitor and awarding it attorney fees as the prevailing party. The District Court granted summary judgment to the Monitor based upon its determination that the \u201ccritical facts are undisputed.\u201d The critical facts noted in the District Court\u2019s Order were that a quorum of the School Board convened at the budget subcommittee meeting on July 13,2012; that the members present at that meeting heard and discussed school business; that the members present \u201cdiscussed at least four applications for an administrative position\u201d; that the members present acted to reduce the \u201croster of several candidates\u201d for the principal position; that the fourth School Board member was \u201cclearly involved in the conduct of the school business\u201d; and that the School Board failed to give notice that these actions would be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b610 The District Court, based upon its conclusion that these were undisputed facts, granted summary judgment to the Monitor. The only relief the District Court granted was a declaration that the School Board had violated the open meeting and public participation requirements of Montana law at the July 13, 2012 meeting, and a determination that the Monitor was entitled to attorney fees. The issue on appeal is whether the District Court properly granted summary judgment to the Monitor based upon the conclusion that the School Board violated Montana law in the manner in which the July 13,2012 budget subcommittee meeting was conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\u00b611 Summary judgment is governed by M. R. Civ. P. 56. That Rule provides that a party is entitled to summary judgment \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d The moving party must demonstrate the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Hiebert v. Cascade County, </em>2002 MT 233, \u00b6 20, 311 Mont. 471, 56 P.3d 848. If the moving party satisfies this burden then the opposing party must present material and substantial evidence to demonstrate that there are genuine issues of material fact, or that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Hiebert, </em>\u00b6 21. All reasonable inferences that might be drawn from offered evidence should be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Montana Metal Bldgs, v. Shapiro, </em>283 Mont. 471, 474, 942 P.2d 694, 696 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u00b612 On appeal this Court reviews decisions on summary judgment de novo, applying the same evaluation as the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56 and determining whether the district court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. <em>Smart v. Judicial Standards Comm., </em>2002 MT 148, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 310 Mont. 295, 50 P.3d 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u00b613 In Montana the public\u2019s constitutional \u201cright to know\u201d guarantees that \u201c[n]o person shall be deprived of the right ... to observe the deliberations of all public bodies or agencies of state government and its subdivisions.....\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 9. This mandate is implemented through the open meeting laws codified at \u00a7\u00a7 2-3-201, et. seq., MCA. <em>Common Cause of Montana v. Statutory Committee, </em>263 Mont. 324, 329, 868 P.2d 604, 607 (1994). Public bodies in Montana \u201cexist to aid in the conduct of the peoples\u2019 business\u201d and it is the intent of the statutes that the \u201cactions and deliberations of all public agencies shall be conducted openly\u201d and \u201c[a]ll meetings of. public or governmental bodies ... must be open to the public.\u201d Section 2-3-201, MCA.

The public is entitled to notice of public meetings and the opportunity to participate. Sections 2-3-103 and -104, MCA. These constitutional and statutory provisions \u201cmust be liberally interpreted in favor of openness.\u201d <em>Associated Press v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><em>Crofts, </em>2004 MT 120, \u00b6 22, 321 Mont. 193, 89 P.3d 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\">\u00b614 The parties do not dispute that the School Board could establish a subcommittee to discuss budget issues and then make recommendations for action to be taken by the full Board. There is no dispute that the School Board provided public notice of the July 13, 2012 meeting of the budget subcommittee and that the Monitor got actual notice. There is also no dispute that Monitor made its own decision not to attend the meeting called to discuss the 2012-2013 budget. The Monitor disputes the adequacy of the notice, based upon its contention that it was a meeting of a quorum of the School Board and that it took action to eliminate candidates for a vacant principal position.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b615 The District Court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment to the Monitor was expressly premised upon the conclusion that the \u201ccritical facts are undisputed.\u201d The absence of a genuine dispute as to \u201ccritical facts\u201d or \u201cmaterial facts\u201d in the language of M. R. Civ. P. 56, is the lynchpin of summary judgment. In the present case, however, the record shows that at the time the District Court entered its Order granting summary judgment, there were genuine disputes as to the material facts the District Court relied upon. The School District\u2019s pleadings, along with its briefs, affidavits and other materials submitted to the District Court disputed the essential facts relied upon by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b616 The District contended that the fourth Board member attended the subcommittee meeting in her capacity as an interested citizen. The District disputed that the fourth Board member was involved in the meeting as a member of the Board and contended that she did not participate in reaching the subcommittee consensus that was reported to the full School Board. The District asserted that only the designated members of the subcommittee had the authority to consider the budget issue and report its consensus. The District disputed that a quorum of the Board met and took action and significantly disputed that the subcommittee \u201cacted to reduce a field of four candidates to two candidates.\u201d The District contends that the subcommittee\u2019s only action after budget review was to reach a consensus on a salary level to recommend to the School Board for final action. The District maintains that the Monitor\u2019s positions on the facts are based upon a misunderstanding of what happened and upon a mis-construction of the events. Materials filed in the record by the Monitor took opposing positions on these factual points.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u00b617 The District Court resolved the factual disputes and contentions between the parties in favor of the scenario posited by the Monitor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>While the Monitor\u2019s factual contentions may ultimately prove out, the District Court should'not have resolved factual disputes between the parties when granting summary judgment. It is settled law that it is improper for a district court to resolve factual disputes in a summary judgment proceeding. <em>Cole v. Flathead County, </em>236 Mont. 412, 416, 771 P.2d 97, 99 (1989); <em>Walker v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine, </em>241 Mont. 256, 258-59, 786 P.2d 1157, 1159 (1990); <em>Mount. West Bank v. Mine &amp; Mill Hydraulics, </em>2003 MT 35, \u00b6 28, 314 Mont. 248, 64 P.3d 1048; <em>Corporate Air v. Edwards Jet Center, </em>2008 MT 283, \u00b6 28, 345 Mont. 336, 190 P.3d 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\u00b618  The District Court erred by granting summary judgment when there were genuine issues of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b619 The District Court also incorrectly applied the law by concluding that the July 13, 2012 subcommittee meeting was a meeting of a quorum of the School Board for purposes of the open meeting statutes. That ruling was based upon a determination that the subcommittee meeting transformed into a meeting of a quorum of the full School Board because a fourth Board member stayed during the proceedings. The open meetings statutes apply to a \u201cmeeting,\u201d which occurs upon the \u201cconvening\u201d of a \u201cquorum\u201d of the \u201cconstituent membership of a public agency.\u201d Section 2-3-202, MCA. The only meeting that was convened on July 13,2012, was a noticed meeting of the three-member subcommittee tasked by the School Board to make budget recommendations regarding the salary level for an open principal position. The only persons who convened to \u201chear, discuss or act upon\u201d budget recommendations were the three designated members of the subcommittee who alone could reach a consensus to report to the full School Board. This is consistent with \u00a7 20-3-322(4), MCA, which provides that the \u201cbusiness\u201d of a school board may only be conducted at \u201cregular meeting or a properly called special meeting\u201d of the school board.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b620  Nothing in the letter or spirit of the open meeting statutes prohibits a person in the position of the fourth member in this case from attending and observing a meeting of a subcommittee along with any other members of the public. In fact, it can be argued that the better public policy would be to encourage members of public bodies to observe such events so they can be better educated and informed about matters that they will later vote on in their official capacities. Penalizing those members and the public bodies they serve by an unwarranted application of the statute creates a difficult labyrinth for public servants and threatens to turn any Saturday night at the county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>rodeo into a board meeting that must be noticed. We decline to formulate such strictures when none exist in the statute. <em>Sonsteile v. Board of Trustees, </em>202 Mont. 414, 419, 658 P.2d 413, 416 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\">\u00b621  We caution that this Opinion should not be taken as an invitation for subterfuge by public bodies or their members to avoid public scrutiny and to conduct business in violation of the requirements of the open meeting statutes. We determine only that the statutes do not prohibit a member of a public body from observing a meeting of a sub-quorum subcommittee, or even asking questions during the meeting, and that doing so does not constitute the convening of a quorum. As \u00a7 2-3-202, MCA, provides, a meeting exists only when a quorum has been convened. In the present case the mere presence of the fourth Board member in the room to observe the budget subcommittee did not transform that meeting into a meeting of the full School Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">\u00b622 The Monitor does not contend, and the District Court did not determine, that it was improper for the School Board to appoint a budget subcommittee and to ask it to consider and recommend a salary level for the principal position. It seems clear that it would be virtually impossible for the subcommittee to discuss the money to be allocated in a vacuum without mentioning the position that the money would be used to fill and without discussing such issues as whether or not the salary allocation would include benefits. The District contends that it was the Superintendent, at the July 13 meeting, and not the subcommittee members, who offered his opinion that the salary level selected by the subcommittee would probably not attract some of the then-current applicants for the principal position. As noted above, there are contested issues of fact that must be resolved in this case and that may not be resolved on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u00b623 The District Court improperly granted summary judgment to the Monitor and therefore also improperly granted attorney fees to the Monitor. The Order granting summary judgment is reversed and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b243-6\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-9\">A quorum of a school board is a majority of the trustees\u2019 membership.

Montana law thus requires that public notice be given of meetings that are subject to the requirements of the open-meeting laws. We have acknowledged that \u201c[i]t is difficult to envision an open meeting held without public notice that still accomplishes the legislative purpose of the Montana \u2018open meeting\u2019 statutes.

The undisputed facts material to Article II, Section 9 and \u00a7\u00a7 2-3-201, -202, and -203(1), MCA, establish that the Budget Subcommittee of the School Board held a meeting on July 13, 2012, to discuss the 2012-2013 school budget. The meeting was noticed up as a meeting of the Budget Subcommittee, not the School Board. Present at the meeting, however, were the three members of the Budget Subcommittee plus a fourth School Board member who was not on the subcommittee. A \u201cquorum\u201d of the School Board is defined as four or more members of the School Board. Ms. Lewis, the fourth member of the School Board and the only board member not on the Budget <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Subcommittee, asked questions during the meeting about the budget process. Following the meeting, Lewis, via email, made certain changes or clarifications to the minutes/notes of the July 13, 2012 meeting. Lewis\u2019s changes were subsequently circulated among the four School Board members-the quorum-in attendance atthe July 13,2012 meeting.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u00b630 Based on the foregoing undisputed facts, <em>\u201ca </em>quorum of the constituent membership of a public agency,\u201d \u00a7 2-3-202, MCA-i.e., four members of the School Board-was present on July 13, 2012.

The meeting by a quorum of the School Board was not properly noticed as a School Board meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u00b631 These undisputed facts, in light of the \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d language of our Constitution, <em>Associated Press, </em>246 Mont. at 391, 804 P.2d at 379, establish that the meeting of July 13,2012, did not comply with Montana\u2019s open-meeting laws. A straightforward application of the statutory provisions necessarily leads to the conclusion that a quorum of the School Board heard, discussed, and otherwise conducted school business without properly noticing the meeting as a School Board meeting. The disputed facts as to what occurred at the meeting are irrelevant, as long as business of the School Board was heard, discussed, or acted upon-as it was here.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u00b632 The Court\u2019s decision today will lead government agencies down a slippery slope by raising the question of whether presence at a public meeting of the body upon which a member serves constitutes a quorum. We have previously recognized that a \u201cquorum\u201d of a given body consists of members who \u201cassemble\u201d or are \u201cin attendance\u201d at \u201cany particular meeting\u201d of the body. <em>Crofts, </em>\u00b6 31. The Court muddles this rule by holding that board members may assemble or be in attendance at a public meeting without constituting a quorum.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\u00b633 Our Constitution mandates that the deliberations of all public bodies or agencies be open. Our open-meeting laws exist to implement this constitutional guarantee. A gathering of School Board members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>at the county rodeo or at the local coffee shop, as the Court posits, is not necessarily impermissible under the open-meeting laws. However, a gathering of four School Board members at the rodeo or coffee shop is impermissible-as it is similarly impermissible when four members assemble at a Budget Subcommittee meeting-if they \u201chear, discuss, or act upon,\u201d \u00a7 2-3-202, MCA, the school budget during that gathering. We should not allow the open-meeting laws to be evaded on the ground that a member of a public body, which has assembled as defined in \u00a7 2-3-202, MCA, claims she was attending the meeting as a private citizen. I submit that Lewis\u2019s inquiries regarding the budgetary process directly related to her subsequent decision, made when she wore her \u201cSchool Board member\u201d hat, on whether to approve recommendations of the Budget Subcommittee concerning the 2012-2013 budget. Lewis\u2019s presence and inquiries clearly constituted \u201cdeliberations\u201d of a matter which the School Board was considering and which the public was entitled, therefore, to receive proper notice of and to observe.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\">\u00b634 The Court opines that \u201cthe better policy\u201d would be to encourage members of public bodies to attend and observe subcommittee meetings along with members of the public \u201cso they can be better educated and informed about matters that they will later vote on in their official capacities.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 20. While such \u201cpolicy\u201d considerations might be appropriate if we were articulating the substance of the right to know in the first instance, we are not in a position to do that here. The Delegates debated the competing \u201cpolicy\u201d considerations during the 1972 Constitutional Convention and struck the balance they deemed appropriate. That balance is now set forth in the Constitution and the statutes which implement the right to know. It is not this Court\u2019s prerogative to adopt what it feels is a \u201cbetter\u201d policy. The constitutional and statutory provisions are clear: When a quorum of the board convenes \u201cto hear, discuss, or act upon a matter over which the agency has supervision, control, jurisdiction, or advisory power,\u201d \u00a7 2-3-202, MCA, \u201c[n]o person shall be deprived of the right... to observe the [board\u2019s] deliberations,\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 9. The open-meeting laws include public scrutiny of the deliberative process which, in my view, necessarily includes public scrutiny of the information utilized by board members to make their decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u00b635 The constitutional and statutory framework is reasonable and functions well, when it is properly applied. Again, the scenario described above-a gathering of board members at the county rodeo or coffee shop-is not impermissible if \u201ca matter over which the agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>has supervision, control, jurisdiction, or advisory power\u201d is not being considered. Section 2-3-202, MCA. But it is impermissible if the public\u2019s business (such as school budgets) is being considered by <em>\u201ca </em>quorum of the constituent membership\u201d of the public body (such as a quorum of the School Board) without proper notice and without being open to the public. Sections 2-3-103, -202, -203, MCA. We have held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\">our constitution mandates that the deliberations of public bodies be open, which is more than a simple requirement that only the final voting be done in public. Devices such as not fixing a specific membership of a body, not adopting formal rules, not keeping minutes in violation of \u00a7 2-3-212, MCA, and not requiring formal votes, must not be allowed to defeat the constitutional and statutory provisions which require that the public\u2019s business be openly conducted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Crofts, \u00b6 31.1 would add to this list that purporting not to \u201cconvene\u201d a quorum of the public agency, Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 19-21, but otherwise satisfying the definition of \u201cmeeting\u201d in \u00a7 2-3-202, MCA, has the potential to defeat the open-meeting laws and the requirement that the public\u2019s business be openly conducted. The Court\u2019s approach in this case will enable public bodies to circumvent the open-meeting laws by announcing that they never \u201cconvened\u201d a meeting, even though a quorum of the constituent membership was present and discussed matters over which the agency has supervision, control, jurisdiction, or advisory power. The Court\u2019s restrictive interpretation of \u201cconvening\u201d in \u00a7 2-3-202, MCA, is contrary to the legislative mandate that our open-meeting laws be \u201cliberally construed\u201d in favor of openness. Section 2-3-201, MCA; <em>Crofts, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u00b636 The Court states that \u201c[pjenalizing those members and the public bodies they serve by an unwarranted application of the statute creates a difficult labyrinth for public servants and threatens to turn any Saturday night at the county rodeo into a board meeting that must be noticed.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 20. I question, however, whether a \u201cpenalty\u201d is being imposed when the person is not being prohibited from attending the meeting but, rather, is simply being held to the obligations and responsibilities of his or her position as a member of the public body. Significantly, the only exception provided for by the plain language of Article II, Section 9 applies when \u201cthe demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure.\u201d It thus is difficult for me to accept that our fundamental constitutional principles of open government should yield to a public official\u2019s desire to attend, as a \u201cprivate citizen,\u201d a meeting of the public body of which she is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>member.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\">\u00b637 We have previously held, and it is my view, that the Constitutional Convention Delegates \u201cmade a clear and unequivocal decision that government operates most effectively, most reliably, and is most accountable when it is subject to public scrutiny.\u201d <em>Day, </em>\u00b6 34. Our open-meeting laws exist to implement accountability of government to the public. This fundamental principle of our State\u2019s constitutional law, and the existence of a clear statutory framework to protect this principle, serves as the basis for this Dissent. Although we may be urged and encouraged at times to manipulate an exception into the \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d language of our open-meeting laws-such as to find that a quorum was not \u201cconvened\u201d-I fear that such exceptions will dilute the strength of our commitment to open government. \u201cWhile on any given occasion there may be legitimate arguments for handling government operations privately, the delegates to our Constitutional Convention concluded that in the long-term those fleeting considerations are outweighed by the dangers of a government beyond public scrutiny.\u201d <em>Day, </em>\u00b6 35. In my view, our decision today blurs these constructs and ignores a \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d constitutional and statutory framework for applying our open-meeting laws. \u201cAll that is required is that a quorum of the membership convene[s] to conduct its public business.\u201d <em>Crofts, </em>\u00b6 30. Our fundamental constitutional right to open meetings of our public bodies should not be made to depend on any particular interpretation that a member of a public body places on his or her role and degree of participation when a quorum of the public body has assembled and discussed agency matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\u00b638 Based on the undisputed material facts, I would hold that Lewis\u2019s attendance and participation at the July 13, 2012 Budget Subcommittee meeting rendered it a meeting of the full School Board, regardless of whether Lewis claims she was attending the meeting as a private citizen, and that the meeting did not comply with Montana\u2019s open-meeting laws. To the extent the Court holds otherwise, I strongly disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b639 I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-9\"> It should be noted preliminarily that neither the District nor the Monitor disputes that the Budget Subcommittee meeting was itself subject to the open-meeting laws.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\"> 1 note that this act alone of making substantive changes to the minutes/notes arguable constituted a violation of \u00a7 2-3-202, MCA, as it was a discussion, by \u201celectronic\u201d means, of a matter relating to School Board business.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b249-6\"> Article II, Section 9 is contained in the Montana Constitution\u2019s Declaration of Rights and is, therefore, a fundamental right. <em>State v.
