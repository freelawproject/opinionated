We consider on appeal whether the District Court erred in the following determinations:</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\u00b62 <em>1. That Employers\u2019 policies did not constitute a standardized group employment contract;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u00b63 <em>2. That the CIB Pay-Out Benefit was not deferred compensation or wages under the Montana Wage and Wage Protection Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\u00b64 <em>3. That the covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not apply to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\u00b65 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">\u00b66 The named plaintiffs are employees of Kalispell Regional Medical Center (KRMC), a subsidiary of Northwest Healthcare Corporation. Upon hire, new employees sign a probationary employment contract that reads, \u201cUpon expiration of this Probationary Employment Contract, if the Employer and Employee elect to continue the employment relationship, the Employee shall attain regular employee status, subject to the policies and regulations of the Employer, as they may exist from time to time.\u201d Plaintiffs did not sign any additional employment contract when they completed their probationary period.</p>\n<p id=\"AMU\">\u00b67 In the 1990s, Employers created a sick-leave policy as part of its benefits package that allowed employees to \u201cbank\u201d their sick leave in what Employers termed a continued illness bank (CIB). The CIB was established to provide employees \u201cwith a source of compensation during long term illnesses and extended periods of time off from work due to personal injury, illness or an approved [family medical leave].\u201d Only Employees who had been employed continuously for six months could begin to accrue CIB hours. Employees could accumulate up to 866 CIB hours for use at any time during their employment; upon termination of employment, employees lost any unused sick leave. Employers revised the terms of the CIB in 2002; the modified plan allowed the capped amount of unused CIB hours to be paid out to departing employees \u201cwho have completed a minimum of twenty-five years of service.\u201d KRMC adopted the policy (hereinafter referred to as the CIB Pay-Out Benefit) on March 31, 2002, after holding meetings to explain the new policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">\u00b68 Employers\u2019 policy and procedure manual contains an additional policy describing different categories of employment status. The policy expressly states that for those employees eligible for benefits, \u201c[t]hese <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>benefits may change from time to time ... .\u201d The policies and procedures contained in the manual were summarized and communicated to Employees through a handbook. The Foreword to Employers\u2019 handbook also stated that \u201cthe procedures, practices, policies and benefits described here may be modified, added to, or discontinued from time to time.\u201d Employees signed a receipt for each edition of the handbook, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-3\">I understand that this Handbook states Northwest Healthcare\u2019s policies and practices in effect on the date of publication. I understand that nothing contained in the Handbook may be construed as creating a promise of future benefits or a binding contract with Northwest Healthcare for benefits or for any other purpose. I also understand that these policies and procedures are continually evaluated and may be amended, modified or terminated at any time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b69 In 2008, KRMC met with new external auditors and determined that accounting for the possible financial liability <em>of </em>the CIB Pay-Out Benefit for all employees would jeopardize its ability to expand operations and possibly endanger its credit rating for tax-exempt bond issuances. Due to these concerns, Employers terminated the Pay-Out Benefit as of July 1, 2008. Only employees who already had reached twenty-five years of employment with Employers at that time are now entitled to their earned but unused CIB hours upon termination; Plaintiffs represent employees who had not reached twenty-five years of service before the benefit ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\u00b610 Following termination of the policy allowing a contingent CIB Pay-Out Benefit, Plaintiffs brought a class action complaint against Employers. They alleged breach of their employment contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violation of the Montana Wages and Wage Protection Act. In an earlier appeal, we affirmed the District Court\u2019s certification of the class of employees. <em>Chipman v. N.W. Healthcare Corp., </em>2012 MT 242, 366 Mont. 450, 288 P.3d 193. Plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on April 30, 2012. Employers responded and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on June 13, 2012. After hearing arguments, the District Court granted Employers\u2019 motion for summary judgment on April 24, 2013. Plaintiffs now appeal that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, using the same criteria applied by the district court under M. R. Civ. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>P. 56. <em>Draggin\u2019 Y Cattle Co. v. Addink, </em>2013 MT 319, \u00b6 16, 372 Mont. 334, 312 P.3d 451. Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u00b612 \u201cThe existence of a contract is a question of law.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Home Depot, </em>2012 MT 23, \u00b6 6, 364 Mont. 27, 270 P.3d 72. Statutory interpretations also present questions of law. <em>State v. Madsen, </em>2013 MT 281, \u00b6 8, 372 Mont. 102, 317 P.3d 806. The parties agree that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the issues before us are solely questions of law. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions on such questions for correctness. <em>Murphy, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u00b613 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred in its determination that Employers\u2019 policies did not constitute a standardized group employment contract.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">\u00b6 14 Plaintiffs first contend that Employers\u2019 institution of the CIB PayOut Benefit created a binding agreement under which Employers promised to compensate Plaintiffs for their earned and unused CIB hours if Plaintiffs stayed with Employers for twenty-five years. Plaintiffs assert that the employer manual constituted a standardized group employment contract with employees and governed the relationship. Plaintiffs admit, however, that the only statutory authority for group employment contracts in Montana relates to collective bargaining for public employees. <em>See </em>\u00a7 39-31-101, MCA, et seq. There is no statutory or case law in Montana supporting blanket group employment contracts. Thus, our analysis of whether the manual is a contract is governed by general principles of Montana contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\u00b615 Plaintiffs must establish four elements to prove the existence of a contract: \u201c(1) identifiable parties capable of contracting; (2) their consent; (3) a lawful object; and (4) a sufficient cause or consideration.\u201d Section 28-2-102, MCA. The consent of the parties must be \u201ccommunicated by each to the other.\u201d Section 28-2-301(3), MCA. Mutual consent consists of an offer and an acceptance of that offer. <em>Daniels v. Thomas, Dean &amp; Hoskins, Inc., </em>246 Mont. 125, 133, 804 P.2d 359, 363 (1990). To be considered an offer, the offeror must manifest a willingness to enter into a bargain. <em>Daniels, </em>246 Mont. at 133, 804 P.2d at 364 (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 24). \u201cWe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>determine whether the parties have mutually consented to a contract by inquiring whether a reasonable person, based upon the objective manifestation of assent, and all the surrounding circumstances, would conclude that the parties intended to be bound by the contract.\u201d <em>Bitterroot Int'l Sys. v. W. Star Trucks, Inc., </em>2007 MT 48, \u00b6 33, 336 Mont. 145, 153 P.3d 627. Consent is not determined by the parties\u2019 subjective, undisclosed intent, but by their objective manifestations of consent, and properly may be determined by summary judgment. <em>Olsen v. Johnston, </em>2013 MT 25, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 16, 22, 368 Mont. 347, 301 P.3d 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\">\u00b616 Manuals and handbooks outlining an employer\u2019s policies and procedures generally are not considered part of the employment contract. <em>Hubner v. Cutthroat Communs., Inc., </em>2003 MT 333, \u00b6 18, 318 Mont. 421, 80 P.3d 1256. Because the handbook is a \u201cunilateral statement of company policies and procedures, because its terms are not bargained for, and because no [mutual consent] occurred,\u201d we generally do not classify employee handbooks as binding agreements. <em>Kittelson v. Archie Cochrane Motors, </em>248 Mont. 512, 518, 813 P.2d 424, 427 (1991) (citing <em>Gates v. Life of Mont. Ins. Co., </em>196 Mont. 178, 183, 638 P.2d 1063, 1066 (1982)). In <em>Gates, </em>we held that an employee handbook that contained a unilateral statement of company policies and procedures given to an employee two years after being hired was not a contract. <em>Gates, </em>196 Mont. at 183, 638 P.2d at 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\u00b617 As Plaintiffs point out, we determined in a previous case that an employer\u2019s policies and procedures did constitute terms of an employment contract where the required elements of contract formation were met. In <em>Langager v. Crazy Creek Prods., Inc., </em>1998 MT 44, \u00b6 20, 287 Mont. 445, 954 P.2d 1169, we concluded that when there is both a sufficient bargained-for exchange and consideration, an employer handbook can become a binding agreement between employer and employee. Plaintiffs argue that because Employers received consideration for the Pay-Out Benefit by virtue of increased employee retention and reduced use of sick leave while the policy was in effect, they have met the <em>Langager </em>exception for adequate bargained-for exchange and consideration. Even if consideration has been shown, it is but one element for proof of a contract. Plaintiffs\u2019 contention cannot prevail in light of Employers\u2019 clearly expressed intention not to be contractually bound. <em>Langager </em>did not involve employer policies with express disclaimer language.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u00b618 The policies at issue lack the required contractual element of mutual consent. The undisputed facts establish that Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>continually were informed, in both the policies and the handbook that communicated and explained those policies, that employee benefits could be altered or discontinued at any time. The foreword to the handbook provides that the benefits may be \u201cmodified, added to, or discontinued from time to time.\u201d In the benefits section of the handbook, Employers reserved the right to \u201camend, modify, or terminate, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the benefit plans described herein ....\u201d The policy defining which employees were entitled to benefits also stated clearly that benefits \u201cmay change from time to time.\u201d The only written contract of employment, the probationary employment contract, also alerts employees expressly that the policies and regulations of the employer \u201cmay exist\u201d-or not-\u201cfrom time to time.\u201d Further, Plaintiffs signed a receipt when given the employee handbook, expressly agreeing that they understood that the policies and procedures are continually evaluated and may be amended, modified or terminated at any time. Given these express disclaimers, the Employers\u2019 objective manifestations leave no doubt that they did not intend the statement of benefits to bind their future obligations, and employees could not reasonably rely on the benefits described in the handbook as existing indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u00b619 Plaintiffs attempt to persuade the Court that other jurisdictions have held similar employer policies and procedures to be standardized group employment contracts. Numerous courts have held, however, that the existence of disclaiming language in an employee handbook precludes the formation of a contract. Even jurisdictions cited by Plaintiffs recognize that if \u201c[ejmployers ... make known to their employees that personnel policies are subject to unilateral changes by the employer,\u201d the employees \u201chave no legitimate expectation that any particular policy will continue to remain in force.\u201d <em>Toussaint v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue </em>Shield, 292 N.W.2d 880, 894-95 (Mich. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u00b620 Many applicable cases address whether policy and procedure handbooks can contractually change an employee\u2019s \u201cat-will\u201d status, a consideration that does not exist in Montana employment law. <em>See Blehm v. St. John\u2019s Lutheran Hosp., Inc., </em>2010 MT 258, \u00b6 21, 358 Mont. 300, 246 P.3d 1024. The decisions nonetheless apply general principles of contract law. <em>See Johnson v. Morton Thiokol, Inc., </em>818 P.2d 997, 1003 (Utah 1991) (\u201cWe also note that a number of jurisdictions have held that a clear and conspicuous disclaimer, as a matter of law, prevents employee manuals ... from being considered as implied-in-fact contract terms.\u201d); <em>Anderson v. Douglas &amp; Lomason Co., </em>540 N.W.2d 277, 288 (Iowa 1995) (\u201cWe simply examine the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>and context of the disclaimer to decide whether a reasonable employee, reading the disclaimer, would understand it to mean that the employer has not assented to be bound by the handbook\u2019s provisions.\u201d); <em>Davis v. Times Mirror Mags., </em>697 N.E.2d 380, 388 (Ill. App. 1998) (internal quotations omitted) (\u201cTo establish the existence of an employment contract using an employee handbook: First, the language of the policy statement must contain a promise clear enough that an employee would reasonably believe that an offer has been made... [Disclaiming language in an employee handbook precludes the formation of an employment contract.\u201d); <em>Bykonen v. United Hosp., </em>479 N.W.2d 140 (N.D. 1992) (same); <em>Habighurst v. Edlong Corp., </em>568 N.E.2d 226 (Ill. App. 1991) (same); <em>Karnes v. Drs. Hosp., </em>555 N.E.2d 280 (Ohio 1990) (same); <em>see also U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, </em>535 U.S. 391, 410, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 1527 (2002) (O\u2019Connor, J. concurring) (noting the concession that employees are not given legally enforceable rights when a personnel policy guide specifically states that it is \u201cnot intended to be a contract (express or implied) or otherwise to create legally enforceable obligations,\u201d and the employer \u201creserves the right to change any and all of the stated policies and procedures in the Guide at any time ... .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\u00b621 Policy considerations underlying Montana employment law recognize the need for flexibility in the employment relationship. <em>See Gates, </em>196 Mont. at 184, 638 P.2d at 1067 (\u201can employer needs flexibility in the face of changing circumstances\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Langager, </em>\u00b6 25 (\u201can employer is free to set the terms and conditions of the work and of the compensation and the employee may accept or reject those conditions\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). But the law binds employer and employee to the terms of employment policies while they are in effect. Montana law, for example, prevents an employer from terminating an employee in violation of the employer\u2019s own policies. Section 39-2-904(l)(c), MCA. <em>See Sullivan v. Cont\u2019l Constr. of Mont., LLC, </em>2013 MT 106, \u00b6\u00b6 43-46, 370 Mont. 8, 299 P.3d 832; <em>Kuszmaul v. Sterling Life Ins. Co., </em>2012 MT 154, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, 365 Mont. 390, 282 P.3d 665. Employees are entitled to the protection of Employers\u2019 policies during the time that the policies are in effect. <em>See </em>\u00a7 39-2-904(l)(c), MCA; Arthur L. Corbin, <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>vol. 1, \u00a7 4.2 (Joseph M. Perillo ed., rev. ed., West 1993) (\u201cAlthough an agreement is not a contract, it is not totally inoperative ... a rendition of performance, before any notice of revocation, binds the other party to pay the specified compensation.\u201d); <em>In re Certified Question, </em>443 N.W.2d 112, 119 (Mich. 1989) (quoting <em>Toussaint, </em>292 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>N.W.2d at 895) (\u201cEven though a ... policy may be modified or revoked, while such a policy remains in effect, \u2018the employer may not treat its promise as illusory\u2019 by refusing to adhere to the policy\u2019s terms.\u201d). <em>See also Gaglidari v. Denny\u2019s Rests., </em>815 P.2d 1362, 1367 (Wash. 1991) (employer\u2019s unilateral change in policy is not effective until employees receive reasonable notice of the change). These cases demonstrate that the law does not prevent an employer from reserving the right to end a fringe benefit previously extended to its workers, so long as that benefit has not been made an express term of the employment contract, the employer provides the promised benefits while they are in effect, and the employer provides notice before the benefit is terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\u00b622 The cases cited by the Dissent are not to the contrary. Dissent, \u00b6 34. All but one involved allegations that the employer terminated the employee in violation of policies then in effect. <em>See Zaccardi v. Zale Corp., </em>856 F.2d 1473 (10th Cir. 1988); <em>Swanson v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>826 P.2d 664 (Wash. 1992); <em>Guz v. Bechtel Natl., Inc., 8 </em>P.3d 1089 (Cal. 2000). The other points out that a handbook creates contractual rights only to benefits accrued before a policy change. <em>See Russell v. Bd. of Co. Comms., </em>952 P.2d 492, 502 n. 39 (Ok. 1997) (citing <em>Langdon v. Saga Corp., </em>569 P.2d 524, 527-28 (Ok. App. 1976) (\u201can employer\u2019s personnel manual providing for certain employee benefits (vacation and severance pay) created a contractual basis for a terminated employee\u2019s claim to those accrued benefits. The <em>policy statement </em>incorporated into the personnel manual was a contract defining the employment relationship during the period the policy was in effect.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AkZ\">\u00b623  Given their express reservation of the right to end the benefit, the Employers\u2019 change in their policy to allow a CIB Pay-Out Benefit did not bind them to continue the benefit for all current employees in perpetuity. We conclude that Employers effectively disclaimed any intent to contract, and the element of mutual consent was not established. The District Court did not err in determining that the handbook was not a standardized group employment contract and that Employers therefore were permitted to terminate the CIB PayOut Benefit. In considering the next issue, we address whether the CIB Pay-Out Benefit already had accrued when the policy was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u00b624 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in its determination that the CIB Pay-Out Benefit was not deferred compensation or wages under the Montana Wage and Wage Protection Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u00b625 Plaintiffs next argue that the CIB Pay-Out Benefit constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>deferred compensation that vested at the time the Pay-Out Benefit was implemented. Plaintiffs concede that Employers may make unilateral policy changes, but argue that such changes may be applied prospectively only. Therefore, Plaintiffs reason, they have a right to be compensated for the CIB hours they earned prior to Employers\u2019 termination of the benefit. As discussed above, the CIB is a benefit created to supplement an employee\u2019s salary during an extended illness or injury. It is thus a safety net to sustain an employee\u2019s income until she can return to work or be eligible for disability benefits. Employees are required under the policy to use their short-term accrued sick leave before they may dip into their CIBs. An employee\u2019s CIB hours may not be transferred to other employees. CIB hours are carried over from year to year and-except for the twenty-five-year employees under the 2002 policy-are uncompensated. Employees claim that they nonetheless accrued the benefit at the time the hours were banked. They reason that because the hours were accrued, they became wages earned, compensation for which was merely deferred until they reached twenty-five years of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\">\u00b626 Section 39-3-204(1), MCA, requires that an employer pay its employees \u201cthe wages earned by the employee ... .\u201d Section 39-3-201(6)(a), MCA, defines wages as \u201cany money due an employee from the employer ... .\u201d The statute does not specifically include sick leave. \u201cThe obligation to pay wages only exists to the extent agreed upon between the employee and the employer.\u201d <em>Harrell v. Farmers Educ. Coop. Union of Am., </em>2013 MT 367, \u00b6 40, 373 Mont. 92, 314 P.3d 920. We have made clear that \u201cpersonal time, as a matter of law, does not automatically qualify as \u2018wages\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 39-3-201(6)(a), MCA. <em>McConkey v. Flathead Elec. Coop., </em>2005 MT 334, \u00b6 22, 330 Mont. 48, 125 P.3d 1121. Only when an employer \u201chas obligated itself to pay money for earned but unused personal time [does] there exist[] an obligation to pay wages ... .\u201d <em>McConkey, </em>\u00b6 22. The right to earn compensation for personal time may be subject to reasonable restrictions and conditions precedent. <em>Langager, </em>\u00b6 30; <em>McConkey, </em>\u00b6 24. A condition precedent is a condition that \u201cis to be performed before some right dependent thereon accrues or some act dependent thereon is performed.\u201d Section 28-1-403, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b627  WTiether Plaintiffs had earned the right to be compensated for their accumulated CIB hours prior to the Employers\u2019 discontinuance of the CIB Pay-Out Benefit is answered by the language of the policies. The portion of the handbook explaining the Pay-Out Benefit stated that \u201cCIB benefits are not payable upon termination ... with one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>exception; CIB hours will be paid out to employees who have completed a minimum of twenty-five years of service.\u201d This exception imposes a condition precedent; before an employee is entitled to compensation for his or her unused CIB hours upon termination, the employee must have reached twenty-five years of service. Plaintiffs\u2019 CIB hours are not \u201cearned, due, and owing\u201d for any purpose other than paid time off of work for extended illness or injury. <em>McConkey, </em>\u00b6 22. This condition is similar to one we found unobjectionable in <em>Langager, </em>which required employees to reach two years of service before earning the right to use paid vacation time. <em>Langager, </em>\u00b6 28. What Plaintiffs had accrued prior to the change in policy was the number of hours in their continued illness banks. They retain those accumulated sick leave hours for appropriate use during their continued employment. We conclude that Plaintiffs\u2019 CIB hours did not constitute deferred compensation or earned wages and Employers did not divest any benefit the Plaintiffs already accrued. Because Plaintiffs did not reach the twenty-five year milestone prior to discontinuance of the CIB PayOut Benefit, they had not earned the right to be paid for whatever CIB hours remained by the time of their eventual termination from employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b628 <em>3. Whether the District Court erred in its determination that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not apply to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b629 Plaintiffs also contend that Employers breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by ending the CIB Pay-Out Benefit. After determining that there was no contract, the District Court did not address this issue. \u201c[T]he implied covenant is a mutual promise that the contracting parties will not attempt, through dishonesty or abuse of discretion in performance, to deprive each other of <em>the benefits of the contract.\u201d Phelps v. Frampton, </em>2007 MT 263, \u00b6 38, 339 Mont. 330, 170 P.3d 474 (emphasis in original). We have made clear that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not attach in the absence of an enforceable agreement. <em>Phelps, </em>\u00b6 33 (citing <em>GRB Farm v. Christman Ranch, Inc., </em>2005 MT 59, \u00b6 15, 326 Mont. 236, 108 P.3d 507; <em>Cate v. First Bank, </em>262 Mont. 427, 432-33, 865 P.2d 277, 279 (1993); <em>McNeil v.

Because the payout of CIB hours was not an accrued right or a term of an enforceable agreement, Employers\u2019 termination of the benefit could not breach the covenant. We conclude that the District Court did not err in determining that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not apply to Plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b631 The District Court\u2019s order granting Employers\u2019 motion for summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b395-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, RICE and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b395-6\">JUSTICE WHEAT</p>\n<p id=\"ABb\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u00b632 I dissent from the Court\u2019s holding that no contract exists regarding the CIB policy. A disclaimer in an employee handbook, standing alone, cannot support summary judgment dismissal of this contract claim. The District Court reads the handbook\u2019s disclaimer as proof that the Employers never meant to be bound by the benefits. But the conduct of a party may manifest assent even though it does not, in fact, intend to assent. Restatement 2d Contracts \u00a7 19(3) (1981). The question, as the majority states, is whether the Employers\u2019 outward manifestations could cause a reasonable person to conclude that they intended to be bound by the benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\u00b633 Questions of reasonableness can be either questions of fact or questions of law. <em>Walters v. Getter, </em>232 Mont. 196, 200, 755 P.2d 574, 577 (1988). When surrounding circumstances are in dispute, the question of reasonableness is at least partially one of fact and requires resolution by the trier of fact. <em>Walters, </em>232 Mont. at 200, 755 P.2d at 577; <em>Steichen v. Talcott Properties, LLC, </em>2013 MT 2, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19, 368 Mont. 169, 292 P.3d 458. Assent to contract occurs when a reasonable person could conclude, based on a party\u2019s outward manifestations, that the party intended to be bound by the contract. <em>Olsen v. Johnston, </em>2013 MT 25, \u00b6 11, 368 Mont. 347, 301 P.3d 791. The evaluation of assent to contract requires the consideration of all surrounding circumstances. <em>Bitterroot Int\u2019l Sys v. Western Star Trucks, Inc., </em>2007 MT 48, \u00b6 33, 336 Mont. 145, 153 P.3d 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">\u00b634 Disclaimers in employer handbooks or policies do not automatically negate assent to contract; rather, they must be examined in the context of all circumstances, representations, and practices of the employer. <em>Zaccardi v. Zale Corp., </em>856 F.2d 1473, 1476-77 (10th Cir. 1988); <em>Russell v. Bo. of Co. Comms., </em>952 P.2d 492, 502 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>(Okla. 1997); <em>Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc., </em>8 P.3d 1089, 1103-04 (Cal. 2000); <em>Swanson v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>826 P.2d 664, 676 (Wash. 1992) (quotations and citations omitted) (\u201c[e]ven if a disclaimer appears in the same handbook as the relied upon policy, summary judgment may be inappropriate .... The disclaimer must be read by reference to the parties\u2019 norms of conduct and expectations founded upon them.\u201d). In essence, a disclaimer is only one relevant fact in the dispute over whether a reasonable person could conclude that a party assented to contract. A factual issue arises if the disclaimer is present in one manual but is absent in a later, more detailed expression of employer policy. <em>Swanson, </em>826 P.2d at 676. A disclaimed handbook may still give rise to a contract when the handbook is only considered a \u201cguide\u201d for employer-employee relations. <em>Zaccardi, </em>856 F.2d at 1477. Disclaimer validity is also questionable when the disclaimed policy was instituted in the face of labor unrest. <em>Swanson, </em>826 P.2d at 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b635 A factual dispute clearly exists as to whether the Employers negated the disclaimer through their outward manifestations. Employers\u2019 written policy manual contains no disclaimer, yet it is more detailed than the handbook, listed as controlling, continually updated, referenced in employment contracts, and relied on as authority by HR staff. The handbook at issue, on the other hand, is described as a guide to Employers\u2019 policies, and ends its disclaimer with a reference to the actual binding policies of the Employers: \u201cPlease note that the terms of the written policies are controlling.\u201d That inconsistency alone raises a factual issue as to whether a reasonable person could believe the Employers intended to be bound. Like in <em>Swanson, </em>the CIB policy was instituted to quell unrest amongst the staff and prevent employee unionization. Finally, plaintiffs alleged that Employers had honored previous benefits by grandfathering in all employees who were hired before a change was instituted, thus demonstrating they saw themselves as bound by the benefits. In the face of these facts, the handbook disclaimer is hardly persuasive and certainly not dispositive. A factual dispute arises as to whether whether a reasonable person could believe that the Employers intended to be bound, and the disclaimer is only one piece of evidence in that dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b636 Even if the disclaimer\u2019s terms were indisputable, I am unconvinced that it has any sway over the actual terms of employment. It is -undisputed that employees entered into an employment agreement, and those agreements incorporated the Employers\u2019 policies and procedures as outlined in the manual, not the handbook. In <em>Marias Healthcare Servs., </em>policies and provisions of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>employer were directly incorporated in the employment contract by reference. <em>Marias Healthcare Servs. v. Turenne, </em>2001 MT 127, \u00b6 17, 305 Mont. 419, 28 P.3d 491. Since the employment contract itself was adequately bargained for, the incorporated policies bound both the employer and employee. <em>Marias Healthcare, </em>\u00b6 18. That is exactly the case here. The CIB policy was not instituted by the handbook. The CIB policy was part of an undisclaimed company policy which was incorporated directly into the initial employment contract. According to the deposition of the Employers\u2019 human resources officer, \u201cthe overriding and controlling document of the employment relationship is the Northwest Healthcare official policies and procedures manual,\u201d and not the handbook. When parties have apparent intent to incorporate policies into an employment contract, that incorporation is not defeated merely because an employer reserves the right of unilateral amendment. <em>Zuelsdorf v. University of Alaska, </em>794 P.2d 932, 934-35 (Alaska 1990) <em>(citing Moore v. Utah Technical College, </em>727 P.2d 634, 641-42 (Utah 1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\">\u00b637 Finally, although not addressed by today\u2019s majority, the employees provided valuable, bargained-for consideration in exchange for the CIB policy. Any benefit conferred upon the promisor constitutes good consideration for a promise. Section 28-2-801, MCA. In <em>Langager, </em>we found sufficient consideration when an employee merely received notice of a policy and attended employee meetings to give input about the policy. \u00b6 20. In <em>Hernandez, </em>we found that consideration exists when an employee agrees to a policy at the time of hiring. \u00b6\u00b6 19-20. Employees here had the CIB policy incorporated into their employment agreement by reference to the Employers\u2019 policy manual. Under the policy, retention increased 100% under the policy and banked sick leave hours increased by over 300%. Employers received, and expected to receive, good consideration in the form of a direct benefit from the CIB policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b638 The District Court erred by granting summary judgment solely based on the disclaimer. Evidence in the record raises a factual dispute over whether the Employers manifested their intent to be bound. I would remand this case for a trier of fact to decide whether a valid contract had been formed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b397-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH joins the dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
