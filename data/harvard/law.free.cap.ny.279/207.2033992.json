J.</author>\n<p id=\"AN7\">The complaint in this action was dismissed on motion made under rule 107 of the Rules of Civil Practice, subdivision 6, on the ground that the cause of action did not accrue within the time limited by law for the commencement thereof. The complaint is brought upon a promissory note which, if it be under seal, comes within the twenty-year Statute of Limitations. The question presented on the motion was whether the note was a sealed instrument merely because it had opposite the maker\u2019s name the word <em>\u201c </em>Seal,\u201d and, if not, whether a question of fact was presented calling for a trial, whereon the plaintiff would have the burden of proving that the note was intentionally sealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">On the 10th day of March, 1925, A: J. Richey and his wife, Dorothy D. Richey, of Dade county, Florida, entered into a contract to sell real property in Florida to the present defendant, Jean G. V\u00e9netos. The contract called for installment payments secured by promissory note. The contract was concededly under seal. The complaint alleges the contract, and that the amount of the purchase price was past due and owing; that the Richeys tendered to the defendant a good and sufficient deed conveying good and marketable title, and demanded payment of the note sued upon; and that the defendant refused to pay or accept the deed. The note in question was signed and executed in Brooklyn, New York, March 10, 1925, for $12,183.50, payable at the Corn Exchange Bank, Flatbush Avenue Branch, in Brooklyn. It is Signed \u201c J. G. V\u00e9netos ('Seal).\u201d The word \u201c seal \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>is printed on the paper, so that we may assume that it was there at the time Venetos signed the note. A. J. Richey, the payee of the note, transferred his interest therein to the plaintiff. According to the authorities in this State, this promissory note is not a sealed instrument, in the absence of any explanation as to how or under what circumstances it was made, or any statements or facts showing an intention on the part of the maker to adopt the seal or to create a sealed instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><em>Matter of Pirie </em>(198 N. Y. 209) related to an ordinary form of promissory note bearing the name of the maker and, after the signature, a seal. There was nothing in the body of the note or the signing of it which indicated that it was intended to be a sealed instrument. This court said: \u201c Ordinarily a seal affixed to a paper in the form of a promissory note changes it into a sealed instrument, which, under the Statute of Limitations, may run for twenty years; but the mere attaching of a seal after the signature does not raise a presumption that the note is a sealed instrument, unless there be a recognition of the seal in the body of the instrument, by some such phrase as <em>1 </em>witness my hand and seal \u2019 or <em>\u2018 </em>signed and sealed.\u2019 The reason for this is that the mere attaching of a seal after a signature without any recognition of it in the body of the note or in connection with the signing, in the absence of evidence showing the time when, and the person by whom, the seal was affixed, would open the door to frauds and forgeries and enable evil-disposed persons to prevent the running of the six-years\u2019 Statute of Limitations, by merely attaching at the end of the note a seal. Under such circumstances a seal is regarded merely as surplusage and the character of the note is not changed\u201d (p. 215).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">This rule of the <em>Pirie </em>case has been followed by the courts of this State and in other States, and recognized as the rule of New York in the text books. We again referred to it in <em>Empire Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Heinze </em>(242 N. Y. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>475, 479), which related to an instrument described as having been signed and sealed, but which in fact lacked a seal. We said, referring to section 44 of the General Construction Law (Cons. Laws, ch, 22), which defined the nature of a seal: <em>\u201c </em>Intention, therefore, cannot make a seal where this provision has not been complied with. * * * The reverse of this proposition does not hold true. The seal annexed to an ordinary obligation like a promissory note does not necessarily make it a sealed instrument, in the absence of any indication that such was the intention.\u201d (Citing <em>Matter of Pirie.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Again, in <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(273 N. Y. 172, 178), we noted that in the body of the instruments the parties had recited that they attached their seals \u201c thereby establishing their intention concerning the sealing of the instrument,\u201d citing the <em>Pirie </em>case. The authority of the <em>Pirie </em>case has been recognized in <em>Brooklyn Public Library </em>v. <em>City of New York </em>(222 App. Div. 422; affd., 250 N. Y. 495); <em>Drexler-Rochester Properties, Inc., </em>v. <em>Paris </em>(236 App. Div. 409), where, at page 410, the court said: \u201c The use of the letters \u2018 L. S.\u2019 appearing after the signature of a party to an instrument not required by law to be under seal is not alone sufficient to constitute the instrument subscribed a sealed instrument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">In <em>Caputo </em>v. <em>DiLoretto </em>(110 Conn. 413) a promissory note was signed by the defendant on a line at the end of which in brackets was the word \u201c seal.\u201d It was held that the instrument was not a contract under seal, and that the six-year Statute of Limitations applied. The court said: \u201c To constitute such an instrument a contract under seal there must therefore be some recognition of the fact on the face of the instrument, other than the mere addition of such word or letters, * * * The fact that the maker of the instrument himself wrote the word <em>\u2018 </em>seal \u2019 or the letters \u2018 L. S.\u2019 after his signature at the time that he executed it, or that the instrument was one whose validity was dependent upon its being under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>seal, might indicate his intention \u201d (p. 416). The <em>Pirie </em>case (198 N. Y. 209) was cited as an authority. (See, also, <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>208 N. C. 202; and to the same effect, <em>Matter of Stamford Road Construction Co., </em>5 Fed. Supp. 651, which cites not only <em>Matter of Pirie, </em>198 N. Y. 209, but <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Esler, </em>143 N. Y. 374, which preceded the <em>Pirie </em>case as an, authority upon the same point; 1 Williston on Law of Contracts, \u00a7 209, p. 419; 25 Am. &amp; Eng. Encyclopaedia of Law [2d ed.], p. 76; <em>Breitling </em>v. <em>Marx, </em>123 Ala. 222; <em>Buckingham </em>v. <em>Orr, </em>6 Col. 587; <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Kingsbeery, </em>68 Ga. 828; <em>Bradley Salt Co. </em>v. <em>Norfolk Importing &amp; Exporting Co., </em>95 Va. 461; 19 Am. &amp; Eng. Annotated Cases, p. 678.)</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The statement in the <em>Pirie </em>case, that there must be recognition in the instrument of the seal, was nothing new to the law, as it is found in <em>Newbold </em>v. <em>Lamb </em>as early as 1819 (5 N. J. L. 449). (See, also, Brannan\u2019s Negotiable Instruments Law [6th ed.], p. 191; 34 Yale Law Journal, p. 786; 4 N. Y. Law Review, p. 432; American Law Institute, Restatement of the Law of Contracts, N. Y. Annotations, vol. 1, \u00a7 100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The statement in the headnote of <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Gantz </em>(140 N. Y. 249, 250) is misleading because under the letters \u201c L. S.\u201d was the phrase, <em>\u201c </em>Sealed and delivered in the presence of John Weber,\u201d and beneath this an acknowledgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The law, therefore, of this State is well established and has been followed and recognized, as before stated, in other courts. A promissory note bearing a signature, after which come the printed letters \u201c L. S.\u201d is not <em>in and of itself </em>sufficient to constitute a specialty, a sealed instrument. There must be in the instrument some acknowledgment or recognition of the seal or else there must be proof that it was the intention of the parties to make it a sealed instrument. This proof may refer to words spoken or to circumstances of execution leading to the inference that the parties intended to use the seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>The <em>Pirie </em>case recognized that such proof might be forthcoming by citing <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Henning </em>(10 W. Va. 596, 631), which stated: \u201c To constitute a sealed instrument, there must be a seal or scroll affixed, and some recognition of it in the instrument, or some evidence of it <em>aliunde; </em>but it can never be maintained that such evidence, whether by the proof of witnesses or acknowledgment of the party, will not supply the place of such recognition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">The affidavit of the defendant on the motion to dismiss the complaint stated that when the note was signed there was nothing said nor was there anything discussed, nor was there any intention that the note be considered a sealed instrument within the purview of the statute. The plaintiff met this by the affidavit of A. J. Richey, the payee. He denies that it was never the intention to seal the note but, on the contrary, asserts that the defendant did intend to affix his seal, and that the note was given in connection with the real estate transaction; that the note was given as part of a consideration for an instrument under seal, <em>\u201c </em>and that it was understood between the parties to the contract and to the note that both were to be sealed instruments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">We think these allegations are sufficient to create a question of fact regarding the nature of this instrument. Standing alone and by itself, unexplained, it is not a sealed instrument, but in view of these denials and allegations, the plaintiff may prove that it was the intention of the parties to make it a sealed instrument, and that the maker understood that he was adopting the seal. The burden is on the plaintiff, but the issue of fact is here and must be tried out. The plaintiff must have an opportunity to present all the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">For these reasons the judgment of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the order of the Special Term affirmed, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Lehman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Av3\">(concurring for reversal). The promissory note was signed by the defendant in Brooklyn on March 10, 1925, and mailed by the defendant to the payee, A. J. Richey, in Florida pursuant to a contract under seal for the purchase of lands in Florida. A printed form was used with script or typewriting inserted in the blank spaces on the printed form. At the end of the space intended for a signature, in which the defendant wrote his name, appears the printed word \u201c (seal).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">This action was not begun within six years after the note was due. In <em>Merritt </em>v. <em>Cornell </em>(1 B. D. Smith, 335), decided by the Court of Common Pleas in 1852, it was said: \u201c At the present day, the distinction between sealed and unsealed instruments has almost ceased to exist, except in respect to the period of limitation of actions upon them \u201d (p. 338). That period is fixed by statute and the Legislature there has continued the old distinction and has provided that: <em>\u201c </em>an action upon a sealed instrument must be commenced within twenty years after the cause of action has accrued.\u201d (Civ, Prac. Act, \u00a7 47.) The question presented upon this appeal is whether the promissory note which the plaintiff in this action seeks to enforce is a <em>\u201c </em>sealed instrument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u201c The private seal of a person, other than a corporation, to any instrument or writing shall consist of a wafer, wax or other similar adhesive substance affixed thereto, or of paper or other similar substance affixed thereto, by mucilege or other adhesive substance, or of the word <em>\u2018 </em>seal/ or the letters c L. S.\u2019 opposite the signature.\u201d (General Construction Law [Cons. Laws, ch. 22], \u00a7 44.) <em>\u201c </em>A contract under seal is a contract expressed in a writing which is sealed and delivered by the promisor.\u201d (American Lawjfnstitute, Restatement of the Law of Contracts, \u00a7 8.) Dispute may at times arise whether the substance affixed to the instrument was affixed by_the obligor or adopted by him as his seal; whether the obligor -wrote the words or letters opposite his signature or adopted as bis seal such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>words or letters previously written or printed upon the paper. Such dispute has arisen in this case and, without waiting for a trial, the courts below have granted summary judgment determining that the note is not a sealed instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">In <em>Matter of Pirie </em>(198 N. Y. 209) the court laid down the rule to be applied by the court when such a dispute arises: \u201c Ordinarily a seal affixed to a paper in the form of a promissory note changes it into a sealed instrument, which, under the Statute of Limitations, may run for twenty years; but the mere attaching of a seal after the signature does not raise a presumption that the note is a sealed instrument, unless there be a recognition of the seal in the body of the instrument, by some such phrase as \u2018 witness my hand and seal \u2019 or \u2018 signed and sealed.\u2019 The reason for this is that the mere attaching of a seal after a signature without any recognition of it in the body of the note or in connection with the signing, in the absence of evidence showing the time when, and the person by whom, the seal was affixed, would open the door to frauds and forgeries and enable evil-disposed persons to prevent the running of the six-years\u2019 Statute of Limitations, by merely attaching at the end of the note a seal. Under such circumstances a seal is regarded merely as surplusage and the character of the note is not changed\u201d (p. 215). That statement of the applicable rule has been followed in all subsequent cases in this State, and is in accord with decisions in many other jurisdictions. (See 1 Williston on Law^of Contracts [Revised ed.], \u00a7 209.) We are agreed that there should be no departure from that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In this case there is no \u201c recognition of the seal in the body of the instrument \u201d but it does appear from an inspection of the instrument and from the affidavits of the parties that the word \u201c seal \u201d was printed opposite the signature of the defendant at the time when he signed the instrument and put it in circulation. Thus we have here indisputable evidence \u201c showing the time when, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>the person by whom, the seal was affixed,\u201d which was wanting in the <em>Pirie </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Though this evidence destroys what we said in <em>Matter of Pirie </em>was the \u201c reason \u201d for the rule that, in the absence of recognition of the seal in the body of the instrument, no presumption arises that the note is a sealed instrument, yet it is now said that even this evidence must be supplemented by other proof that it was \u201c the intention of the parties to make it a sealed instrument.\u201d Undoubtedly it must appear that such intention did exist; the problem, however, is whether in this case the evidence is sufficient to permit or even dictate a finding that the intention did exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Certainly the position of the printed word t\u00a3 seal \u201d immediately after the defendant\u2019s signature leads fairly to the inference that the defendant saw that word and put the note in circulation knowing that it was there. Perhaps he did not, in fact, <em>intend </em>to indicate thereby that the note was to be considered a sealed instrument, but he manifested such intention by his acts. The word <em>\u201c </em>seal \u201d in that position constitutes the seal of the person signing the instrument, as \u00a3\u00a3 seal \u201d is defined by the statute, and gives the note the appearance of a sealed instrument. It could not have any other purpose. Not the undisclosed intention of a party to a contract but the intention manifested by his acts or words, is the measure of his obligation. So here, evidence that the defendant put in circulation an instrument bearing what is, in law, his seal establishes that the note is a \u00a3\u00a3 sealed instrument.\u201d It is not disputed that the instrument was executed and delivered by the defendant and had a valid inception. The defendant should not be heard to say that he intended that the instrument should have a legal effect different from that which a person receiving it would be justified in ascribing to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">That is the general rule as formulated in the Restatement of the Law of Contracts:</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Section 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u201cA seal is a piece of wax, a wafer or other substance, affixed to the paper or other material on which a promise, release or conveyance is written, or a scroll or sign, however made, on such paper or other material, or an impression made thereon; provided that by a recital or by the appearance of the document an intention of the promisor, releasor or grantor is manifested that the substance, scroll, sign or impression shall be a seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u201c Comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">* * * Hs * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u201c Under the Section the question whether a seal is upon a document is to be determined from the document itself. Evidence of extrinsic circumstances is not admissible to prove or disprove this. Such circumstances may, however, be shown to aid the determination of the questions whether a promisor affixed or adopted a seal (see | 98) and whether the document has been delivered * * * <em>&gt;&gt;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Section 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">\u201c (1) A promisor who delivers a written promise to which a seal has been previously affixed or impressed with apparent reference to his signature, thereby adopts the seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\"><em>\u201c (2) </em>A promisor who delivers a written promise to which a seal has been previously affixed or impressed with apparent reference to the signature of another party to the document, is presumed to have adopted the seal unless extrinsic circumstances show a contrary intention.</p>\n<p id=\"AoI\"><em>\u201c </em>Comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">\u201c a. Under the rule stated in subsection (1) extrinsic evidence is not admissible; under the rule stated in subsection (2) such evidence is admissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">Nothing to the contrary was said or decided in <em>Matter of Pirie (supra) </em>or in <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Esler </em>(143 N. Y. 374), or any other cases in this court; nor have our decisions been generally construed as stating a different rule. (Cf. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>authorities cited in the opinion of Crane, Ch. J.) True, the unexplained presence of a seal upon a note is not ' itself sufficient proof that the maker \u201c intended to, or did, affix it \u201d <em>(Weeks </em>v. <em>Esler), </em>but proof that the maker did affix the \u201c seal \u201d or put the note in circulation bearing what is apparently his <em>\u201c </em>seal \u201d is sufficient. The weight of authority including the cases cited in <em>Matter of Pirie </em>support that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The judgment should be reversed, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">O\u2019Brien, Hubbs and Finch, JJ., concur with Crane, Ch.
