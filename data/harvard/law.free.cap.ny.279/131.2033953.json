Kelly </em>for John Thompson et al., respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4K7\">That part of the order of April 22, 1938, denying the motion for a reargument is clearly not appealable and cannot be reviewed in the Court of Appeals. <em>(Doyle </em>v. <em>Hamilton Fish Corp., </em>207 N. Y. 751; <em>Hooper </em>v. <em>Beecher, </em>109 N. Y. 609; <em>White </em>v. <em>Benjamin, </em>150 N. Y. 258; <em>Fleischmann </em>v. <em>Stern, </em>90 N. Y. 110.) That part of the order of April 22, 1938, denying the motion to amend the record on appeal and remittitur is not appealable, not only because such an order is, in its nature, a discretionary order, but for the further reason that the court specifically stated that the motion was denied in the exercise of discretion. <em>(White </em>v. <em>Benjamin, </em>150 N. Y. 258; <em>Matter of Westerfield, </em>163 N. Y. 209; <em>Matter of Baldwin, </em>158 N. Y. 713; <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Page, </em>85 N. Y. 123; <em>Haydorn </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>225 N.

Y. 128.) While the executor was a party to the appeal at the Appellate Division, the executor is not a party aggrieved within the statutory meaning of that expression and the appeal taken by the executor from the order of reversal must be dismissed. <em>(Bryant </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>128 N. Y. 426; <em>Isham </em>v. <em>N. Y. Assn. for Poor, </em>78 App. Div. 396; 177 N.

The words \u201c heirs, executors, administrators and assigns \u201d in the will are words of substitution and not words of limitation. <em>(Matter of Murphy, </em>165 App. Div. 783; 215 N.

Y. 449.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b165-6\">Loughran, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuC\">This is a proceeding brought by an executor for settlement of its account and for the construction of a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Nellie V. Thompson directed that her residuary estate be divided into two equal portions. One portion she gave to her sister, Hannah W. O\u2019Hara. The other she gave in equal shares to her brother, Bryan W. O\u2019Hara, and to her husband\u2019s sister, Elizabeth Thompson. <em>\u201c </em>These two portions,\u201d says the will, \u201c are given absolutely and in fee simple to these legatees, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns forever.\u201d Elizabeth Thompson predeceased the testatrix and was survived only by a brother and nephews and nieces. The Surrogate ruled that the words we have quoted were to be construed as words of limitation, with the result that the gift to Elizabeth Thompson lapsed. The Appellate Division held that the words were to be construed as words of substitution, with the result that a lapse was prevented and the gift went to Elizabeth Thompson\u2019s distributees.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">The foregoing provisions of the will stand quite apart. We find nothing elsewhere in the instrument that colors them or suggests a special purpose in their use. The gift is \u201c to these legatees, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns.\u201d The disjunctive word \u201c or \u201d is no part of the context. In such circumstances, as orneases plainly say, the words can be construed only as mere words of limitation. <em>(Matter of Wells, </em>113 N. Y. 396; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number><em>Matter of Tamargo, </em>220 N. Y. 225. Cf. <em>Matter of Evans, </em>234 N. Y. 42; Decedent Estate Law [Cons. Laws, ch. 13], \u00a7 29.) The ruling of the Surrogate must, therefore, be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">A question of practice remains. Under the ruling of the Surrogate, the legatees Hannah W. O\u2019Hara and Bryan W. O\u2019Hara take the whole residuary estate. They have not themselves appeared in this proceeding. Before the Surrogate, the executor contended that the gift to Elizabeth Thompson had lapsed. On the appeal by Elizabeth Thompson\u2019s distributees to the Appellate Division, the executor, as respondent, maintained that the ruling of the Surrogate was right. As appellant here, the executor takes the same stand. Elizabeth Thompson\u2019s distributees, as respondents here, move to dismiss its appeal on the ground that the executor is not a party aggrieved by the result in the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">We agree that the executor has no interest in the issue sufficient to entitle it to be heard in this court solely upon its own account. <em>(Bryant </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>128 N. Y. <em>426; Isham </em>v. <em>N. Y. Assn. for Poor, </em>177 N. Y. 218; <em>Matter of Chapal, </em>278 N. Y. 495.) It appears, however, that throughout this proceeding the executor undertook to represent the legatees Hannah W. O\u2019Hara and Bryan W. O\u2019Hara and that this appeal was taken by it at their request. We see no reason for denying the competency of the executor so to act in their behalf. The consequence of a contrary view would be that any party to a fiduciary\u2019s accounting would be at the peril of a technical default unless he made an independent appearance at every stage of the proceeding. We are not prepared to impose so rigorous a requirement \u2014 at least where, as in this instance, only questions of law were involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court affirmed, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division payable out of the estate to all parties appearing separately and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>filing briefs. The motion to dismiss the appeal from the order of reversal should be denied, without costs. The appeal from the order of the Appellate Division denying a motion to bring in parties, for a reargument, and to amend the record on appeal and the remittitur, should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Lehman, Hubbs and Finch, JJ., concur; Crane, Ch. J., O\u2019Brien and Rippey, JJ., dissent on the question of the construction of the will. All concur as to denial of motion to dismiss appeal from order reversing decree of Surrogate and as to dismissal of appeal from order denying motion to bring in parties, for a reargument and to amend the record on appeal and the remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Ordered accordingly. (See 279 N. Y. 789.)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
