The room should be as cool as possible. After cleaning, garments should be hung outdoors or in a well ventilated room with cross draft until thoroughly dry.\u201d Plaintiff read and understood these instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">She used nearly all the contents of the container in cleaning eight dresses. The cleaning was done in a small bathroom where the temperature was 83 degrees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>there was no cross-draft. As each dress was cleaned, it was hung up in the same room to dry. Plaintiff\u2019s husband, who was in an adjacent room, called out to her <em>\u201c </em>that the odors were very strong and disagreeable.\u201d After she had been so engaged for forty-five minutes, plaintiff was made sick by the fumes of the fluid. A judgment against defendant for the consequent damages has been affirmed as modified. The action is in form one for breach of an implied warranty of merchantability.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">We think the evidence conclusively shows that the plaintiff failed to use reasonable care in the use of the fluid and that this default was an essential cause of her illness. We do not pass upon any other question.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The judgments should be reversed and the complaint dismissed, with costs in all courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Crane, Ch.
