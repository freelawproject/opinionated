The subsequent shipment to the address designated by the customer cannot affect the previous transfer of title or possession. <em>(Van Brocklen </em>v. <em>Smeallie, </em>140 N.

The Enabling Act (L. 1934, ch. 873) does not forbid the taxation of the transactions involved. These transactions are not related to interstate commerce, being separate and distinct from the later shipments. Hence, the tax was imposed upon local transactions occurring long before movement across State lines had begun. <em>(Henneford, </em>v. <em>Mason Co., </em>300 U.

The facts here are not in dispute. The contracts for the sale of the goods in question, expressly in some cases and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>otherwise by implication or by the usages of the trade, required delivery by the seller at his own expense at points outside the territorial limits of the city of New York. Delivery was, in fact, so made in each case. Since the transactions were not consummated until such deliveries were made at the place and time and in the manner provided for, the transactions were not taxable under the above acts by the city of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Crane, Ch. J., Lehman, O\u2019Brien, Hubbs, Loughran, Finch and Rippey, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
