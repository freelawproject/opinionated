We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>The facts relevant to this appeal have been set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court; <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Angliker, </em>15 Conn. App. 297, 544 A.2d 246 (1988); but can be briefly summarized as follows. Shortly after being employed by the department of mental health as a forensic treatment specialist in 1983, the plaintiff allegedly witnessed numerous incidents of verbal and physical abuse of patients by some of the staff members at Whiting Forensic Institute. On October 21, 1983, the plaintiff was discharged after making several complaints regarding that abuse to his supervisors and officials at Whiting. The plaintiff secured employment at another institution soon thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">In January, 1984, the plaintiff<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a complaint in the Superior Court against the defendants, Colin Angliker, the director of the Whiting Forensic Institute, and Audrey M. Worrell, the commissioner of the state department of mental health, in their official capacities, alleging that they had discharged him because he had exercised his first amendment rights and that the defendants\u2019 actions were in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 31-51q.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff claimed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>case for the jury docket, and the defendants subsequently filed a motion to strike, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 282,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> arguing that there was no right to a jury trial under \u00a7 31-51q. The trial court denied the defendants\u2019 motion and a jury trial commenced on July 22, 1986.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff awarding him $9000 for present and future loss of earnings, $1 for emotional distress and $26,752.50 for punitive damages. The plaintiff was also awarded $3000 by the trial court for attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"pAz\">On September 30,1986, the defendants appealed the judgment to the Appellate Court, arguing, in relevant part, that the trial court erred in denying their motion to strike the case from the jury docket. Specifically, the defendants maintained that the plaintiff did not have a right to a jury trial in an action brought against the state pursuant to \u00a7 31-51q.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Addressing the defendants\u2019 claim of error, the Appellate Court correctly set forth the standards used to determine whether a party is entitled to a trial by jury. \u201cThe constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 19, states that \u2018[t]he right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate.\u2019 This particular provision of our constitution has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>been consistently construed by Connecticut courts to mean that if there was a right to a trial by jury at the time of the adoption of the provision, then that right remains intact. See, e.g., <em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Boschen, </em>143 Conn. 159, 165, 120 A.2d 546 (1959) . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Mention, </em>12 Conn. App. 258, 263, 530 A.2d 645 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Weisser, </em>9 Conn. App. 255, 257, 518 A.2d 655 (1986) , cert. denied, 202 Conn. 803, 519 A.2d 1207 (1987).\u201d <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Angliker, </em>supra, 15 Conn. App. 302; see also <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>v. <em>Spring Brook Dairy, Inc., </em>135 Conn. 294, 297, 64 A.2d 39 (1949). It is generally held that the right to a jury trial \u201cexists not only in cases in which it existed at common law and at the time of the adoption of constitutional provisions preserving it, but also exists in cases substantially similiar thereto. . . . \u201d 47 Am. Jur. 2d, Jury \u00a7 17; <em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Boschen, </em>supra. At common law, \u201clegal claims [were] tried by a jury, [and] equitable claims [were] tried by a court . . . . \u201d <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>68 Conn. 273, 286, 36 A. 55 (1896); <em>Dawson </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>78 Conn. 96,100, 61 A. 101 (1905). Equitable actions, therefore, are not within the constitutional guarantee of trial by jury. <em>Franchi </em>v. <em>Farmholme, Inc., </em>191 Conn. 201, 210, 464 A.2d 35 (1983); <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>v. <em>Spring Brook Dairy, Inc., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Moreover, General Statutes \u00a7 52-215,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provides that as a matter of right \u201ccivil actions involving such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>issue of fact as, prior to January 1, 1880, would not present a question properly cognizable in equity\u201d should be entered on the docket as jury cases upon proper request. Section 52-215 goes on to state that certain enumerated actions and \u201call other special statutory proceedings, which, prior to January 1,1880, were not triable by jury,\u201d shall be tried to the court without a jury. The right that the plaintiff seeks to enforce is statutory and was legislatively created in 1983. In <em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Boschen, </em>supra, 164-65, we stated, however, that the term \u201c \u2018special statutory proceedings\u2019 cannot be construed, under the constitutional provisions guaranteeing jury trials, to mean any cause of action whatsoever, simply because it is authorized by an enactment of the legislature. If it could, the legislature, by the process of giving legislative sanction to common-law causes of action, could, in the course of time, obviate the guarantee of jury trial completely. . . . The test is whether the issue raised in the action is substantially of the same nature or is such an issue as prior to 1818 would have been triable to a jury.\u201d See also <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>v. <em>Spring Brook Dairy, Inc., </em>supra, 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Accordingly, in determining whether a party has a right to a trial by jury under the state constitution and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>\u00a7 52-215, the court must ascertain whether the action being tried is similar in nature to an action that could have been tried to a jury in 1818 when the state constitution was adopted. This test requires an inquiry as to whether the course of action has roots in the common law, and if so, whether the remedy involved was one in law or equity. If the action existed at common law and involved a legal remedy, the right to a jury trial exists and the legislature may not curtail that right either directly or indirectly. <em>Franchi </em>v. <em>Farmholme, Inc., </em>supra; <em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Boschen, </em>supra; <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>v. <em>Spring Brook Dairy, Inc., </em>supra; <em>Windham Community Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Windham, </em>32 Conn. Sup. 271,273, 350 A.2d 785 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Applying this test, the Appellate Court, stated that \u201cit is clear that [the plaintiffs] cause of action, if it existed at all prior to 1818, would have been barred under the doctrine of sovereign immunity,\u201d and, therefore, concluded that the trial court erred in denying the defendants\u2019 motion to strike the case from the jury docket. <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Angliker, </em>supra, 15 Conn. App. 304. We agree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">In discussing the doctrine of sovereign immunity, this court has stated that \u201c \u2018because the state can act only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>through its officers and agents, a suit against a state officer concerning a matter in which the officer represents the state is, in effect, against the <em>state.\u2019 Sentner v. Board of Trustees, </em>184 Conn. 339, 342, 439 A.2d 1033 (1981). In its pristine form the doctrine of sovereign immunity would exempt the state from suit entirely, because the sovereign could not be sued in its own courts and \u2018there can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends.\u2019 <em>Kawananakoa </em>v. <em>Polyblank, </em>205 U.S. 349, 353, 27 S. Ct. 526, 51 L. Ed. 834 (1907); <em>Bergner </em>v. <em>State, </em>144 Conn. 282, 284-85, 130 A.2d 293 (1957).\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>204 Conn. 17, 31, 526 A.2d 1318 (1987); <em>Fetterman </em>v. <em>University of Connecticut, </em>192 Conn. 539, 550-51, 473 A.2d 1176 (1984). Although the \u201cabsolute bar of actions against the state has been greatly modified both by statutes effectively consenting to suit in some instances as well as by judicial decisions in others\u201d; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>supra, 31; it was not until the enactment of \u00a7 31-51q in 1983 that this bar was removed in suits against the state for wrongful discharge due to an employee\u2019s exercise of his or her first amendment rights. No principle of common law, prior to 1818, <em>allowed actions against the state </em>for wrongful discharge or related claims. Such actions, with or without a jury, simply did not exist against the state in 1818. In fact, the plaintiff conceded at oral argument that his claim would have been barred by sovereign immunity before 1818.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">We are not implying that the right to a jury trial does not exist in any cause of action that was not specifically recognized at common law in 1818. \u201cThe historical test we apply is flexible and may require a jury in a new cause of action, not in existence in [1818], if it involves rights and remedies of the sort traditionally enforced in an action at law or if its nearest historical analogue is an action at common law.\u201d <em>Goar </em>v. <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>pania Peruana de Vapores, </em>688 F.2d 417, 427 (5th Cir. 1982); <em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Boschen, </em>supra. But this flexible approach does not mandate a jury in this case. \u201cThe cases that have required jury trials for new causes of action have involved legislative enhancement or creation of rights and duties in circumstances where the common law enforced similiar rights and duties. See <em>Pernell </em>[v. <em>Southall Realty, </em>416 U.S. 363, 370-76, 94 S. Ct. 1723, 40 L. Ed. 2d 198 (1974)]; <em>Curtis </em>[v. <em>Loether, </em>415 U.S. 189, 195, 94 S. Ct. 1005, 39 L. Ed. 2d 260 (1974)]. They did not involve removal or modification of blanket immunity, which creates enforceable rights and duties in circumstances where none existed before.\u201d <em>Goar v. Compania Peruana de Vapores, </em>supra. Accordingly, to entitle one to a right to a jury trial, \u201cit is not enough that the nature of the plaintiffs action is \u2018legal\u2019 rather than equitable; the action must also be brought against a defendant who was suable at common law in [1818].\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Shipping Corporation of India, </em>653 F.2d 875, 883 (4th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 982,102 S. Ct. 1490, 71 L. Ed. 2d 691 (1982); cf. <em>Municipal Authority of City of McKeesport </em>v. <em>Elizabeth Township, </em>57 Pa. Commw. 13, 426 A.2d 182, aff'd, 498 Pa. 476, 447 A.2d 245 (1981) (no right to jury trial in suit against a municipal authority because the municipal authority did not exist when constitution adopted). Because the state was immune from suit in 1818 for this type of action, the plaintiff now has no right to a jury trial brought against the state under \u00a7 31-51q.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Our analysis draws support from cases involving claims for a jury trial under the seventh amendment<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to the federal constitution in suits brought against the United States. Applying a historical test similar to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>one set forth above,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court has held that the seventh amendment does not apply to suits against the government, because these \u201care not suits at common law within its true meaning.\u201d <em>McElrath </em>v. <em>United States, </em>102 U.S. 426, 429, 26 L. Ed. 189 (1880); <em>Lehman </em>v. <em>Nakshian, </em>453 U.S. 156,162 n.9, 101 S. Ct. 2698, 69 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1981) (\u201c[t]he reason that the Seventh Amendment presumption in favor of jury trials does not apply in actions at law against the United States is that the United States is immune from suit, and the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial, therefore, never existed with respect to a suit against the United States\u201d); <em>Glidden Co. </em>v. <em>Zdanok, </em>370 U.S. 530, 572, 82 S. Ct. 1459, 8 L. Ed. 2d 671 (1962) (suits against government requiring as they do waiver of immunity are not suits at common law within the meaning of the seventh amendment); <em>Galloway </em>v. <em>United States, </em>319 U.S. 372, 388, 63 S. Ct. 1077, 87 L. Ed. 1458 (1943).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Since it cannot be maintained that under the common law in 1818 a jury trial was a matter of right for persons asserting a claim against the sovereign, the right to a jury trial in this case will exist only if the legislature, in \u00a7 31-51q, has made the right applicable. Id., 388-89. Section 31-51q does not explicitly state that persons bringing actions under it are entitled to a trial by jury. The plaintiff argues, however, that in light of the language of \u00a7 31-51q and its legislative history, it is clear that the legislature intended to provide a legal, and not equitable, remedy and, therefore, it implicitly consented to a trial by jury. In addition, the plaintiff claims that because the legislature has specifically denied the right to a trial by jury in other statutes and it failed to do so in \u00a7 31-51q, we should assume that it intended to consent to a jury trial in \u00a7 31-51q actions. While the plaintiffs arguments may be valid in a suit against a private employer, it is important to remember that the instant action is one against the sovereign. Discussing the right to a jury trial in actions against the government under the seventh amendment to the federal constitution, the United States Supreme Court has stated that \u201cthe plaintiff has a right to a trial by jury only where that right is one of \u2018the terms of [the Government\u2019s] consent to be sued.\u2019 <em>[United States </em>v. <em>Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 399, 96 S. Ct. 948, 47 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1976)]. Like a waiver of immunity itself, which must be \u2018unequivocally expressed,\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>[445 U.S. 535, 538,100 S. Ct. 1349, 63 L. Ed. 2d 607, reh. denied, 446 U.S. 992,100 S. Ct. 2979, 64 L. Ed. 2d 849 (1980)], quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>King, </em>395 U.S. 1, 4, [89 S. Ct. 1501, 23 L. Ed. 2d 52 (1969)], \u2018this Court has long decided that limitations and conditions upon which the Government consents to be sued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>must be strictly observed and exceptions thereto are not to be implied.\u2019 <em>Soriano </em>v. <em>United States, </em>352 U.S. 270, 276 [77 S. Ct. 269, 1 L. Ed. 2d 306 (1957)]. See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kubrick, </em>444 U.S. 111, 117-18 [100 S. Ct. 352, 62 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1979)]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sherwood, </em>[312 U.S. 584, 590-91, 61 S. Ct. 767, 85 L. Ed. 1058 (1941)].\u201d <em>Lehman </em>v. <em>Nakshian, </em>supra, 160-61; see also <em>DeFonce Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>State, </em>198 Conn. 185,188, 501 A.2d 745 (1985); <em>McKinley </em>v. <em>Musshorn, </em>185 Conn. 616, 621, 441 A.2d 600 (1981) (statutes waiving government immunity must be strictly construed). When the state, by statute, waives its immunity to suit, as it has in \u00a7 31-51q, the right to a jury trial cannot be implied, but rather, must be affirmatively expressed. <em>Lehman </em>v. <em>Nakshian, </em>supra; see <em>Grandison </em>v. <em>United States Postal Service, </em>696 F. Sup. 891, 893 (S.D.N.Y. 1988); <em>Baer </em>v. <em>Abel, </em>648 F. Sup. 69, 77 (W.D. Wash. 1986); <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>United States Postal Service, </em>635 F. Sup. 190, 192 (N.D. Ga. 1986) (no right to a jury trial unless affirmatively granted).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Neither \u00a7 31-51q nor any other statute in Connecticut contains a specific provision for jury trials for wrongful discharge.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Accordingly, because no cause of action in these circumstances existed against the state in 1818, let alone the right to a jury trial, and the legislature has not specifically provided for a jury in \u00a7 31-51q actions, the Appellate Court was correct in concluding that the plaintiff was not entitled to a trial by jury in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-7\"> On appeal to this court, the Connecticut Trial Lawyers Association filed a brief as amicus curiae.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 31-51q. liability op employer for discipline OR DISCHARGE OF EMPLOYEE ON ACCOUNT OF EMPLOYEE\u2019S EXERCISE OF certain constitutional rights.

Whether the right to a jury trial exists under \u00a7 31-51q in cases against a private employer is not before us and, therefore, will not be addressed in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\"> The seventh amendment to the United States constitution states in relevant part: \u201cIn Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved <em>. \u201d</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b397-6\"> In determining whether there is a right to jury trial under the seventh amendment, the United States Supreme Court applies a historical test in which it looks to see whether a similar cause of action was triable to a jury when the constitution was adopted in 1791. <em>Pernell </em>v. <em>Southall Realty, </em>416 U.S. 363, 94 S.
