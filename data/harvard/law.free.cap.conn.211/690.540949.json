The dispositive issue is whether a right to appeal from a decision of this commission exists under the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq. We conclude that the record is inadequate to make such a determination and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">On November 16, 1987, the commission voted to revoke certain permits that it had issued to the plaintiff Connecticut Air Service, Inc. (ConnAir), which authorized ConnAir to do business as a fixed base operator (FBO) at the Danbury Municipal Airport. ConnAir appealed this decision to the Superior Court. The commission filed a motion to dismiss the action claiming that no statutory basis exists for such an appeal and, therefore, the court was without jurisdiction to entertain the matter. In response to the motion, ConnAir argued that the commission is an \u201cagency\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (1)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that a right of appeal therefore exists under the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 4-183.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On August 4, 1988, the trial court found that the commission is not an agency within the meaning of \u00a7 4-166. Finding no other authority for an appeal, the trial court concluded that it was indeed without jurisdiction, granted the motion to dismiss and rendered a judgment of dismissal. ConnAir appealed that decision to the Appellate Court. We thereafter transferred the matter to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">On appeal, ConnAir first renews its argument that the commission is an \u201cagency\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4-166 (1) and therefore its decisions are appealable pursuant to \u00a7 4-183. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the commission is a \u201cstate . . . commission\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4-166 (1) and, therefore, all of its decisions are appealable as a matter of right under the UAPA. We do not agree that the commission is such an agency.</p>\n<p id=\"pAG\">The responsibility for insuring the general public interest and safety for those traveling in aircraft Connecticut reposes in the commissioner of transportation (commissioner). General Statutes \u00a7 15-41.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In furtherance of this mandate, the commissioner is charged with the enforcement of all statutes, regulations and other laws of this state concerning aeronautics. General Statutes \u00a7 15-44.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The commissioner has statutory powers to conduct investigations, inquiries and hearings concerning aeronautical matters. General Statutes 15-45.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Statutes and regulations that the commissioner is required to enforce include those relating to operations of aircraft while either the pilot or the aircraft is not properly licensed; the revocation or suspension of the right to operate aircraft that are not in an airworthy condition; the revocation or suspension of the licenses of unqualified or chemically dependent pilots; the inspection of airports, restricted landing areas, heliports, air schools, flying clubs and air navigational facilities; the unlawful use of, tampering with, or interference with aircraft; tampering with or interference with any airport, heliport landing field or airway and its associated equipment; investigation of aircraft accidents; the careless, negligent or reckless operation of aircraft; the acquisition of land and airspace for the use of aircraft, airports, heliports, restricted landing areas, as well as areas that may be hazardous to airports; the removal of obstructions to air navigation; the establishment and maintenance of clear zones for all public airport runways; the disposition of abandoned aircraft; the operation of aircraft by those who are under the influence of alcohol or drugs or the carriage of passengers who are under the influence of alcohol or drugs; and finally, the establishment of airport approach plans.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">It is evident that the commissioner possesses comprehensive powers with respect to the supervision and enforcement of virtually every aspect of aeronautical activity within the state. These obligations and duties are not limited to those activities carried on by the state or those occurring solely on or over state property, but also include aeronautical activities conducted within the confines of any municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">For its part, the Danbury Aviation Commission derives its authority from Connecticut Special Act No. 381 of the January session of the 1947 General Assembly.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number><footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is specifically authorized \u201cto make and enforce local rules, regulations and ordinances concerning ground and <em>flying activities on or over town property at airports, </em>and <em>to provide for compliance with the enforcement of federal and state laws, rules and regulations relating to aeronautics. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 25 Spec. Acts 580, No. 381, \u00a7 1 (3). This special act is the only enumeration of the commission\u2019s powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">General Statutes \u00a7 15-80 also authorizes municipalities to establish aviation commissions such as the one here in issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Such commissions are only empowered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>however, to administer local ordinances that concern airports, landing fields and aeronautics. Danbury has never enacted any local ordinances concerning its airport, landing fields or aeronautics. In fact, the sole reference to the commission in the Danbury Code of Ordinances is found in \u00a7 2-40 and states: \u201cSaid commission shall have all of the powers and duties established by the statutes of the State of Connecticut and special acts of the State of Connecticut and the ordinances of the Town and City of Danbury pertaining to airports and airport commissions.\u201d Neither General Statutes \u00a7 15-80, Special Act No. 381, nor the Danbury Code of Ordinances provides for an appeal from the rulings of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">In furtherance of its special act mandate, the Dan-bury Aviation Commission adopted a comprehensive set of \u201cRules and Regulations for the Use of Danbury Municipal Airport.\u201d These rules and regulations require written permission before commencement of \u201cany construction on City property or on <em>adjacent </em>property.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Rules and Regulations for the Use of Danbury Municipal Airport \u00a7 7.6. Further, all permittees (which includes FBOs) are to \u201cabide by all rules and regulations promulgated by the Commissions or the [Federal Aviation Administration] necessary for the safe operation of the Airport <em>including, but not limited to, flight and ground operations on, or in the vicinity of, the Airport.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., \u00a7 7.10. The commission, therefore, undertakes to regulate and control not only operations within the airport boundaries, but also operations adjacent to city property and within the vicinity of the airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Thus, we are confronted with the anomalous situation that separate legislative enactments empower both the commissioner of transportation and the Danbury Aviation Commission to exercise parallel and overlapping authority in connection with aeronautical activi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>ties within the Danbury area. Since the legislature, through its enabling statutes, has charged the commissioner of transportation with the supervision and control of virtually every aspect of aeronautical activity conducted within the state, including that carried out at a municipal level, we conclude that such supervision and control is principally a state function and duty.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Berlin Board of Education, </em>167 Conn. 368, 372, 355 A.2d 265 (1974). Since Special Act No. 381 empowered the commission to exercise nearly identical supervisory powers and duties within the Danbury environs, we conclude that to the extent that these powers and duties are congruent, in those areas that do overlap, the local commission\u2019s activities could only be carried out as an agent of the commissioner of transportation. As an agent, the commission, therefore, is not, in and of itself, a \u201cstate . . . commission\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4-166 (1) and, therefore, its decisions do not, per se, qualify for appellate review under the UAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The acts of an agent, however, are ascribable or chargeable to the principal. <em>Robert Lawrence Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Del Vecchio, </em>178 Conn. 1,13, 420 A.2d 1142 (1979); <em>West Haven </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>174 Conn. 392, 395, 389 A.2d 741 (1978). Therefore, to the extent that the commission was in fact acting as an agent, its decisions made while acting in such a capacity would be chargeable to its principal, the commissioner of transportation, a person who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>is clearly a \u201cstate. . . officer\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4-166 (1) and from whose decisions an appeal unquestionably lies under the UAPA. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">\u201cAlthough the finding of an agency relationship is ordinarily a question of fact; <em>Beckenstein </em>v. <em>Potter &amp; Carrier, Inc., </em>[191 Conn. 120,133, 464 A.2d 6 (1983)]; <em>Conte </em>v. <em>Dwan Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., </em>172 Conn. 112, 124, 374 A.2d 144 (1976) . . . unless the statutory scheme permits a finding of an agency relationship, there is no factual question to resolve.\u201d <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Housing Authority, </em>208 Conn. 161,184-85, 544 A.2d 1185 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Such a statutory scheme being evident here, the issue of whether an agency relationship actually exists becomes a question of fact. This relationship must be shown to exist with respect to the precise issue that is the subject matter of the appeal. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Berlin Board of Education, </em>supra, 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">' The complaint alleges that the commission revoked ConnAir\u2019s permits \u201cfor the alleged nonpayment of certain fees and charges\u201d; that the commission\u2019s actions were based in part upon the \u201calleged failure to permit certain inspections of its property for safety purposes\u201d; and that its decision was based in part \u201con charges which were not specified in the notice of the hearing.\u201d If an evidentiary hearing discloses that the factual basis of the commission\u2019s decision involved aeronautical activities in which the commission was acting as an agent for the commissioner of transportation (such as the use of unsafe airplanes or unqualified pilots), then such a decision could well be appealable under the UAPA. If, however, despite the existence of an agency relationship in certain other areas, the subject matter of the dismissal involved solely a local matter (such as the nonpayment of locally determined charges or fees), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>then the required agency relationship as to that subject would not exist and access to the appellate process via the UAPA would not be available. Absent a finding as to the factual basis for the commission\u2019s decision, however, we cannot make a determination as to the existence or nonexistence of an agency relationship between the commission and the commissioner of transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The commission further contends that even if it is an \u201cagency\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4-166 (1), ConnAir has no right to appeal under General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a), which provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a] person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal under this chapter . . . . \u201d In the present case, the commission argues that the proceedings below did not constitute a \u201ccontested case.\u201d \u201cContested case\u201d is defined in \u00a7 4-166 (2) as \u201ca proceeding, including but not restricted to rate-making, price fixing and licensing, in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are required by statute to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for hearing or in which a hearing is in fact held . . . . \u201d According to the commission, the proceedings below did not constitute a contested case because no legal rights were determined and no statutory right to a hearing existed. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">A legal right was determined in the proceedings below as ConnAir\u2019s complaint alleges that its permits, until revoked, authorized it to conduct its business and carry out a livelihood on airport premises. A determination with respect to one\u2019s right to earn one\u2019s occupation or means of livelihood constitutes a determination with respect to a \u201cproperty right\u201d; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number><em>Connecticut Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Tirozzi, </em>210 Conn. 286, 295, 554 A.2d 1065 (1989), citing <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Burson, </em>402 U.S. 535, 539, 91 S. Ct. 1586, 29 L. Ed. 2d 90 (1971); <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>207 Conn. 346, 353-54, 542 A.2d 672 (1988); <em>Leib </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners for Nursing, </em>177 Conn. 78, 83, 411 A.2d 42 (1979); <em>Hart Twin Volvo Corporation </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>165 Conn. 42, 45, 327 A.2d 588 (1973); and, therefore, involves a legal right. Moreover, to the extent that an agency relationship is found to exist between the commission and the commissioner, the proceeding that was held below would qualify as a hearing required under \u00a7 4-166 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Accordingly, if, on remand, an agency relationship is found to exist between the commissioner and the commission, a hearing involving the determination of a legal right will be deemed to have taken place thereby making the proceeding below a \u201ccontested case\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4-166 (2). As a contested case, it will qualify for appellate review under \u00a7 4-183 (a) of the UAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the matter is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In this opinion, Peters, C. J., Callahan and Glass, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (1) provides in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Agency\u2019 means each state board, commission, department or officer ... authorized by law to make regulations or to determine contested eases.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b709-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 provides in part: \u201cAPPEAL TO SUPERIOR COURT, (a) A person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal under this chapter . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b710-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 15-41 provides: \u201cThe commissioner may perform such acts, issue and amend such orders, and make and amend such reasonable general or special regulations and procedure and establish such minimum standards, consistent with the provisions of this chapter, as he deems necessary or appropriate, and which are commensurate with and for the purpose of protecting and insuring the general public interest and safety, the safety of persons receiving instruction concerning, or operating, using or traveling in, aircraft, and of persons and property on land or water, and to develop and promote aeronautics in this state.

In construing the definition of \u201cagency\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 to include municipal commissions to the extent that they perform state functions, the majority follows <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Berlin Board of Education, </em>167 Conn. 368, 355 A.2d 265 (1974), in which this court held that a town board of education was a \u201cstate board\u201d and thus an \u201cagency\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4-166 from which an appeal was authorized in a contested case. The court reasoned that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>local board was a \u201cstate board\u201d because it had long been held that in Connecticut, except for budgetary-matters, local boards of education serve as agents of the state in their communities. Id., 372-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">In response to <em>Murphy, </em>the legislature, in 1975, amended the definition of \u201cagency\u201d in \u00a7 4-166 by the enactment of Public Acts 1975, No. 75-529, to exclude local boards of education specifically.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court in <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>181 Conn. 69, 75-76, 434 A.2d 333 (1980), concluded that the amendment was a \u201clegislative declaration of the meaning of the original act,\u201d citing as one reason for this conclusion the fact that \u201cit was not readily apparent that local or regional boards of education would constitute state boards or agencies under the UAPA as originally enacted.\u201d I view <em>Lee </em>as a rejection of the position adopted in <em>Murphy </em>that a local board or commission becomes a state agency for the purpose of an appeal under the UAPA whenever it performs a state function.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">There are other local agencies, in addition to local boards of education and local aviation commissions, where there is some overlap of regulation or function between the municipality and the state. For example, local traffic authorities in erecting signs or signals on local streets are required to comply with state traffic commission standards. General Statutes \u00a7 14-236. Local building officials enforce the state building, fire and demolition codes. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 29-252 (d), 29-298 (c), 29-404. In many of these situations statutes expressly provide for rights of appeal apart from the UAPA. If we adopt the view that a local agency becomes a state agency when performing a state function, these separate appeal provisions become superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>It may well be desirable for there to be a right of appeal from a decision of any municipal agency, similar to the right provided by the UAPA to appeal from decisions of state agencies in contested cases. Since the right of appeal has always been regarded as wholly statutory, however, I am inclined to let the legislature continue to pick and choose those situations in which it is to be made available.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Accordingly, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 15-52 provides in part: \u201cNo person whose right to operate any aircraft in this state has been suspended or revoked shall operate any aircraft during the period of such suspension or revocation.
