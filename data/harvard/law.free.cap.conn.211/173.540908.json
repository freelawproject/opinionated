Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACq\">In this appeal, the plaintiff challenges the damages that she was awarded in connection with the defendant\u2019s condemnation of her property for highway reconstruction purposes. This appeal from a trial referee\u2019s reassessment of the commissioner of transportation\u2019s original assessment of damages involves three claims of error: (1) that the trial referee erred in failing to view the condemned property; (2) that the trial referee erred in failing to consider the unique characteristics and special use to which the property had been put; and (3) that the trial referee improperly admitted certain evidence. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">A review of the record reveals the following. The condemned property is located on River Street in the town of Waterford. The property is located just south of Route 156 and is divided into two parcels by River Street, which runs southerly from, and perpendicular to, Route 156. The smaller of the two parcels is approximately .24 acres in size, with 200 feet of frontage on the Niantic River, and the larger parcel, which is located immediately across River Street from the smaller parcel, is approximately .82 acres. Improvements on the property include a mobile home that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>plaintiff occupied, a storage building, formerly a fish market, that is in fair condition, two small sheds that are in poor condition, and a cooler building that is in fair condition. The property is serviced by two septic systems and has two docks on the Niantic River. According to the plaintiff, the larger property has an unpaved area on which seventy-five to one hundred cars can be parked.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In addition to residing at the condemned property, the plaintiff had operated a head boat fishing business from the location. The trial court specifically found that the plaintiffs property \u201cwas being used as the site of a party fishing boat operation.\u201d The plaintiff docked her sixty-five foot vessel, the <em>Black Hawk, </em>at the docks jutting from her property and ran two fishing trips daily from mid-April to October 31. Each trip could accommodate up to seventy-six persons and each patron would spend between $15 and $40 per trip, according to the plaintiff. In 1987, the plaintiff had a net income of approximately $55,000 from this business. The trial referee found that the \u201chighest and best use of the property would be the continuation of the present use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The date of the taking was September 25, 1987. At that time, the state paid the plaintiff $416,000, the amount of the department of transportation\u2019s assessment of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">In her action for reassessment of the damages before the trial referee, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 lSa-76,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the plaintiff introduced the testimony of John B. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Flint, a real estate appraiser. Flint testified that he estimated the value of the property at $695,000 as of the taking date. He arrived at this figure by using a comparable sales analysis to value the land at $624,000, and by using a cost approach analysis to value the improvements at $71,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The state\u2019s appraiser, Edgar Russ, testified that the value of the condemned property as of the taking date was $437,000. Russ valued the improvements at $46,500.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both appraisers agreed that the highest and best use of the property was its continued use as the base of operations for a head boat fishing business.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">After hearing the testimony of the experts and testimony from the plaintiff on May 23,1988, the trial referee issued a memorandum of decision on June 13, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>1988. In that memorandum, the trial referee stated: \u201cFrom the evidence, the Court concludes that the fair market value of the premises at the time of taking to be $461,000. The plaintiff has been paid $416,000. Judgment may enter for the plaintiff to recover $35,000, the balance of the award, together with interest from September 25,1987, plus costs and expenses as follows: Appraiser, John B. Flint, $3,500.\u201d In a corrected memorandum of decision, the trial referee stated: \u201cFrom the evidence, the Court concludes that the fair market value of the premises at the time of taking to be $451,000. The plaintiff has been paid $416,000.\u201d Apparently, this corrected memorandum was to correct the discrepancy between the value of the property and balance due under the original memorandum of decision. The plaintiff appealed the trial referee\u2019s decision to the Appellate Court and we transferred the case to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s first claim of error is that the trial referee erred in failing to view the condemned property as required by General Statutes \u00a7 13a-76. Additionally, the plaintiff claims that she did not waive that requirement. Although we agree with the plaintiff that the viewing requirement is mandatory, we disagree with her contention that she did not waive the requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The only discussion of the view requirement at trial appears on the first transcribed page of the trial proceedings. After the parties stipulated that the taking date was September 25,1987, the trial referee declared, \u201cI do not intend to view the premises, because I\u2019m familiar with the area. I\u2019ve had a number of\u2014,\u201d to which the plaintiff\u2019s counsel interrupted and said, \u201cWell, Your Honor, this is a rather \u2014it\u2019s a business that\u2019s been taken on the river; and my client would like it viewed.\u201d The trial referee responded by saying, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll hear the evidence. If I decide that it\u2019s necessary, I\u2019ll see it.\u201d Aside from a comment by the trial referee later that he had not seen the property since the time that there was a fish market there, this exchange is the only discussion during the trial relevant to the plaintiff\u2019s first claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">General Statutes \u00a7 13a-76 provides that in a reassessment appeal before a trial referee, the referee \u201cshall view the land.\u201d In the absence of contrary legislative intent, we construe the term \u201cshall\u201d as imposing a mandatory requirement. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Bemer, </em>200 Conn. 400, 402-403, 510 A.2d 992 (1986); see <em>Lo Sacco </em>v. <em>Young, </em>210 Conn. 503, 507, 555 A.2d 986 (1989); cf. <em>Tramontano </em>v. <em>Dilieto, </em>192 Conn. 426, 433-34, 472 A.2d 768 (1984). The defendant does not offer, nor have we found, any indication of contrary legislative intent that would require us to construe \u201cshall\u201d other than as mandatory in this case. Our determination that the view requirement under General Statutes \u00a7 13a-76 is mandatory, however, does not end our inquiry. Although mandatory, the requirement can be waived. <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Highway Commissioner, </em>152 Conn. 557, 558, 210 A.2d 176 (1965).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">In general, federal and state constitutional and statutory rights can be waived. See, e.g., <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>196 Conn. 309, 324, 493 A.2d 846 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1063, 106 S. Ct. 813, 88 L. Ed. 2d 787, reh. denied, 475 U.S. 1061, 106 S. Ct. 1290, 89 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1986); <em>Grecki </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>174 Conn. 200, 201-202, 384 A.2d 372 (1978). Waiver is the volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>tary, knowing and intelligent relinquishment of a right or privilege. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>199 Conn. 417, 443, 513 A.2d 620 (1986). \u201c \u2018Waiver does not have to be express, but \u201cmay consist of acts or conduct from which waiver may be implied. <em>Andover </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>153 Conn. 439, 445, 217 A.2d 60 [1966]. In other words, waiver may be inferred from the circumstances if it is reasonable to do so. <em>DiFrancesco </em>v. <em>Zurich General Accident &amp; Liability Ins. Co., </em>105 Conn. 162,168,134 A. 789 [1926].\u201d <em>Breen v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>[153 Conn. 633, 646, 220 A.2d 254 (1966)] (dissenting opinion).\u2019 <em>Novella </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>163 Conn. 552, 562, 316 A.2d 394 (1972).\u201d <em>Loda </em>v. <em>H. K. Sargeant &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>188 Conn. 69, 76, 448 A.2d 812 (1982). \u201cWaiver is a question of fact for the trier.\u201d Id. The individual conduct of both parties is relevant in determining whether a waiver has occurred. See <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Calise, </em>174 Conn. 567, 573, 392 A.2d 440 (1978). Because waiver is a factual issue, we must determine whether the trial referee\u2019s implied finding that the view requirement had been waived was \u201cclearly erroneous in view of the evidence.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>208 Conn. 404, 407, 544 A.2d 629 (1988); <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">In this case, we find that the trial referee\u2019s decision not to view the condemned property was not clearly erroneous. Following the referee\u2019s statement indicating that he did not intend to view the land, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel simply stated that his client would like it viewed. The referee then alternatively suggested that he would hear the evidence and then if he decided that viewing the property was necessary, he would do so. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel did not respond to the trial referee\u2019s statement. Thus, it was reasonable for the trial referee to infer from the plaintiff\u2019s silence that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>acquiesced to his approach to viewing the property. Furthermore, the plaintiff did not renew her request to have the property viewed during the trial. She had a prime opportunity to do this when the referee stated that he had not seen the property since the time that there was a fish market on it, but she did not.</p>\n<p id=\"pAV\">Similarly, at the closing of the trial and after both parties had rested, the trial referee said: \u201cI\u2019ll take the papers. You want to argue?\u201d Mr. Fitzgerald, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, replied: \u201cI have nothing to\u2014I think, Your Honor, the reports pretty much speak for themselves. I think His Honor has seen and heard Mrs. Hensley and Mr. Flint [plaintiff\u2019s appraiser].\u201d While this again presented the plaintiff with the opportunity to persist and bring home to the trial court her present claim on the viewing of the property, nothing was said. The defendant\u2019s counsel made no comment at that time. The plaintiff never took any exception to the trial court\u2019s stated position on a view of the property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is apparent on this record that the defendant\u2019s counsel acquiesced in the trial court\u2019s position. From this evidence, it was reasonable for the trial referee to find, under all of the circumstances, that the plaintiff had waived the mandatory viewing requirement, and thus his ruling was not erroneous.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The plaintiffs second claim is that the trial referee erred in determining the value of the condemned property because he did not take into consideration the unique characteristics of the property and the special use to which the property had been put. We disagree with the factual basis of the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">We do not dispute the plaintiffs claim that in assessing the value of property being taken by eminent domain, \u201cthe trier must take into consideration everything by which value is legitimately affected.\u201d <em>Wronowski </em>v. <em>Redevelopment Agency, </em>180 Conn. 579, 586, 430 A.2d 1284 (1980); <em>Tandet v. Urban Redevelopment Commission, </em>179 Conn. 293, 299, 426 A.2d 280 (1979); <em>Altman </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>144 Conn. 233, 240, 129 A.2d 358 (1957). This consideration includes \u201cthe existence on the plaintiff\u2019s] property of an established special business use combined with the many unusual characteristics of the property as factors which would enhance its fair market value.\u201d <em>Wronowski </em>v. <em>Redevelopment Agency, </em>supra; <em>Feigenbaum </em>v. <em>New Britain Housing Site Development Agency, </em>164 Conn. 254, 258, 320 A.2d 824 (1973). Our dispute with the plaintiffs claim, however, centers on her factual assertion that the trial referee did not consider her special use of the property. We note in passing that despite this claim, the plaintiff did not seek any articulation concerning it. See Practice Book \u00a7 4051.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The validity of this factual claim is again governed by the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review. Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>supra; <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>supra. The plaintiff claims that \u201cdespite the uncontradicted testimony and evidence presented to the Court regarding the unique characteristics and special use of the property, the Trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Referee fails to take into account these factors in reaching his determination of value. The Court simply makes the following broad based conclusion: \u2018From the evidence the court concludes that the fair market value of the premises at the time of the taking to be $461,000.00.\u2019 \u201d The plaintiff\u2019s factual assertion, however, is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">A review of the trial transcript reveals that the trial referee explicitly recognized the special nature of the plaintiff\u2019s business operation on her property. In cross-examining Russ, the state\u2019s appraiser, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel inquired as to whether Russ considered the plaintiff\u2019s use of the property in arriving at his appraisal. The following exchange between the plaintiff\u2019s counsel and the court then occurred: \u201cThe Court: Are you claiming the return on the\u2014her income from the property as high?</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u201cMr. Fitzgerald: I\u2019m claiming it\u2019s a speciality, Your Honor, and the Court has got to \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u201cThe Court: <em>It\u2019s a speciality, </em>but it\u2019s not too high for\u2014considering the fact that she puts in\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">\u201cMr. Fitzgerald: Well, she gets free rent too, Your Honor. That\u2019s worth something.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">\u201cThe Court: Well, she has the mobile home there.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">\u201cMr. Fitzgerald: Free rent. All her taxes are paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">\u201cThe Court: Out of her own pocket. It\u2019s an individual entity, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">\u201cMr. Fitzgerald: Yes, it\u2019s sole proprietorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">\u201cThe Court: So, it doesn\u2019t make any difference how she treats it.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-14\">\u201cMr. Fitzgerald: Well, I don\u2019t-</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>\u201cThe Court: But she\u2019s not making a lot of money there, $55,000 for an investment of 400 according to the last appraisal which Mr. Russ has, $437,000, isn\u2019t exactly a lot of money for the\u2014considering she puts\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u201cMr. Fitzgerald: $55,000 at 432 that\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s better than 12 percent, you can\u2019t get that across the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u201cThe Court: Well, that\u2019s debatable.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">\u201cMr. Fitzgerald: Well. All right, in any event.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">This discussion indicates that, contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s assertions, the trial referee did indeed take into consideration the unique characteristics and special use of the plaintiff\u2019s property; it appears, however, that he disagreed with the plaintiff\u2019s position on the importance of the special use.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">Significantly, in its memorandum of decision, the trial referee also noted that the property \u201cwas being used as the site of a party fishing boat operation,\u201d that the \u201cparty boat is 65 feet in length and makes two trips a day during the summer,\u201d and that both appraisers \u201cagreed that the highest and best use would be to continue as its present use.\u201d The trial referee himself made the declarative statement in its memorandum that \u201c[t]he highest and best use of the property would be the continuation of the present use.\u201d The referee\u2019s statement in his memorandum of decision, \u201c[f]rom the evidence, the Court concludes ...\u201d incorporates these findings. Because we conclude that the trial referee did consider the plaintiff\u2019s special use, his decision in this regard certainly was not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The plaintiffs final claim is that the trial referee erred in admitting four pages of the state\u2019s appraisal report. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In order for an error in an evidentiary ruling to be a reversible error, the court\u2019s ruling \u201c \u2018must be both wrong and harmful.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rokus </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>191 Conn. 62, 70, 463 A.2d 252 (1983), quoting W. Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 23; <em>Saphir </em>v. <em>Neustadt, </em>177 Conn. 191, 201, 413 A.2d 843 (1979). When there is a claim of inadmissibility based on irrelevancy, the claimant has the burden of showing that the ruling was both wrong and harmful. <em>Saphir </em>v. <em>Neustadt, </em>supra, citing <em>DeCarufel </em>v. <em>Colonial Trust Co., </em>143 Conn. 18, 21, 118 A.2d 798 (1955); <em>Senderoff v. Senderoff, </em>133 Conn. 300, 303, 50 A.2d 422 (1946); W. Maltbie, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">In the present case, the plaintiff objected to pages nineteen through twenty-two of the state\u2019s appraisal report on the ground that those pages contained data about land sales that were not comparable to the plaintiffs property. The plaintiff claimed that they were contained in the report \u201csimply to get a low figure.\u201d Russ claimed that he put them in the report because one of the sales involved property adjacent to that of the plaintiff and the other involved property 300 feet away from the plaintiff\u2019s land. The trial referee decided to admit them \u201cas informational only,\u201d and he advised the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that he could develop during cross-examination whether Russ used the figures in his appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>In her brief, the plaintiff does not claim that the trial referee considered these informational sales in reassessing damages. Furthermore, at oral argument, the plaintiff conceded that there was no indication that the challenged information was used in the referee\u2019s determination. Therefore, regardless of whether the evidence was properly admitted, there is no claim of harm and thus the plaintiff has failed to carry her burden of proof on this claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 13a-76 provides: \u201cappeal to superior court, reassessment OF DAMAGES OR BENEFITS BY TRIAL REFEREE. Any person claiming to be aggrieved by the assessment of such special damages or such special benefits by the commissioner may, at any time within six months after the same has been so filed, apply to the superior court for the judicial district within which such land is situated or, if said court is not in session, to any judge thereof for a reassessment of such damages or such benefits so far as the same affect such applicant, and said court or such judge, after caus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>ing notice of the pendency of such application to be given to said commissioner, shall appoint a state trial referee to make such reassessment of such damages or such benefits. Such trial referee, having given at least ten days\u2019 notice to the parties interested of the time and place of hearing, shall hear the applicant and said commissioner, shall view the land and take such testimony as such trial referee deems material and shall thereupon reassess such damages and benefits so far as they affect such applicant. If the amount of the reassessment of such damages awarded to any such property owner exceeds the amount of the assessment of such damages by the commissioner for such land, such trial referee shall award to such property owner such appraisal fees as such trial referee determines to be reasonable. If no appeal to the appellate court is filed within the time allowed by law, or if one is filed and the proceedings have terminated in a final judgment finding the amount due the landowner, the clerk shall send a certified copy of the assessment of the commissioner and of the judgment to the comptroller, who shall, upon receipt thereof, draw his order upon the treasurer in favor of the landowner for the amount due him as damages. The pendency of any such application for reassessment shall not prevent or delay the layout, extension, alteration, widening, change of grade or other improvement of any such highway. As used in this section, a trial referee means a referee appointed pursuant to subdivision (1) or (2) of- subsection (a) of section 52-434 and designated a trial referee pursuant to subsection (b) of said section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\"> Russ also used comparable sales analysis to value the land and cost approach analysis to value the improvements.
