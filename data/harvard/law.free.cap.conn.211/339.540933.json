E. Van Norstrand, the speaker of the House of Representatives for the 1985-1986 session. The dispositive issue is whether the trial court erred in concluding that the requested information was a preliminary draft within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (1) and (c) (1) and therefore exempt from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Examination of the record discloses that on March 7, 1986, the Journal Inquirer newspaper and two of its reporters sent a letter to the plaintiff, requesting a copy of the summary of the data he had obtained as the result of a survey of members of the Connecticut Bar Association evaluating various characteristics of the judges of the Superior Court. The survey was conducted in 1985-1986 by the plaintiff in his official capacity as the presiding officer of the House of Representatives, which body has the responsibility, together with the Senate, to pass upon the governor\u2019s nominees for judicial reappointment. The plaintiff sought to obtain information about those judges scheduled for reappointment in 1986. To this end, he sent out 8300 questionnaires to the members of the Connecticut Bar Association. The qualities of the individual judges evaluated included judicial integrity, demeanor, diligence, caseflow management, familiarity with current law, soundness of written rulings and worthiness for retention. Fifteen hundred completed questionnaires were returned. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>questionnaires included evaluations of judges who were not scheduled for reappointment in 1986, as well as those of judges who were.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The data thus acquired were thereafter compiled in a numerical format for all of the judges. Those with the least favorable ratings were reviewed by the plaintiff to determine which of them were scheduled for reappointment in 1986. After this, the information concerning judges not due for reappointment was excised from the final survey results. The plaintiff testified that the only purpose in gathering information about those judges whose terms were not expiring in 1986 was to ensure general statistical reliability. The excised data were not presented to the legislature or to any legislative committee nor were they used in any way in the legislative decisionmaking process.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">On March 11, 1986, the plaintiff sent a letter to the Journal Inquirer\u2019s reporter acknowledging that he had released the summary of data pertaining to judges who were being considered for reappointment in 1986, but that he refused to release the summary of data concerning the judges who were not being considered for reappointment in that year. On March 14, 1986, the Journal Inquirer and two of its staff filed a complaint with the FOIC requesting it to order the plaintiff to disclose the data concerning all of the judges. At a hearing conducted by the FOIC, the plaintiff argued that the excised portion of the summary of the data constituted a preliminary draft or note and was therefore exempt from disclosure pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-19 (b) (1) and (c) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">On June 11, 1986, the FOIC concluded that the requested information was not so exempt and ordered its disclosure. In so doing, the FOIC found that \u201cthe respondent did seriously and in good faith consider the effect upon disclosure to the public . . . [but] failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>to prove that the public interest in withholding such documents clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\u201d The FOIC further found that \u201cthe summary of the data pertaining to the judges is not a preliminary draft of a memorandum, prepared by a member of the staff of a public agency, which is subject to revision prior to submission to or discussion among the members of a public agency and therefore, it is not exempt under \u00a7 1-19 (c) (1).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">On June 26,1986, the plaintiff appealed this decision to the Superior Court. That court concluded that the requested information was indeed a preliminary draft or note and ruled that disclosure was therefore not required. The FOIC in turn appealed that decision to the Appellate Court. We thereafter transferred the matter to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Exemption Under General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (1)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (a) sets out the broad public right to inspect or copy agency records.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (1) exempts from the otherwise required disclosure \u201cpreliminary drafts or notes provided the public agency has determined that the public interest in withholding such documents clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\u201d As a threshold consideration, therefore, we must determine whether the requested material constituted \u201cpreliminary drafts or notes\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (1). In so doing, the words must be construed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>according to their commonly approved usage. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u201cPreliminary\u201d is defined as \u201csomething that precedes or is introductory or preparatory.\u201d As an adjective it describes something that is \u201cpreceding the main discourse or business.\u201d A \u201cdraft\u201d is defined as \u201ca <em>preliminary </em>outline of a plan, document or drawing <em>. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. By using the nearly synonymous words \u201cpreliminary\u201d and \u201cdraft,\u201d the legislation makes it very evident that preparatory materials are not required to be disclosed. The compilation of raw data here in issue was a preliminary document and therefore a draft because it contained data not required or germane to the eventual purpose for which the survey was undertaken and it was thereafter modified to excise the material that was irrelevant to its legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">The FOIC\u2019s argument that those data were neither \u201cpreliminary\u201d nor a \u201cdraft\u201d simply overlooks: (1) the common usage of the pivotal words contained in the exemption statute; (2) the fact that the data concerning judges not scheduled for reappointment were obtained solely to establish the statistical validity of the survey; and (3) the fact that the requested information was thereafter excised as irrelevant from the summary before it was circulated or used in the deliberative process. Had the purpose of the survey been to compile data with respect to all judges in the state which would thereafter be used in connection with their respective reappointments, whenever they might be, then the FOIC would be correct in asserting that the survey was not a <em>draft </em>document but rather a <em>completed </em>document. This, however, is not the factual circumstance that confronts us.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>With respect to the precise language of General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (1) here in issue, we have earlier stated that \u201cpreliminary drafts or notes reflect that aspect of the agency\u2019s function that precedes formal and informed decisionmaking. We believe that the legislature sought to protect the free and candid exchange of ideas, the uninhibited proposition and criticism of options that often precedes, and usually improves the quality of, governmental decisions. It is records of this preliminary, deliberative and predecisional process that we conclude the exemption was meant to encompass.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 332-33, 435 A.2d 353 (1980). The survey results concerning the judges who were not scheduled for reappointment constitute records falling within the predecisional process to which we referred in our earlier holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The fact that this data constituted \u201cpreliminary drafts\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (1) does not resolve the issue, however, as the statute further requires that the \u201cpublic agency has determined that the public interest in withholding such documents clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\u201d In this connection, the FOIC found that \u201cwhile the respondent did seriously and in good faith consider the effect upon disclosure to the public, the respondent failed to prove that the public interest in withholding such documents clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\u201d Such a statement misperceives what is required in order to qualify for the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Van Norstrand testified before the FOIC that the requested information concerned judges who would not be considered for reappointment for two to six years. He further testified that the survey results here in issue would not be used in making that determination. He posited that within two to six years, the information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>would be stale and to use it in the future reappointment process would be unfair to those judges. He also noted that the information being sought was not germane to any considerations then pending before the legislature. He further testified that releasing the information would affect the performance of sitting judges who received a low rating. He also testified that this release would affect assignment patterns by the judicial department and encourage \u201cjudge shopping.\u201d In light of all of these considerations, Van Norstrand concluded that the public interest in withholding the information clearly outweighed the public interest in disclosing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The FOIC\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe respondent failed to prove that the public interest in withholding such documents clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure\u201d demonstrates that the FOIC made an independent determination concerning what was in the public interest based upon Van Norstrand\u2019s testimony. This it cannot do. General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (1) specifically provides that preliminary drafts or notes are exempt from disclosure \u201cprovided the <em>public agency </em>[here Van Norstrand as speaker of the House of Representatives] <em>has determined </em>that the public interest in withholding such documents clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\u201cAlthough the statute places the responsibility for making that determination on the public agency involved, the statute\u2019s language strongly suggests that the agency may not abuse its discretion in making the decision to withhold disclosure. The agency must, therefore, indicate the reasons for its determination to withhold disclosure and those reasons must not be frivolous or patently unfounded.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 339. Here, Van Norstrand set out for the FOIC the various reasons that he considered in complying with the \u201cpublic interest\u201d aspect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>of the statute. Thereafter, the FOIC specifically concluded that \u201cthe respondent did seriously and in good faith consider the effect upon disclosure to the public.\u201d Having concluded that there had been a good faith consideration of the effect upon disclosure, and not having found an abuse of discretion, the FOIC had determined all that was required of it by statute to qualify the requested information for the exemption in issue, it having been earlier found that the material constituted a \u201cpreliminary draft or note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Exemption Under General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (c) (1)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">A conclusion that the requested information is not subject to disclosure under General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (1) does not mark the end of the required analysis, however, as the legislature supplemented the exemption statute in 1981 through its enactment of General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (c) (1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This statute provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>in part that \u201c[notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of this section, [i.e., General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (1)], disclosure shall be required of (1) interagency or intra-agency memoranda or letters, advisory opinions, recommendations or any report comprising part of the process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated, <em>except disclosure shall not be required </em>of a preliminary draft of a memorandum, prepared by a member of the staff of a public agency, which is subject to revision prior to submission to or discussion among the members of such agency.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">In analyzing this statute, we must again construe the words used according to their commonly approved usage. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). While the language initially removes many kinds of material from the exempt status, this additional requirement for disclosure is immediately qualified in two important respects. First, the material to be disclosed must \u201c[comprise] part of the process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.\u201d Second, disclosure \u201cshall not be required of a preliminary draft of a memorandum, prepared by a member of the staff of a public agency, <em>which is subject to revision prior to submission to or discussion among the members of such agency.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Even if the survey data had crossed the initial threshold for disclosure under \u00a7 1-19 (c) (1), the data falls squarely within the specific exemption set out in the statute, i.e., <em>\u201ca </em>preliminary draft of a memorandum, prepared by a member of the staff of a public agency which is subject to revision prior to submission to or discussion among the members of such agency.\u201d We have already discussed the plain meaning of \u201cpreliminary draft.\u201d Further, no one has argued that Van Nor-strand, as speaker of the House of Representatives, was not \u201ca member of the staff of a public agency.\u201d Finally, the survey data as collected were clearly \u201csubject to revision\u201d in that the data concerning judges not to be reappointed were excised by Van Norstrand \u201cprior to submission to or discussion among the members of such agency [i.e., the legislature].\u201d On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that this material is not subject to disclosure under \u00a7 1-19 (c) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">In this opinion Shea, Callahan and Hull, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by any federal law or state statute, all records maintained or kept on file by any public agency, whether or not such records are required by any law or by any rule or regulation, shall be public records and every person shall have the right to inspect such records . . . . \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b361-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIn the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language <em>. . .</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b364-9\"> Examination of its legislative history discloses that the enactment of General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (c) (1) was motivated in part by <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 339, 435 A.2d 353 (1980). In the course of introducing the bill that became Public Acts 1981, No. 81-431, now General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (c) (1), its Senate proponent, Senator Wayne A. Baker, stated: \u201cMr. President, it was just six years ago that we enacted what is nationally recognized as a model Freedom of Information Act. The Act creates broad rights of public access to the records of meetings of all public agencies. It also contains a limited number of exceptions to the general rule of disclosure and openness. All of this is consistent with the Freedom of Information laws intent that the people have the fundamental right to know in a timely fashion not only what governmental decisions are but what considerations go into those decisions. Unfortunately, our Supreme Court has said in the case of <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission </em>that the Connecticut Act should be interpreted as having the same meaning as the federal act even where their language and legislative policy are dissimilar. Mr. President, this bill basically reaffirms and clarifies the original intent and purpose in light of that case. It makes clear, hopefully once and for all, that the <em>deliberative </em>process of government agencies shall be open to the public except where the legislature alone determines a superior public interest in confidentiality.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 24 S. Proc., Pt. 17, 1981 Sess., pp. 5422-23. Senator Baker went on to say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>that \u201cI don\u2019t think that what we are requiring here is that all facts, that every piece of information that they have gleaned in determining or rather dealing with a problem has to be disclosed, but when they are coming to the final deliberative process, making a decision, I think that that has to be disclosed.\u201d 24 S. Proc., Pt. 17, 1981 Sess., p. 5426.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Despite the proponent\u2019s implication that <em>Wilson </em>had in some manner narrowed the broad disclosure policies set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (a), we are still required to construe the new enactment on the basis of what the statute says. \u201cA primary rule of statutory construction is that if the language of the statute is clear, it is presumed that the words express the intent of the legislature. . . . The court must interpret the statute as written . . . . \u201d <em>Ganim </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>204 Conn. 760, 763, 529 A.2d 194 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b366-8\">Peters, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-V_\">dissenting in part. Although I agree with the majority opinion\u2019s analysis of General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (c) (1), I am unpersuaded that the original unexpurgated survey of the judges, which the plaintiff, R.E. Van Norstrand, commissioned in his role as member and speaker of the House of Representatives, qualifies for an exemption under General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (1). Since eligibility for that exemption is essential to upholding the plaintiff\u2019s position, I respectfully dissent from the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">The plaintiff maintains, and the majority opinion concludes, that his survey of judges was not subject to public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA); General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-15, l-18a, 1-19 through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>1-19b, 1-21, 1-21a and 1-21c through 1-21k; because it qualified for the exemption contained in \u00a7 1-19 (b) (1) for \u201cpreliminary drafts or notes provided the public agency has determined that the public interest in withholding such documents clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\u201d In construing this exemption, we do not write on a clean slate. The overarching policy of the FOIA favors disclosure of public records. To implement this policy, exceptions to the rule of public disclosure are to be narrowly construed, and the agency claiming an exemption bears the burden of proving its applicability. <em>Commissioner of Consumer Protection </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>207 Conn. 698, 701, 542 A.2d 321 (1988); <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>201 Conn. 421, 431, 518 A.2d 49 (1986); <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>192 Conn. 310, 315, 472 A.2d 321 (1984); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 328-29, 435 A.2d 353 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">In my view, the majority opinion misconstrues, in two respects, the exemption contained in \u00a7 1-19 (b) (1). First, the exemption requires the plaintiff to demonstrate not only that the document in question was preliminary to a subsequent document, but also that the document falls within the class of documents that can reasonably be characterized as being \u201cdrafts\u201d or \u201cnotes.\u201d Second, the exemption requires the plaintiff to show that he has undertaken an objective rather than a subjective balancing process to determine that the public interest is clearly served by nondisclosure of the document in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The majority opinion reads the statutory phrase \u201cpreliminary drafts\u201d as a unitary requirement, rather than as a duality, requiring a showing that the document is both \u201cpreliminary\u201d and a \u201cdraft.\u201d Such a construction is, I believe, unwarranted. Facially, \u00a7 1-19 (b) (1) refers to \u201cdrafts,\u201d \u201cnotes\u201d and \u201cdocuments.\u201d We should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>presume that the legislature intended to make equivalents out of these independent reference points. \u201cIn examining . . . statutory requirements ... we must consider the statutory scheme as a whole, giving meaning to every section, and assuming no word or phrase to be superfluous.\u201d <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Tonken, </em>192 Conn. 581, 589, 473 A.2d 782 (1984); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Parmalee, </em>197 Conn. 158,162, 496 A.2d 186 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>184 Conn. 102, 107, 441 A.2d 53 (1981); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 14, 434 A.2d 293 (1980). Indeed, the use of the final phrase \u201csuch documents\u201d implies that only documents that are \u201cdrafts\u201d or \u201cnotes\u201d qualify for the \u00a7 1-19 (b) (1) exemption. I am unpersuaded that a completed poll, even one designed solely to validate the legitimacy of data contained in a part thereof, can reasonably be characterized as a \u201cdraft.\u201d I am also unpersuaded that <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, compels a different result. As the commission notes, the legislative history surrounding the subsequent enactment of \u00a7 1-19 (c) (1) signals the legislature\u2019s disavowal of <em>Wilson\u2019s </em>expansive construction of \u201cpreliminary drafts or notes\u201d as encompassing generally \u201cthat aspect of the agency\u2019s function that precedes formal and informed decisionmaking.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 332-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Even if the unexpurgated poll were properly characterized as a \u201cpreliminary draft,\u201d such a characterization, as the majority opinion recognizes, does not per se justify withholding of the document from the public. Under \u00a7 1-19 (b) (1), public disclosure of the origi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>nal document is still required unless \u201cthe public agency has determined that the public interest in withholding such documents clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\u201d I agree that this provision locates the authority to undertake the statutory balancing test in the public agency, in this case the plaintiff, rather than in the commission. Nonetheless, it seems to me inconsistent with the policy of the act, and the limited place it assigns to exemptions, to permit the public agency to validate the balancing process in accordance with a standard of good faith, rather than in accordance with a more objective cost-benefit analysis. The importation of a good faith standard would give to a public agency a breadth of discretion that is difficult to reconcile with the agency\u2019s burden of establishing its entitlement to a \u00a7 1-19 (b) (1) exemption. Concomitantly, such a standard would severely limit the commission\u2019s capacity to review the legitimacy of an agency\u2019s exercise of its balancing authority. The legislature has nowhere indicated that, in this one instance, it intended to deprive the commission of its primary role as FOIA factfinder. <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>205 Conn. 767, 775-76, 535 A.2d 1297 (1988); <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 434-35. The record in this case, however, persuades me that the plaintiff made an objectively valid determination not to release the unexpurgated judges\u2019 poll, and I therefore concur in the majority opinion\u2019s judgment that the plaintiff satisfied his burden of proof on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">For the reasons stated above, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\"> For relevant commentary by the sponsors of Public Acts 1981, No. 81-431, which was later codified as General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (c) (1), see the remarks of Senator Wayne A.
