The case arises out of an incident on September 17, 1987, when Matthew Cauley was fatally shot by one of several teens from an automobile being operated on Vine Street in Hartford. The respondent, a passenger in the car, was fifteen years old when the slaying took place and, therefore, a \u201cchild\u201d whose offenses would ordinarily be treated as juvenile matters. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-120, 46b-121.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After his arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>pursuant to a warrant, the respondent was brought to the Superior Court in Hartford where an information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>was filed charging him with murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 and 53a-54a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and conspiracy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court ordered him transferred to the juvenile docket in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 46b-133.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter, on October 15,1987, a peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>tion of alleged delinquency was filed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-128 (1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Acting on the basis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>murder charge, the prosecutor for juvenile matters moved to transfer the respondent from the juvenile docket to the regular criminal docket under the mandatory transfer provision of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-127 (1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following a transfer hearing, the court granted the state\u2019s motion, finding that there was probable cause to believe that the respondent had \u201ccommitted murder for which he is charged ... by virtue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>of his being an accessory . . . .\u201d On April 20, 1988, the respondent appealed the court\u2019s order to the Appellate Court and we transferred the case to ourselves shortly thereafter. Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">On appeal, the respondent attacks the court\u2019s transfer order claiming that it erred in concluding that he was susceptible to transfer under \u00a7 46b-127 (1) since, as an accessory to murder, he was not \u201creferred for the commission of a murder under sections 53a-54a to 53a-54d, inclusive.\u201d Even if he were susceptible to the mandatory transfer provision of \u00a7 46b-127 (1), the respondent further claims that the court erred in ordering his transfer because: (1) its finding of probable cause was based on certain statements that were improperly admitted into evidence; (2) there was an insufficient finding of probable cause; and (3) General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-126 and 46b-127 are unconstitutional. We determine that the court was correct in concluding that the respondent was susceptible to transfer under the mandatory transfer provision of \u00a7 46b-127 (1). Further, for reasons discussed in part II of this opinion, we determine that the court did not err when it transferred the respondent to the regular criminal docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">The respondent first claims that he was not susceptible to transfer from the juvenile docket to the regular criminal docket under \u00a7 46b-127 (1) because that subsection of the statute does not specifically mention \u201caiding and abetting,\u201d as defined by \u00a7 53a-8, as grounds for a mandatory transfer, but rather, pertains to juveniles who have been \u201creferred for the commission of a murder under sections 53a-54a to 53a-54d, inclusive.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The respondent argues that since he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>charged as an accessory to murder and not as a principal, he is not, because of the language of \u00a7 46b-127 (1), subject to transfer under that section. If he is to be transferred at all, the respondent contends, he must be transferred under \u00a7 46b-126* **<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which is a discretion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>ary statute requiring the transferring court to make more extensive findings than those required by \u00a7 46b-127 (1) prior to ordering a transfer.* **<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He therefore seeks a remand for further proceedings under \u00a7 46b-126.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">We rejected an almost identical argument in <em>Washington </em>v. <em>State, </em>171 Conn. 683, 686-87, 372 A.2d 106 (1976). In <em>Washington, </em>we held that the Superior Court did not err in upholding the order of the court requiring a juvenile to be transferred to the regular criminal docket under General Statutes \u00a7 17-60a, the precursor of \u00a7 46b-126, after it found \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that he was a participant in a felony murder. In doing so, we rejected the juvenile\u2019s argument that the legislature intended to eliminate from the transfer statute situations where the evidence indicated that \u201cthe child participated in a felony and might be guilty of murder under the felony-murder statute, but where he did not actually \u2018pull the trigger.\u2019 \u201d Id., 686. Stating that the juvenile\u2019s \u201creasoning [was] strained,\u201d we held that when a court finds \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that a juvenile is guilty of the crime of murder, \u201cwhether or not he personally sets in motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>the force which kills,\u201d the legislature intended the child to be transferred to the regular criminal docket. Id., 686-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The respondent in the present case recognizes that <em>Washington </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, may be dispositive as to the issue presented, but urges us to reconsider that case, stating that since it was decided the transfer statutes have been substantially revised. He argues that, under the new transfer scheme embodied in \u00a7\u00a7 46b-126 and 46b-127, the legislature intended to \u201ccorrelate the seriousness of an offense charged with the juvenile\u2019s susceptibility to transfer to the regular criminal docket.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>206 Conn. 346, 355, 538 A.2d 185 (1988). Since he did not actually \u201cpull the trigger,\u201d the respondent maintains that his crime is less serious than if he had done so, and, therefore the legislature intended him to be afforded more procedural safeguards than those that exist under the mandatory provision of \u00a7 46b-127 (1), pursuant to which he was transferred.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The respondent\u2019s argument assumes too much. While he correctly points out that under \u00a7\u00a7 46b-126 and 46b-127 the legislature intended to restrict the transfer of juveniles who have allegedly committed less serious offenses, he mistakenly assumes that it considered the charge of accessory to murder less serious than being charged as a principal. To the contrary, \u201c \u2018Connecticut \u201clong ago adopted the rule that there is no practical significance in being labeled an \u2018accessory\u2019 or a \u2018principal\u2019 for the purpose of determining criminal responsibility. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gargano, </em>99 Conn. 103,109, 121 A. 657 (1923); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>47 Conn. 95, 118 (1879); General Statutes (1875 Rev.) p. 545 [tit. XX, c. XIII, part X]. The modern approach \u2018is to abandon completely the old common law terminology and simply provide that a person is legally accountable for the conduct of another when he is an accomplice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>other person in the commission of the crime. . . . \u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>In re Luis R., </em>204 Conn. 630, 637-38, 528 A.2d 1146 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>198 Conn. 158, 164, 502 A.2d 880 (1985). This view was adopted by the legislature and is expressed in \u00a7 53a-8. <em>In re Luis R., </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra. Accordingly, \u201c \u2018[t]here is ... no such crime as \u201cbeing an accessory.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>201 Conn. 125, 130, 513 A.2d 669 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>[supra, 163]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>[195 Conn. 598, 608, 489 A.2d 1041 (1985)]. The defendants charged with committing one substantive offense; \u201c[t]he accessory statute merely provides alternate means by which a substantive crime may be committed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>supra, 131.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Luis R., </em>supra, 637; <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>202 Conn. 520, 528, 522 A.2d 277 (1987). Because the legislature is presumed to know the state of the law when it enacts a statute; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dabkowski, </em>199 Conn. 193, 201, 506 A.2d 118 (1986); we can assume that, absent an affirmative statement to the contrary, it did not intend to change the existing law to create a distinction between accessories and principals when it enacted the present transfer statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Although the respondent attempts to distinguish the language of \u00a7 46b-127 (1) from the language of the statute discussed in <em>Washington </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, the language in both statutes is essentially the same. The present statute, \u00a7 46b-127 (1) reads in relevant part: \u201cThe court shall transfer to the regular criminal docket of the superior court from the docket for juvenile matters: (1) Any child referred for the commission of a murder . . . . \u201d The previous statute, General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7 17-60a, read in relevant part: \u201cThe juvenile court shall have the authority to transfer to the jurisdiction of the superior court any child referred to it for the commission of a murder . . . .\u2019\u2019Lacking any indication that the legislature intended to change the law regarding accessorial liability, we find the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>similarities between the two statutes to be a distinction without a relevant difference. The respondent\u2019s argument in this regard is, therefore, without merit. We conclude that because \u00a7 53a-8 does not define a separate and distinct crime, but only an alternative means by which the crime of murder may be committed, the trial court did not err in finding the respondent to be subject to transfer to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court to be prosecuted as an adult under the mandatory provision of \u00a7 46b-127.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The respondent next claims that the court erred in ordering his transfer under \u00a7 46b-127 (1) because: (1) it based its finding of probable cause on statements that should have been excluded from evidence because they were admitted at his transfer hearing in violation of his constitutional rights and the rules of evidence; (2) there was insufficient probable cause to believe that he had committed murder; and (3) \u00a7\u00a7 46b-126 and 46b-127 are unconstitutional. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">At the respondent\u2019s transfer hearing, the court ruled, over the state\u2019s objection, that it would conduct the proceeding as a \u201cfull evidentiary hearing\u201d at which all of the rules of evidence would apply. The state took an exception to the court\u2019s ruling. Thereafter, the state offered the written statement of Antonio Garcia, an alleged coparticipant in the Cauley murder, claiming it to be admissible hearsay as a declaration against his penal interest. The court found Garcia to be unavailable because he had invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination and admitted Garcia\u2019s written statement over the respondent\u2019s objection. On appeal, the respondent argues that the court was correct in ruling that the transfer hearing should proceed as a full evidentiary hearing. He claims, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the court erred in admitting Garcia\u2019s statement into evidence because it was not admissible under any recognized exception to the hearsay rule and its admission deprived him of his right of confrontation and cross-examination. Because we conclude that the court erred in ruling that the respondent was entitled to a transfer hearing at which strict evidentiary standards applied, his objections concerning the admissibility of evidence, which objections may be viable at later proceedings, are not pertinent at this juncture.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">In <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States, </em>383 U.S. 541, 86 S. Ct. 1045, 16 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1966), the United States Supreme Court considered the procedural requirements for the relinquishment of the jurisdiction of the juvenile court as a condition to the trial of a juvenile in an adult criminal proceeding. The court\u2019s decision in <em>Kent </em>stressed that a juvenile court\u2019s determination to relinquish juvenile jurisdiction is a \u201c \u2018critically important\u2019 proceeding\u201d and therefore the child must be afforded a hearing prior to the entry of a transfer order.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id., 560-61. The court also stressed, however, that the juvenile is not entitled to a formal adjudicatory style hearing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This was noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>by the court on numerous occasions in its opinion and is best illustrated by the following passage: \u201cWe conclude that an opportunity for a hearing <em>which may be informal, </em>must be given the child .... We do not mean by this to indicate that the hearing to be held must conform with all of the requirements of a criminal trial or even of the usual administrative hearing; but we do hold that the hearing must measure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment. <em>Pee </em>v. <em>United States, </em>107 U.S. App. D.C. 47, 50, 247 F.2d 556, 559 (1959).\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 561-62. In so holding, the court did not attempt to \u201cprescribe criteria for, or the nature and quantum of evidence that must support, a decision to transfer a juvenile for trial in adult court.\u201d <em>Breed </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>421 U.S. 519, 537, 95 S. Ct. 1779, 44 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1975). Rather, the court in <em>Kent </em>left it to the states to determine the evidentiary standards applicable at the transfer stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Section 46b-127, in accord with <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, states in relevant part that \u201c[n]o such transfer shall be valid unless, prior thereto, the court has made written findings, after a hearing, that there is probable cause to believe that the child has committed the act for which he is charged.\u201d While the statute classifies the transfer hearing as a probable cause hearing, it does not, on its face, specify the type of evidence that the court should consider in making a determination of probable cause. The extensive legislative history of \u00a7 46b-127 also provides no indication of legislative intent as to the evidentiary standards applicable at transfer hearings. The respondent points to the comments made on the floor of the General Assembly by Representative Richard D. Tulisano calling for a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d as proof that the legislature intended the court to apply the rules of evidence at transfer hearings. 26 H.R. Proc., Pt. 17,1983 Sess., p. 6036. On close scrutiny, however, we find that Representative Tulisano\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>comments were not made as any part of a discussion on the type of evidence that the court should consider at transfer hearings, but rather, were made to emphasize, in general, the need for a hearing at the transfer stage.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Further, Representative Tulisano\u2019s qualification of the word \u201chearing\u201d with the term \u201cdue process\u201d does not indicate that the legislature intended that strict evidentiary rules apply at transfer hearings, as the term \u201cdue process\u201d does not define a particular evidentiary standard; different evidentiary standards satisfy due process depending on the nature of the proceeding involved. See, e.g., <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>420 U.S. 103, 95 S. Ct. 854, 43 L. Ed. 2d 54 (1974); <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra (informal hearing satisfies due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Absent any evidence of a legislative intent mandating a particular evidentiary standard applicable at transfer hearings in the language of \u00a7 46b-127 or in its legislative history, we turn to other statutes relating to the same subject matter for guidance to its interpretation. See <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Costle, </em>179 Conn. 415, 422, 426 A.2d 1324 (1980); <em>Doe </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number><em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>175 Conn. 49, 58, 392 A. 2d 491 (1978); 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands) \u00a7\u00a7 51.02, 51.03. Like \u00a7 46b-127, General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> requires the court to conduct a hearing to determine if there is probable cause to believe that an accused has committed a charged offense. Unlike \u00a7 46b-127, however, the language of that statute requires the court to apply the rules of evidence. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 54-46a specifically states that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>a probable cause hearing conducted pursuant to the statute \u201cshall be confined to the rules of evidence with the exception of written reports and the chain of custody rule.\u201d Likewise, in probable cause hearings dictated by the former General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7 54-76a, the court was required by the language of the statute to apply \u201cthe rules of evidence ... as if such hearing were a jury trial.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Noting the omission of similar language in \u00a7 46b-127, we apply the tenet of statutory construction that \u201c \u2018 \u201c[wjhere a statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similiar statute concerning a related subject ... is significant to show that a different intention existed.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Western States Newspapers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gehringer, </em>203 Cal. App. 2d 793, 799, 22 Cal. Rptr. 144 (1962); 2A J. Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 51.02; see also <em>Patry </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>190 Conn. 460, 468, 461 A.2d 443 (1983). That tenet of statutory construction is well grounded because \u201c \u2018[t]he General Assembly is always presumed to know all the existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>statutes and the effect that its action or non-action will have upon any one of them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gentry </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>196 Conn. 596, 609, 494 A.2d 1206 (1985); <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 529, 540, 494 A.2d 555 (1985). We conclude, therefore, that the absence of any language in \u00a7 46b-127 confining the court to the rules of evidence in a hearing to determine probable cause at the transfer stage of proceedings is a compelling indication that strict evidentiary standards were not intended to apply in such a proceeding. In a transfer hearing, the court can hear any evidence that it determines to be reliable, and that is material and relevant to the issue of probable cause.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">An overview of the statutory scheme concerning the transfer of juveniles to the regular criminal docket supports such an interpretation of the statute. Section 46b-127 (1) requires that a juvenile who is at least fourteen years of age be transferred to the regular criminal docket if, after a hearing, the court finds that there is probable cause to believe that the juvenile has committed murder. Once transferred, article first, \u00a7 8 of the Connecticut constitution and \u00a7 54-46a mandate that the juvenile be afforded yet another probable cause hearing, subject to the rules of evidence, prior to a trial on the merits of the charged offense where, obviously, the rules of evidence will also apply. If, therefore, we were to interpret \u00a7 46b-127 to require the court to apply the formal rules of evidence at transfer hearings, a juvenile would be allowed two identical probable cause determinations, one in the transfer court, and one in the adult Superior Court, prior to a trial at the adjudicatory stage to determine guilt or innocence. Such duplication is unwarranted. See <em>Wolf v. State, </em>99 Idaho 476, 583 P. 2d 1011 (1978); <em>Matter of Three Minors, </em>100 Nev. 414, 684 P.2d 1121 (1984) (in similar statutory scheme, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>court denied use of strict evidentiary standards stating that a child is not entitled to two preliminary hearings); see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>80 Ill. App. 3d 794, 800, 400 N.E.2d 599 (1980) (allowing the use of reliable hearsay at a transfer hearing because it is a \u201cmuch less time-consuming method of proof very nearly essential to this type of hearing\u201d); cf. Official Comments to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5.1; 2 W. LaFave &amp; J. Israel, Criminal Procedure (1984) \u00a7 14.3 (the efficient administration of justice precludes application of strict evidentiary standards at preliminary hearings).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The essentials of due process and fair treatment mandated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, are not impeded by eschewing the formal rules of evidence in a transfer proceeding. In considering whether due process is served it is important to keep in mind the nature of a juvenile transfer hearing. While it cannot be denied that the transfer hearing is a \u201c \u2018critically important\u2019 proceeding\u201d; id.; \u201c[s]uch a hearing does not result in a determination of delinquency . . . does not result in a determination of guilt as may a criminal trial; and does not directly result in confinement or other punishment as may both a delinquency hearing and a criminal proceeding. . . . If the proceedings under consideration were an adjudicatory hearing which could result in a determination that the defendant was guilty of a crime or was a delinquent, we would face a different issue. We are here concerned with a transfer hearing, which has as its only purpose the determination of . . . use of one of two possible forums\u2014the juvenile court or the superior court\u2014which will then hold the adjudicatory hearing.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Piche, </em>74 Wash. 2d 9, 14, 442 P.2d 632 (1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1041, 89 S. Ct. 666, 21 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1969); <em>People </em>v. <em>Chi Ko Wong, </em>18 Cal. 3d 198, 557 P.2d 976, 135 Cal. Rptr. 392 (1976); <em>Cle</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number><em>mons </em>v. <em>State, </em>162 Ind. App. 50, 317 N.E.2d 859, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 859, 96 S. Ct. 113, 46 L. Ed. 2d 86 (1975).

Accordingly, we determine that due to the nonadjudicatory nature of the transfer hearing, consideration by the court of reliable hearsay evidence does not deprive the juvenile \u201c \u2018of fundamental fairness or of any right of confrontation or cross-examination.\u2019 <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>358 U.S. 576, 584 [79 S. Ct. 412, 3 L. Ed. 2d 516] (1959).\u201d <em>In re Dinson, </em>supra; <em>Clemons </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra; <em>In re Harbert, </em>supra.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Further, it is necessary to point out that the child\u2019s status as a juvenile is not irrevocably terminated by transfer to the regular criminal docket. If the adult court determines in the second probable cause hearing that there is insufficient evidence for a finding of probable cause that the child committed murder, our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>supra, dictates that the child be returned to the juvenile court. Once transferred, therefore, the child will not be \u201ctrapped\u201d in the adult criminal justice system as the child cannot be tried as an adult for offenses that would not have resulted in the child\u2019s transfer under \u00a7 46b-127 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">In the present case, therefore, even if Garcia\u2019s statement is hearsay that may not be admissible at a trial, it was properly admitted by the court at the respondent\u2019s transfer hearing as long as the court properly determined that it was relevant and reliable. Based on the record,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we conclude that Garcia\u2019s statement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>relevant because it discussed the respondent\u2019s involvement with Eddie Ramirez, the alleged principal in the Cauley murder, and the degree of the respondent\u2019s participation. Moreover, the statement could reasonably have been found to be reliable because it was against Garcia\u2019s penal interest, was obtained from and signed by Garcia shortly after the shooting, and was corroborated by the testimony of another passenger in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">The respondent next claims that two inculpatory statements made by him to the Hartford police on September 17,1987, and September 23,1987, respectively, were improperly obtained by the Hartford police and, therefore, should not have been considered by the court in its determination of probable cause. At his transfer hearing, the respondent filed a motion to suppress his statements, claiming that both were made without a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The respondent also maintained that while his September 17, 1987 statement discusses his activities on the day of the Cauley murder, it was nevertheless irrelevant because it was obtained by the Hartford police in regard to a separate incident. The state opposed the respondent\u2019s motion to suppress, arguing that the transfer hearing was nonadjudicatory and, therefore, the motion was premature. The court noted the state\u2019s objection for the record but proceeded to take testimony on the issue of the respondent\u2019s ability to effect a valid waiver. Subsequently, the court ruled that a motion to suppress must be heard at a transfer hearing and that the state had the burden at that point of proving that the respondent\u2019s statements were obtained after a valid waiver of rights by both the respondent and his father. The court, thereafter, denied the respondent\u2019s motion to suppress his September 23, 1987 statement and admitted it into evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>dence, stating that the prosecution had met its burden of showing that both the respondent and his father had voluntarily made an intelligent and knowing waiver of the respondent\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights. The court also refused to suppress the respondent\u2019s September 17, 1987 statement, because even though the statement involved another incident it was relevant and the state had met its burden of demonstrating that there had been a valid waiver of the respondent\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights. The respondent took an exception to both of the court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">On appeal, the respondent claims that the court was correct in permitting his motion to suppress at the transfer hearing. He argues, however, that it erred in admitting his September 23, 1987 statement because it was obtained: (1) in violation of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution; (2) in violation of the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8 of the Connecticut constitution; and (3) \u201cwithout a meaningful compliance with [the] parental presence requirement of \u00a7 46b-137 (a).\u201d The respondent also claims that the court improperly admitted his September 17, 1987 statement because it was \u201cirrelevant and prejudicial\u201d and, like the September 23,1987 statement, was obtained without a voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. We need not reach the merits of the constitutional questions concerning the admissibility of the respondent\u2019s statements at this time because such questions are not appropriate for resolution at a transfer hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Section 46b-127 does not state whether the court should entertain motions to suppress at transfer hearings. Nor does its legislative history shed any light on this issue. Accordingly, we turn for guidance once again to the procedures employed at other probable cause hearings. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Costle, </em>supra; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>supra; 2A J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Sutherland, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 51.02, 51.03. While \u00a7 54-46a (b) requires the courts to apply the rules of evidence at probable cause hearings required under subsection (a) of that statute, it specifically forbids the filing of motions to suppress, stating that \u201c[n]o motion to suppress or for discovery shall be allowed in connection with such [probable cause] hearing.\u201d The fact that the legislature rejected the filing of motions to suppress at hearings in which it specifically required the application of the rules of evidence seems to be a clear indication that such motions should not be allowed in a transfer hearing at which strict evidentiary standards do not apply. We also note that the United States Supreme Court in <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, neither expressly nor impliedly extended fourth or fifth amendment rights to transfer hearings. <em>Clemons </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra; <em>Marvin </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 1059; <em>In re Harbert, </em>supra. In fact, the general rule is that constitutional questions are not properly raised in a probable cause hearing because such hearings are not adjudicatory in nature. See, e.g., Fed. R. Crim. Proc. 5.1, Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules; 2 W. LaFave &amp; J. Israel, supra, \u00a7 14.4. Therefore, because a transfer hearing under \u00a7 46b-127 (1) is nonadjudicatory, the court need not address constitutional questions concerning the admissibility of evidence. Accord <em>Ex parte Whisenant, </em>supra; <em>In re Dinson, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Christensen, </em>supra; <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra; <em>Clemons </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra; <em>Matter of Three Minors, </em>supra; <em>Marvin </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra; <em>In re Harbert, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Piche, </em>supra; <em>In Interest of J.G., </em>119 Wis. 2d 748, 350 N.W.2d 668 (1984); <em>Matter of M.A.B., supra, Matter of S.E.C., </em>supra; cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 348, 94 S. Ct. 613, 38 L. Ed. 2d 561 (1974) (\u201c[d]espite its broad deterrent purpose, the exclusionary rule has never been interpreted to proscribe the use of illegally seized evidence in all proceedings or against all persons . . . the rationale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>for excluding the evidence are strongest where the Government\u2019s unlawful conduct would result in imposition of a criminal sanction on the victim . . . \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Accordingly, the constitutional questions concerning the admissibility of his statements raised by the respondent, while relevant at a later adjudicatory proceeding, are not appropriate for resolution at a transfer hearing. Without addressing the merits of the responsent\u2019s claims, we conclude, therefore, that the transfer court did not err by admitting his statements into evidence over his objections on constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Similarly, the respondent is not entitled at a transfer hearing to the suppression of statements allegedly obtained in violation of \u00a7 46b-137 (a).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> That statute requires, generally, the exclusion of a juvenile\u2019s statement if not given in the presence of a parent or guardian after an advisement of rights to both. The statute, however, specifically states only that a statement obtained in violation thereof \u201cshall be inadmissible in <em>any proceeding for delinquency against the child.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 46b-137 (a). A transfer hearing is not a proceeding at which an adjudication of delinquency is made. Section 46b-137 (a), therefore, by its terms is not applicable to transfer hearings. It is not for the court \u201cto search out some intent\u201d that it believes the legislature had; the court is \u201cconfined to the intention which is expressed in the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>used.\u201d <em>Federal Aviation Administration </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>196 Conn. 546, 550, 494 A.2d 564 (1985); <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>134 Conn. 295, 301, 57 A.2d 128 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Such an interpretation of \u00a7 46b-137 (a) is, moreover, supported by its legislative history. In discussing General Statutes \u00a7 17-66d, the precursor of \u00a7 46b-137 (a), on the floor of the General Assembly, Representative Paul D. Shapero stated that the relevant sections of the bill were an attempt to \u201cprovide for ... the criteria set forth in the \u2018Gault\u2019 decision.\u201d 12 H.R. Proc., Pt. 11, 1967 Sess., p. 5057; see Public Acts 1967, No. 630. In <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 87 S. Ct. 1428, 18 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1967), the United States Supreme Court specifically dealt with the application of certain constitutional rights at delinquency proceedings where an adjudication of delinquency or guilt might result. Also, when further amendments were made to \u00a7 17-66d in 1969, Representative James T. Healey stated that the amendment \u201cspells out that a confession is [inadmissible in delinquency proceedings . . . \u201d 13 H.R. Proc., Pt. 11, 1969 Sess., p. 4984. No mention of its application to transfer hearings was made in the legislature at any time. We conclude, therefore, that although the record indicates that the police complied with \u00a7 46b-137 (a), the statute is inapplicable to transfer proceedings where the only question resolved is that of the appropriate forum to hold a trial on the merits.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The respondent next claims that the court erred in transferring him to the regular criminal docket because the evidence did not support the court\u2019s finding that there was probable cause to believe that he was an accessory to murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u201c \u00a3 \u201cOn appeal, it is the function of this court to determine whether the decision of the trial court is clearly erroneous.

[and] [tjhat [he], acting with those intentions, helped, assisted, or aided in the commission of the crime of murder.\u201d The court\u2019s finding was based on evidence that the respondent: \u201cencouraged [the principal] to commit the act; handed [the principal] the weapon which he used to commit the act and accepted it back [after the shooting]; told others to remain silent about the killing; securfed] transportation to the site of the crime\u201d; and was part of a gang that was feuding with a gang that normally gathered near the scene of the crime. Based on the record as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>a whole, we cannot say that the court\u2019s finding of probable cause was clearly erroneous. We therefore find no error in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The respondent also contends that the court erred in failing to find that \u00a7 46b-127, itself, and \u00a7\u00a7 46b-126 and 46b-127 read in tandem, violate federal and state guaranties of due process because they are vague and ambiguous as to juvenile class A felony offenders, and violate equal protection guaranties because they make arbitrary distinctions between juveniles charged with class A felonies. We disagree. A review of the scheme of which the respondent complains reveals it to be comprehensive, with defined distinctions based on ascertainable factual standards. The fact that there may be some theoretical overlap of treatment modes for juvenile class A felony offenders does not render the statute unconstitutional. \u201cA party contesting a statute\u2019s constitutionality has a heavy burden to prove unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dupree, </em>196 Conn. 655, 663, 495 A.2d 691, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 951, 106 S.

There is, however, one probable cause standard. What differs is the procedural requirements necessary to determine whether probable cause exists at the various stages of a criminal prosecution. For example, probable cause can be found based on information provided by police officers in affidavits when the state is seeking to obtain a search warrant; <em>State </em>v. <em>Delmonaco, </em>194 Conn. 331, 337, 481 A.2d 40, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1036, 105 S.

Similarly, a determination of whether there is probable cause to detain a person accused of committing a crime may be based on information provided in affidavits. <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>420 U.S. 103, 95 S. Ct. 854,43 L. Ed. 2d 54 (1975). When the court is concerned with whether there is sufficient evidence to subject an accused to trial, however, a determination of probable cause may be required to be based on evidence received by the court at a hearing.

Although I agree with the rest of the opinion and with the outcome, I disagree with part II A, which holds that the hearing on probable cause contemplated by General Statutes \u00a7 46b-127 before a child accused of murder may be transferred to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court is one in which the child\u2019s right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him, as well as the constitutional and statutory prohibitions against the use of his allegedly unlawfully obtained confession, do not apply. The United States Supreme Court, except for extending the right of counsel to juveniles, has left unresolved the ingredients necessary for a transfer hearing to \u201cmeasure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment.\u201d <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States, </em>383 U.S. 541, 562, 86 S.

Its recognition of the critical importance to the juvenile of the transfer proceeding, however, casts doubt upon the assumption of the majority that the use of evidence at a transfer hearing that would violate the constitutional rights of a defendant if admitted at a trial carries no constitutional ramifications. In any event, I am convinced that the use of such evidence at a transfer hearing cannot be squared with the intention of the General Assembly as expressed in statutes conferring the right of confrontation upon a child and affording protection against obtaining his confession unlawfully, as well as in the legislative history referring to a transfer hearing as a \u201cdue process hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-135 (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides that \u201c[a]t the commencement of any proceeding on behalf of a delin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>quent child . . . the child shall have the right to counsel and . . . such counsel and such . . . child shall have the rights of confrontation and cross-examination.\u201d Since Antonio Garcia, an alleged coparticipant in the crime, refused to testify at the transfer hearing, the admission of his written statement, which implicates the respondent, was a plain violation of the respondent\u2019s right of confrontation as recognized in <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 128, 88 S. Ct. 1620, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1968), and <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 419, 85 S. Ct. 1074, 13 L. Ed. 2d 934 (1965). As that statute extends to a delinquent child in \u201cany proceeding\u201d the \u201crights of confrontation and cross-examination,\u201d it must be deemed to apply to a transfer hearing under \u00a7 46b-127. The majority opinion apparently regards such a transfer hearing as not constituting \u201cany proceeding on behalf of a delinquent child,\u201d because it \u201cis not a proceeding at which an adjudication of delinquency is made.\u201d The respondent, however, was the subject of a delinquency petition filed soon after his arrest under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-128, which was the basis for the assertion of jurisdiction over him by the juvenile court. Section 46b-135 (a), in addition to providing \u201crights of confrontation and cross-examination\u201d to the child, affords him the right of counsel and directs that, \u201c[a]t the commencement of any proceeding on behalf of a delinquent child,\u201d the child and his parents must be informed of these rights by the judge. It is evident that \u00a7 46b-135 (a) treats both the right of confrontation and of counsel as essential for the protection of any child accused of a crime in any proceeding in the juvenile court. I am not aware that juvenile court judges, in advising a child and his parents of their rights under \u00a7 46b-135 (a), have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>excepted a transfer hearing from the application of this statute or have drawn a distinction between the right to counsel and to confrontation at such a proceeding, as the majority has done.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">I disagree also with the position taken in the opinion that the scope of a transfer hearing is so limited under \u00a7 46b-127 that a child\u2019s confession may be used in finding probable cause even if it has been obtained in violation of his constitutional rights and without satisfying the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-137 (a) that the child\u2019s parents be present. The majority opinion construes the prohibition against the admission \u201cin any proceeding for delinquency against the child\u201d of any confession not complying with \u00a7 46b-137 (a) not to apply to a transfer hearing because \u201c[a] transfer hearing is not a proceeding at which an adjudication of delinquency is made.\u201d This narrow interpretation of the applicability of \u00a7 46b-137 (a) would deprive a child of the right given him to exclude an unlawfully obtained confession in a proceeding far more important for his welfare than that for adjudicating him a delinquent. The statutory text does not require the absurd result of making its protection against unlawfully obtained confessions inapplicable to the very proceeding having the direst consequences for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The holding of the majority that evidence may be admitted at a transfer hearing of a child that would violate the constitutional rights of a defendant if used at an adult criminal proceeding is also impossible to reconcile with the remarks of Representative Richard D. Tulisano quoted by the majority concerning the substitution of the word \u201chearing\u201d for \u201cproceeding\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-126, which parallels General Statutes \u00a7 46b-127: \u201c[T]he word hearing has had lots of interpretations in court decisions and it really means the due process hearing rather than a proceeding. . . . It would require that the parties be before the court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>not rely just on written testimony.\u201d 26 H.R. Proc., Pt. 17, 1983 Sess., p. 6036. The reference to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d must have been intended to preclude the use of evidence at a transfer hearing that unquestionably would violate a child\u2019s right to due process of law under the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution if it were admitted at a trial. The expressed intention to require the parties to be \u201cbefore the court\u201d rather than \u201cjust rely on written testimony\u201d is entirely frustrated by the use of documents not admissible at a trial, because such use would violate a child\u2019s right to due process of law. I read this legislative history to indicate the intention to afford children in transfer hearings under \u00a7 46b-126 or \u00a7 46b-127 at least the rights of confrontation and cross-examination and also protection against the use of illegally obtained confessions. Such a view would be consistent with \u00a7 46b-135 (a), which independently provides the right of confrontation to a child in \u201cany proceedings on behalf of a delinquent child, and also with \u00a7 46b-137 (a), which makes his confession inadmissible when obtained without compliance with its provisions. The position of the majority that the legislature never intended either statutory or constitutional prohibitions against the use of a child\u2019s confession or the statement of his accomplice to be applicable in a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d for transfer of a child to the adult criminal docket is contrary to any fair reading of this history.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">I concur in the result, nevertheless, because even without the respondent\u2019s confession or Garcia\u2019s statement, there was ample evidence to support the finding of probable cause in the testimony of witnesses presented at the hearing. A witness riding in the car when the crime occurred testified that the respondent said he wanted to shoot some member of the Albany Avenue gang, that he handled the gun and gave it to Ramirez when he requested it just before the shoot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>ing, and that the respondent told the girls in the car to say nothing about the shooting. That testimony is sufficient to support a finding of probable cause for the charge of murder against the respondent as an accomplice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 46b-135.
