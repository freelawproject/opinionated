See General Statutes \u00a7 45-288 et seq. The order provided that the defendant, Suzanne Benson, the biological mother of Paul Hotarek, was an heir of the deceased and entitled to inherit one half of his estate. The order also provided that the plaintiff, Kenneth Hotarek, the father of the deceased, was an heir and entitled to inherit the other half.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">The facts leading to this probate appeal are unique and tragic. The plaintiff, Kenneth Hotarek, and the defendant, Suzanne Benson, were married on July 27, 1968. The deceased, Paul Hotarek, issue of the marriage, was bom on October 25,1970. The Hotarek marriage was dissolved on October 26, 1972, when Paul <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>was two years old. On July 10, 1986, at the age of fifteen, Paul was killed in a motor vehicle accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Subsequent to Paul\u2019s death, his estate settled a claim against the tortfeasor who was responsible for his demise for $20,000 and was subsequently awarded underinsured motorists benefits in the amount of $525,000. The net proceeds of those two awards were the only substantial assets in the decedent\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Immediately following Paul\u2019s death and during the initial stages of the probate proceedings, the defendant could not be located. Consequently, the Probate Court appointed a guardian ad litem to protect her interests. Her guardian ad litem engaged the services of an investigator who finally tracked down the defendant on December 10, 1987, at her residence in Hurricane, Utah.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It was at that time that the defendant first learned of her son\u2019s death in Connecticut some seventeen months earlier. Her appearance, the Probate Court order distributing one half of Paul\u2019s net estate to her, and the plaintiff\u2019s appeal of that order followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Throughout these proceedings the plaintiff has asserted that for approximately thirteen years, from December, 1973, until the date of Paul\u2019s death in 1986, the defendant had no contact with the deceased. He avers that during that time the defendant failed to provide any financial support to, maintain any interest in, or display any love and affection for her son. He acknowledges that the defendant\u2019s parental rights were never officially terminated but maintains that because the defendant had abandoned her minor son during his life she was not entitled to share in his estate after his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>The Probate Court disagreed and ordered the distribution of the decedent\u2019s net estate, one half to the plaintiff and one half to the defendant in accord with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45-272, 45-276 (a) (1) and 45-280 (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff, thereafter, appealed to the Superior Court. After the pleadings were closed, the Superior Court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>based on the plaintiffs admissions that he and the defendant had been married, that the deceased was the issue of their marriage, and that the defendant\u2019s parental rights \u201cwere not terminated as termination of parental rights is defined in Section 17-32d (e) of the Connecticut General Statutes.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See Practice Book \u00a7 378 et seq. In granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment the Superior Court ruled that \u201cthere is neither common law nor statutory law upon which relief can be granted [to the plaintiff].\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 45-276 (a) (1) provides that if a person dies intestate leaving no spouse or children, the residue of the intestate\u2019s estate shall be distributed equally to the decedent\u2019s parent or parents. Neither \u00a7 45-276 (a) (1) nor any other statute creates an exception disinheriting a parent who has abandoned a minor child who later dies intestate. The plaintiff concedes that to be the statutory law. He urges, however, that we find that the Probate Court and the Superior Court erred in failing to exercise an unspecified, inherent equitable power to vary the statute to prevent an injustice. That failing, he implores this court to promulgate, by judicial fiat, a rule that will preclude the defendant from inheriting because of her abandonment of her minor child. Unfortunately, we can do neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The law governing descent and distribution emanates from the legislature and is purely statutory. <em>Irving Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Day, </em>314 U.S. 556, 562, 62 S. Ct. 398, 86 L. Ed. 452 (1942); <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Plunkett, </em>139 Conn. 491, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>501-502, 95 A.2d 71 (1953); <em>In re Holibaugh, </em>18 N. J. 229, 235,113 A.2d <em>654(1955); Vinson v. Chappell, </em>275 N.C. 234, 240,166 S.E.2d 686 (1969); 23 Am. Jur. 2d, Descent and Distribution \u00a7 9. The legislature has, by statute, carved out exceptions to the statutes governing descent and distribution to deprive an ostensibly rightful heir, falling within the ambit of those exceptions, of an otherwise lawful inheritance. Under \u00a7 45-273a (a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a person who, without sufficient cause, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>abandons his or her spouse is foreclosed from receiving a statutory share of the estate of the deceased spouse. Under \u00a7 45-279 (a)* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a person finally convicted of murder is precluded from inheriting any part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>estate of the deceased victim; see <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Plunkett, </em>supra; see also General Statutes \u00a7 45-279 (b), (c) (1) and (2).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Absent, however, is any statute barring a parent who has abandoned a minor child from inheriting from the estate of the minor child.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Even if the omission of such a statute were the result of legislative oversight or neglect, we have no power to supply the omission or to remedy the effect of the neglect. <em>Matter of Zolessi\u2019s Will, </em>154 Misc. 313, 315, 277 N.Y.S. 137 (1935). \u201c[A]ny qualification [of the law of descent and distribution] pronounced by this court would be a judicial grafting of public policy restrictions on an explicit statutory provision.\u201d <em>Anstine </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>92 Idaho 561, 562, 447 P.2d 677 (1968); <em>Kreisel </em>v. <em>Ingham, </em>113 So. 2d 205, 209 (Fla. App. 1959). The authorities make clear that judicial tribunals have no concern with the policy of legislation and they cannot engraft upon the provisions of the statutes of descent and distribution an exception to bar an inheritance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>Bird </em>v. <em>Plunkett, </em>supra, 500. The statutes cannot be changed by the court to make them conform to the court\u2019s conception of right and justice in a particular case. <em>Estate of Kirby, </em>162 Cal. 91, 94,121 P. 370 (1912); 23 Am. Jur. 2d, supra, \u00a7 12. To avoid trenching on legislative ground, the court must take the view that if the legislature had intended such an exception from the statutes as is sought in this case, it would have said so. See <em>Kerin </em>v. <em>Goldfarb, </em>160 Conn. 463, 467, 280 A.2d 143 (1971); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>121 Conn. 594, 598, 186 A. 540 (1936); <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Wysowatcky, </em>128 Colo. 221, 224, 250 P.2d 199 (1952); 23 Am. Jur. 2d, supra, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In the absence of statutory provisions to the contrary, the fact that a parent has abandoned and neglected a deceased minor child does not bar the right of that parent to inherit from the child\u2019s estate under the statutes governing descent and distribution. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>211 Tenn. 566, 569-70, 366 S.W.2d 755 (1963); see <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Plunkett, </em>supra, 504; <em>Poque </em>v. <em>Poque, </em>434 So. 2d 262, 263 (Ala. Civ. App. 1983). If the law is to be changed to make provision for the situation at hand, it is for the legislature to make the change, not the courts. <em>Tarlo\u2019s Estate, </em>315 Pa. 321, 325-26, 172 A. 139 (1934). We urge the legislature to consider doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-8\"> The total net estate was approximately $300,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b141-9\"> Hurricane is located in Washington County in southwest Utah, population 2660, elevation 3266 feet.
