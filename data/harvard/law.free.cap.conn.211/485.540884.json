The defendant framed the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u201c1. Did the Court abuse its discretion in awarding counsel fees to the Plaintiff to defend the appeal when she admitted having liquid assets of about $630,000 and a net worth of about $1,535,000 at the time of the hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u201c2. As a matter of law, was there an accord and satisfaction when the Plaintiff cashed the Defendant\u2019s check for $525,000 marked \u2018final payment\u2019?</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">\u201c3. Did the Court improperly invoke the adverse inference rule against the Defendant concerning the accord and satisfaction issue?</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">\u201c4. Did the Court in September 1988 have the power over the Defendant\u2019s objection to state that the judgment in July 1987 for lump sum alimony was really a division of property award?</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">\u201c5. If not, does [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-350f provide for interest on lump sum alimony?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">We find error in the award of attorney\u2019s fees and no error in the award of interest on the delayed payment of part of the financial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">On May 19,1988, after we affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision in <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>supra, the court awarded to the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees of $10,000 plus expenses of $4974.63. The plaintiff had requested an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs in the amount of $25,297.13. At the hearing on attorney\u2019s fees the parties submit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>ted current financial affidavits. The plaintiffs affidavit showed a net worth of about $1,535,000. The parties stipulated that her liquid assets were approximately $630,000. The defendant\u2019s net assets on his affidavit were $5,503,000. The defendant has not attacked the reasonableness of the requested fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The defendant did, however, object to any award of attorney\u2019s fees, on the ground that the plaintiff had ample liquid funds to pay her own fees. The court responded to this objection by stating that if it had known that the defendant was going to appeal its decision in the dissolution case it would have made different orders originally. The court also stated \u201cthat part of the appeal was a pressure technique by Mr. Blake, particularly,\u201d and \u201cfrivolous.\u201d We found nothing frivolous in the appeal to this court. Punishment of a litigant should play no role in the determination of the issue of awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The starting point of our analysis is <em>Koizim </em>v. <em>Koizim, </em>181 Conn. 492, 435 A.2d 1030 (1980). In <em>Koizim, </em>the defendant wife was awarded $60,000 per year lump sum alimony for a period of ten years, periodic alimony of $4000 per month and an allowance for counsel fees in the approximate amount of $55,000. Id., 494. We said: \u201cThe plaintiff quite properly challenges the trial court\u2019s award of counsel fees and expenses. Counsel fees are not to be awarded merely because the obligor has demonstrated an ability to pay. \u2018Courts ordinarily award counsel fees in divorce cases so that a party (usually the wife) may not be deprived of her rights because of lack of funds. <em>Krasnow </em>v. <em>Krasnow, </em>140 Conn. 254, 265, 99 A.2d 104 (1953); <em>Steinmann </em>v. <em>Steinmann, </em>121 Conn. 498, 504, 186 A. 501 (1936).\u2019 <em>Ridolfi </em>v. <em>Ridolfi, </em>178 Conn; 377, 380, 423 A.2d 85 (1979). In making its determination regarding attorney\u2019s fees the court is directed by General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62 to consider the respective financial abilities of the parties. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>180 Conn. 376, 380, 429 A.2d 897 (1980). Where, because of other orders, both parties are financially able to pay their own counsel fees they should be permitted to do so. Because the defendant has ample liquid funds as a result of the other orders in this case, there was no justification for an allowance of counsel fees.\u201d <em>Koizim </em>v. <em>Koizim, </em>supra, 500-501.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">In <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>190 Conn. 26, 29-30,459 A.2d 498 (1983), we relied on <em>Koizim </em>in upholding the trial court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees. The plaintiff in <em>Fitzgerald </em>claimed that the court had abused its discretion in denying attorney\u2019s fees. We noted that the availability of \u201csufficient cash\u201d to pay one\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees is not an absolute litmus test for making an award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62. Id., 33. \u201cThis is because a trial court\u2019s discretion should be guided so that its decision regarding attorney\u2019s fees does not undermine its purpose in making any other financial award.\u201d Id., 34. \u201c \u2018Whether a spouse has \u201cample liquid funds\u201d with which to pay counsel fees . . . can only be determined by examining the total financial resources of the parties in light of the statutory criteria.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., quoting <em>Venuti </em>v. <em>Venuti, </em>185 Conn. 156, 163, 446 A.2d 878 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">In the light of the plaintiff\u2019s net assets of over $1,500,000 and her liquid assets of $630,000, it cannot reasonably be claimed that the failure to award $14,947.63 for attorney\u2019s fees and expenses would undermine or skew the substantial financial awards granted to her in the dissolution judgment. To award counsel fees under these circumstances is gilding the lily. The court abused its discretion in making such an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The defendant\u2019s issues two through five are all facets of his claim that the trial court erred in awarding the plaintiff interest on the delayed payment of part of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>award of $1,200,000 to her in the dissolution decree. The background of these claims is as follows: In its oral memorandum of decision in the <em>Blake </em>dissolution case on July 27,1987, the court stated: \u201cI\u2019m going to order the sum\u2014that he pay her the sum of $1,200,000 as a payment in lump-sum alimony.\u201d The judgment file did not label the $1,200,000 payment in any way. It merely stated: \u201c5. The defendant shall pay the plaintiff $1,200,000.\u201d During the pendency of the <em>Blake </em>appeal, the plaintiff moved to terminate the stay of execution on the $1,200,000 order. At the hearing on this motion the court purported to clarify its order by calling it a property division. The court terminated the stay on $675,000 of the award. On May 13,1988, after the original appeal had been resolved against the defendant, the defendant\u2019s counsel hand-delivered a check for $525,000\u2014the balance of the $1,200,000 order\u2014to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s office. The check contained on the left-lower front thereof the notation \u201cfinal payment.\u201d It was accompanied by a letter from the defendant\u2019s counsel to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in which the first sentence stated: \u201cEnclosed is a check for $525,000 as the final payment of the lump sum alimony award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The plaintiff raised the issue of interest on the payment of $525,000 at the hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees on May 19, 1988, followed up by a written motion dated May 20, 1988. At the hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees, the defendant objected to the award of interest on the ground, among others, that the judge had characterized the $1,200,000 order as lump sum alimony when he orally rendered his decision. The trial court noted that no motion to articulate the oral decision on the dissolution had been filed. The court ruled as follows: (1) when the decision is read as a whole it is clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>the court considered it as a division of property; (2) under <em>Niles </em>v. Niles, 15 Conn. App. 718, 546 A.2d 329 (1988), interest is authorized; (3) the phrase \u201cfinal payment\u201d is ambiguous and, since the defendant did not testify \u201cthe court is entitled to draw some inference\u201d; and (4) the defendant did not prove the defense of accord and satisfaction. The court then awarded interest to the plaintiff in the amount, as later corrected, of $59,095.91.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim of error is that, as a matter of law, there was an accord and satisfaction when the plaintiff cashed the defendant\u2019s check for $525,000 marked \u201cfinal payment.\u201d \u201cWhen there is a good faith dispute about the existence of a debt or about the amount that is owed, the common law authorizes the debtor and the creditor to negotiate a contract of accord to settle the outstanding claim. Such a contract is often initiated by the debtor, who offers an accord by tendering a check as \u2018payment in full\u2019 or \u2018in full satisfaction.\u2019 If the creditor knowingly cashes such a check, or otherwise exercises full dominion over it, the creditor is deemed to have assented to the offer of accord. Upon acceptance of the offer of accord, the creditor\u2019s receipt of the promised payment discharges the underlying debt and bars any further claim relating thereto, if the contract of accord is supported by consideration. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Kowalsky, </em>186 Conn. 618, 621, 442 A.2d 1355 (1982); <em>W. H. McCune, Inc. </em>v. <em>Revzon, </em>151 Conn. 107, 109, 193 A.2d 601 (1963); <em>Bull </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>43 Conn. 455, 462 (1876); 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts (1981) \u00a7 281; E. Farnsworth, Contracts (1982) \u00a7 4.23, p. 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\u201cA contract of accord and satisfaction is sufficiently supported by consideration if it settles a monetary claim that is unliquidated in amount.\u201d <em>County Fire Door Corporation </em>v. <em>C. F. Wooding Co., </em>202 Conn. 277, 281-82, 520 A.2d 1028 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>As the trial court found, the defendant\u2019s claim founders on the lack of a factual foundation for an accord and satisfaction. It is very clear that there was no good faith dispute about the existence of the debt or the amount owed. The defendant claims that there was an issue in the case concerning the balance of the $1,200,000 payment in that the court had earlier, in a colloquy between court and counsel, left open the possibility that some or all of the $1,200,000 payment might be in the form of bonds. The defendant argues that this possibility was eliminated by the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of the $525,000 check, thus bestowing a benefit on the plaintiff to which she was not entitled. This claim represents a mere shadow of a claimed dispute sufficient to support an accord and satisfaction. The defendant points to no evidence in the record that he ever sought permission from the court to substitute bonds for the cash payment ordered by the court or even that he had any interest in pursuing such a goal. The question of interest on the $525,000 payment had never been disputed by the parties, up to the date of payment, but was only raised later by the plaintiff in a separate court proceeding. Further, consideration for a contract of accord and satisfaction was lacking since the $525,000 payment was not unliquidated in amount but was instead the precise amount payable under a judgment of the court enforceable by contempt proceedings. The court did not err in concluding that the defendant had not proved an accord and satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The defendant next claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the court improperly relied on <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 165 A.2d 598 (1960), and its progeny to.draw an adverse inference from his failure to testify. The court stated that it was \u201centitled to draw some inference where the actual party to the litigation could have been here to testify as to what he intended.\u201d The rule concerning inferences to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>be drawn from the failure of an available witness to testify is too well known in Connecticut trial and appellate proceedings to justify lengthy discussion of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\u201c \u2018The failure of a party to produce a witness who is within his power to produce and who would naturally have been produced by him, permits the inference that the evidence of the witness would be unfavorable to the party\u2019s cause.\u2019 <em>Ezzo </em>v. <em>Geremiah, </em>107 Conn. 670, 677, 142 A. 461 (1928). \u2018There are two requirements for the operation of the rule: The witness must be available, and he must be a witness whom the party would naturally produce.\u2019 <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 675, 165 A.2d 598 (1960); <em>see D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>193 Conn. 144, 153, 476 A.2d 543 (1984); <em>Doran </em>v. <em>Wolk, </em>170 Conn. 226, 230, 365 A.2d 1190 (1976). \u2018To have the jury charged on the rule, the party claiming the benefit of it must show that he is entitled to it. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carrione, </em>188 Conn. 681, 688, 453 A.2d 1137 (1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1084, 103 S. Ct. 1775, 76 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1983).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Amarillo, </em>[198 Conn. 285, 307, 503 A.2d 146 (1986)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>198 Conn. 424, 426, 503 A.2d 588 (1986). The <em>Secondino </em>rule is applicable to court trials. <em>D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra; <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Friedman, </em>180 Conn. 132, 135, 429 A.2d 823 (1980); <em>Olin Corporation </em>v. <em>Castells, </em>180 Conn. 49, 53, 428 A.2d 319 (1980). The absence of the defendant as a witness met the second prong of the <em>Secondino </em>test in that he was a witness whom the party would naturally have produced. The rule, however, was inapplicable \u201cfor the reason that there is nothing in the record to indicate the \u2018availability\u2019 of the \u2018missing\u2019 witness, an essential prerequisite.\u201d <em>D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 153. The defendant has not shown that the court\u2019s error in voicing a vague form of such an inference was prejudicial to him. The court\u2019s conclusion that there was no accord and satisfaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>proved by the defendant rests on such a solid factual and legal foundation concerning the absence of a dispute between the parties and the lack of consideration, that we would be compelled to conclude as a matter of law that the defendant did not sustain his burden of proof on that issue regardless of whether the trial court may have drawn an adverse inference from the failure of the defendant to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The defendant\u2019s next claim is that the order for payment of $1,200,000 was lump sum alimony and therefore no interest is allowable on the delayed payment of $525,000. He bases this argument on the court\u2019s statement to that effect during its oral memorandum of decision in the dissolution action ordering the defendant to pay $1,200,000 \u201cin lump sum alimony.\u201d He claims that the court\u2019s two attempts to relabel this order as a division of property were illegal attempts to change an order under the guise of clarifying or articulating it. We recently summed up the law on this subject in <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>199 Conn. 417, 436-37, 513 A.2d 620 (1986), as follows: \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 3082 explicitly preserves our common law rule that a trial court possesses the inherent power to modify its own judgments during the term at which they were rendered. <em>Steve Viglione Sheet Metal Co. </em>v. <em>Sakonchick, </em>190 Conn. 707, 710, 462 A.2d 1037 (1983); <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Aspinwall, </em>73 Conn. 493, 497, 47 A. 755 (1901). \u2018During the continuance of a term of court the judge holding it has, in a sense, absolute control over judgments rendered; that is, he can declare and subsequently modify or annul them.\u2019 <em>Sturdevant </em>v. <em>Stanton, </em>47 Conn. 579, 580 (1880). Under the common law rule, a distinction is drawn between \u2018matters of substance\u2019 and \u2018clerical errors\u2019; the distinction being that mere clerical errors may be corrected at any time even after the end of the term. <em>Morici </em>v. <em>Jarvie, </em>137 Conn. 97,104, 75 A.2d 47 (1950); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>81 Conn. 562, 566-67, 71 A. 727 (1909); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number><em>Wilkie </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>15 Conn. 32, 37 (1842). But \u2018[i]n the absence of waiver or consent of the parties, a court is without jurisdiction to modify or correct a judgment in other than clerical respects after the expiration of the term of the court in which it was rendered.\u2019 <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Calise, </em>174 Conn. 567, 571, 392 A.2d 440 (1978).\u201d We further concluded, in reliance on the provision in Practice Book \u00a7 326 that any civil judgment may be opened or set aside \u201cwithin four months succeeding the date on which it was rendered or passed,\u201d that for purposes of the common law rule, a criminal judgment also may not be modified in matters of substance beyond a period of four months after the judgment has become final. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra, 437. We note that the judgment file, as previously discussed, did not affix any label to the $1,200,000 payment. And we further note that the purported clarifications of the judgment contained in the oral decision in the case occurred long after the four month period after the judgment had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Whether the court\u2019s changed characterization of its judgment granting \u201clump sum alimony\u201d is a \u201cmatter of substance\u201d requires a brief look at the precedent cited by the court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra. <em>Wilkie </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, 38, concerned the amendment by a former deputy sheriff of a return on a writ of execution nearly five years after the original was filed. In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, we held that a mistake in failing to include interest for a certain period in the judgment actually rendered was not a judicial error but a clerical mistake in not making the language of the judgment file conform to the decision actually announced by the memorandum, and was therefore correctable even at a later term. In <em>Morici </em>v. <em>Jarvie, </em>supra, 105, a motion to \u201camplify\u201d an earlier judgment file was made after the expiration of the term in which the judgment was rendered. We held that the purported change in the origi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>nal judgment file, which merely adjudicated the amount of the debt due from the defendant to the plaintiff, to a complete foreclosure judgment, was a matter of substance which could not be corrected after the term, in the absence of waiver. Id., 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">It can readily be seen that the three cases cited do not clearly illuminate our task. <em>Wilkie </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, did not concern the same issues; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, was quite evidently a clerical error involving a variance between the judgment as announced and that contained in the judgment files; and <em>Morici </em>v. <em>Jarvie, </em>supra, went to the other extreme where the court attempted to transform an order finding only the debt due into a foreclosure judgment in complete detail, thus involving an out-of-term attempt to correct a judicial error. The case of <em>Goldreyer </em>v. <em>Cronan, </em>76 Conn. 113, 55 A. 594 (1903), is somewhat closer to the mark. In <em>Goldreyer, </em>the trial court filed a memorandum awarding the plaintiff $300 and a corresponding judgment file was entered. Id., 114. Over one year later the court \u201ccorrected\u201d the judgment, on motion of the plaintiff, by adding interest in the amount of $100.50. We concluded that the later adding of interest was an attempt to correct a judicial error beyond the term of court involved and that the court thirteen months later had no power to correct, amend or change the original judgment. Id., 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Although it may appear to be a close issue under traditional analysis, we conclude that the change in nomenclature of the $1,200,000 order under the circumstances of this case was not a \u201cmatter of substance\u201d that was beyond the power of the court to correct beyond the term in which it was rendered. Three reasons support this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">First and foremost, the one-time use of the term \u201clump sum alimony\u201d in the oral memorandum of decision can be viewed as merely a matter of a label affixed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>to an order, despite the admittedly serious ramifications that may result from the distinction between a lump sum alimony award and a division of property. Next, the status of the financial order was not an issue in the dissolution case. Further, an analysis of the structure of the dissolution order is highly instructive. We stated in <em>Dubicki </em>v. <em>Dubicki, </em>186 Conn. 709, 713-15, 443 A.2d 1268 (1982), that \u201c[t]he requisite factors for the trial court\u2019s determination of marital property division depend upon whether it is considered as lump sum alimony pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82, or as a property assignment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81. Under the provisions of both statutes the trial court \u2018 \u201cshall consider the length of the marriage, the causes for the . . . dissolution of the marriage . . . the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate\u201d and needs of each of the parties. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 (c), 46b-82.\u2019 <em>McPhee </em>v. <em>McPhee, </em>[186 Conn. 167, 171, 440 A.2d 274 (1982)]. In assigning marital property, however, \u2018the trial court must also consider the liabilities of the parties, \u201cthe opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income . . . [and] the contribution of each of the parties in the acquisition, preservation or appreciation in value of their respective estates.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (c).\u2019 <em>McPhee </em>v. <em>McPhee, </em>supra, 171; see, e.g., <em>Pasquariello </em>v. <em>Pasquariello, </em>168 Conn. 579, 583, 362 A.2d 835 (1975).\u201d We further stated that \u201c[w]e have often distinguished between the assignment of property under \u00a7 46b-81 and alimony under \u00a7 46b-82; see, e.g., <em>Beede </em>v. <em>Beede, </em>186 Conn. 191, 192, 440 A.2d 283 (1982); <em>McPhee </em>v. <em>McPhee, </em>[supra, 168]; <em>Basile </em>v. <em>Basile, </em>185 Conn. 141,142-43, 440 A.2d 876 (1981); <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>184 Conn. 36, 49-50, 440 A.2d 782 (1981). The difference between an assignment of a specific portion of an estate and alimony is in their purposes. Clark, Domes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>tic Relations (1968) \u00a7 14.8. The purpose of property-assignment is equitably to divide the ownership of the parties\u2019 property. <em>McPhee </em>v. <em>McPhee, </em>supra, 170. On the other hand, periodic and lump sum alimony is based primarily upon a continuing duty to support. <em>Hotkowski </em>v. <em>Hotkowski, </em>165 Conn. 167,170, 328 A.2d 674 (1973); see <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>185 Conn. 491, 493, 441 A.2d 140 (1981); <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>[165 Conn. 777, 784, 345 A.2d 5 (1974)]; 2 Nelson, Divorce and Annulment (2d Ed.) \u00a7 14.06.\u201d <em>Dubicki </em>v. <em>Dubicki, </em>supra, 714 n.2. Finally, the precise issue we are considering was delineated in <em>Dubicki </em>as follows: \u201cIn its memorandum of decision, the trial court characterized the transfers of the plaintiff\u2019s property interest to the defendant as lump sum alimony. In its rectification of the record, however, the trial court characterized the transfers as property distribution. <em>The characterization which is later in time should control, and is more consistent with the trial court\u2019s actions, and with the parties\u2019 testimony.\u201d. </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In light of the <em>Dubicki </em>criteria, the $1,200,000 order was a property assignment. This order was part of an equitable division of the ownership of the parties\u2019 property. The court ordered the plaintiff to convey her interest in the family home in Avon to the defendant and the defendant to convey his interest in a lot in California to the plaintiff. <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>supra, 219. The continuing duty to support, on which a lump sum alimony award could have been based, was satisfied by the court\u2019s award of $50,000 per year periodic alimony and $600 per week child support. The court\u2019s later characterization of the award is \u201cmore consistent with the trial court\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Dubicki </em>v. <em>Dubicki, </em>supra. Any doubt that may remain is dispelled by our frequent reference in <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>supra, to the order of $1,200,000 payment as a \u201cdivision of property.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that the order of payment of $1,200,000 by the defendant to the plaintiff was a division of property and not lump sum alimony. The significance of this conclusion lies in the defendant\u2019s claim that interest cannot be awarded on lump sum alimony under General Statutes \u00a7 52-350\u00cd. His claim is as follows: General Statutes \u00a7 52-350\u00cd allows interest on a money judgment. General Statutes \u00a7 52-350a (13) defines a money judgment so as to exclude a \u201cfamily support judgment.\u201d Lastly, General Statutes \u00a7 52-350a (7) defines a \u201cfamily support judgment\u201d as referring to a \u201cpayment of a legal obligation for support or alimony to a spouse, former spouse, or a child and includes any such order for periodic payments whether issued pendente lite or otherwise.\u201d In view of our conclusion that the $1,200,000 payment was a division of property, we leave this issue for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The precise issue of the award of interest on a \u201cproperty settlement\u201d was considered by the Appellate Court in <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Niles, </em>supra. The husband became entitled to his share of the proceeds of the parties\u2019 marital home in accordance with the dissolution judgment. The wife had delayed payment to him and paid only in response to a motion to compel her to do so. The defendant then sought postjudgment interest on the delayed payment which the trial court awarded. In upholding the court\u2019s judgment, the Appellate Court stated: \u201cThe plaintiff next claims that the trial court erred in holding that interest may be awarded on the marital home sale proceeds which the plaintiff contends derived from a \u2018family judgment.\u2019 We assume that the plaintiff, by the use of that term, intends to refer to \u2018family support judgments.\u2019 For purposes of postjudgment procedures, that term is defined in General Statutes \u00a7 52-350a (7) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>as \u2018a judgment, order or decree of the superior court for payment of a legal obligation for support or alimony to a spouse, former spouse of child and includes any such order for periodic payments whether issued pendente lite or otherwise.\u2019 There is no statutory definition of the term \u2018family judgment\u2019 used by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u201cThe defendant, on the other hand, argues that the judgment in question was not a family support judgment, but rather constituted a \u2018money judgment,\u2019 as defined in the pertinent part of \u00a7 52-350a (13) as \u2018a judgment, order or decree of the court calling in whole or in part for the payment of a sum of money, other than a family support judgment.' We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\u201cIt is apparent that an order for the payment of money from the sale of real estate constitutes a \u2018money judgment\u2019 and not a \u2018family support judgment,\u2019 as those terms are defined, despite the judgment\u2019s origin in an action on the family docket. One party cannot, at its whim, deprive another of monies due and owing simply by changing the characterization of the obligation owed. While similarities exist between support payments and property settlements, we recognize that each serves a distinct purpose. Support, which is generally modifiable, often serves to satisfy an ongoing obligation, whereas a property settlement constitutes a final resolution of a dispute, and as such, warrants the penalty of interest when satisfaction is not obtained. We therefore conclude that the trial court properly ordered that postjudgment interest be paid.\u201d Id., 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">We concur in the reasoning and decision of the Appellate Court. The trial court did not err in the award of postjudgment interest on the defendant\u2019s payment of $525,000 to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">There is error in the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff, that portion of the judgment is set aside and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the case is remanded with direction to render judgment denying the motion for attorney\u2019s fees; there is no error in the award of interest on the payment of $525,000 to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-7\"> \u201cThe <em>defendant </em>contends that the trial court abused its discretion to assign property of either spouse to the other under [General Statutes] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>\u00a7 46b-81 by awarding the plaintiff $1,200,000, as well as a lot in California, which had an undisputed value of $375,000.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>207 Conn. 217, 229, 541 A.2d 1201 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
