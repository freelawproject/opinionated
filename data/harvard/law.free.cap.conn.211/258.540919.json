Ct. 2860, 69 L. Ed. 2d 768 (1981), the hatchback area of an automobile is part of the \u201cpassenger compartment\u201d and, therefore, within the scope of a search incident to the arrest of the operator. In an amended information, the state charged the defendant, Cesar Santiago Delossantos, with the crimes of unlawful possession and transportation of cocaine with intent to sell, in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 21a-278 (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle without a permit, in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 29-38.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a jury verdict of guilty on both counts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>the trial court sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of twenty-three years imprisonment, execution suspended after fifteen years, and five years probation. The defendant appealed to this court from the judgment of conviction. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On the night of December 26, 1986, Connecticut state police trooper Robert Kenney was conducting a radar check for speeders on the eastbound lanes of interstate route 84 in Danbury. At approximately 10:10 p.m., Kenney detected on his radar that a two door 1980 Plymouth Horizon hatchback model automobile was traveling at the rate of sixty-eight miles per hour, thirteen miles per hour over the posted speed limit. At Kenney\u2019s signal, the defendant, who was the lone occupant of the automobile, pulled over. Upon Kenney\u2019s request, the defendant produced his operator\u2019s license and an automobile registration. The automobile was registered to Percio Urena, who lived in the same apartment building as the defendant in Danbury. Urena had loaned the automobile to the defendant two days before.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Standing at the side of the automobile, Kenney looked through the left corner of the windshield. The light of his flashlight fell on what appeared to be the wooden butt of a pistol beneath the driver\u2019s seat. Kenney ordered the defendant out of the automobile, escorted him to the front and frisked him. Kenney then entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the automobile from the passenger door. He reached beneath the driver\u2019s seat and removed a fully loaded .357 magnum revolver. Kenney returned to the defendant and asked if he owned the pistol and whether he had a permit. The defendant admitted that he owned the pistol and had no permit. Kenney then placed him under arrest and handcuffed and searched him. At that moment Kenney\u2019s partner, trooper Gerald Pennington, arrived on the scene. Pennington watched the defendant while Kenney searched the automobile. The search of the front and back seats uncovered nothing. Kenney then reached into the hatchback area, lifted a black imitation leather cover, and discovered a brown paper bag. Inside the brown paper bag was a clear plastic bag containing a hard packed white powder substance. Subsequent laboratory analysis revealed that the white powder substance weighed approximately 17.3 ounces and contained 64.2 percent pure cocaine. The defendant testified at trial that he did not know the cocaine was in the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court erred: (1) in denying his motion to suppress evidence of the cocaine; (2) in excluding a defense witness\u2019 testimony that Urena, the owner of the automobile, was a cocaine dealer; (3) in denying his motions for judgment of acquittal of the \u00a7 29-38 count on the ground of insufficient evidence of the revolver\u2019s \u201coperability,\u201d and in failing to instruct the jury that \u201coperability\u201d is an element of the crime; (4) in instructing the jury on \u201cconstructive possession\u201d and \u201caggregate weight\u201d of the seized narcotics; (5) in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal based on the ground of insufficient evidence that he violated \u00a7 21a-278 (a); (6) in denying his pretrial motion to dismiss based on a claim that the trial court had no authority to sentence him under \u00a7 21a-278 (a); and (7) in denying his motion for a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>trial based on a claim of statewide selective enforcement of \u00a7 21a-278 (a). We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress evidence of the cocaine, claiming that Kenney\u2019s search of the hatchback area of the automobile was illegal. After a pretrial hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, ruling that the search was valid as a search incident to a lawful arrest. On appeal, the defendant argues that the warrantless search of the hatchback area exceeded the permissible scope of a search incident to arrest, in violation of his rights under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution. He claims, therefore, that the trial court erred in failing to suppress the evidence seized in the hatchback search. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">In <em>New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>supra, 460-61, the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cwhen a [police officer] has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile. . . . [P]olice may also examine the contents of any containers found within the passenger compartment, for if the passenger compartment is within reach of the arrestee, so also will containers in it be within his reach. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>[414 U.S. 218, 94 S. Ct. 467, 38 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1973)]; <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, 79 S. Ct. 329, 3 L. Ed. 2d 327 [1959], Such a container may, of course, be searched whether it is open or closed, since . . . the lawful custodial arrest justifies the infringement of any privacy interest the arrestee may have.\u201d The <em>Belton </em>rule \u201cencompasses only the interior of the passenger compartment of an automobile and does not encompass the trunk.\u201d Id., 460 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>670 F.2d 323, 327 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1108, 102 S. Ct. 2909, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1317 (1982), the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that, under <em>Belton, </em>the hatchback area of an automobile is part of the \u201cpassenger compartment,\u201d and therefore may be searched as a contemporaneous incident to the lawful custodial arrest of an occupant. In <em>Russell, </em>the police had probable cause to believe that there were drugs in the defendant\u2019s automobile. Id., 324. The police stopped the automobile and conducted a warrantless search while holding the defendant and three passengers in custody at the scene. The search uncovered a bag containing a handgun underneath the front seat and a large grocery type bag, covered by clothing, in the hatchback area. The second bag contained heroin. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Addressing the argument that the search of the hatchback area was unconstitutional, the court stated that \u201c[t]he question at issue . . . is whether the <em>Belton </em>rule encompasses hatchbacks. See <em>[New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>supra] at 2869 (Brennan, J., dissenting). This question has already attracted scholarly comment. See Y. Kamisar, <em>[The \u2018Automobile Search\u2019 Cases: The Court Does Little to Clarify the \u2018Labyrinth\u2019 of Judicial Uncertainty, </em>in J. Choper, Y. Kamisar &amp; L. Tribe, The Supreme Court: Trends and Developments 1980-1981], at 94-95; 30 Crim. L. Rep. (BNA) 2065, 2066 (Oct. 21, 1981) (summarizing remarks of Prof. Yale Kamisar); Kamisar, <em>Fourth Amendment Hatchback, </em>Washington Post, Oct. 15, 1981, at A29. We note particularly the comment of an authority the Court cited in <em>Belton, </em>Professor Wayne R. LaFave, author of <em>Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment. Belton, </em>Professor LaFave observes, \u2018rejects a case-by-case [approach] in favor of a standardized procedure\u2019 that police officers may follow routinely. 2 W. LaFave, supra, \u00a7 7.1, at 132 &amp; n.9.2 (Supp. 1982). In keeping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>with the <em>Belton </em>majority\u2019s intent \u2018to avoid case-by-case evaluations of control,\u2019 id. at 136, LaFave suggests that \u2018passenger compartment,\u2019 for purposes of the <em>Belton </em>rule, is properly read \u2018as including <em>all </em>space reachable without exiting the vehicle.\u2019 Id. (distinguishing, however, areas that would require \u2018some dismantling of the vehicle,\u2019 for example, door panel interiors, and other places to which there is \u2018virtually <em>no </em>chance the arrestee could have acquired access\u2019) (emphasis in original).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>supra, 326. The court concluded that \u201cin light of the emphasis the Supreme Court placed in <em>Belton </em>on a workable definition of the area of a car subject to warrantless search in conjunction with a lawful custodial arrest ... a hatchback reachable without exiting the vehicle properly ranks as part of the interior or passenger compartment.\u201d Id., 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In the present case, the trial court found that it was unnecessary to open the hatchback of Urena\u2019s automobile from the exterior to gain access, and that \u201cthe hatchback really amounts to an extension of the passenger compartment of the car. At least it\u2019s an area that\u2019s readily accessible from the interior of the car.\u201d See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>supra (hatchback within control of car occupants from interior). The defendant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s factual conclusions respecting the interior accessibility of the hatchback. That the hatchback area could not be reached by someone sitting in the front seat is immaterial under <em>Belton </em>and <em>Russell. </em>Constitutional rights are not dependent upon a person\u2019s size. We conclude, therefore, that the warrantless search of the hatchback area in this case was permissible as a search incident to the defendant\u2019s arrest. <em>New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>supra; <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 89 S. Ct. 2034, 23 L. Ed. 2d 685 (1969); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The defendant urges us to hold that even if the hatchback search is permissible as a search incident to arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>under the federal constitution, it should not be permissible under article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is beyond debate that each state has the \u201c \u2018sovereign right to adopt in its own Constitution individual liberties more expansive than those conferred by the Federal Constitution.\u2019 <em>Pruneyard Shopping Center </em>v. <em>Robins, </em>447 U.S. 74, 81, 100 S. Ct. 2035, 64 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1980); see <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Hass, </em>420 U.S. 714, 718, 95 S. Ct. 1215, 43 L. Ed. 2d 570 (1975).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>209 Conn. 98,104, 547 A.2d 10 (1988). In considering the level of individual protection and the scope of a warrantless search of an automobile under article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution, we have observed that \u201cour automobile exception permits a warrantless search of an automobile whenever the police have probable cause to do so. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 428, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 473, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986). It is also correct that we have recognized that the police may make a search without a warrant incidental to a lawful custodial arrest. Id., 424; <em>see New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>186 Conn. 45, 48, 438 A.2d 872 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>supra, 120-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">We have thus recognized that state constitutional standards enable police to make a warrantless search incident to a lawful custodial arrest. The defendant concedes that his arrest was lawful, and he has not presented any authority to support his assertion that a search incident to a lawful custodial arrest under Connecticut constitutional standards should be delimited in the manner he suggests. We hold that when police make a lawful custodial arrest of an occupant of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>automobile, and the arrestee is detained at the scene, police may contemporaneously search without a warrant the interior passenger compartment of the automobile. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>supra. The passenger compartment encompasses all \u201c \u2018space reachable without exiting the vehicle.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>supra, 326. In the present case, because the hatchback was an extension of the passenger compartment, the warrantless search contemporaneous to the defendant\u2019s arrest was proper under Connecticut state constitutional standards. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of the cocaine seized during the warrantless search of the hatchback area of Urena\u2019s automobile.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court abused its discretion by barring a defense witness\u2019 testimony that Urena, the owner of the automobile the defendant had been operating when arrested, was a cocaine dealer. Although the defendant has not abandoned this claim, he conceded at oral argument that he was no longer \u201cseriously pursuing\u201d it, and that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the offered testimony may \u201cvery well\u201d have been within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Urena testified for the state that he lived in the same apartment building as the defendant on Wooster Street in Danbury, and that he had known him for several months. According to Urena, the defendant borrowed Urena\u2019s automobile on December 24,1986, to drive to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>New York to see his family. Urena testified that he had no knowledge of the cocaine or of the handgun discovered in the automobile. He also testified that he had no criminal record and that he worked at a local store. On cross-examination, Urena denied that he had ever used or sold cocaine, and denied that he was involved in a large scale narcotics operation. He admitted, however, that in October, 1986, another car he had owned had been seized in a drug arrest. He also admitted that in December, 1985, police arrested him on drug related charges when they executed a search warrant at his residence on Spring Street in Danbury. The target of the search was Jose Nunez. The charges against Urena stemming from the Spring Street arrest were later dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Dinioio Jimenez, testifying for the defendant, stated that he was acquainted with Percio Urena.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When defense counsel asked whether Jimenez knew what Urena did for a living, the state objected on the grounds that the question was irrelevant and immaterial. The trial court excused the jury to permit the defendant to make an offer of proof. During the offer, Jimenez stated that he had known Urena for two years, that he knew that Urena was a drug dealer, and that \u201c[everybody knows in town, even the police,\u201d that Urena was a drug dealer. He testified that in November, 1986, he was visiting the defendant in his apartment when Jose Nunez came by, looking for Urena. When Urena arrived, Nunez told Urena that he \u201cneeded the stuff.\u201d Nunez and Urena then exited the apartment onto the stairs. Jimenez did not observe them after they had left the apartment. Jimenez also testified that on December 20, 1986, an individual named Jose Pena attempted to sell him a television set. According to Jimenez, Pena told him he needed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>money to pay Urena for a drug transaction. In response to the trial court\u2019s question, Jimenez testified that he had never had any drug dealings with Urena.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The trial court sustained the state\u2019s objection, ruling that Jimenez\u2019 testimony was inadmissible because \u201c[y]\u00b0u cannot impeach a witness by contradicting his testimony as to collateral matters. ...\u201d The court also rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the testimony was admissible as evidence of another\u2019s guilt, stating that \u201cif you had a direct witness that could show the involvement of Mr. Urena specifically in this transaction, that\u2019s a whole entirely different matter but this man isn\u2019t testifying to that.\u201d The defendant then informed the court that he intended to subpoena the Danbury police department for any records or notes relating to drug investigations of Urena.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Subsequently, on August 5,1987, the trial court permitted the defendant to mark four documents for identification for appellate review. Of particular significance, the defendant\u2019s exhibit 16 is a Danbury police department incident report relating to the execution of the search warrant at Urena\u2019s residence in December of 1985. The reporting officer disclosed that upon entering the apartment, the police discovered Urena in the bathroom where the toilet was flushing. Urena had in his possession over $4000 in cash, and police found several items of drug paraphernalia and two guns in the apartment. In that incident, Jose Nunez was arrested along with Urena. In addition, exhibit 13 indicates that it was Nunez who, in October, 1986, had been arrested while operating an automobile registered to Urena and, as a result of the arrest, convicted on narcotics charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of Jimenez\u2019 testimony violated his federal and state constitutional rights to present witnesses on his own behalf. He argues that the proffered testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>together with the evidence that Urena owned the automobile in which police discovered the cocaine, sufficiently connected Urena to the crime. He also argues that Jimenez\u2019 testimony was admissible to impeach Urena\u2019s assertions that he had no involvement in drug activity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">We have considered on several occasions the admissibility of evidence offered to inculpate a person other than the accused in the commission of the crime. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Milner, </em>206 Conn. 512, 517, 539 A.2d 80 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Echols, </em>203 Conn. 385, 392-93, 524 A.2d 1143 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Burge, </em>195 Conn. 232, 252, 487 A.2d 532 (1985); <em>Siemon </em>v. <em>Stoughton, </em>184 Conn. 547, 555, 440 A.2d 210 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Giguere, </em>184 Conn. 400, 405, 439 A.2d 1040 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 645-46, 431 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinsey, </em>173 Conn. 344, 347-48, 377 A.2d 1095 (1977). \u201c \u2018Ordinarily, evidence concerning a third party\u2019s involvement is not admissible until there is some evidence which <em>directly connects </em>that third party with the crime.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinsey, </em>[supra, 348]. \u2018The defendant can always show that some other person and not the defendant committed the crime; however, it is within the sound discretion of the trial court to refuse to admit such evidence when it simply affords a possible ground of possible suspicion against another person.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Giguere, </em>supra, 405; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>John, </em>210 Conn. 652, 670, 557 A.2d 93 (1989). Generally, the evidence must demonstrate that guilt in the other is inconsistent with guilt in the accused. <em>State </em>v. <em>Zaccagnini, </em>308 S.E.2d 131, 136 (W. Va. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The rules of relevancy govern the admissibility of third party inculpatory evidence. Evidence is relevant if \u201c \u2018 \u201cit tends to establish a fact in issue or to corroborate other direct evidence in the case. . . . \u2018One fact is relevant to another fact whenever, according <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>to the common course of events, the existence of the one, taken alone or in connection with other facts, renders the existence of the other either certain or more probable. . . \u2019 (Citations omitted.) <em>[State </em>v. <em>Echols, </em>supra, 393.] A trial court\u2019s ruling on the relevancy of such evidence will be reversed only if the court has abused its discretion or an injustice appears to have been done. Id.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Milner, </em>supra, 517-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">In the present case, the defendant concedes that he could produce no direct evidence of Urena\u2019s involvement in the crime. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinsey, </em>supra, 347-48 (evidence that a third person engaged in drug activity inadmissible where defendant was unable to demonstrate that the third person was in state or selling narcotics at the time of the offense); <em>State </em>v. <em>Aspinall, </em>6 Conn. App. 546, 552, 506 A.2d 1063 (1986) (trial court did not abuse discretion in excluding evidence that third person with same first name as defendant was cocaine dealer); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>770 F.2d 825, 829-30 (9th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1103,106 S. Ct. 888, 88 L. Ed. 2d 922 (1986) (evidence of drug paraphernalia in codefendant\u2019s house inadmissible); cf. <em>Wesenberg </em>v. <em>State, </em>504 So. 2d 328, 334 (Ala. Crim. App. 1986) (because possession of narcotics may be joint, court properly excluded testimony regarding others\u2019 ownership of controlled substances found in search); but see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>581 F.2d 933, 936 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (where defendant arrested in house and search of basement uncovered narcotics, trial court erred in excluding evidence that son of woman who owned house dealt in drugs). Moreover, the defendant\u2019s possession of the automobile for the two days immediately preceding his arrest attenuated Urena\u2019s connection to the automobile. Thus, this is not a case in which police discovered the contraband in an automobile the operator borrowed minutes prior to the arrest. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vigee, </em>518 So. 2d 501, 503-504 (La. 1988) (where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>defendant stopped approximately twenty minutes after he borrowed automobile, error to exclude evidence that recent owner was known drug dealer).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Further, Jimenez\u2019 testimony regarding Urena\u2019s involvement with narcotics was not inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Zaccagnini, </em>supra. Although this evidence, if credited by the jury, may have established that Urena was a cocaine trafficker, that fact would not have been inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s responsibility for possessing and transporting cocaine with intent to sell. Because the defendant offered no evidence directly connecting Urena to the specific crime, the proffered testimony was not relevant to any fact in issue. <em>State </em>v. <em>Milner, </em>supra, 518; <em>State </em>v. <em>Echols, </em>supra. Finally, since Jimenez\u2019 testimony was immaterial, Urena\u2019s denial of narcotics activity on cross-examination was not subject to contradiction by extrinsic evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>173 Conn. 317, 327-28, 377 A.2d 1082 (1977) (testimony on collateral matter cannot be contradicted by other evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in denying his motions for judgment of acquittal on the weapon count, General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 29-38, since the state offered no proof that the revolver was operable. He also claims that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that the state had to prove operability as an element of the crime. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 29-38 provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny person who knowingly has, in any vehicle owned, operated or occupied by him, any weapon for which a proper permit has not been issued as provided in section 29-28 or section 53-206, or has not registered such weapon as required by section 53-202 . . . shall be fined not more than one thou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>sand dollars or imprisoned not more than five years or both. . . .

Nothing in \u00a7 29-38 remotely suggests that operability of the weapon is an element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The defendant nevertheless argues that because \u201crevolver\u201d as used in \u00a7 29-38 is defined in \u00a7 29-27<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as \u201cany firearm having a barrel less than twelve inches in length,\u201d and because \u00a7 53a-3 (19)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> defines \u201cfirearm\u201d as \u201cany . . . revolver or other weapon, whether loaded or unloaded from which a shot may be discharged,\u201d the state had to prove that the revolver seized in the automobile was capable of discharging a shot. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s assumption that the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d found in the penal code applies to prosecutions under \u00a7 29-38. Sections 29-27 and 29-38 were enacted in substantially their present forms in 1949. General Statutes (1949 Rev.) \u00a7\u00a7 4157, 4169. The penal code, however, was enacted in 1969. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Public Acts 1969, No. 828. Because the offense proscribed in \u00a7 29-38 antedated the penal code by twenty years, it is obvious that the legislature did not intend the definition of \u201crevolver\u201d in \u00a7 29-27 to be augmented by a definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d that did not exist. Moreover, neither the substantive section, \u00a7 29-38, nor the applicable definitional section, \u00a7 29-27, expressly look to \u00a7 53a-3 to augment the definition of \u201crevolver\u201d found in \u00a7 29-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Further, \u00a7 53a-3 (18) defines \u201cpistol\u201d or \u201crevolver\u201d as \u201cany firearm having a barrel less than twelve inches.\u201d This language is identical to that in \u00a7 29-27, the section expressly defining \u201crevolver\u201d as used in \u00a7 29-38. If the definition of \u201crevolver\u201d applicable to \u00a7 29-38 were subject to penal code definitions, \u00a7 29-27 would be superfluous, since \u00a7 53a-3 (18) provides the same definition. Such an interpretation undercuts the established principle that \u201c \u2018no part of a legislative enactment is to be treated as insignificant or unnecessary, and there is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase . . . . \u2019 \u201d <em>DeFonce Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>State, </em>198 Conn. 185,187, 501 A.2d 745 (1985). We also note that \u00a7 29-38 includes in its list of prohibited weapons \u201cany martial arts weapon as defined by section 53a-3.\u201d The legislature added this provision in 1986; Public Acts 1986, No. 86-280; thus, there can be no question that the reference to \u00a7 53a-3 solely pertains to \u201cmartial arts weapon.\u201d Cf. <em>Horak </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>181 Conn. 614, 616-17, 436 A.2d 783 (1980) (use of term \u201cor\u201d connotes separability). Section 29-38 does not, however, refer to \u00a7 53a-3 for a definition of any other weapon. Because \u00a7 29-38 specifically refers to \u00a7 53a-3 to define only one of the several \u201cweapons\u201d listed, we conclude that the legislature did not intend the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d in \u00a7 53a-3 (19) to apply to the term \u201crevolver\u201d in \u00a7 29-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>We acknowledge that \u00a7 53a-2<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 9states that the provisions of the penal code \u201cshall apply to any offense defined in this title or the general statutes, unless otherwise expressly provided or unless the context otherwise requires <em>. \u201d </em>For the reasons discussed above, however, we are persuaded that the \u201ccontext\u201d of \u00a7\u00a7 29-27 and 29-38 implicitly renders the penal code definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d inapplicable to a prosecution for violating \u00a7 29-38.

Finally, the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>State </em>v. <em>Zayas, </em>3 Conn. App. 289, 489 A.2d 380, cert. denied, 195 Conn. 803, 491 A.2d 1104 (1985), is unavailing.

The Appellate Court ruled that the trial court did nor err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal since \u201c[t]he jury could reasonably have concluded that the gun was operable . . . . \u201d Id., 299. In reaching this conclusion, the Appellate Court offered no analysis of the defendant\u2019s premise. In light of this omission, we do- not find <em>Zayas </em>persuasive. Because \u201coperability\u201d of the \u201cweapion\u201d is not an essential element of \u00a7 29-38, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal or in failing to instruct the jury that \u201coperability\u201d is an element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u00cdV</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The defendant next claims: (A) that the trial court erred in its jury instructions on \u201cconstructive possession\u201d and \u201caggregate weight\u201d of the seized narcotics; and (B) that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for violating General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 21a-278 (a).

A review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>record reveals that the trial court\u2019s instructions were a correct statement of the law, and fairly presented the case to the jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>199 Conn. 255, 271, 506 A.2d 1041 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u201cIn order to prove illegal possession of a narcotic substance, it is necessary to establish that the defendant knew the character of the substance, knew of its presence and exercised dominion and control over it.

This principle does not conflict with our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>165 Conn. 577, 596, 345 A.2d 532 (1973), that \u201c[i]t cannot be logically and reasonably presumed that an occupant of a motor vehicle knew of the presence of an unregistered weapon in a vehicle simply on the fact that he was an occupant. Presence alone, \u2018unilluminated by other facts\u2019 is insufficient proof of possession.\u201d In <em>Watson, </em>the defendant and four others occupied the automobile at the time of apprehension. Id., 581. Thus, the defendant in <em>Watson </em>did not have exclusive possession of the vehicle when police discovered the contraband. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Alfonso, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The defendant also claims that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that \u201canother element for violation of Section 21a-278 (a) is that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the preparation, compound, mixture or substance contains either an aggregate weight of one ounce or more of cocaine. The term aggregate weight means the entire weight of the preparation, compound, mixture or substance which is alleged to contain the cocaine. The illegal substance will frequently be less than ten percent pure cocaine. The balance being sugar, milk, quinine, menite or the like. In other words, you must consider the weight of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>entire substance including the alleged illegal drug in combination with any other substance it may contain to be one ounce or more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The relevant part of General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 21a-278 (a) provides that an offense is committed by \u201c[a]ny person who . . . transports with the intent to sell or dispense . . . one or more preparations, compounds, mixtures or substances containing an aggregate weight of one ounce or more of . . . cocaine . . . . \u201d The defendant argues that this language means that the state must prove that the substance seized contains at least one ounce of pure cocaine. Consequently, he claims, the trial court erred by permitting the jury to convict him if it found that the substance in the defendant\u2019s possession weighed at least one ounce and contained any amount of cocaine. The state, on the other hand, argues that the term \u201caggregate weight\u201d means that the substance containing the cocaine must weigh one ounce. It asserts that \u00a7 21a-278 (a) expresses the legislature\u2019s intent to address the problem of narcotics distribution as it occurs \u201con the street,\u201d where diluted substances routinely pass from dealer to user.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">We need not address these arguments since the evidence presented by the state, and not challenged by the defendant, demonstrated conclusively that the substance seized from the automobile contained well over one ounce of \u201cpure\u201d cocaine. The state\u2019s toxicologist testified that the substance weighed 17.3 ounces, and contained 64.2 percent cocaine by weight. Simple arithmetic establishes that pure cocaine composed 11.1066 ounces of the substance, exceeding the threshhold amount by more than 10 ounces. Although the defendant argues that the jury could have rejected the toxicologist\u2019s testimony pertaining to the concentration of cocaine, he conceded at oral argument that he made no attempt to impeach this testimony regarding either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>the weight of the substance or the percentage of pure cocaine. Under these circumstances, therefore, the trial court\u2019s instructions could not have deprived the defendant of a fair trial.

We disagree. \u201cIt is axiomatic that in reviewing a claim of insufficiency of the evidence, this court construes the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict and will affirm that verdict if it is reasonably supported by the evidence and the logical inferences drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>206 Conn. 300, 315, 537 A.2d 1021 (1988). \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018[T]he issue is whether . . . the cumulative effect of the evidence was sufficient to justify the verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. \u2019 . . . \u201d \u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Suggs, </em>209 Conn. 733, 758, 553 A.2d 1110 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">As we have indicated, the jury could have inferred the defendant\u2019s possession of the cocaine from his exclusive possession of the automobile. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>supra. The defendant had been in possession of the automobile for two days when the police apprehended him on his drive from New York to Connecticut on interstate route 84. Urena testifed that he had-not been responsible for placing the cocaine in the automobile. Moreover, if the jury found that the defendant had not been in exclusive possession of the car, there were other circumstances to support the conclusion that the defendant knowingly possessed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>cocaine. <em>State </em>v. <em>Alfonso, </em>supra. When detained by Kenney, the defendant admitted that he owned the loaded magnum revolver found under the front seat. The state presented expert testimony that individuals possessing large amounts of drugs often carry weapons to protect their goods. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>844 F.2d 916, 926 (2d Cir. 1988) (weapons are tools of narcotics trade); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crespo, </em>834 F.2d 267, 271 (2d Cir. 1987), cert. denied, U.S. , 108 S.

In addition, the defendant testified that, while in New York, thieves broke through the windshield of the automobile and stole a jacket from the front seat. The jury could have inferred from this evidence that the cocaine was not in the automobile prior to the break in.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Finally, the jury could reasonably have found that the defendant knew of the narcotic character of the substance. \u201cIt is by now common knowledge that cocaine is often packaged as a white powder in small plastic bags.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Parent, </em>8 Conn. App. 469, 473, 513 A.2d 725 (1986). With respect to the remaining elements of \u00a7 21a-278 (a), the state\u2019s toxicologist testified that the amount of cocaine exceeded one ounce. The defendant did not challenge this testimony. Evidence that the seized substance weighed 17.3 ounces of 64.2 percent pure cocaine supported the inference that the defendant possessed the cocaine with intent to sell. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Vilalastra, </em>207 Conn. 35, 38-39, 540 A.2d 42 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>169 Conn. 322, 334, 363 A.2d 72 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Clemons, </em>168 Conn. 395, 407, 363 A.2d 33, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 855, 96 S.

The state appealed, arguing that the phrase in \u00a7 53a-54d that one convicted of arson murder must be \u201cpunished by life imprisonment and shall not be eligible for parole\u201d precluded the trial court from suspending any portion of the life sentence.

We cannot conclude, however, that in enacting \u00a7 53a-35a, the legislature intended to leave standing the substantive offense set forth in \u00a7 21a-278 (a), but to eliminate punishment for a commission of that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">As was the arson murder offense at issue in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dupree, </em>supra, 662, the narcotics offense of \u00a7 21a-278 (a) is an ''unclassified felony.\u201d Section 53a-35a (7) provides that \u201cthe sentence of imprisonment shall be a definite sentence and the term shall be . . . (7) for an unclassified felony, a term in accordance with the sentence specified in the section of the general statutes that defines the crime.\u201d The sentencing range specified in \u00a7 21a-278 (a) is \u201ca minimum term of not less than five years nor more than twenty years; and, a maximum term of life imprisonment.\u201d The effect of \u00a7 53a-35a is \u201cto put [\u00a7 21a-278 (a)] in the context of a definite sentencing scheme and to render the [indeterminate sentencing language] in the statute meaningless.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dupree, </em>supra, 659. Because the phrase \u201cnor more than twenty years\u201d contemplates indeterminate sentencing, \u00a7 53a-35a implicitly repealed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>language. Id.; <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>supra. Thus, under \u00a7 53a-35a, the minimum sentence for a violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (a) is five years, and the maximum sentence is life imprisonment. The trial court in the present case therefore did not err in denying that portion of the defendant\u2019s supplemental motion to dismiss directed toward the indeterminate sentencing provisions of \u00a7 21a-278 (a). Moreover, the trial court complied with the definite sentencing requirement of \u00a7 53a-35a, as applied to \u00a7 21a-278 (a), by sentencing the defendant to a term of twenty-three years, execution suspended after fifteen years, and five years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The defendant\u2019s last claim concerns the question whether his prosecution under General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 21a-278 (a) violated his due process and equal protection rights under the state and federal constitutions. Prior to the trial, the defendant filed a supplemental motion to dismiss, arguing that the Danbury state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office had charged similarly situated defendants under \u00a7\u00a7 21a-277 and 21a-278 (b),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>fix penalties less severe than the sentence of life imprisonment authorized by \u00a7 21a-278 (a). The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Several months after the defendant had been convicted and sentenced, and after he had taken an appeal, he moved for a new trial, arguing that the \u00a7 21a-278 (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>prosecution infringed his constitutional rights in that the state\u2019s attorneys\u2019 offices throughout Connecticut had been prosecuting similarly situated defendants for the less severe offenses. In connection with this motion, the defendant subpoenaed the state\u2019s attorneys for eleven of the twelve judicial districts, with the exception of Danbury. Eight of the eleven offices responded with letters and, in some cases, affidavits. The chief state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office filed a motion to quash the subpoenas. On August 2, 1988, the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the motions. On September 14, 1988, the court issued a memorandum of decision, in which it granted the state\u2019s motion to quash the subpoenas, and denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The defendant concedes that the Danbury state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office \u201cbasically\u201d prosecuted all cases that fell under \u00a7 2 la-278 (a). Thus, in effect, the defendant has abandoned the claim raised in his pretrial motion to dismiss, and now focuses on allegations that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s offices in the remaining eleven judicial districts have not so prosecuted such cases. A detailed analysis of the many facts and subissues surrounding the defendant\u2019s claim serves no rational purpose. \u201cAbsent a showing of a selection deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion or other arbitrary classification . . . conscious selectivity in enforcement of the law is not in itself a constitutional violation. <em>Oyler </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>368 U.S. 448, 456, 82 S. Ct. 501, 7 L. Ed. 2d 446 (1962). A defendant claiming discriminatory prosecution must show (1) that others similarly situated have generally not been prosecuted and that he has been singled out and (2) that he is the victim of invidious discrimination based on impermissible considerations such as race, religion, or the exercise of a constitutionally protected right. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number><em>States </em>v. <em>Berrios, </em>501 F.2d 1207,1211 (2d Cir. 1974).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>188 Conn. 432, 474, 450 A.2d 828 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Even assuming that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s offices in judicial districts other than Danbury have not prosecuted similarly situated defendants under \u00a7 21a-278 (a), an assertion we do not evaluate, the defendant\u2019s \u201cselective prosecution\u201d theory is meritless. He has not drawn our attention to any reported cases holding that incidental discrepancies in prosecutions between juridical divisions within a state, arising from the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, constitute \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>193 N.C. 290, 293, 136 S.E. 709 (1927) (statute immunizing residents of five counties from prison sentence applicable to residents in all other counties violates equal protection). Moreover, the defendant had no constitutional right to transport cocaine with intent to sell. Absent an allegation of a cognizable instance of \u201cinvidious discrimination based on impermissible considerations such as race, religion, or the exercise of a constitutionally protected right\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>supra; the defendant\u2019s selective prosecution claim is feckless. Consequently, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s pretrial supplemental motion to dismiss and his motion for a new trial, or in granting the state\u2019s motion to quash the subpoenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b278-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1987)] Sec. 21a-278.
