Acts 1984, No. 21, \u00a7 1,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which excused the failure of the estate to present its claim to the claims commissioner within one year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>after it had accrued, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 4-148 (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> violates the prohibition in article first, \u00a7 l<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of our state constitution against any person being \u201centitled to exclusive public emoluments or privileges from the community.\u201d The trial court found such a violation and rendered summary judgment for the state. The plaintiff, Lawrence J. Merly, as administrator of the estate of Alberto Ocasio, has appealed and claims that the court erred in granting the state\u2019s motion for summary judgment because: (1) the alternative provision of \u00a7 4-148 (a), allowing claims for injury to be presented within one year after \u201cthe date when the damage or injury is discovered,\u201d but no later \u201cthan three years from the date of the act or event complained of,\u201d was applicable; (2) there were genuine issues of material fact concerning the cause of the delay in presenting the claim that could be resolved only by a trial; (3) the rejection by the legislature of the recommendation of the commissioner to deny the plaintiff\u2019s claim implicitly accomplished the same purpose as the special act in allowing the claim to be pursued; (4) the action of the commissioner in granting permission to sue after passage of the special act is not reviewable by the court; and (5) the special act does not violate our state constitutional prohibition against \u201cexclusive public emoluments or privileges\u201d in view of circumstances allegedly indicating a public purpose for the act. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>On July 30,1979, at about 5:40 a.m., Alberto Ocasio was found dead after he had hanged himself by using his pajama bottom in a men\u2019s room at the Fairfield Hills Hospital, a psychiatric hospital operated by the state. An autopsy was performed that day and a death certificate was prepared, which was filed the next day, stating the cause of death to have been \u201casphyxia by hanging . . . suicide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The decedent had been admitted to the hospital as a patient on a physician\u2019s emergency certification on July 24, 1979, six days before his death. This admission had resulted from his attempt to commit suicide on that date at the Bridgeport police headquarters after he had been arrested for a disturbance. The decedent had also been treated at the hospital after having attempted suicide about one month before his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The decedent\u2019s family made no attempt to pursue any claim against the state with regard to his death until late January, 1981, when they sent a letter requesting a copy of the autopsy report to the office of the chief medical examiner. On April 16, 1981, a written claim requesting permission to sue the state for wrongful death was filed with the claims commissioner by the plaintiff administrator. The commissioner dismissed the claim on July 15, 1983, denying permission to sue because the claim had not been filed within the time allowed by \u00a7 4-148 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-158 (a), the claims commissioner reported to the General Assembly at its February 1984 session his action denying the plaintiff\u2019s claim and sought approval thereof. Instead, the General Assembly voted to reject the commissioner\u2019s recommendation. Substitute House Joint Resolution 21. Thereafter, Special Acts 1984, No. 21, \u00a7 1 was enacted, which authorized the estate to \u201cprosecute its claim against the state notwithstanding the lack of proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>notice.\u201d The act also barred the state \u201cfrom setting up the failure to comply with the provisions of sections 4-147 and 4-148 of the general statutes with respect to the claim\u201d and \u201cfrom denying that notice of the claim was properly and timely given pursuant to [those statutes].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"pA_\">The plaintiff once again sought permission to sue the state from the claims commissioner.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The state moved to dismiss this request, maintaining that the special act was unconstitutional. The commissioner rejected the state\u2019s motion upon the ground that he lacked jurisdiction to decide such a constitutional issue. He authorized the plaintiff to institute suit on the claim against the state pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-160 (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The plaintiff commenced this action on October 10, 1986, more than seven years after the date of the decedent\u2019s death, claiming that the suicide resulted from the negligence of the Fairfield Hills Hospital in failing to protect against the likelihood of such an event in view of the decedent\u2019s mental condition and his previous suicide attempts, of which state hospital personnel should have been aware.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The plaintiff claims that summary judgment should not have been granted because there remain genuine issues of fact as to whether the claim for wrongful death had accrued within one year before it was presented to the commissioner on April 16,1981. Section 4-148 (a) provides that such claims \u201cshall be deemed to accrue on the date when the damage or injury is sustained or discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered . . . . \u201d The plaintiff does not dispute that the injury was \u201csustained\u201d on July 30, 1979, when the decedent\u2019s death occurred. He contends, nevertheless, that the statute contains three alternatives, any of which may be selected as the date when a claim \u201caccrues\u201d: (1) the date the legal injury was sustained; (2) the date the legal injury was discovered; or (3) the date when in the exercise of reasonable care the legal injury should have been discovered. Relying on the second alternative, the plaintiff maintains that the decedent\u2019s family did not actually discover that the decedent\u2019s death had been caused by any wrongful act until after February, 1981, when they received a response to their inquiry regarding the autopsy report. Thus, he argues that his claim filed with the commissioner on April 16, 1981, was presented within one year after actual discovery of the injury, as allowed by \u00a7 4-148 (a), and that the contrary finding of the commissioner, which the legislature disapproved, was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The state maintains that it is unnecessary to decide whether the claims commissioner erred in concluding initially that the wrongful death claim had not been presented within the time allowed by \u00a7 4-148 (a). The only issue, according to the state, is the constitutionality of the special act validating the notice of claim that had been filed and authorizing the estate to prosecute its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>claim against the state despite its untimeliness. The portion of the special act referring to the claim as \u201cotherwise valid except that proper notice of said claim was not filed with the clerk of the office of the claims commissioner . . . within the time specified by section 4-148 of the general statutes\u201d indicates that the legislature has effectively ratified the finding of the commissioner that the plaintiff had failed to comply with the time limit of \u00a7 4-148 (a). The terms of the act indicate an intention to allow the plaintiff to proceed with his claim despite the untimeliness of its presentation to the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Because the principal issue presented in this case is whether the special act on which the plaintiff relies should be declared invalid as an exclusive emolument or privilege, however, we must explore whether there is any conceivable justification for this challenged legislation from the public viewpoint. <em>Hillier </em>v. <em>East Hartford, </em>167 Conn. 100,107-109, 355 A.2d 1 (1974); <em>Tough </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>162 Conn. 274, 294, 294 A.2d 67 (1972); <em>Sanger </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>124 Conn. 183, 189, 198 A. 746 (1938). If the initial determination of the commissioner concerning noncompliance with \u00a7 4-148 (a) was mistaken, even though the legislature apparently reached the same conclusion, it could not be said that the plaintiff had been given any special privilege in being allowed to pursue a claim that had in fact been presented within the time allowed. Accordingly, we must address the issues the plaintiff has raised concerning the applicability of \u00a7 4-148 (a) as a bar to his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">This court has construed the word \u201cinjury\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 52-584,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which establishes the date for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>commencement of the period allowed for bringing a malpractice action as \u201ctwo years from the date when the injury is first sustained or discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered,\u201d to refer to some form of actionable harm. <em>Catz </em>v. <em>Rubenstein, </em>201 Conn. 39, 45, 513 A.2d 98 (1986). \u201c \u2018Actionable harm\u2019 occurs when the plaintiff discovers, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have discovered, the essential elements of a cause of action.\u201d <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Stovell, </em>205 Conn. 1, 6, 529 A.2d 710 (1987). The statute begins to run when the plaintiff discovers some form of actionable harm, not the fullest manifestation thereof. <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Hartford Hospital, </em>192 Conn. 451, 460, 472 A.2d 1257 (1984). Applying this construction of the word \u201cinjury\u201d to the same term as used in the similar provisions of \u00a7 4-148 (a), we agree with the plaintiff that his claim was not necessarily barred by the lapse of one year from July 30,1979, when the decedent\u2019s death occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">We have not previously considered the interpretation advanced by the plaintiff that the phrase in \u00a7 4-148 (a), \u201csustained or discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered,\u201d permits a claim to be presented within one year of the actual discovery of actionable harm, even though such harm would have been discovered earlier if reasonable care had been exercised. Implicitly, however, we rejected such a construction of the similar phrase in \u00a7 52-584, \u201cfirst sustained or discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered,\u201d when we approved the granting of summary judgment for the defendant in <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Stovell, </em>supra, 7. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>we concluded that the plaintiff \u201cwas aware of circumstances indicating that he had suffered a form of \u2018actionable harm\u2019 and should have discovered his injury at that time.\u201d Id. To hold that a claimant has an option to present his claim within one year from the actual discovery of actionable harm rather than from the time when such harm \u201cin the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered\u201d would render the latter phrase superfluous and wholly ineffective in requiring reasonable diligence on the part of claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The plaintiff also contends that there were genuine issues of fact such as to preclude summary judgment with respect to whether the \u201cactionable harm\u201d suffered should have been discovered any earlier than one year before the presentation of the claim on April 16,1981. He points to the fact that the autopsy report was not signed by the acting chief medical examiner, who had performed the autopsy, until June 17, 1980, and that requests made of the examiner\u2019s office by medical personnel at Fairfield Hills Hospital for the return of medical records and for copies of the autopsy report were not complied with fully until some time in June, 1980. He does not explain, however, how these delays on the part of state employees induced the decedent\u2019s family to wait until late January, 1981, almost one and one-half years after the death, before initiating their investigation. It is not claimed that the state officials who requested information concerning the suicide were in any way connected with the family. Furthermore, since the publicly recorded death certificate specified the cause of death to have been asphyxia by hanging under circumstances indicating suicide, any delay in the preparation of the autopsy report could not have impeded the discovery of actionable harm to the dece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>dent. The report merely confirmed the conclusions of the medical examiner as to the cause of death that had been set forth in the death certificate..</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The plaintiff contends that knowledge of the decedent\u2019s suicide, as stated in the death certificate, would not alone have indicated malpractice and that an examination of the medical records indicating awareness of the decedent\u2019s previous suicide attempts on the part of hospital personnel was necessary before the family could possibly have learned the basis for a malpractice claim. He argues that a review of all the medical records as well as the autopsy report was necessary before any qualified expert opinion as to the existence of malpractice could have been obtained. In <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Stovell, </em>supra, 6, we rejected a similar argument that the malpractice statute of limitations should not begin to run until the plaintiff \u201cdiscovered <em>all </em>the information the defendant was allegedly obliged to disclose to him.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In the present case, we conclude that the undisputed fact that the family, until one and one-half years after learning of the decedent\u2019s suicide, did not start any investigation into the circumstances under which-it had occurred constituted as a matter of law a failure to exercise reasonable care to discover the accrual of the wrongful death claim. The plaintiff has advanced no circumstances to justify such an inordinate delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">The plaintiff argues that, regardless of the validity of the special act, the rejection<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> by the legislature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>the commissioner\u2019s recommendation that no award be granted to the estate of the decedent on its claim was in itself a sufficient basis, apart from the special act, to allow the commissioner to reconsider and then to grant his request for permission to sue the state. We conclude that the rejection of the recommendation that no award be made did not authorize further consideration by the commissioner of the request for permission to sue and that the special act was essential for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The claims commissioner is authorized to \u201capprove immediate payment of just claims not exceeding seven thousand five hundred dollars.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-158 (a).* ******<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The commissioner, however, \u201cshall make his recommendations to the general assembly for payment or rejection of amounts exceeding seven thousand five hundred dollars. . . . The general assembly may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>accept, alter or reject any such recommendation and shall not be required to hold public hearings thereon.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-159.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In rejecting the commissioner\u2019s recommendation for disapproval of any award to the plaintiff, the legislature was clearly performing its function as authorized by \u00a7 4-159.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">With respect to permission to sue the state, however, \u201c[w]hen the claims commissioner deems it just and equitable, he may authorize suit against the state on any claim which, in his opinion, presents an issue of law or fact under which the state, were it a private person, could be liable.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-160 (a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There is no statutory provision requiring legislative approval of the commissioner\u2019s action in granting or denying permission to sue the state. The plaintiff\u2019s \u201cnotice of claim\u201d filed with the commissioner contained not only a request for permission to sue the state, but also \u201ca statement of the amount requested,\u201d in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 4-147 (3).* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>the commissioner in dismissing the claim, in which the amount requested was specified to be $5 million was twofold: \u201cNo award can be granted and permission to sue is denied.\u201d In submitting to the legislature his recommendation that no award be granted, the commissioner must be deemed to have acted pursuant to \u00a7 4-159, which requires that he seek approval of his rejection of claims exceeding $7500.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The action of the legislature in rejecting the commissioner\u2019s recommendation that no award be made on the plaintiff\u2019s claim, therefore, does not also imply a legislative grant of authority to sue the state or to present the request for such permission once more to the commissioner.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The commissioner never submitted his denial of permission to sue to the general assembly for its consideration, nor was he required to do so. The rejection of the recommendation denying any award in no way detracted from the effectiveness of the commissioner\u2019s denial of permission to sue. Indeed, the legislature itself recognized that rejection of the recommendation standing alone would not help the plaintiff and for that reason proceeded thereafter to enact the special act allowing the claim to be pursued despite the bar of \u00a7 4-148 (a). Accordingly, we reject the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the special act is a mere superfluity and that the rejection of the commissioner\u2019s recommendation denying any award implicitly accomplished the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The plaintiff maintains that judicial review of the constitutionality of the special act is precluded by General Statutes \u00a7 4-164 (b), which provides that \u201c[t]he action of the claims commissioner in approving or rejecting payment of any claim or part thereof shall be final and conclusive on all questions of law and fact and shall not be subject to review except by the General Assembly.\u201d This statute, however, applies only to the commissioner\u2019s action \u201cin approving or rejecting payment of any claim or part thereof\u201d and corresponds to the provision of \u00a7 4-159 requiring the commissioner to recommend to the General Assembly the \u201cpayment or rejection\u201d of claims exceeding $7500. As we have previously explained, there is no requirement that the commissioner\u2019s grant or denial of permission to sue the state be submitted to the legislature for approval. Section 4-164 (b), therefore, by its very terms is inapplicable to the grant of permission to sue that the commissioner made pursuant to the special act. Having concluded that there is no statutory bar to the state\u2019s challenge of this action of the commissioner, we need not address the issue of whether, if such a bar existed, it would be constitutional thus to insulate from judicial review an enactment claimed to violate article first, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">We have construed the provision of article first, \u00a7 1 prohibiting \u201cexclusive public emoluments or privileges\u201d to apply to legislation preferring certain individuals over others when wholly unrelated to the public interest. \u201cNo enactment creating a preference can withstand constitutional attack if the sole objective of the General Assembly is to grant personal gain or advantage to an individual. Its validity is contingent, at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>in part, upon its furthering a public purpose; if enacted with that end in view, legislation can be sustained even though it may incidentally confer a direct benefit upon an individual or a class.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Higgins </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>139 Conn. 102,106, 90 A.2d 862 (1952). \u201cOnly if an act serves some public purpose can it be constitutionally sufficient.\u201d <em>Tough </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>supra, 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Under circumstances like those in the present case, where a special act has allowed a person named therein to bring a suit based upon a statutory cause of action that would otherwise be barred for failure to comply with a time limit specified in the statute, we have ordinarily been unable to discern any public purpose sufficient to sustain the enactment. <em>Vecchio </em>v. <em>Sewer Authority, </em>176 Conn. 497, 503-507,408 A.2d 254 (1979) (special act validating an appeal from a sewer assessment commenced after expiration of the time for taking such an appeal held unconstitutional); <em>Hillier </em>v. <em>East Hartford, </em>supra (special act validating notice of sidewalk defect given to municipality after time allowed held unconstitutional). We have also found no public purpose in a special act, which we held invalid, allowing a plaintiff to sue the highway commissioner in negligence and removing the concurring negligence of anyone but the plaintiff and her father as a defense. <em>Tough </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>supra, 292-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The plaintiff maintains, nevertheless, that the special act he relies upon may be sustained as serving some public purpose because the legislature could reasonably have concluded that various state officials were at least partly responsible for the delay in presenting the claim. He cites <em>Sanger </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, where this court upheld a special act validating notice of an injury caused by a sidewalk defect that failed to comply with the statutory requirements. The notice had been prepared by an assistant city clerk, upon whom the plaintiff had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>relied for its preparation and to whom she had given all necessary information. We concluded that the plaintiff had presented <em>\u201ca </em>situation which would afford strong equitable grounds for legislative interference\u201d and that these reasons presumably had motivated passage of the special act. \u201cMunicipalities may be compelled not only to recognize their legal obligations but also to discharge those of an equitable and moral nature.\u201d Id., 189. In relying upon <em>Sanger, </em>the plaintiff claims that the state\u2019s delay in preparing the autopsy report and in making the hospital records available was a significant factor in the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The plaintiff, however, is unable to explain how any action of a state employee impeded the decedent\u2019s family in discovering the basis for a wrongful death action and caused them to make no effort to prosecute their claim until almost six months beyond the period for its presentation allowed by \u00a7 4-148 (a). There are no circumstances in this case comparable to the situation in <em>Sanger, </em>where the municipal clerk had been responsible for the deficiencies in the statutory notice. The inaction of the decedent\u2019s family here was not induced by any agency of the state and cannot serve as the basis for implying any equitable or moral obligation on the part of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The plaintiff also relies upon two additional grounds, recognized in <em>Tough </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>supra, 294, as a basis for sustaining the validity of a special act creating a privilege for a particular individual: (1) \u201cwhere at most the remedy, rather than the grounds of the action, was affected\u201d; and (2) \u201cwhere no right of the opposing party was affected.\u201d The first ground we have held not to be applicable to a statutory cause of action, such as a claim against the state, because in such an action \u201cthe very existence of the right in the first instance depends upon the giving of the required statutory notice.\u201d <em>Hillier </em>v. <em>East Hartford, </em>supra, 105. The second ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>also we have held to be inapplicable where the notice is a condition precedent to a statutory cause of action, because the absence of such notice is a defense that constitutes a property right vested in the defendant. Id., 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the special act, which benefits only the estate of the decedent who is named therein, does constitute the award of an exclusive public emolument or privilege not available to other persons and without a public purpose in violation of article first, \u00a7 1. We agree with the trial court that the act is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-12\"> Special Acts 1984, No. 21 provides: \u201can act validating the piling OP THE NOTICE OP THE CLAIM OP THE ESTATE OP ALBERTO OCASIO WITH the claims commissioner ....
