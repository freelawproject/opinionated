On July 15, 1996, he pleaded guilty to indecent assault of a child under 16 in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04. In February 2000, the INS served Chuang with a notice to appear, charging him with removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), due to his conviction for an aggravated felony, as defined in INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-18\">At his hearing before the IJ, Chuang argued that his conviction was not an aggravated felony as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) because it did not involve sexual arousal and therefore did not qualify as \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d He applied for discretionary relief under INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c). The IJ found that Chuang was removable because his conviction for indecent assault was an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). The IJ also found that AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) made aggravated felons ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief from deportation. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s findings without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-19\">Chuang makes two arguments in his petition for review. First, he argues that his conviction for indecent assault does not qualify as \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). Second, he argues that AEDPA\u2019s \u00a7 440(d) bar against INA \u00a7 212(c) relief for deportable criminal aliens, given that excludable aliens are not barred, violates Equal Protection under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"AXf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>We review the BIA\u2019s statutory interpretation of its laws and regulations <em>de novo. Barreto-Claro v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>275 F.3d 1334, 1338 (11th Cir.2001). However, we defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the applicable statute when the interpretation is reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-2\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-3\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-4\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">Where our review is limited by statutory conditions, \u201cwe retain jurisdiction to determine only whether those conditions exist.\u201d <em>Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). We therefore have the power to review whether Chuang has \u201ccommitted a criminal offense covered in section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).\u201d Section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) provides that \u201c[a]ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.\u201d An aggravated felony is defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) to include \u201cmurder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-8\">Chuang was convicted under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 on July 15,1996. The judgment against Chuang listed his crime as \u201cIndecent Assault child under 16.\u201d Section 800.04 proscribes different types of conduct, and it is not clear pursuant to which prong Chuang was charged. At the time of his conviction, \u00a7 800.04 read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-9\">Lewd, lascivious, or indecent assault or act upon or in presence of child</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax-\">A person who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-12\">(1) Handles, fondles, or assaults any child under the age of 16 years in a lewd, lascivious, or indecent manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-13\">(2) Commits actual or simulated sexual intercourse, deviate sexual intercourse, sexual bestiality, masturbation, sadomasochistic abuse, actual lewd exhibition of the genitals, or any act or conduct which simulates that sexual battery is being or will be committed upon any child under the age of 16 years or forces or entices the child to commit any such act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-14\">(3) Commits an act defined as sexual battery under s. 794.011(l)(b) upon any child under the age of 16 years; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-15\">(4) Knowingly commits any lewd or lascivious act in the presence of any child under the age of 16 years,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-16\">without committing the crime of sexual battery, commits a felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. Neither the victim\u2019s lack of chastity nor the victim\u2019s consent is a defense to the crime proscribed by this section. A mother\u2019s breastfeeding of her baby does not under any circumstance violate this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1313-17\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-18\">In <em>United States v. Padilla-Reyes, </em>247 F.3d 1158 (11th Cir.2001), we held in relation to a previous version of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 that \u201ca violation of \u00a7 800.04 is \u2018sexual abuse of a minor\u2019 \u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). <em>Id. </em>at 1164. In reaching that conclusion, we defined \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d as \u201ca perpetrator\u2019s physical or nonphysical misuse or maltreatment of a minor for a purpose associated with sexual gratification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-19\">Chuang argues that in determining whether his conviction qualifies as sexual abuse of a minor, we should evaluate the factual circumstances of his offense instead of the terms of the statute under which he was convicted. He asserts that his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>duct, \u201cindecent pointing\u2014and perhaps touching\u2014of a young boy\u2019s penis,\u201d though it qualified as indecent assault under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04, did not constitute \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d because the facts showed no purpose associated with sexual gratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-2\">Chuang\u2019s argument fails. In determining whether an offender has committed an \u201caggravated felony\u201d pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A), we \u201conly look at the statutory definition of the crime of conviction, not the underlying facts and circumstances of [the offender\u2019s] particular offense.\u201d <em>Ramsey v. I.N.S., 55 </em>F.3d 580, 583 (11th Cir.1995). Thus, in determining whether Chuang was convicted of \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d we do not look to the facts of his offense, but to the conduct proscribed by Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04. We have already held that \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d includes a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04. <em>Padilla-Reyes, </em>247 F.3d at 1164. The only difference between the versions of \u00a7 800.04 under which Padilla-Reyes and Chuang were convicted is the addition to the latter of prong (2), which involves \u201cactual or simulated sexual intercourse, deviate sexual intercourse, sexual bestiality, masturbation, sadomasochistic abuse, actual lewd exhibition of the genitals, or any act or conduct which simulated that sexual battery is being or will be committed upon any child under the age of 16 years.\u201d <em>Compare </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 (1987), <em>with </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 (1996). We do not think that this addition proscribes any conduct that does not involve \u201ca purpose associated with sexual gratification.\u201d <em>Padillar-Reyes, </em>247 F.3d at 1163. Thus, regardless of which prong of \u00a7 800.04 Chuang\u2019s conduct fell under, his conviction was for a crime constituting \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">To evaluate Chuang\u2019s second argument, another round of statutory explanation is in order. Former INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c), provided that an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeds abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who is returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted to the United States at the discretion of the Attorney General without regard to certain specified grounds of exclusion enumerated in INA \u00a7 212(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a). The availability of a \u00a7 212(c) waiver was extended to lawful permanent residents who never left the United States but who are subject to deportation on grounds analogous to the grounds of exclusion specified in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a). <em>See, e.g., Jaramillo v. I.N.S., </em>1 F.3d 1149, 1150-51 (11th Cir.1993) (en banc); <em>Rodriguez-Padron v. I.N.S., </em>13 F.3d 1455, 1460-61 (11th Cir.1994). Thus, \u00a7 212(c) relief was available to both \u201cex-cludable aliens,\u201d who seek to enter the United States to take up residence, and whom the Attorney General otherwise has the power to exclude, and \u201cdeportable aliens,\u201d who are aliens presently residing in the United States, but who are subject to deportation on various grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-6\">The Immigration Act of 1990 amended 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) to exclude from eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief aliens who have been convicted of one or more aggravated felonies and served a term of imprisonment of at least five years. IA \u00a7 511(a), 104 Stat. 5052; <em>Brooks, </em>283 F.3d at 1271 n. 2. In 1996, AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) rendered aliens \u201cconvicted of aggravated felonies, regardless of the length of their sentence, ineligible for discretionary relief from deportation under \u00a7 212(c) of the INA.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>283 F.3d at 1271; AEDPA \u00a7 440(d), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, 1277. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>BIA has interpreted AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) as rendering only deportable aliens, not ex-cludable aliens, ineligible for relief. <em>See In re Fuentes-Campos, </em>Interim Decision (BIA) 3318, 21 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 905, 1997 WL 269368 (BIA May 14,1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-2\">Subsequent to passage of AEDPA, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 was passed. IIRIRA \u00a7 304(b) repealed INA \u00a7 212(c) and replaced it with a more restrictive provision in INA \u00a7 240(a) called \u201ccancellation of removal.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b. \u201cConsistent with AEDPA, \u00a7 304 of IIRIRA provided that cancellation of removal was not available to an alien convicted of any aggravated felony.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>283 F.3d at 1271. Section 321 of IIRIRA expanded the definition of aggravated felony to include \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d and stated that the expanded definition applies regardless of the date of conviction. <em>See Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1250 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-3\">IIRIRA became effective in September 30, 1996, after Chuang\u2019s conviction on July 15, 1996. But, even if at the time of his conviction Chuang was not an \u201caggravated felon\u201d ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief under AEDPA \u00a7 440(d), IIRIRA clearly gave its expansion of the definition of an aggravated felon retroactive effect. <em>Mohammed, </em>261 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-4\">Chuang asserts that AEDPA \u00a7 440(d)\u2019s bar against INA \u00a7 212(c) relief for deportable criminal aliens, and its allowance of \u00a7 212(c) relief for excludable aliens, violates his right to Equal Protection under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">We note first that notwithstanding 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C)\u2019s jurisdictional limitations on our review of a final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense, we retain jurisdiction to review such an order to the extent that a petitioner raises a substantial constitutional issue. <em>Brooks, </em>283 F.3d at 1273. We thus have jurisdiction to consider Chuang\u2019s Fifth Amendment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-9\">\u201cClassifications that distinguish among groups of aliens are subject to rational basis review, and will be found valid if not arbitrary or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1274. Chuang asserts that there is no rational basis for AEDPA \u00a7 440\u2019s allowance <em>of </em>\u00a7 212(c) relief <em>for </em>excludable aliens, when it precludes that relief for deportable aliens. He points out that if he had left the United States and attempted to return, he would, pursuant to BIA decisions such as <em>Fuentes-Campos, </em>be eligible to petition for relief. He argues that there is no rational basis for this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-10\">Chuang\u2019s position has been flatly rejected by seven of the eight Circuits which have decided the issue. <em>See Asad v. Reno, </em>242 F.3d 702, 706-07 (6th Cir.2001); <em>Domond v. I.N.S., </em>244 F.3d 81, 87-88 (2d Cir.2001); <em>Requena-Rodriguez v. Pasquarell, </em>190 F.3d 299, 308-09 (5th Cir.1999); <em>DeSousa v. Reno, </em>190 F.3d 175, 185 (3d Cir.1999); <em>Jurado-Gutierrez v. Greene, </em>190 F.3d 1135, 1152-53 (10th Cir.1999); <em>Almon v. Reno, </em>192 F.3d 28 (1st Cir.1999); <em>LaGuerre v. Reno, </em>164 F.3d 1035, 1041-42 (7th Cir.1998). <em>But see Servin-Espinoza v. Ashcroft, </em>309 F.3d 1193, 1199 (9th Cir.2002). We now make it eight out of nine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-11\">The Seventh Circuit in <em>LaGuerre </em>most eloquently stated the rational basis behind AEDPA \u00a7 440:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-12\">A rational and indeed sensible reason can readily be assigned to Congress\u2019s more lenient treatment of excludable as distinct from deportable aliens: it creates an incentive for deportable aliens to leave the country\u2014which is after all the goal of deportation\u2014without their hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>ing to be ordered to leave at the government\u2019s expense. To induce their voluntary departure, a little carrot is dangled before them, consisting of the opportunity to seek a waiver should they seek to return to the country and by doing so trigger exclusion proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1316-4\">This equal protection issue must not be confused with that in <em>Francis v. INS, </em>532 F.2d 268 (2d Cir.1976), where the government was taking the irrational position that an alien who after coming to the United States had taken a trip abroad and returned and was then ordered deported was entitled to more consideration than one who had never taken a foreign trip after coming to the United States. That is different from the situation of an alien who seeks discretionary relief while he is still outside the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">164 F.3d at 1041.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-6\">Because there is a rational basis behind the different treatment of excludable and deportable aliens, Chuang\u2019s Equal Protection claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
