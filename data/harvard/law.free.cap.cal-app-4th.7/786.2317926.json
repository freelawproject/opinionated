J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiA\">We consider whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board) properly denied workers\u2019 compensation applicant Vicente Belmontez retroactive vocational rehabilitation temporary disability benefits (VRTD) from February 13, 1988, to April 19, 1989, that were ordered by the workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ). As we shall explain, we have concluded that the Board\u2019s determination was erroneous and that the WCJ properly awarded applicant Belmontez the retroactive VRTD. Also before us are the questions of whether the issue of retroactive VRTD is reviewable by this court, whether the employer\u2019s insurer is entitled to an award of sanctions and attorney fees, and, finally, whether applicant is entitled to the costs incurred in litigating this petition for writ of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">The procedural history in this case is lengthy. Applicant, Vicente Belmontez, sustained an admitted industrial injury to his low back on August 12, 1987, during employment as a farm laborer by Ikeda Brothers, which was insured for workers\u2019 compensation by Pan American Underwriters (now Paula Insurance). As a result of the injury, he did not return to work. He has completed vocational retraining as an electronic repairman.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">On September 18, 1987, applicant, represented by counsel, filed an application with the Board seeking workers\u2019 compensation benefits. He alleged that the application was filed because of a disagreement regarding liability for the usual workers\u2019 compensation benefits and entitlement to rehabilitation. The next month Dr. Judith Willis reported that if computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans did not \u201creveal a surgical lesion,\u201d applicant was precluded from heavy lifting and repeated bending and stooping. She stated applicant could not return to his prior work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>as a laborer because the work required repetitive bending and lifting of 90-pound crates of lettuce and cabbage. Both the CT scan and the MRI scan had previously been performed and were normal.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">On December 10, 1987, Dr. Thor Gjerdrum, applicant\u2019s treating physician, concluded applicant was permanently precluded from prolonged sitting, bending, and stooping and should undergo a \u201cwork hardening\u201d program. Later that month Dr. Anthony Trippi reported applicant could return to his usual and customary work. On January 6, 1988, Dr. Gjerdrum reported applicant should be retrained. That same month the employer prepared an analysis of applicant\u2019s job. On February 3, 1988, applicant signed the job analysis. His attorney signed the job analysis on February 8, 1988. The job analysis stated applicant\u2019s job required frequent lifting of boxes weighing from 20 to 85 pounds and frequent bending or stooping.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">On March 7, 1988, Dr. Gjerdrum recommended vocational rehabilitation, explaining it was very unlikely applicant\u2019s condition would substantially improve. Later that month Dr. Norman Kramer opined applicant was permanently restricted to semisedentary work and needed vocational rehabilitation. In April and June 1988, applicant filed declarations of readiness with the Board. He listed permanent disability but not vocational rehabilitation as an issue, and he did not request the rehabilitation bureau to evaluate his eligibility for rehabilitation or to order the defendants, the employer and its insurer, to provide rehabilitation benefits. However, he listed as an issue \u201call benefits of Labor Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">On August 24, 1988, Dr. Hugh Greer, the agreed medical examiner (AME), reported applicant was permanently precluded from heavy lifting and his condition had become permanent and stationary on February 12, 1988. The AME did not state whether applicant needed vocational rehabilitation. The WCJ issued rating instructions based on Dr. Greer\u2019s report. In late December 1988, the WCJ adopted the disability evaluator\u2019s recommendation, finding applicant 22 percent permanently disabled. The WCJ also found medical temporary disability indemnity was payable for the September 20, 1987, through February 12, 1988, period.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">On April 20, 1989, applicant filed with the rehabilitation bureau (Bureau) a request for dispute resolution as to applicant\u2019s medical eligibility for rehabilitation services. The request was dated April 20, 1989. Applicant stated that in March 1989 the defendants had refused to provide these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>services. Defendants requested closure, asserting applicant was not a qualified injured worker (QIW)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or he had refused to cooperate in efforts to evaluate his eligibility for rehabilitation services. On May 17, 1989, applicant filed a case initiation document dated May 9, 1989, with the Bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">On September 5, 1989, the WCJ approved a stipulation that the defendants would pay VRTD from May 9, 1989, through the date of an examination scheduled with the AME and the issue of retroactive VRTD would be remanded to the Bureau. The AME subsequently reported applicant\u2019s condition was unchanged from August 24, 1988. The AME concluded applicant was medically precluded from returning to his job with the employer because the duties exceeded applicant\u2019s work restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Thereafter, the Bureau found applicant was medically eligible for rehabilitation services. The Bureau ordered retroactive VRTD from February 13, 1988, the date after conclusion of medical temporary disability indemnity. Relying on <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co. </em>(1988) 83 SBA 40766, 17 Cal. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rptr. 17, rehabilitation consultant Edgar Breffitt construed the application filed with the Board as the operative request for rehabilitation services, and stated applicant had established a prima facie case of medical eligibility. The insurance company appealed to the WCJ from the Bureau\u2019s decision. The insurance company contended, among other things, that applicant\u2019s first request for rehabilitation was the case initiation document. Since that was dated May 9, 1989, the insurance company claimed not to be responsible for the payment of VRTD from February 13, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">At the hearing on the insurer\u2019s appeal, consultant Breffitt stated he relied on the reports of the AME and Drs. Gjerdrum, Kramer, and Willis and the WCJ\u2019s finding as to the level of permanent disability. Consultant Breffitt testified that the request for dispute resolution was the first rehabilitation request filed with the Bureau. Consultant Breffitt stated that applicant did not need to file an RB-104, a formal request for rehabilitation services.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The WCJ upheld the Bureau, concluding rehabilitation was placed in issue by the application form filed September 18,1987, a prima facie case of QIW status was established before February 12, 1988, and QIW status was confirmed by the AME. The WCJ also found defendants breached their duty to notify applicant of his potential right to rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>The insurer petitioned for reconsideration, contending applicant\u2019s first request for rehabilitation was made on April 20, 1989, when applicant filed the request for dispute resolution with the Bureau. The insurer also contended for the first time that retroactive VRTD should not have been awarded from February 13, 1988, through April 19, 1989, because applicant had waived any right to rehabilitation services by not requesting VRTD or rehabilitation services during that period and had raised the issue of permanent disability at a hearing in November 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">In the report on reconsideration, the WCJ stated the contention concerning waiver was not properly raised in the petition for reconsideration because the insurer had not presented it to him. The WCJ also concluded the contention had no merit. Citing <em>Harklerode </em>v. <em>Young\u2019s Market Co. </em>(1979) 44 Cal.Comp.Cases 561 (in bank), the WCJ noted the Board is not foreclosed from determining the extent of permanent disability when rehabilitation benefits are not being received and neither party objects to a permanent disability determination. (See <em>id., </em>at p. 562.)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Upon reconsideration, in August 1990 the Board agreed with the insurer, finding that applicant was not entitled to retroactive VRTD for the February 13, 1988, through April 19, 1989, period. The Board determined that applicant\u2019s request for rehabilitation was made April 20, 1989, rather than September 18, 1987. The Board stated that an employer has no duty to advise an employee of his or her entitlement to rehabilitation services when that employee is represented by counsel and has filed an application for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Applicant petitioned for reconsideration of the Board\u2019s decision. He contended the application filed with the Board was a request for rehabilitation. Relying on this division\u2019s opinion in <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1 [241 Cal.Rptr. 302], applicant contended he was entitled to retroactive VRTD commencing on the date the AME found applicant\u2019s condition was permanent and stationary.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">On September 24, 1990, the Board denied applicant\u2019s petition for reconsideration. The Board declared: \u201c[C]hecking off a line on the application [for benefits] is not necessarily a \u2018request\u2019 for benefits, but merely an indication that something about rehabilitation either is an issue or a potential issue.\u201d The Board opined that because applicant was represented by counsel and had not requested rehabilitation, the indication in medical reports before April 20, 1989, that applicant might need rehabilitation did not require the insurance company to provide rehabilitation benefits. Noting that applicant had not listed rehabilitation as an issue in his April and June 1988 declarations of readiness, the Board concluded applicant was making no contention \u201cthat he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>missed out on any rehabilitation services designed to return him to work\u201d and applicant had not asserted \u201cthat he wanted or desired rehabilitation services any earlier than the request date in April 1989.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">In <em>Belmontez </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., </em>case No. B053944, applicant sought review in this court. We noted that although applicant had been determined to be medically eligible for vocational rehabilitation, no determination had been made as to his vocational eligibility. We also noted that if applicant was ultimately found not to be a QIW and the Board reasonably found that applicant had not requested rehabilitation in good faith, he might not be entitled to the retroactive VRTD. (See <em>General Foundry Service </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 331, 340, fn. 6 [228 Cal.Rptr. 243, 721 P.2d 124]; <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 633, 640-641 [211 Cal.Rptr. 683].) Therefore, we concluded that the petition for writ of review was premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Consequently, on December 13, 1990, we issued an order that stated: \u201cIt appearing that there has been no order determining whether applicant is both medically and vocationally eligible for vocational rehabilitation, the petition for writ of review is denied without prejudice as premature. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, ch. 4.5, \u00a7\u00a7 10003, subd. (c), 10013; <em>General Foundry Service </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 331, 340, fn. 6; <em>San Diego Transit Corp. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (Renfro) </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 635, 637-638; <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 633, 640-641; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co. </em>(1988) 83 SBA 40766, 17 Cal. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rptr. 17, 18.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Applicant sought review in the California Supreme Court. On January 30, 1991, the California Supreme Court denied review. Applicant then sought a determination from the Bureau that he was \u201cvocationally eligible for rehabilitation.\u201d On March 11,1991, Consultant Breffitt issued an order stating he could not alter the Board\u2019s findings because \u201c[i]t appears as if jurisdiction on this matter currently rests with the D.C.A., per their missive dated 12/13/90.\u201d Applicant appealed to the WCJ. At a hearing before the WCJ on May 15, 1991, Consultant Breffitt testified applicant had completed an approved rehabilitation plan and was a QIW. On May 30, 1991, the WCJ found that applicant was both medically and vocationally eligible for vocational rehabilitation, \u201cas defined by Title 8, California Code of Regulations section 10003(c), subsection (1) and subsection (2).\u201d The WCJ declined to order the retroactive VRTD, however, stating it was \u201cbarred by the doctrine of res judicata.\u201d The WCJ said his finding about vocational eligibility was based on the rehabilitation consultant\u2019s testimony. The WCJ also said he did not have \u201cjurisdiction to relitigate an issue in this case which has already been decided by the Appeals Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>Applicant petitioned for reconsideration, declaring that in <em>Vasquez </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 867 [277 Cal.Rptr. 102], this court had held that filing an application with the Board alleging that the parties have a disagreement regarding liability for rehabilitation constituted a request for rehabilitation. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 872-873.) Applicant asserted that because the AME found he was a QIW, he was entitled to VRTD from the date he became permanent and stationary. Applicant further contended the matter should be reopened because the WCJ found he was a QIW. The WCJ recommended denial of reconsideration, stating the issue of retroactive VRTD had been decided by superior authority. The Board denied reconsideration, stating that it remained of the view \u201cthat VRTDI is only due from the date of request unless defendant breaches its duty to notify the applicant of his rights, and that in this case defendant did not breach its duty.\u201d The Board dismissed the <em>Wood </em>and <em>Vasquez </em>holdings as involving statute of limitations issues rather than retroactivity of VRTD.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">This second petition for writ of review followed. Applicant advises in his petition that \u201c[t]he monetary amount is a significant amount. The applicant was awarded rehabilitation benefits from February 13, 1988 to April 20, 1988 [sz'c]. The applicant\u2019s compensation rate is $174.22 per week or @4.89 per day [sic]. The period from February 13, 1988 to April 20, 1989 is 432 days or $10,752.48.\" He reiterates the argument that the Board was not following applicable law. The insurer now claims in this court that no further review of the Board\u2019s 1990 decision is possible because of \u201cres judicata.\u201d On January 23, 1992, we issued the writ of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Applicant contends that he is entitled to retroactive VRTD for the February 13, 1988, through April 19, 1989, period because he requested rehabilitation in the application he filed with the Board. He also contends he is entitled to retroactive VRTD for the February 13, 1988, through April 19, 1989, period because the employer breached its duty to notify him of his potential right to vocational rehabilitation. Finally, applicant contends the Board failed to consider the reports of several physicians and failed to comply with Labor Code section 5908.5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The insurance company contends that the Board\u2019s September 24, 1990, decision is final and, under Labor Code section 5953, it is not subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>review. The insurance company requests an award of sanctions and attorney fees incurred in opposing the petition for writ of review, asserting there is no reasonable basis for the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">1. <em>Retroactive VRTD</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Because the injury occurred in 1987, our decision is based on the law pertinent to injuries that occurred before 1990. For the purpose of awarding retroactive VRTD benefits to a QIW, the effective request date is the date on which the employee first requested rehabilitation even if the first request is not filed with the rehabilitation unit. It is better practice to request rehabilitation by filing the appropriate form with the rehabilitation unit of the office of benefit determination (formerly rehabilitation bureau). However, an allegation on an application to the Board for workers\u2019 compensation benefits that the parties have a dispute regarding vocational rehabilitation is a request for vocational rehabilitation. <em>(Vasquez </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at pp. 872-873; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., supra, </em>17 Cal. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rptr. 17.) If the request is first raised in an application filed with the Board and there are no good faith issues that would bar the employee\u2019s right to compensation, the WCJ has a duty to refer the question of entitlement to vocational rehabilitation benefits to the rehabilitation unit. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, ch. 4.5, \u00a7 10013, subd. (c) [rule 10013(c)].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">We are aware that in <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 631 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 576], the First District held that the applicant\u2019s request for rehabilitation filed with the Rehabilitation Bureau was an initial request for rehabilitation for purposes of Labor Code section 5405.5<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> although the applicant had previously filed an application with the Board on which he checked a box indicating the parties had a dispute regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>rehabilitation. <em>(Roberts, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.4th at pp. 633, 638.) <em>Roberts </em>is distinguishable from the present case because it did not involve the issue of entitlement to retroactive VRTD.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The Board\u2019s insistence that <em>Wood </em>and <em>Vasquez </em>are not pertinent because they deal with statute of limitations issues is unavailing. The requirement in rule 10013(c) that the WCJ refer the question of entitlement to vocational rehabilitation to the rehabilitation unit when eligibility for rehabilitation was first raised before the WCJ would be meaningless if an applicant could not request rehabilitation before the Board. Although rehabilitation should first be requested by filing the appropriate form with the rehabilitation Unit, the employer\u2019s duty to provide VRTD to a QIW arises when the employee requests rehabilitation benefits or when the employer breaches its duty to notify the employee regarding the employee\u2019s potential right to rehabilitation, whichever occurs first, even if the employee\u2019s request is first made in an application filed with the Board. (See <em>San Diego Transit Corp. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (Renfro) </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 635, 637-638 [170 Cal.Rptr. 40, 620 P.2d 626]; cf. <em>Bland </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 324, 330 [90 Cal.Rptr. 431, 475 P.2d 663] [informality of pleading permissible in workers\u2019 compensation].)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Because the WCJ has determined applicant is both medically and vocationally qualified for vocational rehabilitation benefits and the Board denied reconsideration, applicant is entitled to retroactive VRTD for the February 13, 1988, to April 19, 1989, period. <em>(San Diego Transit Corp. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. (Renfro), supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at pp. 637-638; <em>Vasquez </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at pp. 872-873; see <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d at pp. 6-7; 1 St. Clair, Cal. .Workers\u2019 Compensation Law &amp; Practice (4th ed. 1990) Vocational Rehabilitation, \u00a7 10.5, p. 493.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Inasmuch as we have concluded that applicant is entitled to retroactive VRTD because he requested rehabilitation services when he filed his application, we need not and do not discuss his remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">2. <em>Power to Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">On December 13, 1990, this court issued an order denying relief \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d It was apparent from the language and citations in our order that a factual finding as to whether applicant was a QIW had to be made on the administrative level before applicant would be entitled to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>relief he sought. Our order was not a determination on the merits, and could not reasonably have been interpreted as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The insurer contends here that the Board\u2019s denial of reconsideration in 1990 is final and not presently reviewable by us because the California Supreme Court denied applicant\u2019s petition for review. A copy of our order of December 13, 1990, was attached to the petition for review. Since the Supreme Court was aware that our denial of the prior petition was without prejudice, its denial of review did not render the Board\u2019s decisions res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The insurer contends that Labor Code section 5953 precludes our review. That section is contained in division 4, part 4, chapter 7, article 2 of the Labor Code, which is entitled \u201cJudicial Review.\u201d Section 5953 provides: \u201cThe findings and conclusions of the appeals board on questions of fact are conclusive and final and are not subject to review. Such questions of fact shall include ultimate facts and the findings and conclusions of the appeals board. <em>The appeals board and each party to the action or proceeding before the appeals board shall have the right to appear in the review proceeding. Upon the hearing, the court shall enter judgment either affirming or annulling the order, decision, or award, or the court may remand the case for further proceedings before the appeals board.\" </em>(Italics added.) The section describing judicial review and the power of a reviewing appellate court follows, and is consistent with, Labor Code section 5950, which provides for such review.  Section 5953 does not preclude review by the appellate courts of questions of law, including whether substantial evidence supports a finding of the Board in light of the whole record. <em>(Lamb </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 274, 280-281 [113 Cal.Rptr. 162, 520 P.2d 978].)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">3. <em>Sanctions, Fees and Costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Labor Code section 5801 provides that when <em>\u201cthe injured employee . . . </em>prevails in any petition by the employer for a writ of review from an award of the appeals board and the reviewing court finds that there is no reasonable basis for the petition, it shall remand the cause to the appeals board for the purpose of making a supplemental award awarding to the injured employee or his attorney, ... a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee for services rendered in connection with the petition for writ of review. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The insurer for the <em>employer </em>has asked for attorney fees and sanctions, claiming there was \u201cno reasonable basis\u201d for the present petition for writ of review. \u201cNo reasonable basis\u201d for an employer\u2019s petition is the statutory standard for determining whether an injured employee is entitled to attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>fees incurred in opposing a petition by the employer for a writ of review (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5801). We need not determine whether attorney fees may be awarded to an employer that opposes an injured employee\u2019s frivolous petition for writ of review because here there was a reasonable basis for the present petition for writ of review. We issued a writ of review because the Board has ignored applicable law, including a decision written by this division.
