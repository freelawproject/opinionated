J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">Mayme Abramson appeals from the judgment entered following denial of her petition for a writ of mandate (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5) challenging a resolution of respondent City of West Hollywood Rent Stabilization Commission (Commission),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which denied her application for a rent increase. We find that City calculated Abramson\u2019s gross rental income in an unauthorized manner and therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">Abramson is an elderly widow who owns a nine-unit apartment building in West Hollywood. She resides in one of the units. In 1985, the newly created City of West Hollywood enacted a rent stabilization ordinance (Ordinance), the purpose of which is \u201cto protect tenants from unreasonable and excessive rents . . . and at the same time to ensure a just and reasonable return to landlords.\u201d (West Hollywood Mun. Code, \u00a7 6401.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">Under Ordinance, rent increases are automatically permitted which provide landlords with an amount not to exceed 75 percent of the increase in the consumer price index, and when a rental unit is voluntarily vacated after five years or more. (\u00a7\u00a7 6409-6410.) Upon application, City is required to \u201cpermit rent increases in the MAR [maximum allowable rent] such that the landlord\u2019s net operating income[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] shall be increased by sixty percent (60%) of the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index [CPI], over the base year [of 1983].\u2019\u2019 (\u00a7 6411(C)(1)(h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>In February 1988, Abramson filed rent increase application No. 1-048 (hereafter 1-048), seeking an increase pursuant to section 6411(C). Based on the procedure established by Ordinance and its accompanying regulations, the matter was first heard by a hearing examiner, and then appealed to Commission. On April 12, 1989, Commission partially granted 1-048, permitting an increase in Abramson\u2019s MAR.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">On October 31, 1989, Abramson filed rent increase application No. 1-061 (hereafter 1-061), which is the subject of this appeal. The application papers provided by City included a form requesting the landlord\u2019s rental income for both the base year of 1983 and for the \u201ccurrent year.\u201d Current year was defined as \u201ctwelve consecutive months of [the applicant\u2019s] choosing within the fourteen months immediately preceding the filing.\u201d The instructions required that, in calculating current income, the landlord assume all units \u201cwere occupied by tenants for the entire year\u201d and \u201cestimate a fair market value\u201d of units on which \u201cno rent or partial rent [was being received] due to owner, relative or employee occupancy.\u201d Pursuant to these instructions, Abramson selected November 1, 1988, through October 31, 1989, as her current year, and stated that her income was $57,911.62.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In a decision filed on February 1, 1990, the hearing examiner rejected the current year rental income figure provided by Abramson. The hearing examiner found that, in order to avoid \u201cduplicate increase^ in rent] which would be excessive and thereby would violate the express provisions of [] Ordinance,\u201d it was necessary to calculate the current year\u2019s gross rental income by annualizing the MAR granted in I-048.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, it was determined that an additional $5,725.60 should be included in Abramson\u2019s current year income, and she was therefore not entitled to an increase in her MAR.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Abramson appealed the hearing examiner\u2019s decision to Commission, arguing, inter alia, that the MAR of 1-048 had been annualized without notice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>and that such annualization was contrary to City\u2019s instructions for rent increase applications, which she had scrupulously followed. In a resolution adopted on March 28, 1990, Commission rejected Abramson\u2019s argument, agreeing with the hearing examiner that Abramson\u2019s gross rental income should be calculated by annualizing the MAR increases granted in 1-048. The resolution provided an example of how duplicative rent increases might result from failure to annualize,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and found that annualization was supported by <em>Natter </em>v. <em>Palm Desert Rent Review Com. </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 994 [235 Cal.Rptr. 718].<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">On June 25, 1990, Abramson filed a petition for a writ of mandate challenging City\u2019s resolution in 1-061. The petition was denied at a hearing conducted on April 26, 1991. A judgment denying the petition was filed on May 13, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">\n<em>Introduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Abramson, in propria persona, has raised 11 enumerated contentions challenging the trial court\u2019s denial of her petition for a writ of mandate. Many of her contentions are duplicative; in other situations, a single heading contains more than one legal contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">In the published portion of this opinion, we deal with Abramson\u2019s primary contention\u2014that annualization of her MAR was unauthorized\u2014and with a minor mathematical error, which has been conceded by City. The remaining contentions require only brief discussion, and are addressed in the unpublished portion of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">\n<em>Calculation of Income</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">The main dispute between the parties is whether, pursuant to section 6411, Abramson\u2019s income for the current year of 1-061 should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>calculated with reference to actual rent receipts or by annualizing the MAR granted in 1-048. Because we find no basis in section 6411 or any other provision of City\u2019s rent control scheme to permit annualization, we hold that City erred in its determination of 1-061.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">We start with the language which governs the calculation of gross rental income, section 6411(C)(1)(b).  \u201cPursuant to established principles, our first task in construing a statute [<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. In determining such intent, a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves, giving to the language its usual, ordinary import and according significance, if possible, to every word, phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose. A construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided. The words of the statute must be construed in context, keeping in mind the statutory purpose, and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized, both internally and with each other, to the extent possible. [Citations.] Where uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation. [Citation.] Both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent. [Citations.] A statute should be construed whenever possible so as to preserve its constitutionality. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1386-1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323].)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">\u201cThe contemporaneous construction of a new enactment by the administrative agency charged with its enforcement, although not controlling, is entitled to great weight. [Citations.]\u201d (43 Cal.3d at pp. 1388-1389.) \u201c[T]he final interpretation of a statute is a question of law and rests with the courts. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Department of Water &amp; Power </em>v. <em>Energy Resources Conservation &amp; Development Com. </em>(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 206, 220 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 289].)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">\u201cIncome,\u201d as utilized throughout section 6411(C)(1)(b), is commonly defined as \u201ca gain or recurrent benefit that is usu[ally] measured in money and for a given period of time. . . .\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New Internal. Diet. (3d ed. 1976) p. 1143.) As applied here, such a definition would at least imply the rent actually received during the current year.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Furthermore, the instructions supplied to Abramson by City specifically define \u201ccurrent year\u201d to include any 12 of the preceding 14 months. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>calculating income based on the actual receipts of the 12 months immediately prior to her application, Abramson was doing exactly what the instructions required.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">City advances two reasons why Ordinance should be read to permit an annualized calculation of MAR. Neither reason has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">First, City asserts the language of subdivisions (i) and (iv) of section 6411(C)(1)(b), providing that units be deemed 100 percent occupied and that uncollected rents due to vacancies and bad debts be included as income, \u201cauthorizes [it] to consider income which the landlord <em>will receive </em>in connection with the use or occupancy of the building.\u201d (Italics in original.) While it is true that Ordinance creates a legal fiction with respect to occupancy and uncollected rents, there is no basis to extend this fiction to permit annualization of MAR. Indeed, the doctrine <em>expressio unius est exclusio </em>alterius<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> would appear to preclude such annualization.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Second, City places great reliance on <em>Natter </em>v. <em>Palm Desert Rent Review Com., supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d 994. In <em>Natter, </em>a rent control ordinance required that rent increases be calculated based on the rates charged on April 28, 1983. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 997.) However, guidelines to the ordinance specified that the base year for calculating rents was \u201c \u2018calendar year 1982 or the most \u2022recent fiscal year ending on or prior to April 30, 1983.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 998.) The ordinance in <em>Natter </em>also established a procedure for a hardship rent increase if the base rent \u201c \u2018was disproportionate due to [certain] enumerated factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1002.)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The landlord in <em>Natter </em>sent notice to tenants in November 1982, indicating that their rent would be increased effective February 1983. In a subsequent hardship application, the landlord asserted that his base rate should be calculated by annualizing the rate in effect in April 1983. This position was rejected at the administrative and superior court levels. (190 Cal.App.3d at pp. 999-1001.)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">The appellate court reversed, holding that the drafters of the rent control ordinance had \u201ccontemplated the annualization of rents in a case such as this\u201d because the language of the hardship application guidelines gauged disproportionality by comparing rents charged at different times throughout the year \u201cto the rent from a \u2018base date\u2019 rather than from a \u2018base year.\u2019 Further, owners were permitted to show the rent from a base date was disproportionate and not indicative of actual rent levels through a comparison with rents charged at other times during the year.\u201d (190 Cal.App.3d at p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>1002.) The <em>Natter </em>court also observed that an interpretation permitting annualization would avoid the potential of the rent control ordinance operating in a confiscatory manner. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1003; see also <em>Cotati Alliance for Better Housing </em>v. <em>City of Cotati </em>(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 280, 285 [195 Cal.Rptr. 825].)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">In contrast to <em>Natter, </em>the West Hollywood rent control scheme contains no language which would support annualization. Rather, the landlord is specifically required to calculate gross income based on actual receipts for 12 of the preceding 14 months. Moreover, the constitutional concerns in <em>Natter </em>regarding confiscation of property are not present in this case. Indeed, Abramson notes that she would not have bothered to pay a fee and file 1-061 had she been put on notice that City would calculate her rental income by annualizing the MAR granted in I-048.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">City also relies on the example recited in Commission\u2019s resolution, quoted in footnote 8, <em>ante, </em>to support its argument in favor of annualization. The example merely begs the question. Regulation 60005(A)(4) permits a rent increase application to be filed not less than six months after the final disposition of a prior application. This is exactly what Abramson did. The fact that City\u2019s rent control scheme has unintentionally created the potential for undesirable duplicative rent increases does not provide a valid basis for the introduction of a new procedure which seeks to avoid this undesired effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">We are mindful of the general rule that City\u2019s contemporaneous construction of Ordinance is entitled to great deference. We are also mindful of the policy arguments advanced by City throughout these proceedings regarding the protection of tenants from excessive increases in rent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But no matter how great the deference or how strong the policy, we are unwilling to read a procedure into Ordinance which does not exist. (See <em>Vega </em>v. <em>City of West Hollywood </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1342, 1350 [273 Cal.Rptr. 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that City\u2019s annualization of gross income in 1-061 was not authorized and therefore should not be allowed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>stand. Accordingly, we shall order that 1-061 be recalculated without annualization of the MAR granted in I-048. (See <em>Lindell Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Permit Appeals </em>(1943) 23 Cal.2d 303, 315 [144 P.2d 4].)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><em>Other </em>Issues<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The judgment is reversed. The trial court is directed to issue a writ of mandate compelling City of West Hollywood, City of West Hollywood Rent Stabilization Department, and City of West Hollywood Rent Stabilization Commission to reconsider rent increase application No. 1-061 in a manner consistent with the views expressed in this opinion; i.e., without, annualizing the maximum allowable rent rates granted in rent increase application No. 1-048 and utilizing 18.76 percent as the relevant increase in the consumer price index. Mayme Abramson is to recover her costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Ortega, J., and Vogel, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-11\">Abramson also named City of West Hollywood and City of West Hollywood Rent Stabilization Department as respondents.
