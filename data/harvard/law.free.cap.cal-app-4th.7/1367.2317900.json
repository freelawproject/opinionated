Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 211), he waived jury regarding three \u201cserious felony\u201d conviction allegations (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)). The trial court found each true. Appellant was sentenced to state prison for a total term of twenty years, the upper five-year term for robbery and 3 five-year consecutive terms for the prior felony convictions. Appellant was credited with 177 custody days. On appeal, appellant contends: (1) the trial court erred in denying his suppression motion (\u00a7 1538.5), (2) insufficient evidence supports one felony conviction allegation, (3) and he is entitled to 178, not 177, days\u2019 custody credit. We find the second contention has merit and accordingly we reverse part of the judgment but otherwise affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">There being no insufficiency of evidence claim concerning guilt, the facts may be simply stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">On January 17, 1991, shortly before 2 a.m., appellant and a female companion approached the victim, Melvin Nelson, in an alley near 21st Street and Magnolia in Long Beach. Appellant had an unlit cigarette in his mouth and asked the victim for a light. The two, appellant and the victim, talked for a few minutes and then the victim turned his back to walk away. Appellant \u201cjumped\u201d the victim, placed his arm around the victim\u2019s neck and forced him to the ground. The female ripped the victim\u2019s pocket and took his wallet. When a car approached, appellant and the female fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">The victim called 911 and gave a description of the robbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">A short time later, not far from the robbery, a deputy sheriff, unaware of the robbery, stopped a car for a traffic violation. When he saw the rear passenger, appellant, try to hide a wallet under the front passenger seat, he retrieved the wallet and found Melvin Nelson\u2019s (the victim\u2019s) identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-12\">About an hour later, the victim identified appellant as one of the robbers. He was unable to identify the female driver of the car as the other robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">1. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred in denying his suppression motion?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the victim\u2019s wallet was heard during<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> trial. The hearing consisted of stipulated testimony<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and solely involved the issue of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">The stipulated facts were the following: an officer stopped a vehicle for a traffic violation at about 2 a.m. He asked the driver for identification but she said she had none. He asked the two passengers for identification but they said they had none. The officer saw the rear passenger, appellant, place a wallet under the front passenger seat. The officer recovered the wallet which contained the victiift\u2019s (Melvin Nelson\u2019s) identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">The trial court found appellant lacked standing to claim that seizure of the wallet violated the Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s suppression motion. The trial court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">Appellant was merely a guest-passenger in someone else\u2019s vehicle and made no claim, possessory or otherwise, regarding the wallet, freshly stolen from the victim, or regarding the <em>place </em>from which the wallet was recovered. <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>is apposite: \u201c[Appellant\u2019s] claims must fail. [He] asserted neither a property nor a possessory interest in the automobile, nor an interest in the property seized .... [He] made no showing that [he] had any legitimate expectation of privacy in the . . . area under the seat of the car in which [he was] merely [a] passenger[ ].\u201d <em>(Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1978) 439 U.S. 128, 148 [58 L.Ed.2d 387, 404, 99 S.Ct. 421]. See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salvucci </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 83, 90-91 [65 L.Ed.2d 619, 627, 100 S.Ct. 2547]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Melnyk </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1532 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 570].)</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">2. <em>Appellant contends insufficient evidence supports one felony conviction allegation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">The information alleged appellant had suffered three felony convictions within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a). As to the first and third, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>both robbery convictions, there is no issue on appeal. As to the second, the information alleged that on or about March 26, 1974, appellant had been convicted of \u201cResidential Burglary,\u201d a serious felony within the meaning of section 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Section 667, subdivision (a) provides in pertinent part that \u201cany person convicted of a <em>serious felony </em>who previously has been convicted of a <em>serious felony </em>. . . shall receive, in addition to the sentence imposed by the court for the present offense, a five-year enhancement for each such prior conviction. . . . The terms . . . shall run consecutively.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">Section 667, subdivision (d) states: \u201cAs used in this section \u2018serious felony\u2019 means a serious felony listed in subdivision (c) of section 1192.7.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">Among the \u201cserious felonies\u201d listed in section 1192.7, subdivision (c) is \u201cburglary of an inhabited dwelling house.\u201d (\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(18).)</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">Thus, to sustain the subject felony conviction allegation, the prosecutor had to prove not merely that appellant had been convicted of <em>burglary </em>but that the burglary was <em>\u201cof an inhabited dwelling house.\u201d </em>Absent such proof, the trier of fact was required to find the allegation <em>not true.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">The occasion for such proof arose immediately after the jury\u2019s guilty verdict. Defense counsel told the court \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a court trial on the priors, your Honor.\u201d The prosecutor then advised appellant of his right to have a jury determine the prior felony allegations and counsel then discussed whether the trial should proceed immediately or should be deferred to and be part of the probation and sentence hearing. They decided to have the trial immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">Proof at trial consisted of two pieces of evidence. The prosecutor requested the court \u201cto take as evidence the statements made by the defendant while on the stand concerning the priors.\u201d The trial court made no response to this request and from all reporter\u2019s transcript appearances seems to have ignored it. But even if, despite appearances, the trial court (silently) granted the request, this evidence consisted only of \"appellant\u2019s admission he was \u201cconvicted of two <em>felonies\u201d </em>in 1974. This evidence did not prove the subject allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-11\">The second piece of evidence was People\u2019s exhibit 3, seven pages of certified records from the Department of Corrections. Pertinent is page 5, a judgment of conviction stating that on March 26, 1974, Monte Rene Jackson \u201cpleaded guilty in this court of |&gt;zc] the crime of Burglary, in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>section 459, Penal Code, of the Second Degree, a Felony, as charged in the information.\u201d The referred to information was <em>not </em>part of exhibit 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">No other evidence was offered. The evidence was sufficient to prove appellant was convicted of second degree burglary, a felony. It was utterly insufficient to prove that the burglary appellant was convicted of concerned \u201can inhabited dwelling house\u201d rather than a \u201cshop, warehouse, store, mill, barn, stable, outhouse or other building. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 459.)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">Ordinarily that would end the matter. It being undisputed that insufficient evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding, we would simply reverse that finding. But the Attorney General, despite virtually conceding the <em>trial </em>death of the allegation, argues that, like Lazarus, it can be raised from that death.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">This resuscitative feat, the Attorney General contends, may be accomplished either by appellate judicial notice<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 459, subd. (d), 452, subd. (d)) or appellate factfinding (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 909<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>). The reason, the Attorney General explains, is this: \u201c[T]he issue here is not. . . the truth of the prior allegation, but rather the substantialness of the evidence relating to the nature of the prior, <em>which is a sentencing matter. </em>The probation report, which included hearsay evidence relating to appellant\u2019s admission to his probation officer, was submitted at such hearing and considered by the court. There was therefore evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s implied finding that appellant was previously convicted of burglary of a residence.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">The error of the Attorney General is fundamental. Contrary to his assertion, the issue <em>is </em>\u201cthe truth of the prior allegation.\" Appellant made it the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>issue by his denial. Once denied, its truth had to be determined by <em>trial, </em>either jury or court. (\u00a7 1025.)</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Only if, <em>during trial, </em>substantial evidence of its truth was received and based upon that evidence, the trier of fact then found the prior allegation true, could it then become \u201ca sentencing matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">We decline to judicially notice (Evid. Code, \u00a7 459, subd. (d)) or factually find (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 909) that the subject prior burglary was \u201cof an inhabited dwelling house.\u201d  To do so would do \u201cviolence to the elementary principle that the function of an appellate court, in reviewing a trial court judgment on direct appeal, is limited to matters contained in the record of the trial proceedings.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pena </em>(1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 414, 422-423 [101 Cal.Rptr. 804]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hambarian </em>(1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 643, 662 [107 Cal.Rptr. 878] [\u201cAn appellate court may not on direct appeal from a judgment take judicial notice of or consider matters that were not considered by the trial court. . . .\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pearson </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 218, 221-222, fn. 1 [74 Cal.Rptr. 281, 449 P.2d 217]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Huntsman </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 1073, 1086-1087 [200 Cal.Rptr. 89]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cowan </em>(1940) 38 Cal.App.2d 144, 153 [100 P.2d 1079] [Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 956a, predecessor to \u00a7 909, applies only to civil not criminal cases]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Benford </em>(1959) 53 Cal.2d 1, 6-7 [345 P.2d 928]; <em>Tyrone </em>v. <em>Kelley </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 1, 13 [106 Cal.Rptr. 761, 507 P.2d 65].) Respondent cites no authority for the proposition that an essential element, not proved at trial, may be proved on appeal. <em>People </em>v. <em>Shaw </em>(1965) 237 Cal.App.2d 606 [47 Cal.Rptr. 96] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Bautista </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 344 [85 Cal.Rptr. 688], relied on by respondent, are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">3. <em>Appellant contends he is entitled to 178, not 177, days\u2019 custody credit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">The trial court awarded appellant 118 days\u2019 actual custody credit and 59 days\u2019 local conduct credit for a total of 177 days\u2019 custody credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">Appellant contends, and respondent concedes, he was in local custody 119 not 118 days and accordingly should be credited with 178 total days\u2019 credit. But as respondent notes, and appellant does not thereafter contest, 119 actual custody days entitle appellant to only 58 local conduct days <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 523 [259 Cal.Rptr. 515])., Therefore, although the trial court made two mistakes in calculating appellant\u2019s custody credits, its total of 177 days was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">The trial court\u2019s finding that appellant had been convicted of a serious felony, residential burglary, is reversed. The clerk is directed to modify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>abstract of judgment as follows; in part 3, Enhancements, delete 1 of the 3 \u201c667(A)\u201d listed priors and change the total from 15 years to 10 years; in part 6, Total Term Imposed, change 20 years to 15 years; in part 9, change 118 (actual local time) to 119 and 59 (local conduct credits) to 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">As modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Lillie, P. J., and Johnson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied July 29, 1992, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied September 30, 1992.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b967-13\">Unless otherwise noted all statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b968-11\">After counsel for appellant had filed his opening brief, appellant, in propria persona, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
