(Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 459, 460.) Smith waived jury trial on seven alleged serious prior felony conviction enhancements, each for residential burglary. (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (a), 1192.7, subd. (c)(18).) The trial court found all of them true. The court specifically found that each serious prior felony conviction was \u201cseparately brought and tried.\u201d Smith appeals after the court sentenced him to prison for 41 years, consisting of a 6-year upper term for the new residential burglary conviction and 35 years for the 7 enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Smith appeals, contending the trial court erred in failing to include in its otherwise proper aiding and abetting instructions an instruction specifying the time when the requisite specific intent must have been formed\u2014before or at the time of the entry. Smith also contends that three of the enhancements were not tried separately and thus were improperly imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">About 10:30 a.m. on July 27, 1990, Darko Radovanovic was home in bed with a foot injury at the San Diego home of his parents. Darko heard his bedroom door open and shut, then heard footsteps running down the home\u2019s marble hallway. Within five to ten seconds Darko saw someone run by his bedroom window in the backyard. There was no way out of the backyard in the direction the person was running. Darko saw him run the opposite direction past the bedroom window and noticed he was wearing something blue. Darko went to the front of the house by the garage door and saw the man he identified as Smith running toward the street between the garage and a neighbor\u2019s house. Darko chased Smith down the street, noticing that he was looking back at Darko from a distance of 10 to 15 feet. When Darko \u201cgot a really good visual look at him,\u201d he stopped the chase, returned home and called 911, giving a detailed description of the person.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">A nearby patrolman, Officer Thomas O\u2019Connell, monitored the radio call and soon saw Smith who attempted to flee when the officer began to approach. Officer O\u2019Connell gave chase. With the help of a police helicopter and another officer, Sharon Smyth, O\u2019Connell arrested Smith who was underneath a large dumpster at a construction site. Smyth patted Smith down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>and found a screwdriver tucked into his right sock. Upon further search a watch and jewelry from the Radovanovic house were found in Smith\u2019s pants pockets. Smith gave Smyth a false name, Social Security number and date of birth. Darko was brought to the scene of the arrest, and he identified Smith as the person he had seen running from the backyard and chased. Darko never saw Smith while he was in the house. The police were unable to find any usable fingerprints on or in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Smith contends the court erred in instructing the jury on aiding and abetting by failing to include an instruction on the issue of intent. The instruction in question, CALJIC No. 14.54, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-8\">\u201cIn order for an accused to be guilty of burglary as an aider and abetter, he . . . must have formed the intent to encourage or facilitate the perpetrator prior to or at the time [that person] made the entry into the_with the required specific intent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">Smith relies on three cases holding the jury must be instructed not only with the standard aiding and abetting instruction language of CALJIC Nos. 3.00 and 3.01, as here,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but also with specific language indicating that the aider and abetter\u2019s intent must be formed at or before the time of the entry. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Macedo </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 554, 560 [261 Cal.Rptr. 754]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Forte </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1317, 1323 [251 Cal.Rptr. 855]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brady </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 124, 135 [235 Cal.Rptr. 248].) The Attorney General responds that Smith failed to ask the trial court for this type of instruction; the instructions were complete as given; and under the facts of the case any instructions on aiding and abetting were superfluous, and if there was a defect in them, it made no difference in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">Since the decisions in the cases Smith cites the Supreme Court has clearly pronounced, in the context of the aiding and abetting instruction under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>CALJIC No. 3.00, that error cannot be predicated on the trial court\u2019s failure to give an amplification or explanation on its own motion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cox </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 618, 669<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> [280 Cal.Rptr. 692, 809 P.2d 351].) Thus, there may be merit in the Attorney General\u2019s first point that in light of the other correct instructions given, the absent instruction in question is a matter of clarification and a request is required for such an instruction before a reviewing court may conclude it is error not to give the instruction sua sponte.  However, we ground our decision on the third basis suggested by the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">As Smith recognizes, \u201ca sua sponte duty to instruct will not arise in the absence of evidentiary support.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Forte, supra, </em>204 Cal.App.3d at p. 1323.) In each of the cases on which Smith relies there was evidentiary support for the proposition the defendant was involved merely as an aider and abetter. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Macedo, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.3d 554, 557, 560\u2014 defendant outside in van as codefendant entered the garage of a home, then came out riding a stolen bicycle down the street with defendant following in the van; <em>People </em>v. <em>Forte, supra, </em>204 Cal.App.3d at p. 1320\u2014defendant testified that just before a neighbor yelled for the police another person entered the house and defendant went to the front of the house when the person called to him to help carry out stolen property; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brady, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d at pp. 129-130\u2014a witness testified he, not defendant, entered the apartment, and he told defendant he was going in to retrieve some of his possessions.)</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">In this case there is no evidentiary support for the giving of any of the instructions on aiding and abetting. There is no evidence of involvement by a second person. Nor is there room in these facts for a reasonable inference a second person was involved. Such an inference cannot be drawn due to the rapid succession of the events following discovery of the intruder in the house, including Darko\u2019s seeing Smith in the backyard within five to ten seconds, the essentially continuous chase to the point of arrest and Smith\u2019s possession of the property stolen from the house at the time of arrest. The facts that Darko did not see Smith while he was in the house and that there were no usable fingerprints found in the house do not raise a reasonable inference another person entered the house. At most, the latter conclusion is speculation and conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Under this state of the evidence, there was no basis for instructing on aiding and abetting, including the matter of aiding and abetting in burglary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>under CALJIC No. 14.54. Since there was no need to give these instructions, it was not error to omit the CALJIC No. 14.54 instruction on the timing of the requisite intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Smith contends the court improperly imposed three serious felony prior conviction enhancements under sections 667, subdivision (a), and 1192.7, subdivision (c)(18), for prior convictions that were not tried separately. Section 667, subdivision (a), is part of the 1982 initiative under Proposition 8 known as the Victims\u2019 Bill of Rights. Its purpose is to deter recidivism. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 826, 833 [210 Cal.Rptr. 623, 694 P.2d 736].) Section 667 provides that for defined serious felony prior convictions within which category Smith\u2019s seven prior residential burglary convictions lie (\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(18)), the person having any such serious felony prior convictions \u201cshall receive, in addition to the sentence imposed by the court for the present offense, a five-year enhancement <em>for each such prior conviction on charges brought and tried </em>separately.\u201d (Italics added.) Smith\u2019s contention focuses on three pairs of such serious prior felony convictions which were brought separately under separate case numbers pertaining to separate crimes, but which he asserts were not \u201ctried separately.\u201d The factual basis for his assertion is that, although none of the cases was consolidated, there was a common date for certain criminal proceedings in connection with the charges, including the date of his entry of guilty pleas and the date of sentencing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Smith cites the rule of <em>In re Harris </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 131, 136 [775 P.2d 1057], that \u201cthe requirement in section 667 that the predicate charges must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>have been \u2018brought and tried separately\u2019 demands that the underlying <em>proceedings </em>must have been <em>formally distinct, from filing to adjudication of guilt.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) He also cites the statement in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ebner </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 297, 304 [49 Cal.Rptr. 690, 411 P.2d 578], that the phrase in question \u201csignifies that the two prior felony proceedings must be totally separate, not only during proceedings before trial but also as to those leading to the ultimate adjudication of guilt.\u201d The holding in <em>Ebner </em>was that there is no distinction between an adjudication of guilt based on a plea of guilt and one predicated on a trial on the merits. <em>(Ibid.) </em>There was no question in <em>Ebner </em>about the separateness of the proceedings. The only contention there was that since defendant had pled guilty to the prior offense, he was not in fact \u201ctried\u201d as called for in the statute. The <em>Ebner </em>dictum, however, was quoted without comment in <em>In re Harris, supra, </em>49 Cal. 3d at page 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\"><em>In re Harris, supra, </em>49 Cal. 3d 131, 136, held that charges initially made in a single felony complaint, but later prosecuted under two separate informations, were not \u201cbrought. . . separately.\u201d <em>Harris </em>sets forth the rationale that \u201cbrought\u201d in the context of bringing criminal charges \u201cplainly means to initiate proceedings. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Ebner, supra, </em>64 Cal.2d at p. 304 [construing former \u00a7 644].) This reading is altogether consistent with the general rule that it is the complaint that initiates felony proceedings. (See Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 14; Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 738, 859.)\u201d <em>(Harris, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 137.) Thus, the sole concern of <em>In re Harris </em>was the aspect of the meaning of \u201ccharges brought. . . separately.\u201d The case did not decide what was meant by \u201ctried separately,\u201d although it did state the rule that the underlying proceedings must have been \u201cformally distinct.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 136.)</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 134, 145-147 [267 Cal.Rptr. 908], this court held the proceedings were \u201cformally distinct\u201d and thus \u201cbrought and tried separately\u201d where the defendant in two separately filed cases that were not consolidated pled guilty on the same date and was sentenced later on the same date. Trial by jury had commenced in one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>cases before the matter was continued and defendant pled guilty to both counts. In <em>Thomas </em>we said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-5\">\u201cThe same date for accepting the pleas in these nonconsolid\u00e1ted cases is of no significance for purposes of section 667. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 1288, 1301 [citation], \u2018[t]he \u201cseparately brought and tried\u201d limitation of section 667, subdivision (a) does not bar multiple enhancements where convictions are based on unrelated counts of different accusatory pleadings.\u2019)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 147.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Thus, <em>Thomas </em>placed significance on the facts the prior felony proceedings were processed under separately numbered criminal cases and they were not consolidated. It expressly found that the same timing of the processing of the case for purposes of the entry of the guilty plea was not significant, and it impliedly made the same finding concerning the same timing of the sentencing. Readily apparent considerations of efficiency in judicial administration support these similarities of timing in various proceedings in the cases and furnish a sound basis for concluding that the timing similarities do not cause the proceedings to be other than \u201cformally distinct.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzales </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 134, 140-141 [269 Cal.Rptr. 221].)</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzales, supra, </em>220 Cal.App.3d 134, 140-144, placed emphasis on the fact the cases were not consolidated, either actually or de facto, when it considered the totality of the circumstances surrounding the progress of the defendant\u2019s cases and concluded the charges were tried separately. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 140.) <em>Gonzales </em>involved separately numbered residential burglary charges where the first complaint was filed almost a month before the second burglary occurred. The parties arrived at a plea bargain that was accepted on the same date in the municipal court which \u201cseparately stated the accusations brought by each complaint, and specified each case separately in asking appellant for his plea. Furthermore, the court consistently referred to \u2018these offenses\u2019 during the proceeding.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 139.) <em>Gonzales </em>gives further details of the processing of the prior cases, including frequent verbal and paperwork references to them separately. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Discussing <em>In re Harris, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d 131, <em>People </em>v. <em>Jerez </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 132 [256 Cal.Rptr. 31], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 1288 [237 Cal.Rptr. 64], regarding the concept of de facto consolidation for purposes of applying section 667, <em>Gonzales </em>states (at p. 143):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-8\">\u201cWe reject the notion that calendaring and hearing more than one case per defendant per day results in \u2018de facto\u2019 consolidation. Courts do not determine issues not presented by unrecorded nonrulings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number><em>\u201cHarris </em>teaches that the proceedings giving rise to separate priors must be \u2018formally distinct.\u2019 <em>Jerez </em>explains that cases that \u2018could have been\u2019 consolidated, but which were not, are separate for section 667 purposes. <em>Lewis </em>explains that \u2018[t]he \u201cseparately brought and tried\u201d limitation of section 667, subdivision (a) does not bar multiple enhancements where convictions are based upon unrelated counts of different accusatory pleadings. [Citations.]\u2019 (191 Cal.App.3d at p. 1301.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Here, as in <em>Gonzales, </em>the record shows the verbal and paper-work references to the cases were separate with files for each case and transcripts showing each case was dealt with by its separate number. As in <em>Lewis, supra, </em>the convictions are based on unrelated counts of different accusatory pleadings. As in <em>Thomas, supra, </em>and <em>Jerez, supra, </em>the cases were not consolidated. In addition, under <em>Thomas, supra, </em>it is not significant for purposes of section 667, subdivision (a), that the guilty pleas were taken on the same date. Nor do we find any particular significance for purposes of applying the section in the other transactions that occurred on the same date. Obvious considerations of judicial efficiency called for that type of processing the multiple cases of a single defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">In this connection, Smith relies on a statement in footnote 6 of <em>People </em>v. <em>Deay </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 280, 290 [239 Cal.Rptr. 406]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-6\">\u201cWe note further that, as to both priors, defendant here pled guilty, i.e., was \u2018tried,\u2019 under one case number. This, however, is not dispositive of our conclusion that defendant was not tried separately for his prior convictions. Although we agree that separate case numbers may be evidence that multiple priors were brought separately, we reject any suggestion that, despite the fact the defendant pled guilty to both priors at the same time they may be deemed to have been tried separately simply because of the fortuity of their bearing different case numbers. In our view, and consistent with its purpose, <em>section 667 contemplates temporal rather than administrative separateness. </em>The random assignment of case numbers is not only inconclusive of a defendant\u2019s having been tried separately within the meaning of section 667; to measure separateness in this manner also opens a door to prosecutorial abuse of the process.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Since <em>Deay </em>involved two <em>counts </em>of a <em>single </em>felony complaint to which defendant entered a guilty plea in one proceeding on the same date, it is factually dissimilar to Smith\u2019s case where separate accusatory pleadings were adjudicated. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d 134, 147.) Contrary to the above underscored statement in <em>Deay, </em>in light of the \u201cformally distinct\u201d test set forth by the Supreme Court in the more recent <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number><em>Harris </em>case, we are of the view that separately filed cases involving separate crimes can be adjudicated on the same date under their separate case numbers and still be considered to have been both \u201cbrought and tried separately\u201d within the meaning of section 667. This construction of the statute and <em>In re </em>Harris, rather than <em>Deay\u2019s </em>construction, advances the purpose of the statute to deter recidivism. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d 826, 833, \u201cThe basic purpose of the section\u2014the deterrence of recidivism\u2014would be frustrated by a construction which did not take account of prior criminal conduct.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">We conclude in each of the three pairs of serious prior felony conviction cases Smith challenges that the proceedings were \u201cformally distinct\u201d within the meaning of <em>In re Harris, supra. </em>The five-year enhancement for each was properly imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">Wiener, Acting P.

Smith entered guilty pleas in both cases in superior court on the same date after the same trial date had been set for both, and they were trailed for trial.

CR 56652 involved charges of two counts of residential burglary and two counts of grand theft committed in October 1981. Smith entered guilty pleas to the three burglary charges in both cases in municipal court on the same date after he and the prosecutor had used a single plea bargain form to memorialize the terms of the bargain in each case. Smith was sentenced to prison in both cases on the same date in January 1982. In CR 56652 he received a principal two-year term and a consecutive eight-month term.

In CR 65790 Smith pled guilty to residential burglary and admitted one serious felony prior that was alleged. Each plea was contingent on entry of a plea in the other case. The pleas were entered after a readiness conference for both cases had been set for the same date and the trial date set for CR 65452 had been vacated.
