(Diceon), a company which manufactures printed circuit boards, two of the company\u2019s managers, and its president, respondent Roland G. Matthews, were charged in a twelve-count information which alleged the illegal disposal of hazardous waste (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25189.5, subd. (b); nine counts, one felony and one misdemeanor count involving Matthews among others) and the illegal storage of hazardous waste (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25190; three counts, all three misdemeanor counts involving Matthews among others.) Pursuant to a negotiated disposition and prior to a preliminary hearing, Diceon pled nolo contendere to three felony counts of the illegal disposal of hazardous waste, and two company managers (Richard Thomas and Peter Jonas) pled nolo contendere to one misdemeanor count of illegal disposal of hazardous waste.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Also as a part of the negotiated disposition, the charges against Matthews were dismissed on the People\u2019s motion and pursuant to Penal Code section 1385. Subsequently, the trial court granted Matthews\u2019s motion to seal and destroy his booking and arrest records. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 851.8, subd. (b).) The People appeal from the order sealing and destroying the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">I. <em>Procedural and Substantive Standards for Sealing and Destroying Arrest Records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Penal Code section 851.8 sets forth the guidelines for sealing and destroying the arrest records of a person who is factually innocent. Where, as here, a person has been arrested and an accusatory pleading filed but no conviction has occurred, the defendant may \u201cpetition the court which dismissed the action for <em>a finding that the defendant is factually innocent of the charges for which the arrest was made.\u201d </em>(Pen. Code, \u00a7 851.8, subd. (c), italics added.) \u201cA finding of factual innocence and an order for the sealing and destruction of records . . . <em>shall not be made unless the court finds that no reasonable cause exists to believe that the arrestee committed the offense for which the arrest was made. </em>In any court hearing to determine the factual innocence of a party, the initial burden of proof shall rest with the petitioner to show that no reasonable cause exists to believe that the arrestee committed the offense for which the arrest was made. If the court finds that this showing of no reasonable cause has been made by the petitioner, then the burden of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>shall shift to the respondent to show that a reasonable cause exists to believe that the petitioner committed the offense for which the arrest was made.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 851.8, subd. (b), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">\u201c[Penal Code] section 851.8 is for the benefit of those defendants who have not committed a crime. It permits those petitioners who can show that the state should never have subjected them to the compulsion of the criminal law\u2014because no objective factors justified official action\u2014to purge the official records of any reference to such action. \u2018The Legislature thus recognized that the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt often results that defendants, who are not factually innocent, are acquitted.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scott M. </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 688, 699-700 [213 Cal.Rptr. 456].) For example, a failure of the prosecution to meet its burden of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt could be due to the suppression of illegally obtained evidence. Penal Code section 851.8, subdivision (b), specifically permits the court to receive all relevant evidence on the subject of factual innocence, notwithstanding Penal Code sections 1538.5 and 1539 (relating to the suppression of evidence for the purpose of trial). (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Glimps </em>(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 315, 322 [155 Cal.Rptr. 230].) Similarly, a dismissal in the interests of justice (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1385), as Matthews obtained in the present case, does not necessarily imply factual innocence, but rather may reflect the result of a negotiated or pragmatic disposition of the case. (92 Cal.App.3d at pp. 323-324.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">In determining at a court hearing whether factual innocence exists, the arrestee bears the preliminary burden of establishing that \u201cno reasonable cause exists to believe that [he] committed the offense.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 851.8, subd. (b).) The arrestee thus must establish that facts exist which would lead no person of ordinary care and prudence to believe or conscientiously entertain any honest and strong suspicion that the person arrested is guilty of the crimes charged. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scott M., supra, </em>167 Cal.App.3d at p. 699.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Establishing factual innocence, within the meaning of Penal Code section 851.8, entails establishing as a prima facie matter not necessarily just that the arrestee had a viable substantive defense to the crime charged, but more fundamentally that there was no reasonable cause to arrest him in the first place. For example, a legal defense which is unrelated to the conduct of the arrestee and his innocence, such as entrapment, may be available \u201cnot because the defendant is innocent but because it is a lesser evil that some criminals should escape than that the government should play an ignoble part. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pogre </em>(1986) 188 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 7 [234 Cal.Rptr. 590].) On the other hand, other legal defenses may be so related to the defendant\u2019s own conduct that the existence of the defense negates a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>requisite element of the offense or otherwise eliminates culpability, thereby revealing no reasonable cause to believe the arrestee committed an offense and establishing factual innocence, within the meaning of Penal Code section 851.8. Accordingly, we do not accept the People\u2019s simplistic position, that proof of a defense to the crime charged cannot establish factual innocence. Rather, it depends upon the nature of the defense whether a defense to the crime charged establishes factual innocence, for the purposes of Penal Code section 851.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">II. <em>Matthews\u2019s Defense of Lack of Personal Involvement in Criminal Violations and His Alleged Attenuated Corporate Responsibilities for the Offending Conduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">A. <em>Nature of the Offenses Charged</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">\u201cLawmakers have wide latitude to declare an offense and to exclude, or include, elements of knowledge and diligence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 699, 714 [259 Cal.Rptr. 770, 86 A.L.R.4th 383].) In counts VIII and IX, Matthews was charged with one felony and one misdemeanor violation of Health and Safety Code section 25189.5, which alleged the improper disposal of hazardous waste.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   \u201c[Health and Safety Code section] 25189.5 includes knowledge or negligence as an element of the crime, and so is not a strict liability offense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, </em>at p. 713.) However, counts X, XI and XII alleged violations of Health and Safety Code section 25190 by improperly storing and labeling and permitting the leaking of hazardous waste containers, and required no finding of knowledge or negligence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">We find that violations of Health and Safety Code section 25190 constitute strict liability offenses or \u201cso-called \u2018public welfare\u2019 or <em>\u2018malum </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>prohibitum\u2019 crimes which are punishable despite the absence of any criminal intent or criminal negligence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Calban </em>(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 578, 584 [135 Cal.Rptr. 441].) \u201cThese public welfare crimes are most often based upon the violation of statutes purely regulatory in nature and involving widespread injury to the public. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chevron Chemical Co. </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 50, 53-54 [191 Cal.Rptr. 537].) Indeed, the offenses were enacted by the Legislature as part of the Hazardous Waste Control Act \u201cto protect the public health and the environment and to conserve natural resources\" (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25101, subd. (a)) in light of \u201c[l]ong-term threats to public health and to air and water quality [from the] disposal of many types of untreated hazardous wastes and by the inappropriate handling, storage, use, and disposal of hazardous wastes.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25100, subd. (b); see <em>People </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, </em>211 Cal.App.3d 699, 713.) Also indicative of a strict liability offense, section 25190 involves relatively \u201clight penalties and no moral obloquy or damage to reputation.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vogel </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 798, 801, fn. 2 [299 P.2d 850]; <em>see Morissette </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1952) 342 U.S. 246, 256 [96 L.Ed. 288, 296-297, 72 S.Ct. 240].)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">B. <em>Defense to the Offenses Charged</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Matthews\u2019s effort to establish that \u201cno reasonable cause exists to believe that [he] committed the offense for which the arrest was made\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 851.8, subd. (b)) focuses on different but somewhat related defenses to each of the two different types of offenses charged. As to the violations pertaining to the disposal of hazardous waste (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25189.5, counts VIII and IX), Matthews urged the trial court to consider the question of his duty, the reasonableness of his reliance on other corporate executives (such as Jonas) and his response to information imparted to him by his subordinates.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Indeed, counsel and the trial court focused on the disposal of hazardous waste violations which occurred between January 19 and April 7 of 1989 (counts VIII and IX), and the court observed that \u201cwe have to have some kind of negligence.\u201d As previously noted, \u201c[Health and Safety Code] section 25189.5 includes knowledge or negligence as an element of the crime, and so is not a strict liability offense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, </em>211 Cal.App.3d at p. 713.) The court ultimately ruled that Matthews \u201cwas not negligent because of the efforts he testified [to] with respect to . . . trying to alleviate this condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">However, counsel and the trial court apparently failed to focus on the strict liability nature of the labeling and storage violations which occurred on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>January 19, 1989 (counts X, XI, and XII), offenses for which no showing of negligent conduct is required.  Matthews\u2019s defense to the strict liability labeling and storage violations of Health and Safety Code section 25190 was based on his purported lack of direct corporate power and authority regarding the hazardous waste violations, despite his position as president of the company and co-owner.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Matthews thus contends on appeal that there is an insufficient factual predicate for his criminal liability because evidence at the hearing on his motion established \u201cthat he was only rarely present at the Chatsworth facility [where the hazardous waste violations occurred], that he was unaware of any environmental problems at the Chatsworth facility prior to the [execution of a] search warrant, that he was four managerial levels removed from direct responsibility for environmental conditions at the Chatsworth facility, and that he had no technical training or expertise, particularly in the environmental compliance area.\u201d In essence, Matthews claims that he was located in the headquarters in Irvine and was so far up the corporate ladder of a $120 million company with five facilities throughout the country and so far isolated from daily operations and environmental oversight, regarding the environmental compliance activities at the Chatsworth facility, that he was \u201coutside of the scope of even strict liability\u201d for his company\u2019s hazardous waste violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Matthews asserts his factual innocence based on an analysis of the principles of strict criminal liability in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Park </em>(1975) 421 U.S. 658 [44 L.Ed.2d 489, 95 S.Ct. 1903] and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dotterweich </em>(1943) 320 U.S. 277 [88 L.Ed. 48, 64 S.Ct. 134], <em>Park </em>and <em>Dotterweich </em>involved the criminal liability of corporate executives for strict liability offenses committed by their corporation. In <em>Dotterweich, </em>the court explained that criminal liability may be assessed against \u201call who . . . have such a responsible share in the furtherance of the transaction\u201d (320 U.S. at p. 284 [88 L.Ed. at p. 53]) which is the basis of the offense, but declined to \u201cattempt a formula embracing the variety of conduct whereby persons may responsibly contribute in furthering a transaction forbidden by [legislation].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 285 [88 L.Ed. at pp 53-54].)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">In <em>Park, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the theoretical basis for criminal culpability of the corporate president of a national retail food chain with 36,000 employees, 874 retail outlets and 16 warehouses. Park\u2019s office was at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>the corporate headquarters in Pennsylvania and the various violations of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act involving exposure of food to rodent contamination occurred at a warehouse in Maryland. <em>(Park, supra, </em>421 U.S. at p. 660 [44 L.Ed.2d 494].) The court found that the jury was properly instructed that Park could be found guilty if he \u201c \u2018had a position of authority and responsibility in the situation out of which these charges arose.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 665, fn. 9 [44 L.Ed.2d at pp. 496-497].) Chief Justice Burger\u2019s majority opinion rejected the position of the Court of Appeal <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Park </em>(4th Cir. 1974) 499 F.2d 839, revd. (1975) 421 U.S. 658 [44 L.Ed.2d 489, 95 S.Ct. 1903]) that criminal liability could only be premised on the presence of some wrongful action by Park.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The Supreme Court explained as follows: \u201cThe duty imposed by Congress on responsible corporate agents is . . . one that requires the highest standard of foresight and vigilance, but the Act, in its criminal aspect, does not require that which is objectively impossible. The theory upon which responsible corporate agents are held criminally accountable for \u2018causing\u2019 violations of the Act permits a claim that a defendant was \u2018powerless\u2019 to prevent or correct the violation to \u2018be raised defensively at a trial on the merits.\u2019. . . [T]he Government\u2019s ultimate burden [is to prove] beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant\u2019s guilt, including his power, in light of the duty imposed by the Act, to prevent or correct the prohibited condition. . . . [|] . . . The concept of a \u2018reasonable relationship\u2019 to . . . violation of the Act indeed imports some measure of blameworthiness .... [T]he Government establishes a prima facie case when it introduces evidence sufficient to warrant a finding . . . that the defendant had, by reason of his position in the corporation, responsibility and authority either to prevent in the first instance, or promptly to correct, the violation complained of, and that he failed to do so. . . . The considerations which prompted the imposition of this duty, and the scope of the duty, provide the measure of culpability.\u201d (421 U.S. at pp. 673-674 [44 L.Ed.2d at pp. 501-502].)</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Matthews\u2019s request to seal and destroy his arrest records as to counts X, XI and XII is premised on his claims (1) that he had no personal involvement in the criminal violations, and (2) that, in essence, his corporate responsibility for the hazardous waste labeling and storage violations was too attenuated because he had extremely limited contact with the Chatsworth facility (only visited the business office there once a month). However, he fails to allege any facts which would establish, and does not now claim on appeal, that he was actually \u201c \u2018powerless\u2019 \u201d to prevent or correct the violation <em>(Park, supra, </em>421 U.S. at p. 673 [44 L.Ed.2d at p. 501]) and that he somehow lacked sufficient \u201cauthority with respect to the conditions that formed the basis of the alleged violations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 674 [44 L.Ed.2d at p. 502].)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>Indeed, it appears that Matthews had a position in the corporate structure that would have enabled him to have avoided or addressed the situation which led to the violation. Although Matthews claimed in the declaration in support of his motion that he had only \u201cnominal responsibility\u201d and \u201cno personal supervision or oversight of environmental compliance matters at the Chatsworth facility,\u201d he admitted that his responsibility encompassed \u201call aspects of the company\u2019s operations and [was] over all of the company\u2019s facilities.\u201d While repeatedly characterizing his responsibility as \u201cnominal,\u201d Matthews conceded that his \u201coversight\u201d responsibilities would logically extend to include \u201cresponsibility for the company\u2019s compliance with all federal, state, and municipal law.\u201d According to Matthews, the Chatsworth employees responsible for implementing environmental controls reported to a local supervisor, who reported to codefendant Richard Thomas (director of operations at Chatsworth), who reported to codefendant Peter Jonas (executive vice-president and chief financial officer), who in turn reported to Matthews. A separate environmental officer, Laurey Cook, also had responsibility for environmental compliance at the Chatsworth facility. Cook reported to the director of manufacturing at the Irvine facility, who reported to Jonas, who in turn reported to Matthews.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">At the hearing on Matthews\u2019s motion to seal and destroy his arrest records, it became even more apparent that his corporate responsibility and authority were not merely nominal. Matthews was one of the company\u2019s owners and the highest ranking corporate officer in charge of Diceon at the time of the violations. Matthews had the power with other executives to hire and fire employees, to expend corporate funds to institute corrective measures, and even \u201cpersonally had the authority to shut the company down.\u201d Matthews was also eventually in daily communication with Jonas, who became responsible for bringing the plant into compliance with environmental requirements. Diceon had been cited for hazardous waste violations twice before the execution of the search warrant on January 19, 1989. After execution of the search warrant and Matthews\u2019s discovery of some of the violations charged in the information, Matthews met with Jonas and other executives \u201cto set a plan in action.\u201d The plan included installing new equipment, hiring an environmental consulting firm, requiring Cook to spend more time at the Chatsworth facility, having Jonas keep Matthews updated on a daily basis, and having the plant shut down numerous times to correct problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">On appeal, Matthews concedes, as he must, that \u201cit is clear that he wields considerable responsibility and authority over the affairs of all of Diceon\u2019s [facilities].\u201d Matthews\u2019s corporate responsibility and authority were more than nominal. His responsibility and authority were real, and he exercised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>them commendably and effectively, albeit after January 19, 1989. Matthews is thus not a mere figurehead of the company, but is a responsible owner with \u201cnot only a positive duty to seek out and remedy violations when they occur but also ... a duty to implement measures that will insure that violations will not occur.\u201d <em>(Park, supra, </em>421 U.S. at p. 672 [44 L.Ed.2d at pp. 500-501].)</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Such an affirmative duty is properly placed on corporate officers by strict liability statutes regulating the public welfare. \u201c[I]n the interest of the larger good it puts the burden of acting at hazard upon a person otherwise innocent but standing in responsible relation to a public danger. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Dotterweich, supra, </em>320 U.S. at p. 281 [88 L.Ed. at pp. 51-52].)  Matthews\u2019s height on the corporate ladder does not therefore insulate him from strict liability statutes. It is of no consequence that it may have been objectively impossible for Matthews personally to control fully the daily activities at each of several manufacturing facilities. As the Supreme Court observed in <em>Park, </em>which involved the liability of a defendant in a corporation apparently at least as large or larger than Diceon, \u201cAssuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that it would be objectively impossible for a senior corporate agent to control fully day-to-day conditions in 874 retail outlets, it does not follow that such a corporate agent could not prevent or remedy promptly violations of elementary sanitary conditions in 16 regional warehouses.\u201d <em>(Park, supra, </em>421 U.S. 658, 677, fn. 19 [44 L.Ed.2d at p. 504].) It is therefore appropriate as a practical matter and consistent with <em>Dotterweich </em>and <em>Park </em>to prosecute a person at the highest levels of a corporation as the best way to insure the adoption of corporate policies and practices which will avoid violations of strict liability public welfare and regulatory offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">In our view, persons holding significant shares of corporate responsibility and power are subject to prosecution and conviction for strict liability crimes unless they have exercised their responsibilities and power so as to have undertaken all objectively possible means to discover, prevent and remedy any and all violations of such laws.  No evidence presented at the hearing below showed that Matthews had undertaken all objectively possible means to discover, prevent or remedy the criminal violations discovered pursuant to a search warrant on January 19, 1989. He was, therefore, properly subject to arrest, prosecution and conviction for these strict liability crimes. Hence, the trial court should have denied Matthews\u2019s motion to seal the records of his arrest and prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">As to the strict liability offenses charging violations of Health and Safety Code section 25190 (counts X, XI and XII), Matthews failed to satisfy his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>initial burden to show that \u201cno reasonable cause exists to believe that [he] committed the offense for which the arrest was made.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 851.8, subd. (b).) The evidence presented at the hearing on Matthews\u2019s motion to seal indicated that he had the power to engage all objectively possible means to discover, prevent and remedy the conditions upon which the violations of law here were based. The evidence also indicated Matthews did not utilize this power fully and, as a result, failed to discover, prevent or remedy these conditions. Since Matthews was not powerless to prevent or remedy promptly these violations, sealing of his arrest records is not authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Because we find Matthews\u2019s defense unavailing in his effort to seal and destroy his arrest records for the strict liability offenses, we need not address his defense of the absence of negligence to the other offenses for which he was arrested relating to the unlawful disposal of hazardous waste, in violation of Health and Safety Code section 25189.5, subdivision (b) (counts VIII and IX). Even if Penal Code section 851.8 provided, which it does not, for the surgical excision of only certain portions of an arrest record, Matthews has not requested such a partial sealing and destruction of his arrest records. We would defeat the statutory purpose of leaving a factually innocent person with an unblemished record and run afoul of the legislative objective sought to be achieved were we to permit the sealing and destruction of only part of an accused\u2019s arrest record. (See <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 149, 156 [118 Cal.Rptr. 14, 529 P.2d 46].) We are also constrained by the principle that penal statutes must be strictly construed to guard against judicial usurpation of the legislative function. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Overstreet </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 891, 896 [231 Cal.Rptr. 213, 726 P.2d 1288].)
