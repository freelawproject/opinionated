The agency contends the court\u2019s ruling is erroneous on several grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">We find the property owners waived any objection to the adequacy of the written statement provided by the agency, and we reverse the judgment dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-11\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">The property to be acquired is part of a larger parcel located in the City of Pleasant Hill and owned by Richard L. Cole and Edythe P. Cole. On October <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>4, 1990, the Department of Transportation (the Department) offered the Coles $711,000 for the property. Six hundred forty-four thousand dollars of this sum represented the market value of the property, which included the value of one building located on the property and the value of a portion of a second building that was partially on the property. The remaining $67,000 represented the Department\u2019s estimate of rehabilitating the second building for future use after its partial demolition. The Department provided the Coles with a written \u201cAppraisal Summary Statement\u201d which set out these figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">Mr. Cole did not believe the offer was adequate, particularly the $67,000 to rehabilitate the building to be partially demolished. He retained a structural engineer and began the process of applying for building permits with the City of Pleasant Hill. Cole discovered that in order for rehabilitation to be feasible, a larger portion of the building would have to be demolished than contemplated by the Department. He informed the Department of his findings and asked the Department to evaluate the possibility of acquiring the entire building. The Department asked Cole to obtain two or three bids on the project to rehabilitate the building in the manner required by the Pleasant Hill Building Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">On December 7, the Department mailed to Mr. Cole notice of its intent to obtain a resolution of necessity to acquire the property. The Coles did not appear at the hearing on the matter before the California Transportation Commission (the Commission), and they offered no opposition to the resolution. The resolution was adopted by the Commission on January 23, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">On March 15, Mr. Cole provided the Department with an estimate of $153,405 as the cost to rehabilitate the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">The Department filed its complaint in eminent domain on April 11, but shortly thereafter the Department offered the Coles $953,500 for the property, an offer which anticipated complete acquisition of the disputed building. The Coles did not accept the offer, and the eminent domain proceedings continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">The Coles filed a demurrer and an answer to the complaint, and then moved for summary judgment asserting, inter alia, that the appraisal summary statement was inadequate, thus rendering the eminent domain proceedings invalid. The parties stipulated that for purposes of the motion for summary judgment, the court could consider the original complaint as superseded by a first amended complaint. The court granted the motion, finding the appraisal statement did not comply with statutory requirements. The court awarded the Coles their litigation expenses (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1268.610) and entered judgment in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The Department contends the Coles waived any objection to the adequacy of the written appraisal statement by failing to object during the administrative proceedings before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Before initiating eminent domain proceedings, the governing body of the public entity must adopt a resolution of necessity. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1245.220.) Before adopting a resolution of necessity, the public entity must establish an amount it believes to be just compensation for the property and make an offer to the owner for that amount. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7267.2, subd. (a).) The offer must be accompanied by a written statement of the basis for the amount established as just compensation. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see <em>City of San Jose </em>v. <em>Great Oaks Water Co. </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1005, 1011-1013 [237 Cal.Rptr. 845].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The resolution of necessity must contain a declaration \u201c[t]hat either the offer required by Section 7267.2 of the Government Code has been made to the owner or owners of record, or the offer has not been made because the owner cannot be located with reasonable diligence.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1245.230, subd. (c)(4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">The property owner is entitled to appear before the governing body of the public entity and to be heard on (1) whether the public interest and necessity require the project, (2) whether the project is planned or located in the manner most compatible with the greatest public good and least private injury, and (3) whether the property sought to be acquired is necessary for the project. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1245.235, subd. (a), 1240.030.) This right to be heard may be waived by the failure to file a written request to appear and be heard. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1245.235, subd. (b)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">In the instant case, the Commission sent Mr. Cole notice of its intent to adopt a resolution of necessity and his right to appear at a hearing on the matter. The notice informed Cole of his right to object to the adoption of the resolution and, more specifically, his right to object to whether the conditions stated in Code of Civil Procedure section 1240.030 had been met, and whether \u201c[t]he offer required by Section 7267.2 of the Government Code has been made to the owner of record.\u201d Both the notice and an accompanying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>cover letter stated that the amount of compensation to be paid would not be an issue at the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">The Coles did not appear at the hearing or otherwise object to the adoption of the resolution or to the adequacy of the appraisal statement provided by the Department and required by Government Code section 7267.2. (Compare <em>City of San Jose </em>v. <em>Great Oaks Water Co., supra, </em>192 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1009-1010 [property owner\u2019s attorney appeared at city council meeting and argued written appraisal statement did not comply with Gov. Code, \u00a7 7267.2].)</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">The Coles assert they had no right to be heard on the adequacy of the appraisal statement, but their assertion is contradicted by the notice they received from the Commission which provided that they could dispute whether the offer required by Government Code section 7267.2 had been made. An integral part of the offer is the written appraisal statement, which is a mandatory requirement. <em>(City of San Jose </em>v. <em>Great Oaks Water Co., supra, </em>192 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1011-1013.)</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">While Code of Civil Procedure section 1245.235, subdivision (a) provides that the governing board of the public entity need only give the property owner the opportunity to be heard on the three matters referred to in section 1240.030, the governing body must resolve not only those three matters, but also whether the offer required by Government Code section 7267.2 has been made. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1245.230, subd. (c).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is no prohibition against the property owner being heard on the latter issue, and here, the Commission notified Mr. Cole that it would hear him on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">The Coles further argue that they were dissuaded from challenging the adequacy of the appraisal statement by the fact that the notice of the Commission hearing and the accompanying cover letter stated they could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>raise the issue of the amount of compensation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The issue of compensation is distinct from the question of whether the Department complied with Government Code section 7267.2, and that distinction is apparent from the notice of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">The adequacy of the appraisal statement should have been raised at the administrative hearing, and under these circumstances we conclude the Coles waived their right to judicial review of the statement. (See <em>Bleeck </em>v. <em>State Board of Optometry </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 415, 432 [95 Cal.Rptr. 860] [\u201cBefore seeking judicial review a party must show that he has made a full presentation to the administrative agency upon all issues of the case and at all prescribed stages of the administrative proceedings.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The purpose of Government Code section 7267.2 is to facilitate the acquisition of private property for public use without resorting to litigation. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 7267.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the Coles thought the appraisal statement provided by the Department inadequate, they should have raised the issue before the Commission to solicit correction at that time and possibly avoid court proceedings. The Coles\u2019 late objection serves no purpose other than to delay the eminent domain proceedings. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">The judgment dismissing the action and awarding the Coles their litigation expenses is reversed. The Coles, however, are entitled to recover their costs on appeal pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1268.720.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Newsom, J., concurred. Strankman, P. J., concurred in the result only.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 4, 1992, and respondents\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied October 1, 1992. Kennard, J., Arabian, J., and Baxter, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-8\">Government Code section 7267.2, subdivision (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cPrior to adopting a resolution of necessity pursuant to [Code of Civil Procedure] Section 1245.230 and initiating negotiations for the acquisition of real property, the public entity shall establish an amount which it believes to be just compensation therefor, and shall make an offer to the owner or owners of record to acquire the property for the full amount so established, unless the owner cannot be located with reasonable diligence. . . .
