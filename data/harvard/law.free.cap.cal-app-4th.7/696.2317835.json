J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEG\">Defendant seeks review of his case in this court, by way of this court\u2019s order transferring this case to it from the appellate department of the superior court (appellate department) upon certification of the appellate department. Defendant was convicted in the municipal court of one count of driving a vehicle while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subd. (a)) and one count of driving a vehicle while having a blood-alcohol level of 0.10 percent or greater (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subd. (b), as worded at the time of the offense), which convictions were attended by the municipal court\u2019s finding that defendant had suffered a prior conviction under section 23152 of the Vehicle Code (the prior).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Notwithstanding defendant\u2019s attempts to secure our review of the entirety of the municipal court proceedings, we shall conclude that only one, limited issue\u2014whether or not the appellate department committed error in remanding to the municipal court for retrial the question of whether defendant was convicted of the alleged prior\u2014is before us for hearing and decision.With respect to that one issue, we shall conclude that the appellate department did err.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Following a jury trial in the municipal court, defendant was convicted of the aforementioned \u201cdriving under the influence\u201d offenses and the trial court found true the alleged prior. Defendant appealed to the appellate department, raising four distinct issues, including the issue of whether the trial court had committed <em>\u201cYurko </em>error\u201d in proceeding to determine the truth of the alleged prior without first advising defendant of his right to a jury trial on that question and then obtaining an express waiver by defendant of a jury trial on that matter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">The appellate department ruled on the matter as follows: \u201cIt Is Ordered, Adjudged, and Decreed that the judgment of the Municipal Court of the Corona Judicial District, County of Riverside, in the above entitled cause, is hereby affirmed. The Finding of the prior is reversed. The Matter is remanded to Corona Judicial District for retrial on the prior only.\u201d Defendant thereafter petitioned the appellate department for a rehearing on the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>and, in the alternative, applied for a certification of the case to this court pursuant to California Rules of Court, rules 62 and 63(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The sole ground upon which defendant based his petition/application for rehearing/certification was his contention that the appellate department had committed error in remanding the case to the municipal court for retrial on the question whether defendant had been convicted of the alleged prior because the double jeopardy doctrine precluded a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The appellate department denied defendant\u2019s petition for rehearing, but did certify the transfer of the case to this court because: \u201cA decision regarding the impaneling of a new jury to try prior conviction allegations as it relates to a criminal defendant\u2019s right against Double Jeopardy should be addressed within this Appellate District to settle this important question of law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">This court then ordered the transfer of the case to it for hearing and decision pursuant to rule 62(a), stating: \u201cTransfer is necessary to settle an important question of law. That question is whether the superior court may remand a case to the municipal court for trial by jury of the truth of an alleged prior conviction after the trial court had previously failed to submit the question to the jury without the defendant\u2019s waiver. (See <em>In re Ware </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1265, 1267 et seq. [285 Cal.Rptr. 179]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Saunders </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1574, 1577-1578, 1581 et seq. [285 Cal.Rptr. 485].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Defendant filed an opening brief with this court, in which brief defendant once again assigned as error by the municipal court the same four contentions he had originally raised in the appellate brief he had filed with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>appellate department. The People responded to each of the four issues in its respondent\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Additional facts will be referred to, as needed, in the discussion which follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Issues Considered for Review on Transfer</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Rule 62(a) states in pertinent part that: \u201cA Court of Appeal may order <em>a case </em>transferred to it for hearing and decision when the superior court certifies . . . that such transfer appears necessary to secure uniformity of decision or to settle important questions of law.\" (Italics added.) A literalistic argument can be made that rule 62(a)\u2019s use of the phrase \u201ca case\u201d means that the <em>entirety </em>of a case (including all of the various issues raised on appeal in the appellate department of the superior court) is necessarily brought forward for further appellate review by a court of appeal when a case is transferred from a superior court to a court of appeal by way of certified transfer. We do not, however, interpret rule 62(a) to have that meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">As noted by our Supreme Court: \u201cThe Court of Appeal has <em>uncontrolled discretion </em>in deciding whether to transfer a case from the appellate department [citation], . . .\u201d <em>(Dvorin </em>v. <em>Appellate Dept. </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 648, 650 [125 Cal.Rptr. 771, 542 P.2d 1363], italics added.) In our view, \u201cuncontrolled discretion in deciding whether to transfer a case\u201d <em>at all </em>necessarily includes the discretion to determine that only certain, <em>limited </em>aspects of a case will be heard and decided after the transfer. This interpretation of rule 62(a) is particularly consistent with the fact that \u201c[c]ases are transferred to the Court of Appeal under rules 61-69, not primarily for the benefit of the party who lost in the superior court, but \u2018to secure uniformity of decision or to settle important questions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Corcoran </em>v. <em>Universal Guardian Corp. </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 904, 910 [140 Cal.Rptr. 421].)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">In this case, the petition for a rehearing which defendant filed with the appellate department was based solely on his contention that the appellate department had committed error by remanding the case to the municipal court for retrial of the truth of the alleged prior. This same contention formed the sole basis of defendant\u2019s application to the appellate department to have his case certified for transfer to this court for hearing and decision. This same issue was the only issue referred to (indirectly) by the appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>department in its certification. And finally, this same issue is the sole issue referred to by this court in ordering the transfer of defendant\u2019s case. Given all of the above, we decline to address any of defendant\u2019s assignments of error by the municipal court which he has raised in his briefs filed with this court, and will consider only the question whether the appellate department committed reversible error in remanding the case to the municipal court for a retrial of the truth of the alleged prior.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Alleged \u201cWojahn Error\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The appellate department\u2019s decision remanding the case to the municipal court with directions that the alleged prior be retried is reversed. This case is remanded to the municipal court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate department\u2019s affirmance of defendant\u2019s convictions of the driving under the influence charges and its reversal of the finding that the alleged prior was true. The stay of action and proceedings under California Rules of Court, rule 67, is forthwith terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">McKinster, J., and McDaniel, J.,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-10\"><em>In re Yurko </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 857 [112 Cal.Rptr. 513, 519 P.2d 561],</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\">hereinafter, references to \u201crules\u201d will refer to the California Rules of Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A537\">The quotation is taken from defendant\u2019s application for certification and appears to be intended to reflect the following wording of rule 63(a): \u201cThe superior court on application of a party or on its own motion may certify that the transfer of a case to the Court of Appeal appears necessary to secure uniformity of decision or to settle important questions of law.\u201d The superior court\u2019s actual certification consists of nothing more than a check mark next to a general statement prepared by defendant and attached to his application: \u201cThis matter is certified for transfer to the Court of Appeal pursuant to Rules of Court 62 and 63(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ANF\">The fact that defendant raised only one \u201cimportant question of law\u201d in his application for certification makes it easy, in this case, to ascertain the precise legal issue the appellate department had in mind when it certified the matter for transfer to this court. However, this will not always be the case. For future reference, we remind the appellate department that rule 63(e) states that: \u201cThe certification [by the superior court] shall contain a brief statement setting forth any conflict of decision (with citation of or reference to decisions creating the conflict, if there is no written opinion by the superior court) or important question of law to be settled and shall state whether there was a judgment in the superior court, and, if so, the nature and the date thereof.\" (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Burdzinski </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 540, 543 [173 Cal.Rptr. 440].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b357-10\">We suggest that the Judicial Council amend the California Rules of Court to make explicit that which is currently only implicit\u2014the power of the intermediate appellate courts to limit the issues for hearing and decision in cases ordered by those courts to be transferred pursuant to rule 62(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b357-11\">We note that we requested, and received, oral argument by the People and defendant on the question whether an appellate court has the authority to limit the issues to be considered when a case is transferred to that court pursuant to rule 62(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-12\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 696.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b357-13\">Retired Associate Justice of the Court of Appeal, Fourth District, sitting under assignment by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
