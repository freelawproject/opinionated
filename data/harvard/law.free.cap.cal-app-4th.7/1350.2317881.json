We find no prejudicial error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">Procedural and Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">There being no insufficiency of evidence claim, we summarize the evidence and do so with a perspective favoring the judgment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barnes </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 284, 303-304 [228 Cal.Rptr. 228, 721 P.2d 110].)</p>\n<p id=\"b952-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>This is a gang, drive-by shooting case. The victims lived in Lynwood, Banning Street Gang territory. The perpetrators were members of a rival gang from Compton, the Bario Los Padrenos (BLP) Gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">The events occurred Christmas Eve, December 24, 1989. Appellant, 19\u2018A years old and a member of BLP, went to a party in Compton. But, finding it boring, he left about 9 p.m. with another gang member, Raymond Vasquez. The two had been friends for three years afid lived on the same block. Raymond, about 17 years old, had been a gang member for at least 3 years and was called \u201cLittle Man.\u201d Appellant and Raymond \u201chad done graffiti\u201d together and appellant had been with Raymond when he had \u201chit people up,\u201d i.e., asked their gang affiliation and declared his own. Appellant knew Raymond was violent.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">The two of them, appellant and Raymond, were gone from the party for about two hours. Appellant testified they \u201ccruised\u201d and played some arcade games. They returned approximately 11 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">After a short time they left again, this time with 3 girls, Sylvia and Martha, each 16 years old, and Connie, 14 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">Appellant drove his blue Buick Regal. Raymond sat in front, on the right. Connie sat between them. Sylvia and Martha sat in the rear. They drove a short distance to Long Beach Boulevard and picked up another BLP Gang member, Sparkey. He sat in back.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">Appellant then drove to Banning Street Gang territory in Lynwood. It was about 11:20 p.m. when they drove by a house on the corner of Banning and Peach. Sylvia called out that \u201cthere\u2019s some guys from Banning.\u201d Appellant testified that Raymond couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off them, looking back, and staring\u2014but said nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">Without anything being said, appellant drove past the house, went to the corner, turned right and turned right again. Connie asked Raymond where they were going and he told her to ask appellant. Connie did. Appellant didn\u2019t answer. Connie asked him five or six times but still got no response. As appellant again approached the corner house he slowed, turned off his lights, and stopped in the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">Raymond leaned out his window and screamed \u201cWhere you Vatos from?\u201d When there was no answer, he asked again. One of the nearby men then answered, \u201cBanning.\u201d Raymond replied, \u201cFuck Banning.\u201d He then stated, \u201cBarrios Los Padrenos,\u201d pulled out a .38-caliber pistol, extended both arms through the window, and fired six shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>Two bullets hit Antonio Gonzales, one in the chest, one in the stomach. He died within three hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Two bullets hit Martin Camorlinga. A third man, Solomon Rodriguez, was about 25 feet away from the car when the shooting started. He started to run, trying to hide, but also was shot twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">Appellant immediately drove away. After a short distance he turned his lights on. There was little conversation but Sylvia and Raymond did talk about the shooting. According to Martha, Raymond was \u201cscared\u201d and \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe he did it.\u201d Raymond and Sylvia \u201cwere just laughing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">Although appellant, Connie, and Martha all testified, none related any postshooting conversation between appellant and Raymond, or <em>any </em>statement\u2014of surprise, disapproval, or otherwise\u2014by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">Appellant drove to a park in Bell Gardens, stopped briefly, and then took each of the others home.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">When asked why he hadn\u2019t called the police during the month before he was arrested, appellant said he had forgotten about the shooting \u201cbecause I was too busy working.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">Also, on cross-examination, when asked if he was surprised by Raymond\u2019s first shot, appellant testified, \u201cYes. I thought he was going to shoot once. But he shot couple\u2014he shot more than once.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\">1. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred in admitting certain expert gang testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">To provide context for appellant\u2019s numerous contentions concerning the admissibility of expert gang testimony, we set forth in detail not only that testimony but appellant\u2019s trial objections and the court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-14\">Deputy Sheriff Loy Luna was called as a prosecution gang expert witness. He testified to being presently assigned to \u201cOperations Safe Street Team,\u201d a gang unit in the sheriff\u2019s Lynwood station. He had also worked in other specialized units exclusively dealing with gangs, such as the gang enforcement team. He had worked patrol for seven years. As part of his experience he had investigated \u201cwell over 4[00] or 500 gang-related crimes\u201d and had \u201cpersonally arrested well over 500 active gang members.\u201d He had \u201ccome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>across\u201d \u201cwell over a thousand\u201d gang members, was familiar with both the BLP Gang and the Banning Street Gang, and had investigated approximately 30 drive-by shootings. He had also taken a 40-hour class on gang subculture.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Appellant made no objection when Deputy Luna was called as a witness or during the establishment of his qualifications as a gang expert.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s first objection, on \u201crelevancy\u201d grounds, was to this prosecutor question: \u201cDeputy Luna, based on your training and experience, would you describe for the jury how a typical drive-by shooting occurs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">Before ruling, the court had a lengthy bench conference with counsel. The prosecutor stated the evidence was offered for motive and intent. Appellant objected on relevancy and lack of foundation grounds. The court <em>sustained </em>appellant\u2019s objection, ruling a sufficient foundation had not been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">The prosecutor then resumed her examination and Deputy Luna, <em>without objection, </em>testified that there <em>is </em>a typical gang drive-by shooting. He described it this way: \u201cTypically done with the use of a vehicle. Usually there\u2019s two .or more people within the vehicle. And certainly [ ] a neighborhood or specific target of people are sought out and accomplished by driving into that neighborhood, which is usually a rival gang neighborhood, finding the target and using whatever firearms that they have available and shooting at the intended target or victim and then driving away from the location.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">Deputy Luna further testified that \u201csometimes\u201d during a drive-by shooting words are exchanged. When he began to describe the words, stating \u201cUsually, it\u2019s related to the particular\u2014,\u201d appellant interposed this objection: \u201cObject, your Honor, on the grounds of that\u2019s not\u2014out of his expertise if he didn\u2019t say it\u2019s typical.\u201d The trial court properly overruled this objection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Deputy Luna answered that question and the following, unobjected to, questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-8\">\u201cThe Witness: Usually, it\u2019s something within the nature of a gang slogan or either the persons that are doing the shooting are identifying themselves from a particular gang in calling out to the rival gangs using profanity against them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>\u201cQ. What\u2019s the purpose of either calling out to a rival gang member or stating your own gang?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-5\">\u201cA. Well, the purpose is they want the\u2014well, from what I understand, they want the notoriety that they, in fact, did commit the drive-by when they usually yell out their own\u2014their own gang slogan or whatever. It\u2019s to let the victim know that they are a rival gang; their rival gang is the one that actually did the shooting so there\u2019s no mistake about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-6\">\u201cQ. Deputy Luna, what does the phrase \u2018where you from\u2019 mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-7\">\u201cA. The phrase generally means \u2018what gang are you from; what neighborhood are you from?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-8\">\u201cQ. Deputy Luna, what\u2014what reasons would there be for a rival gang to go into another gang\u2019s territory that you know of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-9\">\u201cA. Well, primarily, from what I have experienced, would be to commit some kind of an assault or some type of crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-10\">\u201cQ. And what do you mean by crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-11\">\u201cA. Well, if there\u2019s no target or victim out\u2014standing out in the neighborhood or whatever, occasionally they will bring out their spray paint cans and deface the property in the rival neighborhood or cross out the rival gang\u2019s neighborhood writings that\u2019s already on the walls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-12\">\u201cQ. And what does the crossing out of a gang name mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-13\">\u201cA. Basically a form of disrespect towards that rival gang. And the crossing out usually means that they intend to\u2014to kill anybody from that particular gang.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-14\">\u201cQ. Would you say it was like a challenge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-15\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-16\">The next question by the prosecutor was a lengthy hypothetical one. It recited testimony describing the drive-by shooting and asked: \u201cWhat would be your opinion of this incident?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-17\">Appellant objected: \u201cYour Honor, I will object on the grounds of it\u2019s outside his expertise. Calls for speculation. Phrased to provoke the jury. Not a proper argument.\u201d The trial court sustained appellant\u2019s objection, observing \u201cIt is also vague.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b956-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>Then, at prosecutor request, another protracted bench conference occurred. During this conference the trial court made clear that whether or not a hypothetical question was proper depended upon \u201cWhat question you [the prosecutor] ultimately put to the expert.\u201d No question about <em>appellant\u2019s </em>intent would be permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">After this bench conference, the following two questions were asked and answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">\u201cQ. Deputy Luna, do you remember the hypothetical that I gave you?</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">\u201cQ. Okay. Would you have an opinion as to whether that was a typical drive-by shooting?</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">\u201cA. Yes, I would.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">Apparently believing, erroneously, that she had elicited Deputy Luna\u2019s opinion, the prosecutor turned to a different subject. Without objection, this question was asked and answered:</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">\u201cQ. Okay. Based on your training and experience, could you tell us the association between a driver and a passenger shooter during a drive-by shooting?</p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">\u201cA. Well <em>in most cases that I have dealt with, </em>at least, the driver\u2019s purpose is what it\u2014what it states <em>[sic] </em>is that he takes the passenger or whoever was going to commit the assault to an area of where the target is or victim is which is usually some rival gang neighborhood. And his purpose is to basically get him into the neighborhood and to get him out safely and hopefully elude law enforcement if law enforcement was nearby or happens to be in the area.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">The prosecutor\u2019s next question shifted focus away from Deputy Luna\u2019s personal experience. The following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-13\">\u201cQ. Deputy Luna, let me ask you. Is it common for a\u2014in your training and experience, <em>has it been common for a driver not to know what his passenger was going to do in gang-related </em>shootings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-14\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: I object, your Honor, on the grounds that that calls for speculation. No foundation that he has knowledge as to what all the drivers know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Sustained.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">The objection having been sustained, the prosecutor refocused her questions, again asking Deputy Luna about his personal experiences.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">\u201cQ. Well, have you talked to both drivers and shooters in your investigations of drive-by shootings?</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">\u201cA. Yes, I have.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">\u201cQ. And when you talk to them, do you talk about particular shootings and methods of how they go about planning a shooting?</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">\u201cA.' Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">\u201cQ. <em>And based on your training and experience with these particular types of drive-by shootings, </em>have you known\u2014let me put it simpler\u2014for the driver to not know what his passenger was going to do?\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">To this last question appellant objected as follows: \u201cYour Honor, again I\u2019ll object on the same grounds.\u201d The court clarified that appellant\u2019s objection was \u201cimproper foundation,\u201d and overruled the objection. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">Deputy Luna then answered \u201cNo\u201d and, without further objection, testified: \u201cIn other words, I haven\u2019t come across, at least in the cases that I have investigated where the\u2014the driver hasn\u2019t any knowledge that the passenger was, in fact, going to commit an assault or do a drive-by shooting. Usually the drivers had knowledge. They either planned it in advance or thought upon it real quickly or just acted and driver did his part by driving the passenger or whoever into the rival gang neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">Appellant\u2019s arguments concerning this expert testimony are numerous and lengthy (44 pages of his briefs are devoted to this subject). He contends the trial court erred in admitting this testimony because: (1) it is irrelevant, (2) it is irrelevant that drive-by shootings have a common pattern, (3) it is irrelevant as proof of appellant\u2019s intent, (4) gang behavior is not a subject of expert testimony, (5) the testimony did not satisfy <em>Kelly-Frye </em>standards<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, (6) Deputy Luna was not a qualified expert, (7) information from gang members is too unreliable upon which to base expert opinion, (8) it was inadmissible character evidence, (9) the trial court failed to exercise its Evidence Code section 352 discretion, and (10) it denied appellant due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>We do not decide the merits of any of these contentions because appellant did not object to the admitted evidence on any of these grounds. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 353; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 542, 547-548 [146 Cal.Rptr. 732, 579 P.2d 1048]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 27 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ghent </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 739, 762 [239 Cal.Rptr. 82, 739 P.2d 1250].) Of his five objections, three were sustained including his only \u201crelevancy\u201d objection. His other two objections were \u201cbeyond expertise\u201d (see fn. 3, <em>ante) </em>and \u201cimproper foundation.\" This last objection was properly overruled because the objected-to-question was restricted to Deputy Luna\u2019s personal experience investigating drive-by shootings.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Appellant\u2019s contention is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">2. <em>Appellant contends the trial court committed Ireland error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Appellant contends, and respondent concedes, the trial court committed <em>Ireland (People </em>v. <em>Ireland </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 522 [75 Cal.Rptr. 188, 450 P.2d 580, 40 A.L.R.3d 1323]) error. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">The trial court gave CALJIC No. 8.34<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which eironeously instructed the jury, in appellant\u2019s words, \u201cthat it could convict appellant of second degree felony-murder if it found that the killing occurred during the commission of assault with a firearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">However, the court correctly instructed the jury concerning other theories of second degree murder. \u201cIn such circumstances, the applicable rule on appeal is clear: reversal is required only if the reviewing court cannot determine from the record on which theory the jury relied.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sanders </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 471, 509 [273 Cal.Rptr. 537, 797 P.2d 561]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Sedeno </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 703, 720-721 [112 Cal.Rptr. 1, 518 P.2d 913]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 495, 530-531 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 677, 822 P.2d 385].)</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">The facts of the instant case are indistinguishable from <em>People </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 605 [253 Cal.Rptr. 863, 765 P.2d 70], The court, in considering a similar instructional error, stated: \u201cThree persons were shot\u2014 Vasquez, Romero and Zamora. Only Vasquez died. Defendant was charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>with two counts of assault with intent to commit murder for the shootings of Romero and Zamora. The jury was instructed that this crime requires express malice. Express malice, in this context, necessarily includes an intent to kill. The jury verdicts finding defendant guilty on both counts thus determined that he intended to kill Romero and Zamora. The evidence manifestly shows a single intent as to all three victims in the liquor store shootings; it is inconceivable the jury would find that defendant intended to kill only the victims who survived, but not the one who died.\u201d (Internal quotations omitted.) <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 633-634.)</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">As in <em>Walker, </em>the trial court instructed the jury that appellant could only be convicted of attempted murder if \u201cthe person committing such act harbored ... a specific intent to kill. . . .\u201d By its two guilty-of-attempted-murder verdicts, the jury determined Raymond harbored this intent. Also as in <em>Walker, </em>it is \u201cinconceivable the jury would find that [Raymond] intended to kill only the victims who survived, but not the one who died.\u201d (47 Cal.3d at p. 634.)</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">We conclude the <em>Ireland </em>error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">3. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred in giving CAUIC No. 3.02.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">The trial court gave CAUIC No. 3.02, instructing the jury: \u201cOne who aids and abets is not only guilty of the particular crime that to his knowledge his confederates are contemplating committing, but is also liable for the natural and probable consequences of any criminal act that he knowingly and intentionally aided and abetted. You must determine whether the defendant is guilty of the crime originally contemplated, and, if so, whether the crime charged in Counts 1, 2, and 3 was a natural and probable consequence of such originally contemplated crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">Appellant contends it was error to give the instruction for two reasons. First, it was inapplicable. Second, it removed malice aforethought from second degree murder. Appellant is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">The instruction was applicable because the jury could have found appellant knew Raymond had a gun and knew Raymond intended to shoot at people, but did not know that Raymond intended to kill anyone. The instruction accurately informed the jury that appellant\u2019s liability was not limited by his own knowledge but, rather, extended to the \u201c \u2018 \u201cnatural and probable consequences of any [criminal] act\u201d \u2019 \u201d he knowingly aided Raymond in committing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Croy </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 1, 12, fn. 5 [221 Cal.Rptr. 592, 710 P.2d 392]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garrison </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 746, 777-778 [254 Cal.Rptr. 257, 765 P.2d 419]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hammond </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 463, 467-470 [226 Cal.Rptr. 475].)</p>\n<p id=\"b960-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>4. <em>Appellant contends CALJIC No. 3.02 violates due process.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Expanding upon his previous contention concerning the same instruction, appellant makes a scholarly attack upon the \u201cnatural and probable consequences doctrine.\u201d Since the California Supreme Court has rejected appellant\u2019s argument <em>(People </em>v. <em>Croy, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 1, 12, fn. 5; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garrison, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 746, 777-778) we are powerless to accept it. <em>(Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].)</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">5. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred in failing to define \u201cconspiracy.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">Appellant contends the trial court had a sua sponte duty to define \u201cconspiracy\u201d as that word was used in the CALJIC No. 8.33<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> instruction it gave the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Earnest </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 734, 744-745 [126 Cal.Rptr. 107] found it harmless error to omit a conspiracy definition when conspiracy was not separately charged but was relied upon to admit the hearsay statements of coconspirators. No such statements were received in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1268, 1314-1315 [248 Cal.Rptr. 834, 756 P.2d 221] held that since \u201cthe word \u2018conspiracy\u2019 was used in its common and nontechnical meaning of an agreement to do harm\u201d there was no sua sponte duty to define it.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">The only difference between the ordinary meaning of conspiracy and its legal meaning is the latter\u2019s inclusion of <em>overt act </em>(in furtherance). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Earnest, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d 734, 744-745). Because the commission of an overt act (in furtherance of any conspiracy between appellant and Raymond) was undisputed, its omission from a \u201cconspiracy\u201d definition, even if the trial court had a duty to give one, was without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">6. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred in failing to define \u201cassault.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">Appellant states: \u201cAlthough the court instructed the jury that it could find appellant liable for second degree aiding and abetting felony-murder, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>conspiracy felony-murder, if appellant aided and abetted an assault with a firearm, or conspired to commit assault with a firearm, the court omitted to instruct the jury on the elements of an assault.\" Appellant contends the omission was prejudicial error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument hinges on the difference between the everyday meaning of \u201cassault\u201d and the law\u2019s inclusion of \u201cwith a present ability\u201d (\u00a7 240) in its definition. This distinction was without significance in the instant trial because appellant was not separately charged with assault, \u201cwith a present ability\" was undisputed (six shots were fired and all six bullets caused injury), and by their verdicts the jury necessarily determined Raymond had \u201cpresent ability\u201d to commit violent injuries. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garrison, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 746, 777-778.) Any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">7. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred in failing to give CAUIC No. 6.15.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">The trial court instructed the jury concerning second degree felony murder in pursuance of a conspiracy. (CALJIC No. 8.33; see fn. 6.) Appellant contends it should also, sua sponte, have given CALJIC No. 6.15: \u201cNo act or declaration of a conspirator that is an independent product of his own mind and is outside the common design and not a furtherance of that design is binding upon his co-conspirators, and they are not criminally liable for any such act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">We hold the trial court had no sua sponte duty to give CALJIC No. 6.15. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brigham </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1039, 1046-1047 [265 Cal.Rptr. 486].)</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">The factual issue in the instant trial was simple. The prosecution argued appellant knew Raymond had a gun and intended to use it. Appellant testified he did not know Raymond had a gun. Unlike <em>Brigham, </em>there simply was no issue of a last-second \u201cindependent\u201d criminal act by the coconspirator. If appellant sought instructional insulation against such a covert possibility it was his duty, not the trial court\u2019s, to formulate such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">8. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury to view with caution evidence of his oral admissions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked appellant if he had told the arresting officers he \u201chad loaned [his] car out on Christmas Eve?\u201d Appellant answered that he told the officers he had loaned \u201cit to Raymond for a while and then he came back.\u201d Further minimizing the significance of this difference between the two versions was Detective Morgan\u2019s testimony that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>appellant also stated, \u201cin one flow of time,\u201d \u201cI was cruising with some girls that night. I didn\u2019t know what Little Man was going to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">Appellant contends it was error for the court not to instruct, sua sponte, that \u201cEvidence of an oral admission of a defendant should be viewed with caution.\" (CALJIC No. 2.71.) We believe there was no sua sponte duty to give this cautionary instruction, but, in any event, its omission was without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Neither version of appellant\u2019s extrajudicial statement to the arresting officers constituted a traditional \u201cadmission.\"<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To the contrary, the prosecution\u2019s version was facially exculpatory and appellant\u2019s version was guilt-neutral. More to the point, it was undisputed that whichever version appellant had made he had simultaneously stated \u201cI was cruising with some girls that night. I didn\u2019t know what Little Man was going to do.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">This, we believe, explains why neither party requested an admission instruction or its cautionary appendage. Because appellant\u2019s extrajudicial statements to the arresting officers were virtually inextricable, a <em>cautionary </em>instruction would have emasculated the possible effect of his exculpatory \u201cI didn\u2019t know what Little Man was going to do\u201d statement. Given the nature of these extrajudicial statements, we conclude the trial court was not required, sua sponte, to instruct the jury that \u201cEvidence of an oral admission of the defendant should be viewed with caution.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Heishman </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 147, 166 [246 Cal.Rptr. 673, 753 P.2d 629].)</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">9. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred in failing to give CALJIC No. 2.13.1.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">Appellant contends the court should have given CALJIC No. 2.13.1. It states: \u201cIf you find that a defendant, following arrest, made [a statement] [or] [statements] to a law enforcement officer or officers, inconsistent with [such] defendant\u2019s trial testimony, the out-of-court [statement] [or] [statements] should be considered by you only for the purpose of testing [such] defendant\u2019s credibility as a witness. You must not consider the statement as evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">\u201c[Evidence of an oral out-of-court statement of the defendant ought to be viewed with caution.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>This contention is based upon the assumption that appellant\u2019s statement to the arresting officers was made in violation of <em>Miranda (Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974]) and was admissible only for impeachment. The assumption is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">The prosecutor, during cross-examination of appellant, attempted to elicit the \u201cI had loaned [my] car out on Christmas Eve\u201d statement but failed. First, she got bogged down by being unable to establish a <em>Miranda </em>foundation. Then she was confronted by appellant\u2019s denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">Ultimately, the prosecutor called Detective Morgan who established that. appellant\u2019s statements were spontaneous, and thus not violative of <em>Miranda. </em>Defense counsel did not challenge the full admissibility of appellant\u2019s statements. In fact, his brief cross-examination of Detective Morgan emphasized that appellant <em>had </em>stated \u201cI didn\u2019t know Little Man was going to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">CALJIC No. 2.13.1 was inapplicable and properly not given.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">10. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred in giving CALJIC No. 2.03.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">This contention, like the previous one, assumes appellant\u2019s extrajudicial statements were made in violation of <em>Miranda. </em>As we have explained, this assumption is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">11. <em>Appellant contends the cumulative effect of the \u201cmultiple\u201d errors was prejudicial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">We conclude that the few trial court errors were neither singly nor cumulatively prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">The factual issue was a simple one: did appellant know Raymond had a gun and intended to use it?
