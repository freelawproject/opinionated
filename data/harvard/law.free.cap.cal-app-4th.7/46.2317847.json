We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">Brian Taylor, age three, was playing in his yard with his brothers and sisters when defendant drove up to their house. Defendant was a family friend who was well known to Brian and the other children. Brian and one of his older brothers ran over to defendant\u2019s car and they talked for awhile. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>After the older brother walked away, defendant opened his car door, picked up Brian, put him on the seat and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Defendant drove to his home and left Brian with his wife, saying he would be back for him in 20 minutes. Defendant\u2019s wife changed and fed Brian and, when defendant did not return, put Brian to sleep with her children. The police arrived between 11 and 12 p.m. that night and picked up Brian. Defendant was arrested the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Defendant\u2019s purpose in taking Brian was the principal issue at trial. Brian\u2019s father testified he was a drug addict and owed defendant $1,200 for drugs. The day before he took Brian, defendant told the father, \u201cIf you don\u2019t pay me the money that you owe me, my connection told me either come up here and get you or your son.\" Defendant testified Brian\u2019s father owed him money but it had nothing to do with his taking Brian. According to defendant, he was a friend of the family and had just come by to take Brian out for a hamburger as he had done in the past. He took Brian to his house because Brian was wet and needed changing. He left to drive a friend on an errand and for a complicated set of reasons did not get home until 2 a.m. the next morning. Defendant believed he had at least implied permission to take Brian places without checking first with Brian\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">On the basis of the statements by Brian\u2019s father that defendant took Brian to force payment of a debt, defendant was charged with kidnapping for purposes of extortion or to obtain money or something of value. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209, subd. (a).) The jury was also instructed on the lesser included offense of simple kidnapping under Penal Code section 207, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the lesser offense of simple kidnapping and defendant was sentenced to the midterm of eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">On appeal, defendant argues the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the elements of a kidnapping under section 207, subdivision (a). He also argues there was insufficient evidence of a forcible taking and that the jury should not have been instructed to make a finding as to Brian\u2019s age. For the reasons set forth below, we reject these arguments and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>I. <em>Defendant Invited the Trial Court\u2019s Failure to Instruct That Simple Kidnapping of a Person Incapable of Giving Consent Requires a Specific Intent to Do Some Unlawful Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Defendant was charged with aggravated kidnapping under section 209, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The prosecution\u2019s theory was that defendant kidnapped Brian to force Brian\u2019s father to pay a debt owed defendant, allegedly money owed for drug purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">When it came time to consider jury instructions, defense counsel vigorously argued the jury be instructed on the lesser included offense of simple kidnapping which statutorily requires only the forcible movement of a person for a substantial distance without the person\u2019s consent. ( \u00a7 207, subd. (a).) The trial court was reluctant to give such an instruction and asked defense counsel to articulate the facts under which the jury could convict defendant of simple kidnapping as opposed to the choices urged by the prosecution: guilty of aggravated kidnapping or not guilty of any offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Defense counsel argued the jury could disbelieve the testimony of Brian\u2019s father that defendant took Brian to force payment of a debt, but could also disbelieve defendant\u2019s claim he had permission from Brian\u2019s parents to take Brian for rides. Under that scenario, defense counsel told the court, \u201c[tjhere was a movement against someone\u2019s will. . . and unfortunately, at least for my client\u2019s sake, that\u2019s sufficient for a 207 simple kidnap.\u201d The defense theory, as counsel articulated it, was that if the jury disbelieved the extortion aspect of the prosecution\u2019s case and did not accept the defense claim of a permissive taking, the evidence would support a verdict of guilt of simple kidnapping. Defense counsel told the court several times simple movement of Brian against his will would be enough to convict defendant of kidnapping under section 207, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">After hearing argument from the defense and prosecution the court agreed to instruct the jury on simple kidnapping. There was no discussion between counsel and the court as to the specific instructions the court would give on simple kidnapping or what language would be used or not used.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">The court instructed the jury on simple kidnapping, using its own modification of CALJIC No. 9.50 which essentially stated the elements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>crime as set forth in section 207, subdivision (a). The court did not instruct the jury that for purposes of simple kidnapping under section 207, if the person forcibly moved is incapable of giving consent (i.e., a three-year-old child) then the People must prove the movement was done for an illegal purpose or with an illegal intent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Oliver </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 761, 768 [12 Cal.Rptr. 865, 361 P.2d 593]; and see CALJIC No. 9.57.)  On appeal, defendant argues failure to give this qualifying instruction was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Defendant\u2019s argument is based on <em>People </em>v. <em>Oliver, supra, </em>in which the court held that as to minors or others incapable of giving consent a person is guilty of kidnapping under section 207 \u201conly if the taking and carrying away is done for an illegal purpose or with an illegal intent.\u201d (55 Cal.2d at p. 768.) The court injected this element of specific intent into section 207 to avoid kidnapping convictions of \u201cgood Samaritans\u201d attempting to protect a child or incapacitated adult from imminent harm. (55 Cal.2d at p. 765.) Here, it is undisputed Brian Taylor was three years old at the time of the incident. Therefore, in order to convict defendant of kidnapping Brian under section 207, subdivision (a) the People would have to prove defendant acted for an illegal purpose or with an illegal intent. (55 Cal.2d at p. 768.) Failure to so instruct the jury was error. <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In this case, however, it is clear the error was invited. As we noted above, defense counsel sold the trial court on the section 207 instruction by arguing \u201cmovement against someone\u2019s will\u201d is sufficient to sustain a conviction under section 207, subdivision (a). Counsel never mentioned the element, required in the case of minors, that the movement be for an illegal purpose or with an illegal intent. Counsel may have had a tactical .reason for failing to mention this additional element. If convicted under section 209, subdivision (a), defendant faced life in prison. If convicted under section 207, subdivision (a), defendant faced a sentence of five, eight or eleven years. (\u00a7 208, subd. (b).) If defense counsel raised the <em>Oliver </em>element, the court would realize that under the facts of this case the only illegal purpose or intent the defendant could have had was to commit extortion or exact money from Brian\u2019s parents which would bring the case under section 209 and, therefore, no instruction on simple kidnapping would be proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>It is well settled the doctrine of invited error precludes the defendant from complaining about an instruction given at his own request. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 616, 625 [76 Cal.Rptr. 768].) Here, the record is clear defense counsel intended the court to give the instruction it gave on simple kidnapping and that the court gave that instruction only at the behest of defense counsel and over the prosecutor\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">It is true defense counsel did not explicitly ask for the language the court used in its instruction nor did he articulate on the record any tactical reason for requesting the simple kidnapping instruction without the <em>Oliver </em>element. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wickersham </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 307, 330, 333 [185 Cal.Rptr. 436, 650 P.2d 311].) However, the <em>Wickersham </em>requirements for invited error are not applicable here. <em>Wickersham </em>is only applicable when the court is under a sua sponte duty to instruct in a manner other than it did. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gallego </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 115, 183 [276 Cal.Rptr. 679, 802 P.2d 169].) As we have explained, the evidence did not warrant an instruction on simple kidnapping because under the facts of this case if defendant was guilty of simple kidnapping as defined in <em>Oliver, </em>it could only have been because he acted with the unlawful purpose or intent of exacting money from Brian\u2019s father. This is the same unlawful purpose or intent that would make the kidnapping an aggravated one under section 209. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Morrison </em>(1964) 228 Cal.App.2d 707, 713 [39 Cal.Rptr. 874].)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">II. <em>Defendant\u2019s Remaining Contentions Are Without Merit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">We have examined defendant\u2019s remaining points and find them to be without merit. The evidence was sufficient to establish Brian was taken by force. Whether or not the jury should have been asked to make a finding Brian was under the age of 14, it is undisputed Brian was 3 years of age. Therefore, defendant was properly sentenced under section 208, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">Lillie, P. J., and Woods (Fred), J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied July 2, 1992, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied September 3, 1992, Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-9\">All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b65-11\">At the time of the offense, section 209, subdivision (a) provided in relevant part, \u201cAny person who seizes . . . entices, decoys, abducts, conceals, kidnaps or carries away any individual by any means whatsoever with intent to hold or detain, or who holds or detains, such individual for ransom, reward or to commit extortion or to exact from another person any money or valuable thing, ... is guilty of a felony and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life without possibility of parole in cases in which any person . . . suffers death or bodily harm, . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Defendant was tried and convicted prior to the enactment of section 207, subdivision (e)(1) which provides: \u201cSubdivisions (a) to (d), inclusive, do not apply to any of the following: [\u00b6] (1) To any person who steals, takes, entices away, detains, conceals, or harbors any child under the age of 14 years, if that act is taken to protect the child from danger of imminent harm.\u201d Thus we express no opinion on whether, as to a child, the existence of an unlawful purpose remains an element of the offense or whether the purpose of protecting the child is an affirmative defense.
