J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXe\">Defendant appeals from a judgment entered on a jury verdict convicting him of possession of a concealed dirk or dagger (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12020, subd.(a)). He contends: 1) the knife he possessed is not a dirk or dagger as a matter of law, and 2) the court incorrectly instructed the jury regarding the definition of \u201cdirk or dagger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">On April 22, 1991, Bakersfield city police officers received a report of an intoxicated person who possibly possessed a large knife. Police detained defendant as one matching the reported description. The officers searched defendant. They found a kitchen knife concealed from view inside the waistband of his pants. When asked about the knife, defendant said he carried it for protection and that there were people \u201cafter him.\u201d He also said if anybody tried to touch him, \u201cI\u2019ll kill them.\u201d Defendant described himself as \u201cgood with a knife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">Prior to trial, defendant moved to exclude the knife from evidence on the basis the knife was not a \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d as a matter of law. Relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Ferguson </em>(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 13 [86 Cal.Rptr. 383], and <em>In re Quintus W. </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 640 [175 Cal.Rptr. 30], the court denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>the motion. At trial, the jury viewed a knife<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with a fixed blade of eight or nine inches and a wooden handle of about four inches. The blade was serrated on one edge and blunt on the other. The tip was rounded coming to a point on the serrated edge. The knife did not have a handguard.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Defendant contends the court erred by determining that whether this particular knife is a \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d was a question of fact for the jury. Penal Code section 12020, subdivision (a) provides, in relevant part, as follows: \u201cAny person in this state who . . . possesses . . . any instrument or weapon of the kind commonly known as a blackjack, slungshot, billy, sandclub, sap, or sandbag, or who carries concealed upon his or her person any explosive substance, other than fixed ammunition or who carries concealed upon his or her person any dirk or dagger, is guilty of a felony,</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">First, we discuss three California Supreme Court cases which we are bound to apply. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Forrest </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 478 [62 Cal.Rptr. 766, 432 P.2d 374], the court considered whether a folding pocket knife was a \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d as a matter of law. The court applied the following definition from <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruiz </em>(1928) 88 Cal.App. 502, 504 [263 P. 836]: \u201cA dagger has been defined as any straight knife to be worn on the person which is capable of inflicting death except what is commonly known as a \u2018pocketknife.\u2019 Dirk and dagger are used synonymously and consist of any straight stabbing weapon, as a dirk, stiletto, etc. (Century Dict.) They may consist of any weapon <em>fitted primarily for </em>stabbing.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The court noted, construing section 12020, subdivision (a) with other sections of the Penal Code, it was clear the Legislature did not intend \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d to include all knives. Accordingly, the court refined the test to be applied. When a knife has many possible uses, some of which are clearly innocent and utilitarian, and also has a characteristic that substantially limits its effectiveness as a stabbing instrument, it cannot be held to be a weapon primarily designed for stabbing and is not a dirk or dagger. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Forrest, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d at p. 481.) The court held that a knife with a folding, unfixed blade was substantially limited as a stabbing instrument and was not, as a matter of law, a dirk or dagger within the meaning of the statute. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Bain </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 839 [97 Cal.Rptr. 684, 489 P.2d 564], the court applied the <em>Ruiz </em>definition and the <em>Forrest </em>guidelines. There, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>knife had a folding blade that locked into place and had handguards to prevent the hand from slipping onto the blade if used as a stabbing weapon. Reversing a jury verdict due to prosecutorial misconduct, the court held that it was ordinarily a question of fact for the jury whether such a knife, with no impediments to its effectiveness as a stabbing instrument, was a dirk or dagger. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bain, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at p. 851.) In addition, the court stated the terms \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d are to be strictly construed. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 850.)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Grubb </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 614 [47 Cal.Rptr. 772, 408 P.2d 100], the court applied a clause of Penal Code section 12020, subdivision (a) which outlaws possession \u201cof any instrument or weapon of the kind commonly known as a blackjack, slungshot, billy, sandclub, sap, or sandbag. . . .\u201d The court considered whether a common baseball bat which had been altered into a smaller billy club violated the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">\u201cThe Legislature here sought to outlaw the classic instruments of violence and their homemade equivalents; the Legislature sought likewise to outlaw possession of the sometimes-useful object when the attendant circumstances, including the time, place, destination of the possessor, the alteration of the object from standard form, and other relevant facts indicated that the possessor would use the object for a dangerous, not harmless, purpose. [Citation.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">\u201cThus we hold that the statute embraces instruments other than those specially created or manufactured for criminal purposes; it specifically includes those objects \u2018of the <em>kind </em>commonly known as a billy.\u2019 [Citation; italics in original.] The concomitant circumstances may well proclaim the danger of even the innocent-appearing utensil. The Legislature thus decrees as criminal the possession of ordinarily harmless objects when the circumstances of possession demonstrate an immediate atmosphere of danger.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Grubb, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at pp. 620-621, original italics.) Although the court reversed a guilty verdict due to <em>Dorado </em>error <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dorado </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 338 [42 Cal.Rptr. 169, 398 P.2d 361]), it held possession of the altered baseball bat violated the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Since <em>Grubb, Forrest, </em>and <em>Bain, </em>no California Supreme Court case has applied Penal Code section 12020, subdivision (a). Court of Appeal cases have split over the applicability of the <em>Grubb </em>language to concealed dirks or daggers. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Ferguson, supra, </em>7 Cal.App.3d 13 (butcher knife with an eight-inch blade, a point, and one cutting edge), <em>In re Robert L. </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 401 [169 Cal.Rptr. 354] (common ice pick) and <em>In re Quintus W., supra, </em>120 Cal.App.3d 640 (steak knife with a blade four and five-eights inches long), the Second District held it was proper to allow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>jury to consider the surrounding circumstances and the subjective intent of a knife\u2019s possessor when determining whether the concealed instrument was a dirk or dagger. In <em>Bills </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 855 [150 Cal.Rptr. 582] (unaltered barber scissors), and <em>People </em>v. <em>La Grande </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 871 [159 Cal.Rptr. 709] (leather or wood awl seven and one-half inches long with a sharp point), the First District limited application of the <em>Grubb </em>language to clubbing weapons \u201cof the kind commonly known as a blackjack, slungshot, billy . . . .\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12020, subd.(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><em>In re Quintus W. </em>is typical of the Second District cases. There, the court focused on the defendant\u2019s statement that he carried a steak knife for personal protection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Grubb, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 614, 622, the court concluded \u201c \u2018Nothing further was necessary to show the instrument though \u201cconceived for peaceful purposes, . . . was wrapped in the indicia and circumstance of probable assault.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u2019\u2019 <em>(In re Quintus W., supra, </em>120 Cal.App.3d at p. 645.)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In contrast, the First District, in <em>Bills </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>held that the <em>Grubb </em>approach does not apply to dirk or dagger cases. The court noted that <em>Grubb </em>applied a clause from Penal Code section 12020, subdivision (a) dealing with a class of weapons separate from dirks or daggers. <em>(Bills </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>86 Cal.App.3d at p. 861.) Unlike the very specific reference to concealed \u201cdirks or daggers\u201d this clause outlaws any possession of a broad range of objects \u201cof the <em>kind </em>commonly known as a blackjack,\u201d etc. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12020, subd. (a).) These clubbing instruments may be innocent-appearing utensils. Thus, the attendant circumstances of possession are relevant to determining the possessor\u2019s intent to use them for a dangerous purpose. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Grubb, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at pp. 620-621; <em>Bills </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>86 Cal.App.3d at p. 861.)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">We agree with the First District for the reasons following.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, the terms \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d are to be strictly construed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bain, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at p. 850.) Second, it is clear the <em>Forrest </em>court focused only on the characteristics of the weapon as a stabbing instrument, not on the mental state of the defendant in possessing the weapon. If the knife has innocent uses and is of substantially limited effectiveness as a stabbing instrument, it cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>held to be a dirk or dagger. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Forrest, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d at p. 481.) Third, the <em>Forrest </em>court warned against enlarging the class of weapons within the category of \u201cdirk or dagger.\u201d \u201cNo matter how lethal the instrument may be we cannot hold its concealed possession is a crime unless the Legislature has so provided.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Forrest, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d at p. 481.)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Next we apply the principles discussed above to the knife possessed by Barrios. We do not consider the defendant\u2019s statement that he carried the knife for protection. The knife appears to be a common bread knife. It has one dull serrated edge and one blunt edge. The blade is about eight inches long and the wooden handle about four inches. There are no handguards to prevent the wielder\u2019s hand from slipping onto the blade if it was used to stab. The end of the blade is essentially rounded and comes to a modest point only on the serrated edge. The blade itself flexes noticeably when the point is applied to an object.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">This knife has characteristics which substantially limit its effectiveness as a stabbing instrument. It has no sharp edges, no stabbing point, no hand-guards, and no stiff blade. It is not a dirk or dagger as a matter of law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Forrest, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d at p. 481.) The court erred by denying defendant\u2019s motion to exclude the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">This case provides an excellent example of the mischief wrought by application of the <em>Grubb </em>principles to dirk or dagger cases. By allowing the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s intent in possessing the knife,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the court permitted a common bread knife to be transformed into a dirk or dagger.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Because of our disposition on the first issue, we do not reach appellant\u2019s claim of erroneous jury instructions. The judgment of conviction is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">Ardaiz, J., and Buckley, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-10\">We requested the knife from the superior court pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 10(d), and we have examined it independently.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b193-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Shah </em>(1949) 91 Cal.App.2d 716, 719 [205 P.2d 1081], the First District stated the actual intent to use a knife as a deadly weapon is immaterial to the offense charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b193-9\">The only Fifth District case in this area is <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 52, 55 [139 Cal.Rptr. 811], There, we construed the portion of Penal Code section 12020 dealing with possession of dangerous weapons (a \u201cChinese Throwing Star\u201d). We held that proof of possession alone is sufficient to convict. It is not necessary to prove malicious intent or wrongful use. We contrasted this with the <em>People </em>v. <em>Grubb </em>class of weapons for which defendant\u2019s state of mind is relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b194-10\">The prosecution vigorously argued the defendant\u2019s intent to use the knife for protection in its closing argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
