Gage reciting, among other averments, that by an arrangement with one John McSorley, a contractor, he took the legal title to premises in controversy to hold while a large flat building should be erected thereon, he to receive as compensation for his services the sum of $500; that holding said title, various orders were presented to him by persons furnishing labor and material for such building, and he became obligated to pay certain indebtedness, the exact amount of which he is not advised; that he was unable to make a loan, as originally intended, to pay such debts; that appellant had furnished material for the building for which McSorley was indebted, and thereupon it was agreed between said parties that Gage should convey the property upon which was the unfinished building, to one Detlor, an employe of appellant\u2019s and acting for him; that it was agreed Detlor should obtain a loan on the property and pay all indebtedness, and whatever expense should be necessary to complete the same, and hold title for\u00b0the benefit of McSorley and complainant, in reliance on which agreement Gage- made the conveyance; that as complainant had personally incurred indebtedness in connection with the building on behalf of McSorley, the latter agreed to hold him harmless, and executed an indemnity contract, which, at McSorlev\u2019s request, was not recorded; and that McSorley and appellant entered into an agreement to defraud Gage and those who had furnished labor and material on the building.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-11\" pgmap=\"404(23) 405(84)\">In an amended bill it was set up, among other things, that by reason of the assumption clause in the deed from Gage to Detlor, the latter and appellant became liable to pay all the indebtedness incurred by Gage in connection with the property and the erection of the building. An accounting of all claims is prayed for, and that appellant be decreed to hold the property for the benefit of Gage and such persons as had furnished the material and labor not paid for, and that Gage may have a lien on the premises for all the claims upon which he had become personally liable.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-6\" pgmap=\"405\">By leave of court other parties were allowed to file intervening petitions setting up claims against the property for labor and material furnished for erection of the building, or upon orders given or accepted by appellee Gage. The Circuit Court held that by reason of the assumption clause in the warranty deed from Gage to Detlor, appellant acquired the property charged with liabilities of Gage incurred in connection with the erection of the building:, O and with liability for the claims of intervening petitioners who had furnished labor, material or funds for, or had otherwise contributed to the erection of the building, without reference to whether they were entitled or not, to mechanics\u2019 liens.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b405-12\" pgmap=\"405\">Henry S.

On the other hand it is contended in behalf of appellees that the purpose is not merely to make an exception to the general warranty, but also to create a charge upon'the land in favor of persons having claims of any kind growing out of the erection of the building.</p> <p id=\"b407-7\" pgmap=\"407(51) 408(323)\">Bead in what seems to us its obvious meaning and giving effect to all the language used, the purpose of the clause is to except from the warranty of the deed claims of any and every description existing against the land. These claims may include possessory rights, leasehold interests and the like, not perhaps in the ordinary sense properly described as liens. \u25a0 It is claims against the land only, which the grantee assumes and agrees to pay. He clearly does not assume or agree to pay claims against the grantor which are not in law valid and existing charges upon the land itself. Such claims would not affect the title to the land, and it is the title whiph the grantor warrants. . The evident intention of the clause in controversy is merely to except from the warranty existing claims of any and every description which, like mortgages, liens and taxes, ejusclem generis, are or may become a valid charge against the land itself (see Misch v. Russell, 136 Ill. 22, 28); in other words, which may be legally enforced against it, and from which but for the exception, the grantor might be liable to protect the grantee\u2019s title. In Beardstown v. Virginia, 76 Ill. 34, 40, it is said : \u201c It is not allowable to interpret what has no need of interpretation, and when the words have a definite and precise meaning, to go elsewhere in search of conjecture in order to restrict or extend the meaning. Statutes and contracts should be read and understood according to the natural and most obvious import of the language, without resorting to subtle and forced construction for the purpose of either limiting or extending their operation.\u201d It is the meaning upon the face of the instrument which courts must say was the intention of the parties thereto. The question in the construction of written instruments is, not what was the intention of the parties, but what is the meaning expressed by the words they have used. The intention of the parties is to be ascertained as expressed by the language used and not the intention which may have existed in their minds, but is not expressed by their language.</p> <p id=\"b408-6\" pgmap=\"408\">It is only where the language is obscure or doubtful that resort may be had to oral evidence of surrounding circumstances to ascertain the intention of the parties to the deed. But this can not be had for the purpose of contradicting or varying the language actually employed. Fowler v. Black, 136 Ill. 363, 372.</p> <p id=\"b408-9\" pgmap=\"408(22) 409(125)\">It is urged by appellees\u2019 counsel that the words'\" claims of any and every description \u201d created a lien by fcontract, referring to Sidwell v. Wheaton, 114 Ill. 267. In that case it was held that an assumption by the grantee of payment of two certain notes, created a.n express lien by contract on the land conveyed. But in the case at bar such is not the case. If the language employed had been, subject to existing mortgages, liens, taxes and claims in favor of John M. L. Sexton for a specific sum, and in favor of each of appellees for other definite sums, a lien by express contract might have been created. A charge in the nature of a lien on real property may be created by an express agreement (Pinch v. Anthony 8 Allen (Mass.), 536), but the clause in controversy contains none.</p> <p id=\"b409-6\" pgmap=\"409\">The claims of the appellees which were allowed by the Circuit Court, not being valid and existing charges against the land when the deed in question was executed and delivered, were not included in the reservation made in that instrument, and can not be enforced in this proceeding. The decree in that respect was erroneous. Whether any of these parties are in a situation to establish liens under the statute we are not called upon to consider in this case.</p> <p id=\"b409-10\" pgmap=\"409\">The decree of the Circuit Court must be reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
