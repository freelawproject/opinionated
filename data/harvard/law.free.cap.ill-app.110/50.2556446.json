Appurtenances\u2014Particular Facts Under Which Electric Lights Are.\u2014During the entire period of plaintiffs\u2019 tenancy in defendants\u2019 building their rooms had been lighted by electricity furnished by defendants from an electric light plant owned and operated by the latter. There were no gas connections, so that there was no other means of lighting the premises. Owing to the character of their business, in which it was customary for them to write on blackboards, within the leased premises, quotations of the sale of stock, graip and other merchandise, which are in continual use, it would be impossible for plaintiffs to transact business without the light. Prior to the execution of the lease plaintiffs were informed by the agent of the building that furnishing electric light was an appurtenance to said premises and as such would be included in the lease, and that plaintiffs executed the lease relying on such representations and their right to such light had been repeatedly recognized. Held, that the light is necessary or essential 'to the proper enjoyment of the estate granted, and passed as an appurtenance granted by the terms of the lease.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-11\" pgmap=\"72\">Bill for an Injunction.\u2014Appeal from the Superior Court of Cook County; the Hon.

App. 339.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-10\" pgmap=\"75(51) 76(94)\">When the injury is irreparable, a court of equity will take jurisdiction to enjoin a trespass. Irreparable injury is not the loss of that for which some substitute might be had; it implies the destruction of some right. If the appellees here are entitled to the right which they claim, irreparable injury will result from the proposed action of the appellants which would destroy that right. It has been frequently held that the threatened cutting off of artificial light on the. part of a lessor affords jurisdiction to a court of equity, on the ground that irreparable injury would result if such threat should be carried out. U. S. Electric Lighting Co. v. Metropolitan Club of the City of Washington, 23 Washington Law Reporter, 465; Graves v. Key City Gas Co., 83 Ia. 714; Whiteman v. Fuel-Gas Co., 139 Pa. St. 492.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-5\" pgmap=\"76\">Irreparable injury does not necessarily mean that the injury is beyond the possibility of compensation in damages, nor that it must be very great. The fact that no actual damages can be proved, so that in an action at law the jury could award only nominal damages, often furnishes the very best reason why a court of equity should interfere.

Barling, 149 Ill. 556.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-6\" pgmap=\"76\">A conveyance in general \u2018 terms passes everything belonging to the demise.

Chicago Exhibition Co. v. Illinois State Board of Agriculture, 77 Ill. App. 350.</p> <p id=\"b77-5\" pgmap=\"77(214) 78(227)\">It is complained that the injunction was improperly granted without notice. Ho court, judge or master is authorized to grant an injunction without notice \u201cunless it shall appear from the bill or affidavit accompanying the same, that the rights of the complainant will be unduly prejudiced if the injunction is not issued immediately or without such notice.\u201d (R. S., Chap. 69, Sec. 3.) It is not enough for the bill to state that complainants\u2019 rights will be unduly prejudiced, but facts must appear either in the bill or affidavit accompanying it, from which such conclusion may be drawn. The writ ought not to issue without notice upon the bare possibility of an injury or a mere apprehension not founded upon a substantial basis of fact. Suburban Construction Co. v. Naugle, 70 Ill. App. 384-398; Chi. Tel. Co. v. N. W. Tel. Co., 199 Ill. 324-327. In the case before us the bill states that the defendants\u2019 representatives did more than threaten. They actually notified complainants that the electric light service was about to be withdrawn from the leased premises. The bill sets forth that the furnishing of said electric light is included in said lease as an appurtenance; that without the electric light it would be impossible for complainants to transact their business; that the effect of such withdrawal would be to render the premises entirely untenable for business purposes, cause a loss of customers, greatly depreciate and permanently damage complainants\u2019 reputation and business, and inflict irreparable injury. It further appears from the bill that the rooms occupied by complainants are so situated that they have little or no artificial light, and that there is practically no other means of lighting said premises, except by the electric light heretofore furnished from a plant which is the private property of .and operated by the defendants. This service the latter have not merely threatened, but positively stated they are about to withdraw. These statements, if true, constitute a state of facts from which the conclusion may be drawn that the appellees were about to be unduly prejudiced if appellants were not enjoined from cutting off the light; and from the notice given to the complainants that the service of electric light would be discontinued, the inference may very well be drawn that it might be so discontinued at any moment. Upon the whole, we are of the opinion the issue of the injunction without notice was justified by the averments of the, bill, although a fuller recital of facts tending to show that notice of the application would be prejudicial, might readily have removed any room for controversy.</p> <p id=\"b78-5\" pgmap=\"78(143) 79(116)\">It is further urged that upon the face of the bill appellees have an adequate remedy at law. The contention is that as no express provision was made for electric light service by the terms of the.written lease under which appellees occupy the premises, the right to such service could pass only as an appurtenance of the premises leased; and it is insisted that the bill fails to state facts upon which such implication may be based. The bill shows that appellees nad occupied the premises under \"their lease from May 1, 1902, a period of nearly eight months, receiving meanwhile the benefit of the electric light service without any objection on the part of defendants. It is alleged that prior to the execution of the lease appellees were informed by one of the appellants who was acting as agei\\t of the building that the electric light service would be included as appurtenant to the lease. The fact that after the execution of the lease this service continued to be furnished without objection for so long a time tends to show that appellees themselves, regarded and treated it as appurtenant to the lease. The right to the light in controversy appears, under the circumstances as stated in the bill, to be \u201cnecessary or essential to the proper enjoyment of the estate granted.\u201d Jarvis v. Seele Milling Co., 173 Ill. 192-195. If so, it apparently passed as an \u201cappurtenance\u201d granted by the terms of the lease. Finding no error the order of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
