If he has only committed a breach of contract, he is liable to those only with whom he contracts; but if he has also committed a breach of duty, he is not protected by setting up a contract in respect of the same matter with another person.\u201d Smith on Contracts, Amer. Ed., 10. Heaven v. Pender. 11 Q. B. D. 506; 1 Shearman and Redfield on Negligence, Sec. 116; Coupe v. Platt, 172 Mass. 458.</p> <p id=\"b250-5\" pgmap=\"250\">Here appellant rented an apartment to be used as a dwelling by the lessee and his family. He covenanted to furnish steam to heat said apartment when necessary. With the slightest care he could foresee that if he was negligent in the performance of his covenant, plaintiff\u2019s^ intestate, the infant son of his tenant, and \u00e1 member of his family, would be exposed to risk and danger of injury; and we are of opinion, though the question is not free from difficulty, that appellee owed to plaintiff\u2019s intestate the duty to use ordinary care and diligence to avoid injuring him, and to that end to use reasonable care and diligence to furnish steam to heat said apartment when necessary. We find no material error in the instructions given for appellee. The court, of its own motion, instructed the jury as follows:</p> <p id=\"b250-6\" pgmap=\"250\">\u201c 14. Unless the jury believe and can say from the evidence that the alleged failure of the defendant to supply ste\u00e1m heat, if there was such failure, has something to do with the death of the child (meaning plaintiff\u2019s intestate), by way of bringing about such death, you should find the defendant not guilty.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b250-7\" pgmap=\"250\">And it is insisted that the words \u201c believe and can say \u201d impose upon appellant a burden of proof which was improper. In this contention we can not agree. The instruction has no greater or different force or effect with the words \u201ccan say\u201d in, than with them out of it.</p> <p id=\"b250-8\" pgmap=\"250(83) 251(23)\">Appellant also insists that the verdict is against the evidence. To entitle plaintiff to a verdict he was bound to show, both that the failure to furnish steam on the night of February 19th constituted and was negligence on the part of appellee, and that such negligence was a proximate cause of the death of his intestate. The jury returned not only the general verdict of not guilty but the following special finding: \u201c What was the proximate cause of the child\u2019s death ? Answer: Asthma and heart trouble.\u201d We can not say that either the special or the general verdict was against the evidence.</p> <p id=\"b251-4\" pgmap=\"251\">Mo \"complaint is made that steam was not furnished whenever necessary up to a late hour of February 19th. In the morning of that day the little boy had an attack of acute endocarditis. He had suffered from heart disease for some time and the family physician testified in substance that chronic endocarditis developed into acute endocarditis. He was attended by a physician in the morning, at noon,\" in the afternoon, at nine o\u2019clock in the evening, and the physician was again called at two o\u2019clock in the morning of February 20th and remained until six .o\u2019clock, when the boy died. The evidence showed that such attacks are exceedingly grave and in a majority of cases result in death. The evidence for appellant tended to show that the patient in such cases should be kept in a warm room, and that for appellee, that he should be kept in a cool room.</p> <p id=\"b251-5\" pgmap=\"251\">As bearing upon the question whether the/ failure to furnish steam through the night of February 19th constituted and was negligence on the part of appellee, it was shown that the father of the sick boy at ten o\u2019clock in the evening notified the janitor of the building that the boy was very sick; that it was necessary that the room in which he was, be kept warm all night, and that he requested the janitor to keep steam up through the night. It had been customary to bank the fires at ten o\u2019clock, and for all that appears the fires then banked furnished all the steam that was necessary after that hour under ordinary circumstances. The janitor informed the boy\u2019s father that his orders were to bank the fires at ten o\u2019clock and he had no authority to grant his request. Appellant lived about a mile from the building and no attempt to communicate with him that night was made-by either the janitor or the boy\u2019s father.</p> <p id=\"b251-6\" pgmap=\"251(41) 252(24)\">Under the evidence, a finding by the jury that appellee was not guilty of negligence, or that his negligence, if he was negligent, was not a proximate cause of the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate, would not be against the evidence, and either finding must result in a verdict for defendant. We find no substantial error in the record and the judgment will therefore be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b252-5\" pgmap=\"252\">Mr. Justice Stein took no part in the decision of this case.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
