The incorporators principally interested were Judson McFell and William J. McWade. The company carried on its business from the time of its creation until the expiration of its charter in December, 1900. In April, 1900, McWade had become the owner of McFell\u2019s interest in the company and its business. The latter, however, continued in the company\u2019s service as a salaried employe. The business was carried on as before under the same name after the expiration of the charter in December, 1900, and in April following an application for a license to form a new corporation under the - name \u201c McFell Electric Company,\u201d appellee herein, was forwarded to the secretary of state. The license was duly issued and a certificate of incorporation was recorded May 24, 1901. The application for said license was signed and acknowledged April 16, 1901, by Judson McFell as one of the incorporators, but shortly after signing the application said McFell left his employment with the said company and began business for himself in the same line of work. Within a few days thereafter, May 16,1901, he made application for a license to form a corporation under the name 41 McFell Electric and Telephone Company,\u201d and a certificate of incorporation of such company, appellant herein, was recorded June 16,1901. Thereupon McFell proceeded to carry on business in the name of the new company, in rivalry and competition with appellee.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-5\" pgmap=\"205\">Appellee\u2019s business had been conducted for about six years preceding the expiration of the original charter and is still conducted in the Marquette Building, Chicago. When appellant McFell quit his former employment apd obtained a charter for the appellant corporation, a place of business for the latter was secured in the same building upon the floor below that occupied by appellee, access to which was had by the same stairway. The names of the two corporations appeared thereafter in close relation upon the same bulletin board.

A., 194 Ill. 194.</p> <opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b207-4\" pgmap=\"207\">Mr. Presiding Justice Freeman</author> <p id=\"A1J\" pgmap=\"207\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b207-5\" pgmap=\"207(335) 208(81)\">Appellants insist that the court erred in finding the equities with appellee and granting it the relief prayed for in the original bill. The contention seems to be that upon the expiration of the charter of the original corporation having substantially the same name as that adopted byappellee, the right to use the name reverted to Judson McFell, who was one of its original incorporators, and who had previously sold out to McWade, another of its incorporators, all his stock in the company and all interest in its business. The transfer of McFelPs stock to McWade occurred in March, 1900. When, with McFelPs consent, he being one of the incorporators and stockholders, the original company was created with the name \u201cThe McFell Electric Company,\u201d there can be no doubt that he conferred on such corporation the right to use his name in that manner; and when he sold out his stock in the company and his interest in its business to McWade for a valuable consideration, as he did, he could not afterward resume the use even of his own name in.carrying on the same business during the lifetime of the corporation, in such a way as to mislead the public. By the sale and transfer of his stock in the company for a valuable and adequate consideration he equitably estopped himself from questioning its right to the use of its corporate name. See Frazer v. Frazer Lubricator Co., 121 Ill. 147-157. Under the statute, moreover, the said corporation had the exclusive privilege of becoming re-incorporated under the same name within thirty days from and after the expiration of its original-charter. (R. S., Chap. 32, Sec. 28\u00bd.) It did not avail itself of this right, but its stockholders did continue to carry on the business with McFelPs consent in the same name, he remaining in their employment. Later he joined with two of the stockholders in making application for a license to enable them to obtain a new charter under substantially the same name, the only difference being an omission of the article \u201cthe\u201d and an abbreviation of the word \u201ccompany.\u201d He appears thus to have recognized the existence of an equitable right in the stockholders of the old company to continue to do business in, and for that purpose to re-incorporate under, the old name, for the use of which he had received a valuable consideration in the purchase price paid for his stock and his interest in the business.</p> <p id=\"b208-4\" pgmap=\"208\">It is said, however, that before the application for the new license was forwarded to the secretary of state he revoked bis consent. As to that the testimony is conflicting. The alleged revocation is by no 'means established by the evidence. McFell himself does not even now seek to interfere with the use by appellee of its corporate name. .</p> <p id=\"b208-5\" pgmap=\"208(229) 209(212)\">It appears that after signing and acknowledging the application for a license to re-incorporate appellee\u2019s business under substantially the old name, McFell concluded to give up his salaried position in its service, and go into business for himself. Reaching this conclusion he promptly took steps to incorporate under the name which he has selected for the appellant corporation. Obtaining its charter, the name indicating that its business was the same as appellee\u2019s, it was located in the same building, in close proximity to the place where appellee\u2019s business had been conducted for more than six years. That the conditions were such as to deceive the public and lead persons to suppose they were dealing with appellee when in fact they were employing appellant, is, we think, apparent. The name of the new company was placed on the bulletin-board of the building immediately above that of appellee, so as to readily give the impression that they were one and the same company. The circumstances justify the inference that it was for' some such purpose the location was selected. This is not open and honest competition. It has every appearance of an attempt to mislead the public and-to obtain by deception the benefit of the patronage and clientage enjoyed by appellee. Courts of equity give relief against such violations of the rules of honesty and fair dealing. See Merchants\u2019 Detective Ass\u2019n v. Detective Mercantile Agency, 25 Ill. App. 250, 259. If appellants\u2019 new business was established and conducted with the fraudulent and wrongful intention of attracting to themselves the custom intended for appellee, this is clearly a fraud upon the rights of the latter. Allegretti v. Chocolate Cream Co., 177 Ill. 129-133. In Imperial Mfg. Co. v. Schwartz, 105 Ill. App. 525-529, we said: \u201cThe public are entitled to protection from being misled to trade with parties not known to them, under the impression that they are doing business with an established firm or person with whom they have been accustomed to deal.\u201d What is said in Internat\u2019l Com. Y. W. C. A. v. Y. W. C. A., 194 Ill. on page 200, is applicable in this case; namely,that though there may be no property in a name, the principle in these cases is that it is a fraud on a person who has an established trade and carries it on under a given name, that another person should assume the same name with a slight alteration, so as to induce people to deal with him in the belief that they are dealing with those who have given a reputation to the name in the particular line of business.</p> <p id=\"b209-5\" pgmap=\"209\">The judgment of the Superior Court must be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
