It is apparently not denied that appellee was entitled to recover something. The controversy is as to the amount to which he was entitled. The questions of. fact were submitted to the jury. We have considered the evidence, but after such examination are not disposed to interfere with the finding, and do not deem it necessary to review the evidence in detail.</p> <p id=\"b518-9\" pgmap=\"518(170) 519(170)\">It is, however, insisted that the jury were erroneously instructed, and our attention is called to the first instruction given in behalf- of appellant, which is objected to on the alleged ground that it called the attention of the jury particularly to the expert evidence, ignoring other evidence in the case. We do not think it reasonably open to that objection. The instruction tells the jury that the law implies a promise from appellant'to pay appellee for his services \u201c what the jury may find from the evidence the same are reasonably worth,\u201d and that in estimating the reasonable worth, they are to consider and weigh any testimony \u201c of attorneys in good standing as to what may be the usual compensation for such services\u201d shown by the evidence to have been rendered. The jury are expressly told by the instruction' that they \u201c may find from the evidence \u201d and determine the reasonable worth of the services. Thev were moreover instructed, at the instance of appellant, that they were \u201c to determine the weight to be given to the evidence \u201d of the witnesses; to take into consideration the ^opportunities of the several witnesses for knowing the things about -which they testify, the probability or improbability of the truth of their statements \u201c in view of all the other evidence; \u201d that they are to consider ;i all the other surrounding circumstances appearing on the trial; \u201d that they are not bound to believe anything to be a fact, provided they \u201c believe from all the evidence \u201d that it is not; that appellee must \u201c prove his case by a preponderance of the evidence; \u201d and that they are to \u201c determine from the evidence \u201d whether or not appellee is indebted to appellant in any sum exceeding the value of appellee\u2019s services, and if so, that the latter can not recover. There is, we think, no reason to conclude that the jury were in any way misled by the instruction complained of.</p> <p id=\"b519-4\" pgmap=\"519(232) 520(165)\">We are referred to Scott v. The People, 141 Ill. 195-208, as authority for holding the instruction to be erroneous. In that case the court says that the instruction, the refusal of which is there discussed, \u201c directed the attention of the jury exclusively to the testimony of the expert witnesses; \u201d that it also stated it was \u201c necessary for the people to prove to the satisfaction of the jury,\u201d etc., that it told the jury they were at liberty to take into consideration the testimony of the medical experts in connection with all the other facts and circumstances detailed on the trial, and if after considering all of such testimony they entertained any reasonable doubt whether there was ever any attempt to commit an abortion, it would be their duty to find the defendant not guilt}?. The Supreme Court say that the \u201c instruction was calculated to make the impression upon the minds of the jury that they were only to consider the expert testimony in connection with such facts,\u201d referring to certain items of defendant\u2019s proof, \u201c and not in connection with all the evidence; that \u201c it Avas the duty of the jury to consider all the evidence; \u201d and it was held that the defendant could not have been injured by the refusal of the instruction, \u201c because the jury were told in other instructions to carefully consider all of the testimony introduced, which included as well that of the experts as of the other witnesses.\u201d So in the case at bar, the jury were repeatedly told in other instructions, as well as in the one complained of, to consider all the evidence, and not exclusively the testimony of the expert witnesses. The jury are told to find from the evidence \u201c what the services of appellee are reasonably worth,\u201d and that in estimating the 'reasonable worth, they are to consider and weigh any testimony of attorneys in good standing, as to one single point\u2014not the value of appellee\u2019s services, but \u201c what may be the usual compensation for such services\u201d\u2014a point as to which there was,' so far as we are advised, no other testimony except that of the experts. We do not regard the instruction as open to the objection urged. See Guetig v. State, 66 Ind. 107; Brooks v. Jenkins, 3 McLean, 447,</p> <p id=\"b520-5\" pgmap=\"520(233) 521(13)\">It is objected that the hypothetical questions to the expert witnesses called for their opinion as to what was \u201c a usual, customary and reasonable compensation\u201d for the services supposed to have been rendered upon the hypothesis as stated, and that it was error to include the word \u201c reasonable \u201d in the question. It has been said that evidence which establishes the amount allowed as a usual and customary fee must be held to be a reasonable fee. Nathan v. Brand, 167 Ill. 607-610. In the case before us the inquiry was directed apparently to what is usual and customary, and hence, in the opinion of the witnesses, reasonable. In L., N. A. &amp; C. Ry. Co. v. Wallace, 136 Ill. 87-93, it is held that lawyers may be asked as experts their opinions as to what is fair and reasonable compensation for services rendered by their professional brethren. The objection is\u2019 not, we think, well taken, and it is moreover raised here for the first time, not having been one of those urged to the question upon the trial. It is true that in Reynolds v. McMillan, 63 Ill. 46, it was said that in that case the inquiry should have been directed to what was a customary charge for such legal services, and not what was reasonable, just and proper. But that lawyers may be asked their opinions as to the value of legal services is well established.</p> <p id=\"b521-4\" pgmap=\"521\">We have considered the evidence relating to other points raised by appellant\u2019s counsel, but it must suffice to say that we find no error in the record justifying interference with the judgment and it must be affirmed.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b521-5\" pgmap=\"521\">Mr. Justice Stein,</author> <p id=\"AvpM\" pgmap=\"521\">dissenting.</p> <p id=\"b521-6\" pgmap=\"521\">The entire instruction alluded to in the above opinion is as follows:</p> <p id=\"b521-7\" pgmap=\"521\">\u201cIf the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff performed services as attorney at defendant\u2019s request, for which he has not been paid, and that no price was agreed upon, then the law will imply a promise from defendant to pay plaintiff for such services, what the jury may find, from the evidence, the same are reasonably worth.</p> <p id=\"b521-8\" pgmap=\"521\">And in estimating the reasonable worth of such services, the jury are to consider and weigh any testimony, admitted in evidence, of attorneys of good standing, as to what may be the usual compensation for such services, as may be shown by the evidence to have been rendered.</p> <p id=\"b521-9\" pgmap=\"521\">And the jury may also consider any facts shown in the evidence, as to the amount of labor and time properly expended by plaintiff in such services and the benefit which defendant may have derived from them; the amount involved in the controversy in which such services were rendered; the nature of the controversy, as to whether difficult or doubtful questions were involved; the ability and experience of plaintiff; and the result of the controversy.</p> <p id=\"b521-10\" pgmap=\"521\">From any sum which the jury may find from the evidence that the defendant owes the plaintiff for services, if anything, the jury are to deduct $177.12 for money of the defendant in the hands of the plaintiff on the land account.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b521-11\" pgmap=\"521(91) 522(96)\">This instruction is objectionable and should not have been given because its second sentence singles out and gives undue prominence to the testimony of the attorneys upon the question of value. Its language is mandatory and has a strong tendency to divert the attention of the jury from the other proof upon the subject, some of which tends to show that appellee himself had put a considerably lower valuation upon his services than that testified to by the experts. Scott v. People, 141 Ill. 195, 208; Head v. Hargrave, 105 U. S. 45. In the Scott case, supra, the jury were to be told that they \u201c were at liberty to take into consideration the testimony of the medical experts,\u201d (here they were told that they \u201c are to consider,\u201d) and they were also to be told to consider such testimony \u201cin connection with all the other facts and circumstances \u201d in proof (which here they were not)'; and yet the Supreme Court held the instruction to be \u201cclearly erroneous\u201dbecause it \u201cdirected the attention of the jury exclusively to the testimony of the expert witnesses.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b522-4\" pgmap=\"522\">(The italics are the writer\u2019s.)</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
