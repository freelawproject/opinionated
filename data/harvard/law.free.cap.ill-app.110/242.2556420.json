Appellee, a boy fourteen years of age, received the injuries complained of from contact with an electrified lead cable containing an insulating preparation covering a live copper wire. The place where the accident occurred was under a wooden sidewalk on Ogden avenue, Chicago. The cable had been located there for a period of from eight to twelve years, and .was maintained by virtue of an ordinance of the city which conferred upon appellant the right to maintain wires and cables underneath streets and sidewalks. At the point referred to, the sidewalk was about five feet above the level of the adjacent lot. On the street-side, the walk extended to the curbstone, and access to the wire could be had only from the lot adjoining, which was vacant. There was a large bill-board rising some fifteen or twenty feet above the walk, located at or near the inner or lot side of the walk and extending the width of the lot. The bottom of this bill-board was sufficiently far from the sidewalk to allow persons to crawl under it and drop into the lot. One standing in the lot could readily look under the sidewalk, which was, it is said, about nine feet wide.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-4\" pgmap=\"266\">The cable containing the wire ran along in immediate proximity to the curbstone, and was attached to the stringers of the sidewalk near the top of the vacant space beneath. The insulation intended to prevent contact with the wire was inside the lead cable and between the latter and the electrified wire. The accident occurred on a rainy day, when, by reason of the moisture, there is liability that the wire, if from any cause the insulation is worn off, may become \u201c grounded,\u201d that is, connected with the earth, thus establishing a ground circuit. This seems to have been the condition existing at the time and place where the. accident occurred. In some way the lead cable and insulating material had been penetrated and the copper wire exposed, so that, whether by reason of the moisture or some other cause, electricity from the wire was communicated to the lead cable, which, being a conductor, became itself electrified. This condition existed for about a hundred yards along the cable, and where the latter came in contact with wood, smoke and fire were likely to be produced.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AYs\" pgmap=\"266(151) 267(74)\">Appellee, a boy of fourteen years of age, passing along on the opposite side of the street with his mother, saw smoke coming up from beneath the sidewalk and people gathering. Leaving his mother he joined the increasing crowd, some of whom were endeavoring to extinguish the fire. Appellee, with several other boys, crawled underneath the bill-board into the vacant lot. The point at which there was most smoke and fire was under the walk in front of a barber shop adjoining. Two or three of the boys walked under the sidewalk and looked through the partition separating the space under the walk in front of the barber shop from that in front of the vacant lot. In doing this appellee claims to have slipped, and to save himself from falling, threw up his hand, catching hold of the cable, which, being highly electrified, burned his hand severely, causing the injuries complained of. There was no break or abrasion in the cable at the point where he grasped it, and nothing apparently visible there to indicate that it was itself charged, and that contact with it would be dangerous. In fact it would probably have been safe to handle except for the ground circuit, which had made it a dangerous conductor of electric fluid instead of a protecting cover to the copper wire within.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-4\" pgmap=\"267\">It appears that the day before the accident there had been a grounding of the current at or near this point, and appellant had sent men to fix it, which they did, reporting everything all right. On the day in question, notice that the cable was again grounded reached appellant late in the afternoon and within two hours thereafter it is said that men were on the scene to correct the trouble. They found a break in the lead, which was the cause of the difficulty, resulting in the injury complained of. The defect repaired, the rest of the cable in front of the vacant lot was again, it is said, in good condition.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b267-5\" pgmap=\"267\">F.

The basis of the contention is that the space underneath the sidewalk ivas private property of the city, not open to use or occupation by the public. There is evidence tending to show that the vacant lot in front of which the accident occurred was not infrequently used as a playground by boys of the neighborhood, that some of these were frequently in the habit of going under the sidewalk in the course of their play after a ball or for other reasons, and that there was no fence at the rear of the lot. It is doubtless true that the space underneath the sidewalk was not intended for ordinary public use, nevertheless the place was left open and accessible from the private property adjoining, without barrier or other notice to prevent boys at play, or others, from going under for shelter perchance, for a stray ball, or from mere curiosity, where, as in this instance, the presence of smoke or lire invited investigation as to its cause and extent. If appellant was under no obligation or duty to use ordinary care and skill toward appellee then it is not liable to him for the want of it. Gibson v. Leonard, 143 Ill. 182, 189. As it is said in that case, \u201cthe owner of land and buildings assumes np duty to one who is on his premises by permission only, and as a mere licensee, except that he will refrain from willful or affirmative acts which are injurious.\u201d But appellant was not the owner of the premises where appellee was injured. It, too, was a mere licensee, and its license did not authorize it to make the premises dangerous to other licensees having no knowledge or reason to expect the existence of such danger, by locating its wires in ways not authorized by city ordinances. Appellant was not given, by the ordinance, any exclusive right to use the space under sidewalks for its lines of wire any more than \u201cthrough, upon, over and under the streets, avenues, alle}7s,\u201d etc., as provided by the ordinance. The general rule is that the occupant is responsible for injuries inflicted upon another by reason of the neglect or failure to keep the premises, or at least the portion so occupied by him, in repair. West Chicago Masonic Ass\u2019n v. Cohn, 192 Ill. 210, 218. Appellee was not a licensee of appellant nor a trespasser upon its premises. The license given by the city ordinance gave appellant the right to maintain and operate its wires under the sidewalk, not, however, in such a manner as to exclude others therefrom or make it dangerous for those lawfully going there. The wire in this case w7as maintained upon public property and it was the duty of appellant to take reasonable precautions against injuring persons lawfully there, and the duty extends to all who have the right of any kind to come upon the place to which the wires are attached. Keasby on Electric Wires, p. 274. In this case the danger was concealed. There was nothing in the appearance of the cable to indicate to one not an expert that it was itself charged with the electric current, which it was intended to insulate. The facts are very different from those in Sullivan v. Boston &amp; A. R. Co., 31 N. E. Rep. 128, where the defendant was the owner of the premises and \u201chad a right to arrange and use its property in any lawful manner,\u201d and owed the deceased \u201c no duty with respect to it, except to refrain from setting a trap for him and from doing him intentional or wanton harm.\u201d In the case before us appellant knew that the current was liable to be grounded at this particular place, for it had occurred before. It knew, or ought to have known, that the place was easily accessible, and liable to be visited by persons having no knowledge that an electric cable was there. It knew, or ought to have known, that when the current was \u201cgrounded,\u201d contact with the cable was dangerous, and that such danger might not be apparent to ordinary observation. The question of liability for injury by electricity is not dependent solely upon the relation of the parties. Keasby on Electric Wires, Sec. 237-251. Our attention has not been called to any cases which hold that under such conditions the fact that the person injured was only a licensee, exempted another licensee from liability where liability for negligence would otherwise exist. The question of negligence was for the jury. See Griffin v. United Electric Light Company, 164 Mass. 492.</p> <p id=\"b271-4\" pgmap=\"271\">It is claimed that the trial court\"erred in refusing certain instructions, one of which stated that a child of seven years of age may be guilty of contributory negligence, and that if the plaintiff was not exercising such care as could be reasonably expected from a child of his age and intelligence, and such lack of care contributed to the injury, the verdict should be for the defendant; citing City of Pekin v. McMahon, 154 Ill. 141-154. All that was proper in the instruction was given in another instruction at appellant\u2019s instance, and there was no error in refusing the one referred to.</p> <p id=\"b271-5\" pgmap=\"271(106) 272(32)\">It is not seriously urged that appellant was guilty of no negligence in leaving the cable exposed as it was under the conditions existing, but it is said that the verdict for \u00a75,000 was so excessive as to indicate passion and prejudice in the jury. The court required a remittitur reducing the amount to \u00a73,500. We can not regard the view of the jury as to the proper amount to be awarded for damages in this case as indicative of any improper feeling. There is room for a legitimate difference of opinion under the evidence. \"We are better satisfied with the amount of the judgment as entered than we might have been with the larger sum, but are unable to find any sound reason for reversing the judgment on account of the view taken by the jury.</p> <p id=\"b272-5\" pgmap=\"272\">Other points are raised which in view of what ive have said need not be specifically discussed.' Finding no error in the judgment, it must be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
