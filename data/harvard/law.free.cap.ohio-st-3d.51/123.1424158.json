J. 534. \u201cNystagmus\u201d has been defined as a \u201crhythmic to-and-fro oscillation of the eyes[,]\u201d or as an involuntary jerking of the eyeball. Walsh, Neuro-Ophthalmology: Clinical Signs and Symptoms (1978) 239; The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy (15 Ed. 1987) 1359; Dorland\u2019s Illustrated Medical Dictionary (26 Ed. 1981) 910. \u201cHorizontal gaze nystagmus\u201d refers to a jerking of the eyes as they gaze, or look, to one side. See Erwin, <em>supra, </em>at 8-51. It has been shown that there is a correlation between blood-alcohol concentration (\u201cBAC\u201d) and nystagmus. See Goding &amp; Dobie, <em>supra; </em>Belton, <em>supra; </em>Wilkinson, Kime &amp; Purnell, Alcohol and Human Eye Movement (1974), 97 Brain 785; Development and Field Test of Psychophysical Tests for DWI Arrest (Mar. 1981), U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; Good &amp; Augsburger, Use of Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus as a Part of Roadside Sobriety Testing (1986), 63 Am. J. Optometry &amp; Physiological Optics 467.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">According to a test manual devised by the United States Department of Transportation for use by law enforcement agencies, the HGN test is the single most accurate field test to use in determining whether a person is alcohol impaired. U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Safety Administration, Improved Sobriety Testing (1984) 4.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although many people will have some nystagmus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>as their eyes move to an extreme side, as people become intoxicated, the jerking becomes not only more frequent and pronounced but it also occurs at an earlier angle. See Erwin, <em>supra, </em>at 8-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The HGN test is relatively easy to administer. The driver taking the HGN test usually is asked to focus on a \u201cstimulus\u201d (such as a pen) held in an officer\u2019s hand at the driver\u2019s eye level approximately six to eight inches away. The officer will then move the stimulus gradually out of the driver\u2019s field of vision toward the driver\u2019s ear. Because it has been shown that the onset of the angle of nystagmus at less than forty-five degrees indicates the presence of alcohol, the officer watches each eye to determine whether nystagmus occurs at an angle less than forty-five degrees. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986), 149 Ariz. 269, 271, 718 P. 2d 171, 173; Development and Field Test of Psychophysical Tests for DWI Arrests, <em>supra. </em>Each eye is tested separately, although the suspect performs the HGN test binocularly. See Good &amp; Augsburger, <em>supra, </em>at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">According to the test manual devised by the United States Department of Transportation, an officer administering the HGN test observes the driver\u2019s eyes to detect the following three signs of intoxication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">\u201c(1) The jerking of the eyes occurs much sooner. That is, the more intoxicated a person becomes, the less that he has to move his eyes to the side in order for the jerking to occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">\u201c(2) If you have a suspect move his eyes as far to the side as possible, you can estimate in a general way the extent of intoxication. The greater the alcohol impairment, the more distinct the nystagmus will be in the extreme gaze position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">\u201c(3) If the suspect is intoxicated, he cannot follow a slowly moving object smoothly with his eyes.\u201d Improved Sobriety Testing, <em>supra, </em>at 3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">A person may receive up to six points on the HGN test. Specifically, each eye is tested to determine (1) whether the angle of onset of nystagmus is less than forty-five degrees; (2) whether nystagmus, when the eye is moved as far as possible to one extreme, is moderate or distinct; and (3) whether the eye can follow a moving object smoothly. A score of four or more points indicates a BAC level above .10 percent. Using these criteria, an officer should be able to correctly determine seventy-seven percent of the time whether a person taking the test is under the influence of alcohol or sober. When the HGN test is used in conjunction with the walk-and-tum field sobriety test, an officer\u2019s ability to detect whether a driver is under the influence of alcohol is improved. See Improved Sobriety Testing, <em>supra, </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-13\">In the instant case, appellee had objected to Trooper Click\u2019s testimony regarding the HGN test. The trial court overruled this objection, stating that the test had been accepted by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-14\">The court of appeals found that admission of Trooper Click\u2019s testimony about the HGN test was improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>because \u201cevidence regarding the scientific principles underlying and establishing the validity of the HGN test are [sic] a prerequisite to its admission. Since the prosecution * * * did not present expert testimony to establish the validity of the HGN test and the scientific principles underlying it, the trial court erred in allowing it into evidence. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">This court has not previously addressed this issue. However, the appellant argues that a properly trained law enforcement officer is competent to testify as to a person\u2019s performance of the HGN test without expert testimony to establish the scientific foundation of the test. A review of courts of appeals decisions in this state on this issue establishes that a majority of appellate courts has admitted testimony by law enforcement officers concerning this test. The appellate courts generally have held that the HGN test is similar to other field sobriety tests and is admissible without expert testimony. See, <em>e.g., State </em>v. <em>Nagel, supra; State </em>v. <em>Welday </em>(Sept. 27, 1989), Medina App. No. 1793, unreported; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brug, supra; State </em>v. <em>Earley, supra; State </em>v. <em>Hintz, supra; State </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(Apr. 29, 1986), Seneca App. No. 13-84-21, unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">There is a split of opinion in other states concerning this issue. Some jurisdictions have held that the HGN test is a scientific test, which requires expert testimony regarding the test\u2019s scientific reliability and acceptance. See, <em>e.g., State </em>v. <em>Barker </em>(W. Va. 1988), 366 S.E. 2d 642; State v. Reed (1987), 83 Ore. App. 451, 732 P. 2d 66; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(Pa. Super. 1987), 532 A. 2d 1186; <em>State </em>v. <em>Borchardt </em>(1986), 224 Neb. 47, 395 N.W. 2d 551. Other jurisdictions have held that evidence of a HGN test is admissible so long as a proper foundation is laid as to the techniques used and the officer\u2019s ability to use it. See, <em>e.g., State </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra. </em>See, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(Mont. 1988), 762 P. 2d 853. In a recent Supreme Court of Iowa decision, the court, relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Nagel, supra, </em>held that some of the uncertainty surrounding the HGN test might stem from its \u201cpretentiously scientific name.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>(Iowa 1990), 451 N.W. 2d 154, 156. The court held that \u201c* * * testimony by a properly trained police officer with respect to the administration and results of the horizontal gaze nystagmus test is admissible without need for further scientific evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 158. See, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Edman </em>(Iowa 1990), 452 N.W. 2d 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>the Supreme Court of Arizona held that \u201c* * * in the hands of a trained officer the [HGN] test is reasonably trustworthy and may be used to help establish probable cause to arrest. <em>***\u201d Id. at </em>276, 718 P. 2d at 178. It also held, after reviewing testimony given at an evidentiary hearing as well as pertinent literature on the subject, that the HGN test is reliable and that \u201c* * * jjQjyf occurs jn conjunction with alcohol consumption; * * * its onset and distinctness are correlated to BAC; * * * and officers can be trained to observe these phenomena sufficiently to estimate accurately whether BAC is above or below .10 percent. We therefore hold that, with proper foundation as to the techniques used and the officer\u2019s ability to use it * * *, testimony of defendant\u2019s nystagmus is admissible on the issue of a defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level as would be other field sobriety test results on the question of the accuracy of the chemical analysis.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id. at 279, 718 P. 2d at 181. \u201c* * * It is admissible * * * also, as evidence that the driver is \u2018under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>influence.\u2019 * * *\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280, 718 P. 2d at 182.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">We find that the HGN test has been shown to be a reliable indicator of BAC levels. Accordingly, results of this test are admissible so long as the proper foundation has been shown both as to the officer\u2019s training and ability to administer the test and as to the actual technique used by the officer in administering the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In this case the evidence shows that such a foundation was established. Trooper Click testified that he had received five days of training regarding the HGN test and described the methods he used in testing and evaluating appellee\u2019s performance on the HGN test. His testimony concerning what he looked for when administering the test corresponds to the testing methods devised by the United States Department of Transportation. Trooper Click testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">\u201cThe horizontal gaze nystagmus and the lateral horizontal gaze nystagmus is <em>[sic] </em>used to refer to a test in which a person\u2019s eyes are observed following stimulus, either a penlight, flashlight, ballpoint pen, any type of object, even a finger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">\u201cIn this test, a person is asked to hold their head steady. They\u2019re asked to watch an object, which is held approximately six to eight inches in front of them. I personally always use a ballpoint pen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">\u201cThe pen is held up in front of them. They are asked to watch the object, follow the object as it moves in a horizontal fashion without moving their head, only moving their eyes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\"><em>il </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">\u201cWe were trained to watch for three characteristics when giving this test. The three things we\u2019re looking for is <em>[sic] </em>known as distinct nystagmus prior to 45 degrees. That is the approximate point of 45 degrees where you begin to see a jerky motion, a side-to-side motion of a person\u2019s eye.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-12\">\u201cWe\u2019re also trained to look for distinct nystagmus at maximum deviation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-13\">U* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-14\">\u201cWhat that means is, the point where a person can look farthest to the side, moving their eyes only, not their head. That is considered maximum deviation, as far from the middle as a person can look.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-15\">\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a distinct nystagmus or a distinct jerky motion of the eye at that point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-16\"><em>U* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-17\">\u201cWe have been instructed and trained * * * that a person who has consumed alcohol will exhibit these signs, as well as a lack of what we call smooth pursuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-18\">\u00cd\u00cd* <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-19\">\u201cThe smooth pursuit is the ability of the eye to follow an object in a smooth, fluid motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-20\">\u201cWe have been instructed, and I have observed, persons who have consumed alcohol, instead of following the object in a smooth, fluid motion, their eyes move like they\u2019re clicking along, just at intervals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-21\">When asked specifically about appellee\u2019s performance on the HGN test, Trooper Click testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-22\">\u201cMr. Bresson was sitting in the front seat of the patrol car with me. He was not handcuffed. I held the ball<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>point pen. * * * I held it up in front of Mr. Bresson, asked him if he could see the very end of it. I asked him to follow the pen in a horizontal fashion, side to side, without moving his head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">\n<em>He He</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">\u201cOf the six points we were looking for, Mr. Bresson exhibited all six points: The lack of smooth pursuit, the distinct nystagmus prior to 45 degrees, and distinct nystagmus at maximum deviation.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">The trial court has broad discretion in admitting evidence based on scientific processes. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Traficant </em>(N.D. Ohio 1983), 566 F. Supp. 1046. Its ruling on admission or exclusion of evidence will not be overturned absent a showing of an abuse of discretion. \u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. * * *\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 151, 157, 16 O.O. 3d 169, 173, 404 N.E. 2d 144, 149. We cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing Trooper Click to testify as to the HGN test. We hold that the HGN test has been shown to be a reliable test, especially when used in conjunction with other field sobriety tests and an officer\u2019s observations of a driver\u2019s physical characteristics, in determining whether a person is under the influence of alcohol. The HGN test cannot be compared to other scientific tests, such as a polygraph examination, since no special equipment is required in its administration. Thus the only requirement prior to admission is the officer\u2019s knowledge of the test, his training, and his ability to interpret his observations. The admission of the results of the HGN test is no different from any other field sobriety test, such as finger-to-nose, walk-and-turn, or one-leg stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">Although not an issue in the instant case, we hasten to add that although results on an HGN test may be admissible at trial by a properly trained officer, such an officer may not testify as to what he or she believes a driver\u2019s actual or specific BAC level would be, based solely on the HGN test results. \u201c* * * Such a use of HGN test results would raise a number of due process problems different from those associated with the chemical testing of bodily fluids. The arresting officer\u2019s \u2018reading\u2019 of the HGN test cannot be verified or duplicated by an independent party. * * * The test\u2019s recognized margin of error provides problems as to criminal convictions which require proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The circumstances under which the test is administered at roadside may affect the reliability of the test results. Nystagmus may be caused by conditions other than alcohol intoxication. And finally, the far more accurate chemical testing devices are readily available.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at 279, 718 P. 2d at 181. See, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Dakuras </em>(1988), 172 Ill. App. 3d 865, 527 N.E. 2d 163; <em>State, ex rel. McDougall, </em>v. <em>Ricke </em>(1989), 161 Ariz. 462, 778 P. 2d 1358; <em>State </em>v. <em>Barker, supra, </em>at 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Accordingly, a properly qualified officer may testify at trial regarding a driver\u2019s performance on the HGN test as to the issues of probable cause to arrest and whether the driver was operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. See R.C. 4511.19 (A)(1). However, such testimony may not be admitted to show what the exact alcohol concentration level of the driver was for purposes of demonstrating a violation of R.C. 4511.19(AX2), (3), or (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the judgment of the trial court is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b168-6\">Moyer, C.J., Koehler, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H.

Some of these reasons are seizure, medications, phencyclidine (\u201cPCP\u201d), barbiturates and other depressants. Additionally, a large disparity between test results of the right and left eyes may indicate brain damage. See Improved Sobriety Testing, <em>supra, </em>at 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\"> In a laboratory test, four hundred forty-one subjects had BAC levels ranging from 0.10 to 0.19 percent. Their performance on three sobriety field tests \u2014 the gaze nystagmus test, the walk-and-turn test, and the one-leg stand test \u2014 was scored by police officers. The gaze nystagmus test was shown to be the most accurate single test in determining whether a person\u2019s alcohol concentration was above or below 0.10 percent. The accuracy of these tests were: gaze nystagmus, seventy-seven percent; walk-and-turn, sixty-eight percent; one-leg stand, sixty-five percent; and combined gaze nystagmus and walk-and-turn, eighty percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">Additionally, a field evaluation was performed by using police officers who stopped more than one thousand five hundred drivers for suspicion of driving while under the influence. The evaluation showed the following accuracy ratings: gaze nystagmus, eighty-two percent; walk-and-turn, eighty percent; one-leg stand, seventy-eight percent; and combined gaze nystagmus and walk-and-turn, eighty-three percent.

Frequently, traditional field sobriety tests are not sensitive enough to detect a driver who has a BAC level below .14 percent. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at 272, 718 P. 2d at 174. Traditional field sobriety tests such as the one-leg stand and walk-and-turn tests \u201c*** give the of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>ficer an indication of the suspect\u2019s condition. However, to some degree the results of these tests can be controlled voluntarily by the suspect.
