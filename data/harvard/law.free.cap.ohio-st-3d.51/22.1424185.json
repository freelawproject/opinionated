Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6V\">For the reasons which follow, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction, but vacate the sentence of death and remand for imposition of a life sentence in accord with <em>State </em>v. <em>Penix </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St. 3d 369, 513 N.E. 2d 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Admission of Victim Impact Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">In his second proposition of law, appellant challenges the use of victim impact evidence at the penalty phase of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">In the instant case, appellant requested a presentence investigation report pursuant to R.C. 2929.03(D)(1). The report contained a summary of an interview with the victim\u2019s parents, Ralph, Sr., and Elizabeth Harris, in which Mr. Harris expressed the view that appellant should be sentenced to death. This report was admitted into evidence. The prosecution also called Mr. and Mrs. Harris as rebuttal witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">Mrs. Harris testified concerning the victim\u2019s good character. When asked if she was proud of her son, she replied, \u201cOh, God, how proud I was, a child that never give me no problem, no nothing, no drinking, no smoking, nothing but go to church and come back * * *.\u201d She described the effect on the victim\u2019s son<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>: \u201cI hate to take him to the graveyard. He always wants to go. He think[s] he [is] going to see his dad.\u201d Mr. Harris testified, in response to a question from the prosecutor, that he believed appellant should get the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-14\">In <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1987), 482 U.S. 496, decided after the trial of the instant case but before the court of appeals issued its opinion, the United States Supreme Court held that the introduction of victim impact evidence in the penalty phase of a capital trial is constitutionally impermissible. Victim impact evidence is defined in <em>Booth </em>as including evidence which describes the personal characteristics of the victim, the emotional trauma suffered by the victim\u2019s family, or the family members\u2019 opinions and characterizations of the defendant and the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 502. The court reasoned that \u201c[t]he prospect of a \u2018mini-trial\u2019 on the victim\u2019s character * * * could well distract the sentencing jury from its constitutionally required task \u2014 determining whether the death penalty is appropriate in light of the background and record of the <em>accused </em>and the particular circumstances of the crime. * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 507. The holding <em>o\u00ed Booth </em>was reaffirmed in <em>South Carolina </em>v. <em>Gathers </em>(1989), 490 U.S ___, 104 L. Ed. 2d 876, 109 S. Ct. 2207.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-17\">In <em>State v. Post </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St. 3d 380, 383, 513 N.E. 2d 754, 758, we noted that the admission of victim impact evidence at capital trials was not expressly permitted by the Ohio statutes. However, in <em>Post </em>and two subsequent cases, <em>State </em>v. <em>Sowell </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St. 3d 322, 530 N.E. 2d 1294, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Brewer </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St. 3d 50, 549. N.E. 2d 491, we found the admission of such evidence harmless in <em>bench </em>trials where there was no indication that the three-judge panel relied on the victim impact evidence in arriving at its sentence. See, <em>e.g., Post, supra, </em>at 384, 513 N.E. 2d at 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Four arguments have been advanced by the state to distinguish the present case from <em>Booth </em>and <em>Gathers. </em>These are: (1) Ohio\u2019s use of a sentencing system where the jury\u2019s recommendation of a death penalty is not binding on the trial judge, (2) distinctions between the victim impact evidence in the instant case and that presented in <em>Booth, </em>(3) the victim impact evidence in this case was presented to rebut appellant\u2019s mitigation evidence, and (4) <em>Booth </em>and <em>Gathers </em>allow for victim impact evidence where the killer is acquainted with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Jury Recommendation</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The prosecution argues that <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Maryland, supra, </em>is distinguishable from the instant case because an Ohio jury\u2019s recommendation of death is not binding on the trial judge, while a Maryland jury makes the final determination of sentence. Compare Md. Ann. Code (1987), Article 27, Section 413(E)(1), with R.C. 2929.03(D)(3). We are urged to extend <em>Post </em>to jury trials and require the defendant to show that the sentencing <em>judge </em>was influenced by victim impact evidence before the sentence may be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">We find this argument unpersuasive for two reasons. First, the <em>Booth </em>court held that the admission of victim impact evidence in the sentencing phase of a capital jury trial is constitutional error. Second, in <em>Gathers, supra, </em>the <em>Booth </em>rule was applied to a case decided under South Carolina\u2019s capital punishment statutes, which use a \u201crecommendation\u201d system similar to Ohio\u2019s. See S.C. Code Ann. (1985), Section 16-3-20(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">Distinctions Based on Quality of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">The court below found the admission of the victim impact statement to be harmless error because it was much shorter than that at issue in <em>Booth, </em>and because it contained statements blaming Elba Ortiz for \u201cdeceiving\u201d the victim, which the court viewed as \u201cfavorable\u201d to appellant. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">It is true that the written victim impact statement at issue in <em>Booth </em>was longer and more detailed than that involved in the instant case, see <em>Booth </em>at 509-515, but <em>Booth </em>prohibits consideration of victim impact evidence. In <em>Gathers, supra, </em>the court, without reference to any presentence investigation reports or statements by surviving family members, held that it was constitutional error for the prosecutor, in his closing argument, to draw inferences about the victim\u2019s good character based on the contents of his pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-14\">Further, even if the quantity and quality of the evidence were somehow relevant under <em>Booth </em>and <em>Gathers, </em>we would still find it necessary to vacate the sentence of death. Mrs. Harris\u2019s grief-stricken, emotional testimony is compelling even in a cold transcript; it is almost impossible to believe that a jury could hear it and remain unaffected.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-15\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b63-16\">Rebuttal of Mitigating Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b63-17\">The prosecution argues that the Harrises\u2019 testimony was offered to rebut appellant\u2019s mitigating evidence. During the penalty phase of the trial, appellant presented testimony from his family and an expert, Dr. Thomas Haglund, to the general effect that appellant was basically a good person whose crime was, in part, caused by his problems with drugs and alcohol. Appellant himself, in an unsworn statement, expressed remorse and begged forgiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-18\">The prosecution was certainly entitled to rebut the validity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>appellant\u2019s assertions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the Harrises\u2019 testimony does not serve this purpose. Their testimony did not relate to appellant\u2019s character, his family or drug problem.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It was not rebuttal testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Appellant\u2019s Knowledge of Victim\u2019s Family</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\"><em>Booth </em>and <em>Gathers </em>prohibit introduction of victim impact evidence which is not \u201crelate[d] directly to the circumstances of the crime. * * *\u201d <em>Booth, supra, </em>at 507, fn. 10; <em>Gathers, supra, </em>at _, 104 L. Ed. 2d at 883, 109 S. Ct. at 2211. Impliedly, there may be an exception to the <em>Booth </em>rule when the victim impact evidence relates to the circumstances of the crime. (See <em>Booth, supra, </em>at fn. 10.) It is urged that the instant case falls under this exception because appellant was acquainted with the victim and his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">The purpose of the <em>Booth </em>rule is to ensure that the jury, in its sentencing decision, considers only that evidence which \u201chas some bearing on the defendant\u2019s \u2018personal responsibility and moral guilt.\u2019 * * *\u201d <em>Booth, supra, </em>at 502, quoting <em>Enmund </em>v. <em>Florida </em>(1982), 458 U.S. 782, 801. In most cases, the mere fact that the killer knows his victim does not make him more or less deserving of the death penalty. For example, if appellant and Ralph Harris had not been friends, and all other circumstances had been the same, we doubt that anyone would consider the crime less heinous. In order to bring in victim impact evidence under the \u201ccircumstances of the crime\u201d exception to <em>Booth, </em>the state must show a connection to the defendant\u2019s \u201cpersonal responsibility and moral guilt.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-15\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b64-16\">Testimony Recommending a Death Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b64-17\">Finally, the type of evidence given by the victim\u2019s family in this case goes beyond that considered in <em>Booth </em>and <em>Gathers, supra. </em>Here, a family member offered his opinion on what the appropriate sentence would be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-18\">A distinction should be drawn, in considering victim impact evidence, between (1) evidence relating to the victim\u2019s character, (2) evidence relating to the circumstances of the crime, and (3) evidence consisting of the opinions of the victim\u2019s family as to an appropriate punishment for the defendant. The dissenting justices in <em>Booth </em>and <em>Gathers, supra, </em>argue that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>evidence of the suffering caused by a particular crime can be considered relevant to the defendant\u2019s culpability or moral guilt. See <em>Gathers, supra, </em>at _, 104 L. Ed. 2d at 887-888, 109 S. Ct. at 2214-2215 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting); <em>Booth, supra, </em>at 519-520 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Such evidence is specifically required to be considered by the sentencing court in some non-capital cases. R.C. 2947.051. However, statements by a member of the victim\u2019s family recommending a particular punishment, such as Mr. Harris\u2019s penalty phase testimony, have nothing to do with culpability or moral guilt. They are simply opinions on the appropriate sentence given by someone who, though having a great personal interest in the outcome, is not a member of the jury. These opinions go to the ultimate issue, usurp the jury\u2019s function and undermine the defendant\u2019s right to trial by an impartial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Opinions with respect to an appropriate punishment distract the jury from its constitutional and statutory obligation to weigh mitigating factors against aggravating circumstances. Such opinions, if credited, could make imposition of punishment dependent upon whether the victim\u2019s family believed in or was opposed to capital punishment (and not \u201cthe background and record of the accused and the particular circumstances of the crime\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">We therefore hold that expressions of opinion by a witness as to the appropriateness of a particular sentence in a capital case violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to have the sentencing decision made by the jury and judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">After reviewing the arguments presented, we find no grounds on which to distinguish <em>Booth </em>and <em>Gathers, </em>and we are thus compelled to follow those cases, vacate the sentence of death, and remand for imposition of a life sentence in accord with <em>Penix, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">Voluntary Intoxication</p>\n<p id=\"b65-14\">Appellant called Dr. Thomas Haglund as an expert witness in the guilt phase to testify on the effects of intoxication and the ability of an intoxicated person to suffer a blackout. The prosecution objected, and the court refused to permit Dr. Haglund to testify. Defense counsel proffered the testimony to negate the existence of prior calculation and design. In his first proposition of law, appellant contends that he was prevented from presenting evidence that he was incapable of forming specific intent as permitted by <em>State </em>v. <em>Fox </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St. 2d 53, 22 O.O. 3d 259, 428 N.E. 2d 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-15\">A defendant may present nonexpert testimony in an effort to prove that he was \u201c \u2018 \u201cso intoxicated as to be mentally unable to intend anything <em>([i.e.] </em>unconscious)[.]\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilcox </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St. 2d 182, 194, 24 O.O. 3d 284, 291, 436 N.E. 2d 523, 530, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St. 2d 203, 206, 61 O.O. 2d 433, 434, 291 N.E. 2d 432, 433; see, also, <em>Fox, supra. </em>However, Ohio law does not recognize the defense of \u201cdiminished capacity.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Wilcox, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>paragraph one of the syllabus. Further, except in the mitigation phase, a defendant may not introduce <em>expert </em>psychiatric testimony unrelated to the insanity defense for the purpose of showing that he lacked the capacity to form the specific mental state required for a particular crime. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooey </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St. 3d 20, 544 N.E. 2d 895, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">The arguments which appellant makes are the same as those advanced in <em>Cooey. </em>If accepted, they \u201cwould bring into Ohio law, under another guise, the diminished capacity defense we rejected in <em>Wilcox. </em>* * *\u201d <em>Cooey, supra, </em>at 26, 544 N.E. 2d at 906. Appellant has not proffered any argument which would persuade us to depart from the <em>Wilcox </em>rule, and so we reject his second proposition of law on authority of <em>Cooey </em>and <em>Wilcox, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Appellant advances a related contention in his twelfth proposition of law. He claims that \u201c[insufficient evidence existed for prior calculation and design in this case because [appellant] * * * was intoxicated at the time of the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The mere fact that a defendant is intoxicated does not make him incapable of acting with prior calculation and design. Intoxication \u201cis often voluntarily induced for the sole purpose of nerving a wicked heart to the firmness requisite for the commission of a crime soberly premeditated, or as an excuse for such crime. * * *\u201d <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>State </em>(1858), 8 Ohio St. 435, 439-440.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">We have reviewed the testimony and find that there was sufficient evidence from which reasonable minds could find prior calculation and design. A week before the killing, appellant threatened to \u201cwaste\u201d Ralph Harris, Jr., if he continued to see Elba Ortiz. On the night he killed Harris, appellant, though intoxicated, was able to secure a knife, drive across town, break into the apartment, stab Harris, dispose of the knife, and drive himself home. While appellant testified that he suffered a \u201cblackout\u201d from his intoxication, it is apparent that the jury chose not to believe him.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">Because there was \u201csubstantial evidence upon which a jury could reasonably conclude that all the elements of an offense have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt[,]\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Eley </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St. 2d 169, 10 O.O. 3d 340, 383 N.E. 2d 132, syllabus, we reject appellant\u2019s twelfth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">Multiple Murder Convictions</p>\n<p id=\"b66-13\">In his third proposition of law, appellant claims that his conviction and sentencing on two counts of aggravated murder for a single killing violated R.C. 2941.25 and the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions. Though this issue was not raised at trial or in the court below, the prosecution has conceded that appellant cannot be convicted twice for a single offense. Accordingly, we hold that, on remand, appellant should be given only a single life sentence for the aggravated murder offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">Appellant also contends that the jury improperly \u201cdouble counted\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>aggravating circumstances when weighing them against the mitigating evidence. In view of our disposition of appellant\u2019s death sentence, we need not consider this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Exclusion of Jurors for Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">In his eighth proposition of law, appellant argues that the trial court, over defense objection, improperly excused three prospective jurors, Penny Potts, Ina Hammond and Cheryl Yagielo, for cause because they expressed opposition to the death penalty-</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Mrs. Potts said that she was \u201cnot totally opposed\u201d to capital punishment, but \u201cwould much rather go with the sentence to prison and hope that they changed.\u201d \u201cI hope they come out with a better attitude than to kill them, whatever you want to call it,\u201d she stated. She agreed that voting for a life sentence would be easier than voting for the death penalty. After the prosecutor challenged her for cause, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: * * * Would you be able to follow exactly my instructions, or would you let your own views get in the way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">\u201cWe can\u2019t always take the easier route. Sometimes we have to do what is required and you would have to follow, it\u2019s really the law of Ohio that I am giving you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-11\">\u201cYou think you would be able to do this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-12\">\u201cMRS. POTTS: Probably not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-13\">\u201cBut my views would probably come back and get in the way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: You would be in conflict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-15\">\u201cMRS. POTTS: Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-16\">Mrs. Hammond said she would try to be impartial and follow the judge\u2019s instructions, but did not really believe in the death penalty. Even if other jurors voted for the death penalty, she admitted, \u201cI guess I would say I wouldn\u2019t vote for it, to be honest with you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-18\">Ms. Yagielo was not opposed to the death penalty, but expressed doubts that she, personally, \u201ccould send someone to their death.\u201d When asked if there was any circumstance under which she could vote for the death penalty, she answered, \u201cNo.\u201d The judge excused Ms. Yagielo for cause without allowing defense counsel to voir dire her.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-19\">The standard for excusing a prospective juror based upon the juror\u2019s views on capital punishment is whether those views would \u201cprevent <em>or substantially impair </em>the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and oath.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St. 3d 174, 17 OBR 414, 478 N.E. 2d 984, paragraph three of the syllabus, vacated and remanded on other grounds (1985), 474 U.S. 1002. \u201c* * * The determination of juror bias necessarily involves a judgment on credibility, the basis of which often will not be apparent from an appellate record. <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Witt </em>(1985), 469 U.S. 412, 429. For this reason, \u2018* * * deference must be paid to the trial judge who sees and hears the juror.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 426. * * *\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St. 3d 275, 280, 528 N.E. 2d 542, 549-550.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-20\">Applying these standards, we discern no abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. All three prospective jurors indicated that their views on the death penalty would, at least, substantially impair their ability to follow the judge\u2019s instructions. Though it would have been better practice for the court to allow defense counsel to voir dire Ms. Yagielo, her unequivocal statement that she could never vote for the death penalty is, in itself, a sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>basis to support her removal. We therefore reject appellant\u2019s eighth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Restrictions on Voir Dire Inquiry-</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">In his sixth proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial judge unduly restricted his inquiry into jurors\u2019 views on the death penalty during individual voir dire. This issue was not raised in the court of appeals, and could be considered waived. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St. 2d 112, 5 O.O. 3d 98, 364 N.E. 2d 1364, vacated in part (1978), 438 U.S. 911; <em>Toledo </em>v. <em>Reasonover </em>(1965), 5 Ohio St. 2d 22, 34 O.O. 2d 13, 213 N.E. 2d 179, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Normally, we would be reluctant to consider an issue of this importance to be waived in a capital case. However, in view of our disposition of appellant\u2019s death sentence, any error in the process of \u201cdeath qualifying\u201d the jury has been rendered moot, and we therefore decline to address the issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">Public Voir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">In his seventh proposition of law, appellant contends that he was denied a right to a fair trial because the judge conducted the voir dire in public.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">Initially, the trial court excluded the press and public from the voir dire proceedings pursuant to a motion by appellant. On the first day, two potential jurors were excused for medical reasons, and nineteen potential jurors were questioned. At the beginning of the second day, an attorney for the Lorain Journal appeared in court and asked the court to reconsider its exclusionary order. Appellant and the state opposed this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">After hearing arguments, the court rescinded its previous ruling, stating that, \u201c[w]e have gone through 19 prospective Jurors; and I found nothing that would be so embarrassing that there is a further need for sequestration.\u201d Appellant was granted a continuance in order to make an interlocutory appeal. The court of appeals dismissed it for lack of a final appealable order. Voir dire was resumed after a delay of about a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-14\">The constitutional guarantee of open public proceedings in criminal trials extends to voir dire examinations. <em>State, ex rel. The Repository, </em>v. <em>Unger </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St. 3d 418, 421, 28 OBR 472, 475, 504 N.E. 2d 37, 40. Proceedings may be closed in rare circumstances, and only for cause shown that outweighs the value of openness. <em>Press-Enterprise Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984), 464 U.S. 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-15\">Appellant claims that it was contrary to his' \u201cultimate life/liberty interest\u201d to allow the press and public to attend voir dire. However, appellant has failed to demonstrate prejudice, or to discredit the trial judge\u2019s finding that voir dire had revealed \u201cnothing that would be so embarrassing that there is a further need for sequestration.\u201d In the absence of such a showing, the strong presumption in favor of an open public trial is controlling. <em>Press-Enterprise, supra, </em>at 509-510. We reject appellant\u2019s seventh proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-16\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b68-17\">Admission of Victim\u2019s Taped Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b68-18\">In his fourteenth proposition of law, appellant challenges the admissibility of the tape recording of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Ralph Harris, Jr.\u2019s statement to Detective Shuster.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Harris gave the statement about half an hour to forty-five minutes after the stabbing. Harris was \u201cvery agitated\u201d and \u201cin serious pain.\u201d Harris was still under the stress of the stabbing and \u201chad not calmed down.\u201d Over defense objection, the tape was admitted as an excited utterance under Evid. R. 803(2) and played to the jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">To be admissible under Evid. R. 803(2) as an excited utterance, a statement must concern \u201csome occurrence startling enough to produce a nervous excitement in the declarant,\u201d which occurrence the declarant had an opportunity to observe, and must be made \u201cbefore there had been time for such nervous excitement to lose a domination over his reflective faculties. * * *\u201d <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Baker </em>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 488, 55 O.O. 389, 124 N.E. 2d 140, paragraph two of the syllabus, quoted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Wallace </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St. 3d 87, 89, 524 N.E. 2d 466, 469. Appellant does not dispute that the statement concerns his attack on Harris, that Harris had an opportunity to observe the event, or that being stabbed in the liver is an \u201coccurrence startling enough to produce a nervous excitement * * He does dispute the trial court\u2019s finding that Harris was still in a state of nervous excitement when the statement was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Harris made his statement while doctors were treating him. Clearly, he was agitated over the stabbing and the resultant need for emergency medical care, as both Detective Shuster\u2019s testimony and the sound of Harris\u2019s voice on the tape demonstrate. There was ample evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the statement was admissible as an excited utterance. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s fourteenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">Voluntary Manslaughter as a Lesser Included Offense</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">In his fifth proposition of law, appellant argues that the trial court should have given an instruction on voluntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense. The court gave an instruction on the lesser included offense of murder, but did not give a requested voluntary manslaughter instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">\u201cVoluntary manslaughter\u201d is defined in R.C. 2903.03 as knowingly causing the death of another \u201cwhile under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage, either of which is brought on by serious provocation occasioned by the victim that is reasonably sufficient to incite the person into using deadly force * * *.\u201d We have previously held that voluntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense of murder, and that a trial court commits reversible error by failing to give an instruction when the elements of manslaughter are raised by the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Solomon </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St. 2d 214, 20 O.O. 3d 213, 421 N.E. 2d 139. The persuasiveness of the evidence does not control; the instruction must be given if \u201cunder any reasonable view of the evidence it is possible for the trier of fact to find the defendant not guilty of the greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>offense and guilty of the lesser offense * * <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilkins </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 382, 388, 18 O.O. 3d 528, 532, 415 N.E. 2d 303, 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">At trial, appellant argued that being told on the phone by Elba Ortiz that Ralph Harris was sleeping with her constituted \u201csufficient provocation\u201d to require a voluntary manslaughter instruction. Even if we were to accept this questionable argument, appellant had more than sufficient time to cool down after the telephone conversation was completed. The trial court therefore properly denied the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Appellant\u2019s present counsel appears to have abandoned this argument, and now urges that a voluntary manslaughter instruction was required because appellant\u2019s intoxication rendered him unable to form the specific intent required for aggravated murder and murder. This is a reformulation of the diminished capacity defense which appellant presents in his first proposition of law, and which we have already determined to be devoid of merit. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s fifth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Miscellaneous Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">In his ninth, tenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth propositions of law, appellant contests several alleged errors occurring in the guilt phase of his trial. These issues were not raised in the court of appeals, and have therefore been waived. <em>Williams, supra; Reasonover, supra. </em>Additionally, our review of the record reveals no basis upon which to invoke the plain error rule and reverse appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">In his fourth, eleventh, thirteenth and nineteenth propositions of law, appellant asks that we reverse his death sentence based on several alleged errors in the penalty phase of his trial. In view of our reversal of appellant\u2019s death sentence, these issues are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">In his seventeenth, eighteenth, twentieth and twenty-first propositions of law, appellant attacks the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s capital punishment scheme. These arguments have been rejected in previous cases. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Spisak </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St. 3d 80, 521 N.E. 2d 800; <em>State </em>v. <em>Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St. 3d 1, 520 N.E. 2d 568; <em>State </em>v. <em>Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E. 2d 383; <em>State </em>v. <em>Buell </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St. 3d 124, 22 OBR 203, 489 N.E. 2d 795; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St. 3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E. 2d 264. In addition, appellant has no standing to attack the death penalty because we have vacated his death sentence. Accordingly, we reject these propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">X</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b70-14\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate appellant\u2019s felony murder conviction, affirm his remaining convictions for aggravated murder with prior calculation and design and aggravated burglary, and we vacate his sentence of death. We remand the case for imposition of a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-15\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b70-16\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b70-17\">Moyer, C.J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b70-18\">Douglas and Resnick, JJ., separately dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-12\"> The victim\u2019s child, Ralph Harris III, was the product of a previous relationship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b64-11\"> For example, in his cross-examination of Arlene Huertas, the prosecutor attacked her claim that appellant was a good father by eliciting testimony that appellant never paid child support.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b64-13\"> Mrs. Harris also gave an account of the altercation between Ralph, Jr., and appellant a week before the murder which duplicated her testimony in the guilt phase.

I concur separately for two reasons. The first is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>to add my voice to that of Justice Resnick who, in her dissent, urges the United States Supreme Court to reconsider its opinions in <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1987), 482 U.S. 496, and <em>South Carolina </em>v. <em>Gathers </em>(1989), 490 U.S. _, 104 L. Ed. 2d 876, 109 S.Ct. 2207, in order to give the state courts clear direction with respect to the admissibility of victim impact statements in the sentencing phase of a death penalty case. The fact that the majority and two dissenters in this case all interpret the opinions and footnotes in <em>Booth </em>and <em>Gathers </em>differently demonstrates the uncertainty of the law in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The second reason I concur separately is to dispel any notion that &lt;&lt;* * * today\u2019s majority creates a constitutional ban on the admission of <em>any </em>victim impact evidence * * *,\u201d as asserted in the dissent by Justice Douglas in this case. Footnote 10 in <em>Booth, </em>referred to in Justice Douglas\u2019s dissent simply does not apply to the facts in this case, and the majority opinion, therefore, obviously should not be characterized to apply to facts referred to in footnote 10. Under the holdings of both <em>Booth </em>and <em>Gathers </em>referred to in the majority opinion, we simply have no discretion, when presented with the facts in this case, to decide that the use of the victim impact statement herein did not violate those holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">We can only hope that the United States Supreme Court will soon provide us with an opinion, free of footnotes with statements of substantive law, that will permit the greater use of victim impact statements in the sentencing phase of death penalty cases.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b71-9\">Douglas, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ait\">dissenting. By stating \u201c* * * the <em>Booth </em>[v. <em>Maryland </em>(1987), 482 U.S. 496] court held that the admission of victim impact evidence in the sentencing phase of a capital jury trial is constitutional error,\u201d and \u201c* * * <em>Booth </em>prohibits consideration of victim impact evidence,\u201d today\u2019s majority creates a constitutional ban on the admission of <em>any </em>victim impact evidence and, thereby, the majority contravenes the express language in <em>Booth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">If <em>Booth </em>is viewed as creating a constitutional ban on the admission of victim impact evidence, how can that view be justified in light of footnote 10 in <em>Booth, </em>which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-12\">\u201cOur disapproval of victim impact statements at the sentencing phase of a capital case does not mean, however, that this type of information will never be relevant in any context. Similar types of information may well be admissible because they relate directly to the circumstances of the crime. Facts about the victim and family also may be relevant in a noncapital criminal trial. Moreover, there may be times that the victim\u2019s personal characteristics are relevant to rebut an argument offered by the defendant. See, <em>e.g., </em>Fed. Rule Evid. 404(a)(2) (prosecution may show peaceable nature of victim to rebut charge that victim was aggressor). The trial judge, of course, continues to have the primary responsibility for deciding when this information is sufficiently relevant to some legitimate consideration to be admissible, and when its probative value outweighs any prejudicial effect. Cf. Fed. Rule Evid. 403.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 507-508.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">Obviously, <em>Booth, </em>by its own terms, does not create a constitutional ban on the admission of victim impact evidence. Therefore, in the case at bar, it is error for the majority to create such a ban by relying on <em>Booth. </em>In my view, <em>Booth </em>stands for the proposition that the use of victim impact evidence in the sentencing phase of a capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>trial is constitutionally impermissible <em>only </em>when that evidence creates a substantial risk that the sentencing decision will be based upon arbitrary or irrelevant considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><em>South Carolina </em>v. <em>Gathers </em>(1989), 490 U.S. ___, 104 L. Ed. 2d 876, 109 S. Ct. 2207, was decided shortly after <em>Booth. </em>In the case at bar, the majority views <em>Gathers </em>as a mere application of the constitutional standards announced in <em>Booth. </em>I disagree. <em>Gathers </em>further explained the tenth footnote in <em>Booth. </em>Therefore, <em>Gathers </em>should have dispelled any belief that <em>Booth </em>created a constitutional ban on the use of victim impact evidence, or that the use of any such evidence is constitutionally impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">For purposes of the present appeal, the majority has apparently dismissed <em>Gathers </em>and certain relevant language in <em>Booth. </em>In so doing, the majority states: \u201c* * * we find no grounds on which to distinguish <em>Booth </em>and <em>Gathers, </em>and we are thus compelled to follow those cases, vacate the sentence of death, and remand for imposition of a life sentence * * Today\u2019s majority opinion does <em>not </em>follow <em>Booth </em>or <em>Gathers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt is overwhelming. Appellant requested that Harris stop dating Elba Ortiz. When Harris apparently refused to comply with the request, appellant stated that he \u201cwas going to waste\u201d Harris. Approximately one hour later, appellant repeated his threats stating: \u201cI still say I\u2019m going to have to waste you. * * * I don\u2019t do it fair, * * * but I\u2019m going to waste you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">Appellant knew Harris was spending the night with Elba Ortiz at Ortiz\u2019s apartment. Harris and Ortiz were awakened by a noise at the door. Harris got up to investigate. Appellant stabbed Harris with a knife and attempted to kill Ortiz. Harris died after describing appellant\u2019s attack on him. Appellant\u2019s shirt had blood stains matching Harris\u2019s blood type. Police found appellant\u2019s fingerprints on the storm windows through which he entered the apartment. Appellant\u2019s shoe heel matched a hole in the bedroom door of Ortiz\u2019s apartment. Appellant admitted going to Ortiz\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">In my judgment, the proof of appellant\u2019s guilt is overwhelming and, further, it is my judgment that appellant would have been sentenced to death regardless of the victim impact evidence. Accordingly, I find that if the admission of the victim impact evidence was error, that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 281, 6 OBR 345, 452 N.E. 2d 1323, paragraph six of the syllabus. It is also interesting to note that appellant objected to some, but not all, of the victim impact evidence, thereby waiving error, if any, involved. See, <em>e.g., State </em>v. <em>Broom </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St. 3d 277, 288-289, 533 N.E. 2d 682, 695-696. Because <em>Booth </em>and <em>Gathers </em>prohibit the admission of victim impact evidence <em>only </em>when that evidence creates a substantial risk that the capital sentencing decision will be based upon arbitrary or irrelevant considerations, I would affirm the sentence of death since the evidence in the present case created no such risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">Unfortunately, the majority opinion in the case at bar leaves no room to even consider whether the error was harmless and thus nonprejudicial to appellant\u2019s rights. By what the majority views as \u201cfollowing\u201d <em>Booth </em>and <em>Gathers, </em>the majority opinion creates an automatic vacating of the death sentence <em>any time </em>victim impact evidence is admitted in the sentencing phase of a capital jury trial. Because I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>do not believe that the United States Supreme Court intended such a result, I urge that honorable court, should this matter be appealed, to review this case which so plainly misconstrues both <em>Booth </em>and <em>Gathers.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b73-5\">Alice Robie Re snick, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AE4\">dis-</p>\n<p id=\"Afq\">senting. Today\u2019s holding, as well as the holdings in <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1986), 482 U.S. 496, and <em>South Carolina </em>v. <em>Gathers </em>(1989), 490 U.S. _, 104 L. Ed. 2d 876, 109 S. Ct. 2207, is a step backward in the sentencing process in Ohio and the country. It was not until 1980 that Ohio enacted legislation concerning victims and the effect the crimes had on their lives. R.C. 2947.051 provides \u201c[i]n all criminal cases in which a person is convicted * * * the court shall, prior to sentencing the offender, order the preparation of a victim impact statement by the department of probation.\u201d Prior to this time victims were not considered at all during the sentencing process. This has been changed by the foregoing legislation. As Justice Scalia stated in his dissent in <em>Booth, supra, </em>at 520, \u201ccitizens have found one sided and hence unjust the criminal trial in which a parade of witnesses comes forth to testify to the pressures beyond normal human, experience that drove the defendant to commit his crime, with no one to lay before the sentencing authority the full reality of human suffering the defendant has produced \u2014 which (and <em>not </em>moral guilt alone) is one of the reasons society deems his act worthy of the prescribed penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">The majority in <em>Booth, supra, </em>at 504, stated, \u201c[i]n such a case, it is the function of the sentencing jury to \u2018express the conscience of the community on the ultimate question of life or death.\u2019 \u201d How can this be done without the sentencing authority knowing all the facts surrounding both the defendant and the victim? Further, the conscience of the community cannot properly be expressed if the sentencing authority lacks knowledge of the effect the defendant\u2019s crime had on the community and especially the family, friends and associates of the victim. I am not intimating that such information should be provided to the fact-finders in the guilt phase of the trial. But in the penalty phase a statement prepared by the department of probation should be included and not be deemed prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">In light of recent victim rights legislation it is time that both <em>Booth, supra, </em>and <em>Gathers, supra, </em>be reconsidered so that when the sentencing authority is making that determination of whether or not to impose the death penalty it will be on an equal footing with the sentencing process in all other criminal cases. Victim impact statements are appropriate in the penalty phase of the proceedings especially in view of the fact that aggravated murder is the most heinous crime that can be committed. Why should the rights of a victim be less important? Based upon the majority\u2019s holding the sentence of life or death is determined in a vacuum. The sentencing jury is not permitted to know anything about the personal characteristics of the victim. An appropriate, fair and just determination cannot be made without this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">Based upon the foregoing I would find that the admission of the victim impact statement was not prejudicial error and I would therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeals in its entirety.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
