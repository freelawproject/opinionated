Hence, the state need not prove that the probationer left the court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction in order to toll the running of his probation period pursuant to R.C. 2951.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">A trial court retains jurisdiction over a defendant placed on probation in accordance with R.C. 2951.07, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">\u201cProbation under section 2951.02 of the Revised Code continues for such period as the judge or magistrate determines, and may be extended. The total period of probation shall not exceed five years. If the probationer absconds or otherwise absents himself from the jurisdiction of the court without permission from the county department of probation or the court to do so, or if he is confined in any institution for the commission of any offense whatever, the probation period ceases to run until such time as he is brought before the court for its further action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">The state argues that the phrase \u201cor otherwise absents himself from the jurisdiction of the court without permission,\u201d is a wholly independent clause, not modifying \u201cabsconds\u201d in any way. Thus, a defendant might abscond \u2014 by willfully evading the court\u2019s lawful supervision \u2014 without in fact leaving the jurisdiction. In contrast, petitioner-appellee argues that the word \u201cotherwise\u201d does modify the word \u201cabsconds,\u201d so as to require the state to prove that the probationer left \u201cfrom the jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">In this case, the court of appeals issued no opinion; however, in the entry granting the petition, the court relied on <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1988), 43 Ohio App. 3d 184, 540 N.E. 2d 300. <em>Williams, </em>in interpreting R.C. 2951.07, concluded, in a split decision, that a \u201cprobationer must abscond from the jurisdiction\u201d in order for the period of probation to be tolled. <em>Id. </em>at 186, 540 N.E. 2d at 302. Judge Krupansky, dissenting, argued the majority\u2019s interpretation \u201crewards injustice by permitting a probation violator, appellant, to terminate his probation at his pleasure without penalty since he absconded within the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189, 540 N.E. 2d at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">Returning to the present case, dissenting Judge Matia presented similar views. He read \u201c \u2018absconds,\u2019 as used in R.C. 2951.07 to include any action by a probationer who frustrates the trial court\u2019s supervision of his probation, irrespective of where the probationer absconds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">Applying normal standards of statutory construction we find the word \u201cabsconds\u201d is not qualified by the words \u201cfrom the jurisdiction.\u201d The phrase \u201cfrom the jurisdiction\u201d applies only to \u201cor otherwise absents.\u201d The word \u201cabscond\u201d has a clearly defined legal meaning, standing alone; it needs no clarification or modification from the statutory words appearing after it. \u201cAbscond\u201d is widely and normally interpreted to include hiding within a jurisdiction from service of process. See 1 Words and Phrases (1964) 247, Abscond; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed. 1979) 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-15\">We find this interpretation fits within the object and purpose of the statute which is to deal with those who, by their voluntary act, frustrate supervision of their probation. As we noted long ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-16\">\u201cIt is a rule of interpretation, of universal application, that a law is to be so construed as to carry out the <em>intention </em>of the maker, and that to ascer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>tain that <em>intention, </em>not merely is the language of the law, to be looked to, but also the subject-matter to which it relates, the evil provided against, and the attending circumstances and understanding, at the time the law was framed.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Bank of Toledo </em>v. <em>Toledo </em>(1853), 1 Ohio St. 622, 637.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">It makes little sense to qualify \u201cabsconds\u201d by requiring the state to prove the probation violator left the jurisdiction. To so interpret R.C. 2951.07 constricts the word to less than its normal meaning, frustrates the legislature\u2019s intention, and rewards a wrongdoer for his own wrong. Thus, we specifically disapprove <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>to the extent it holds that \u201cabsconds\u201d requires proof that the probationer left the jurisdiction. \u201c * * Courts of law are not warranted in giving such a construction to the acts of a legislature, as must necessarily work injustice and be fraught with injurious consequences, unless the intent of the legislature that they shall be so understood, is manifest and clear beyond any rational doubt. * * *\u2019 \u201d <em>Lessee of Allen </em>v. <em>Parish </em>(1827), 3 Ohio 187, 198, quoted in part by Judge Krupansky in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>at 189, 540 N.E. 2d at 304-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, relief denied and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b176-9\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
