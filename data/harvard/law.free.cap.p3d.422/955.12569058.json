He became the sheriff-elect after the general election in early November and began preparing to take office. His preparations included a meeting in late November with two of the sitting county commissioners. The three men discussed the sheriff-elect's plans, including purchasing new uniforms, but the commissioners did not explicitly or implicitly authorize Mr. Haskell to order any uniforms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b64] Nevertheless, without first consulting with the sitting sheriff or seeking formal approval from the board of county commissioners, Mr. Haskell set out to order new uniforms and related items, such as patches and badges. He wanted the uniforms for himself and the future members of his command staff to be ready to wear by January 5, 2015, the date of his swearing-in ceremony. He personally placed orders with two companies the sheriff's office had done business with in the past. However, he placed the orders in name of the sheriff's office and did not personally pay for the ordered items. Witnesses from one of the companies later testified they were concerned the orders came prior to Mr. Haskell taking office and did not come from the sheriff's office staff the company normally worked with.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b65] On January 5, 2015, Mr. Haskell and his new command staff arrived at the ceremony wearing new uniforms. County officials and employees at the ceremony took notice. At their meeting the following day, the commissioners criticized Mr. Haskell for ordering the uniforms before he had been sworn in. Some of the items Mr. Haskell ordered had not arrived before the swearing-in ceremony, but Mr. Haskell told the commissioners the only items he ordered were what he and his command staff wore at the ceremony. The value of those items was reportedly around $900. Mr. Haskell told the commissioners he would pay for those items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b66] After the commissioners' meeting, an employee who regularly processed invoices for the sheriff's office received invoices from one of the companies and noticed the order dates were before the new sheriff was sworn in. The employee notified Mr. Haskell about her concerns, and Mr. Haskell contacted the companies to change the order dates in their records to dates after January 5, 2015. The companies complied. Afterwards, Mr. Haskell told the employee the office would be receiving new invoices and he directed her to shred the original copies, which she reluctantly did. However, when the employee later received the modified invoices from the company, she again went to Mr. Haskell and told him that she was uncomfortable submitting the documents to the county commissioners to approve payment. Mr. Haskell downplayed her concerns. When a second employee separately received the amended invoices, and approached Mr. Haskell about her concerns, he dismissed those as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b67] Around early February, the county commissioners received invoices and vouchers for payment from the companies and learned Mr. Haskell had ordered more items than he originally represented. The commissioners revisited the issue at their next board meeting on February 17, 2015, which Mr.\n   Haskell attended. The commissioners told Mr. Haskell they would not pay for items ordered before January 5. Mr. Haskell reiterated he would pay for anything ordered before that date. The commissioners ultimately approved paying for the items the invoices listed as ordered after January 5, but, unknown to the commissioners, those items included some whose order dates Mr. Haskell had modified. The commission approved payments of around $12,000 to the two companies. The commissioners testified that they relied on the order dates represented by Mr. Haskell and would not have paid for the items if they had known the order dates were incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b68] Weeks later, a county dispatcher came across a recording of one of Mr. Haskell's calls to the companies asking them to change the order dates. The commissioners eventually obtained and reviewed the recording. They requested the Department of Criminal Investigation (DCI) to look into the matter, and DCI's investigation led to criminal charges and Mr. Haskell's arrest. He was charged under five counts: Count I-felony of obtaining property by false pretenses; Count II-felony of wrongfully taking property; Count III-felony of submitting a false claim with intent to defraud; Count IV-misdemeanor of public officer acting before qualifying; and Count V-official misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b69] Mr. Haskell's jury trial began on February 21, 2017, and lasted four days. The State rested its case on the third day and Mr. Haskell's counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal under W.R.Cr.P. 29 on Counts I, II, and V. Regarding Counts I and II, defense counsel argued the State had not proven the county passed title to its property to Mr. Haskell. For Count V, he claimed the State had not shown any official duties regarding which Mr. Haskell had committed an unauthorized act with intent to obtain pecuniary benefit. The court granted the motion regarding Count V and denied it for Counts I and II. The court dismissed Count V and sent Counts I through IV to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b610] After considering the Rule 29 motion, the court held a jury instruction conference. The court's jury instructions included a general instruction on the elements of the crime of obtaining property by false pretenses. Relevant to the issues on appeal, Mr. Haskell asked the court to also instruct the jury to find that Mr. Haskell had to obtain both title and possession of the county's property, as required by our decision in\n   <em>\n    Bohling v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338028\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/388/502/\">\n    2017 WY 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338028\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/388/502/\">\n    388 P.3d 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Wyo. 2017). The State's attorney told the trial court Mr. Haskell's proposed instruction was a correct statement, but argued instructing the jury members on the \"title concept\" would confuse them. The trial court accepted the general elements instruction, but rejected Mr. Haskell's proposed instruction and did not instruct the jury on obtaining title and possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b611] On the morning of the trial's fourth day, the trial court met in chambers with counsel to discuss a note the court had received from a juror indicating that juror, or multiple jurors, had heard enough and did not need their notebooks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense counsel argued the note was direct evidence there was a juror who had already made up his mind without hearing the defense's case. The trial court offered to allow defense counsel to question the note's author. However, Mr. Haskell's counsel passed on the opportunity, stating he was uncomfortable putting the juror on the spot and thought it would do more harm than good. Instead, the trial court reminded the jury members of their responsibility to listen to all of the evidence before retiring to deliberate, and the defense presented its case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b612] The jury found Mr. Haskell guilty of the four charges brought before it: obtaining property by false pretenses, acting as a public officer before qualifying, submitting false claims, and wrongfully obtaining property. Mr. Haskell timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Obtaining Property by False Pretenses\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b613] Mr. Haskell challenges his conviction for obtaining property by false pretenses on\n   the grounds of insufficient evidence and erroneous jury instructions. For the jury to find he obtained the county's property by false pretenses, he argues\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-3-407\">\n    Wyo.

He argues the State did not meet that burden and, as a result, there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction for obtaining property by false pretenses. He also claims the trial court erred when it did not instruct the jury to find whether the county passed title to its property to him. To analyze Mr. Haskell's appeal of this conviction, we first consider his arguments regarding passing title as an element of the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Elements of Obtaining Property by False Pretenses\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b614] Mr. Haskell asserts one of the five elements of obtaining property by false pretenses is \"to pass title to,\" meaning the perpetrator must obtain both possession of and title to a victim's property. He argues that\n   <em>\n    Bohling\n   </em>\n   highlights how that element distinguishes obtaining property by false pretenses from the crime of larceny. The State concedes that if we apply\n   <em>\n    Bohling\n   </em>\n   to this case, we must reverse Mr. Haskell's conviction for obtaining property by false pretenses, but asks us to instead reexamine our analysis in\n   <em>\n    Bohling\n   </em>\n   and conclude the State did not have to prove Mr. Haskell obtained both possession and title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b615] The statute creating the felony crime of obtaining property by false pretenses states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (a) A person who knowingly\n   <strong>\n    obtains\n   </strong>\n   property from another person by false pretenses with intent to defraud the person is guilty of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (i) A felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than ten (10) years, a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), or both, if the value of the property is one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or more[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-3-407\">\n    Wyo.

First, the State disputes whether we have always interpreted \"obtains\" to include obtaining both possession and title, and it argues several cases are inconsistent with our reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Bohling\n   </em>\n   :\n   <em>\n    Sweets v.

The State also claims we discounted the minority approach in other jurisdictions to interpreting false pretenses crimes, which does not require obtaining title as an element of obtaining property by false pretenses.

The evidence at trial also demonstrated that the Sublette County Sheriff was authorized to purchase uniforms in accordance with the county's budget for the sheriff's office.

However, his convictions for performing the duties of a sheriff prior to qualifying and for submitting false claims were supported by sufficient evidence. We also conclude there was no cumulative error to require reversing those convictions or his conviction for wrongfully taking property. Therefore, we affirm all of Mr. Haskell's convictions, except one. We reverse Mr. Haskell's conviction for obtaining property by false pretenses and we remand with\n   instruction to enter a judgment of acquittal on that count.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The trial transcript indicates the parties and the trial court knew the identity of the note's author.
