At the time of the alleged abuse, Eckstrom's parents had just been through an acrimonious marriage and divorce. Eckstrom's mother accused Hansen of molesting the child, and the court was called on to decide whether Hansen should be allowed to continue having residential time with her. After a full trial in March 1992, the court found that Hansen had not abused Eckstrom. Hansen asserts that the 1992 finding of no abuse estops Eckstrom from litigating the present claim. Because Eckstrom was not a party to the 1992 proceedings, the trial court properly denied Hansen's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Eckstrom's parents married in 1987 and separated about a month later. Eckstrom was born in 1988. The marriage was dissolved by decree in 1989. Under the parenting plan, Eckstrom resided primarily with her mother. Hansen, a commercial fisherman who spent several months per year in Alaska, exercised his right to residential time when he was in town. Then, in 1990, the mother began to accuse Hansen of molesting the child. Although Hansen denied wrongdoing, his residential contact with his daughter was suspended by temporary order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Eckstrom was assessed by a number of professionals during the ensuing investigation. Sometimes she made statements that indicated Hansen had molested her. In other interviews, she denied that he had touched her inappropriately. A court-appointed psychiatrist concluded there was no convincing evidence to support the allegations of sexual abuse. A guardian ad litem appointed for Eckstrom filed a report stating his opinion that Hansen had not abused Eckstrom and recommending that his visitation with her be reinstated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 A trial occurred in 1992 on Hansen's motion to resume residential contact with Eckstrom. The court made a finding that Hansen had not abused his daughter. The court provided for gradual reinstatement of his residential time with her, under therapeutic supervision intended to overcome the estrangement\n   that had developed and to promote a close parent-child relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Efforts to reunite father and daughter were unsuccessful. In 1993, Hansen relinquished his parental rights. Eckstrom's mother assumed sole custody and control of the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Eckstrom grew up having no contact with Hansen. In 2010, she reached out to Hansen and told him that she was planning to go to law school. She asked Hansen to give her money for tuition and other expenses, which she estimated as more than $250,000. Hansen told her that he would first want to get to know her better. They attended a joint counseling session. They had no further contact thereafter. Eckstrom went to law school and is now a practicing attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 This suit began in May 2016, when Eckstrom filed a complaint against Hansen seeking damages for child rape and molestation. Eckstrom claimed to have memories of Hansen's abuse and said that she was prepared to testify about her experience. Hansen denied liability and asserted the defenses of res judicata and collateral estoppel. He moved for dismissal in July 2016 on the ground that the 1992 finding of no abuse precluded Eckstrom's suit. The trial court denied the motion but granted Hansen's request for a certification under RAP 2.3(b)(4). This court granted discretionary review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 Res judicata and collateral estoppel are kindred doctrines designed to prevent repetitive litigation.\n   <em>\n    Bordeaux v.

The requirements of collateral estoppel are: (1) the identical issue was decided in the prior action; (2) the prior action resulted in a final judgment on the merits; (3) the party to be estopped was a party or in privity with a party in the earlier proceeding; and (4) precluding relitigation of the issue will not work an injustice.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4015795\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/171/726/#p730\">\n    171 Wash.2d at 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=254%20P.3d%20818\">\n    254 P.3d 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the parenting plan trial in 1992, the trial court was presented with the identical issue and decided Hansen did not sexually abuse Eckstrom. The result was final judgment on the merits permitting Hansen to resume residential contact with his\n   young daughter. Because the first two elements of collateral estoppel are satisfied, we must consider the third: whether Eckstrom, the party to be estopped, was a party or in privity with a party in the earlier proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 Eckstrom was not a named party to the earlier action.

The George Washington Foundation, serving as guardian of the persons of three minors, petitioned for removal of Robert Terhune, who was then serving as guardian of their estates.\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5299919\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/9/525/#p536\">\n    9 Wash.2d at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20P.2d%20734\">\n    115 P.2d 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court dismissed the petition, and the foundation appealed.

The effect of the appointment of a guardian ad litem depends on the type of case and the authority given.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 18 The\n   <em>\n    Marriage of Hansen\n   </em>\n   case, King County Superior Court cause number 87-3-09135-3, was a domestic relations matter. The order appointing a guardian ad litem for Eckstrom in 1990 provided that the guardian ad litem \"shall conduct a reasonable investigation of the circumstances of the child in relation to Parenting Plan matters and shall, in that capacity, represent the best interests of the minor child.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The order did not authorize the guardian ad litem to receive service of process for Eckstrom or to assert claims and counterclaims on her behalf. Nothing in the terms of the order of appointment authorized the guardian ad litem to act for Eckstrom so as to make her \"effectively a party\" as Hansen contends. Even if the guardian ad litem had concluded that Hansen abused Eckstrom, he did not have the authority to pursue a personal injury claim on her behalf. The guardian ad litem was appointed to represent Eckstrom's interests only in connection with the pending decision on whether her father should be allowed to have residential time with her. This concern is immaterial to the present suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 19 In addition, we find no authority permitting collateral estoppel to operate against a minor who is represented by a guardian ad litem in an earlier proceeding when the minor's interests in the second proceeding are not the same as in the first proceeding. In\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   , the foundation was asserting the minors' interest in having their assets handled honestly. The exact same interest was at stake at the earlier hearing on the final account. Here, the interest now asserted by Eckstrom is to receive monetary\n   compensation for the damages she has allegedly suffered as the result of Hansen's conduct. This is different from the\n   <em>\n    Marriage of Hansen\n   </em>\n   matter, where her interest was in being protected from sexual abuse, not in receiving compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 20 We conclude that the appointment of the guardian ad litem did not make Eckstrom a \"party\" to the dispute between her parents for purposes of collateral estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 21 Hansen next contends that Eckstrom, if not a party, was in privity with her mother, who was a named party to the adjudication in\n   <em>\n    Marriage of Hansen\n   </em>\n   . Privity denotes a mutual or successive relationship to the same right or property.\n   <em>\n    McDaniels v.

Eckstrom's mother was pursuing her right as a parent to protect her child from abuse. Eckstrom did not have that same right. As a child, she had to depend on others to protect her. And Eckstrom did not succeed to her mother's rights as a parent. Eckstrom is pursuing her own distinct right as an adult to sue for personal injury damages. The requirement for privity in collateral estoppel is \"strict.\"\n   <em>\n    McDaniels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1187848\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/108/299/#p306\">\n    108 Wash.2d at 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=738%20P.2d%20254\">\n    738 P.2d 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It would be procedurally unfair to Eckstrom to bind her to the outcome of an earlier proceeding that occurred when she was unrepresented by anyone with the power to act for her in litigation.

We grant Hansen's request to take judicial notice that these documents are, in fact, documents that were filed with the King County Superior Court in the earlier proceedings. That fact, supported by a copy of the court's docket, is not subject to reasonable dispute.
