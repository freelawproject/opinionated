(\"Father\") challenges the juvenile court's failure to make written findings in its order terminating his parental rights to his children J.B. and I.B. We hold that even if the court makes oral findings of fact on the record, a written termination order that recites only conclusions of law regarding the statutory grounds for termination and best interests is insufficient as a matter of law. Such an order fails to comply with the requirement in both Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 8-538(A) and Arizona Rule of Procedure for the Juvenile Court 66(F)(2)(A) that a termination order must contain written findings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 In July 2016 the Department of Child Safety (\"DCS\") filed a dependency petition alleging J.B. and I.B. (collectively, the \"children\") were dependent. DCS alleged substance abuse based on Father's use of heroin, marijuana, and morphine. DCS also alleged neglect because of Father's inability to provide the necessities of life for the children and because he cared for them while under the influence of drugs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court later adjudicated the children dependent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 In April 2017, DCS moved to terminate Father's parental rights on the statutory grounds of abandonment, A.R.S. \u00a7 8-533(B)(1), substance abuse, A.R.S. \u00a7 8-533(B)(3), and six months in an out-of-home placement, A.R.S. \u00a7 8-533(B)(8)(b). DCS also alleged termination was in the children's best interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Father later failed to appear for a pretrial conference. The juvenile court found Father's failure to appear was without good cause and granted DCS's motion to proceed with the termination hearing in absentia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 After receiving exhibits and hearing testimony presented by a DCS case manager, the juvenile court made findings of facts and conclusions of law by oral pronouncement on the record at the conclusion of the hearing. The juvenile court found DCS failed to prove abandonment but did prove the grounds of chronic substance abuse and out-of-home placement by clear and convincing evidence, and stated relevant factual findings. The court also found by a preponderance of evidence that termination of Father's parental rights was in the children's best interests, again providing its factual findings orally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 The juvenile court later entered a final written order terminating Father's parental rights to the children. The final order read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   THE COURT FINDS by clear and convincing evidence that the State has proven the allegation of a history of chronic abuse of dangerous drugs and controlled substances with respect to [Father].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE COURT FINDS beyond a preponderance of the evidence that it would be in the children's best interest[s] to sever the father's parental rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The final order was devoid of any factual findings to support the legal conclusions about the statutory ground for termination or factual findings to justify that termination was in the children's best interests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 Father timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 8-235(A) and Arizona Rule of Procedure for the Juvenile Court 103(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 Father argues the juvenile court committed an error of law when entering a final order lacking any written factual findings in support of its conclusions of law. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Purported Waiver\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 9 Father did not raise this argument in the juvenile court.

Nonetheless the juvenile court, based on the limited record before it, was still required to find whether DCS had met its burden. To do so, the juvenile court was required to state in writing the ultimate facts on which it relied in reaching its conclusions of law. That is, the juvenile court was required to state what facts supported its conclusion that DCS had proven that Father had a history of chronic substance abuse, rendering him unable to discharge his parental responsibilities, and there existed reasonable grounds to believe his condition would continue for a prolonged indeterminate period within the meaning of A.R.S. \u00a7 8-533(B)(3). The court was further required to state what ultimate facts supported its legal conclusion that DCS had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that termination of Father's parental rights was in the children's best interests. Therefore, the juvenile court erred as a matter of law when it made findings of fact on the record, but then entered a termination order containing only conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 21 Father also argues the juvenile court erred as a matter of law by omitting a written conclusion of law confirming the oral pronouncement that DCS had proven the ground of six months in an out-of-home placement.

The lack of written findings is the sole issue Father raises on appeal. Therefore, on remand Father cannot later elect to raise additional issues on appeal. Rather, Father is limited to challenging the sufficiency of the juvenile court's written findings of fact. He may also challenge the court's conclusions of law and findings of fact regarding the six months in an out-of-home placement ground, which was not included in the juvenile court's termination order.

A prompt objection raised by Father with the juvenile court would have given DCS the opportunity to address the error instead of waiting until it was raised on appeal. Indeed, DCS would have been hard pressed in this case to object to a request from Father for issuance of written findings, which presumably would have resulted in a termination order that complied with statutory and rule requirements. And it would have given the juvenile court the opportunity to address, in the first instance, the error Father now asserts on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 30 Fourth, Father is incorrect in suggesting that applying waiver here is unfair because no specific authority addresses how a party can object to the sufficiency of the juvenile court's findings and still preserve the right to appeal. If the juvenile court fails to make sufficient findings, nothing prevents a party from promptly bringing the matter to the court's attention by filing a motion for reconsideration, motion for additional findings, or motion to amend. For decades, Arizona appellate courts have acknowledged the propriety of a prompt motion to set aside where a party asserts a procedural irregularity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    David C. v.

The label placed on the motion is less important than the content; the goal is to provide the court and the opposing party with the opportunity to correct errors in the termination order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R.P. Juv. Ct. 6 (stating that juvenile court proceedings, \"unless otherwise stated, shall be conducted as informally as the requirements of due process and fairness permit, and shall proceed in a manner similar to the trial of a civil action before the court sitting without a jury\"). To further preserve the right to appeal, a party may file a timely notice of appeal and promptly seek an order from this court staying the appeal until the juvenile court resolves the pending post-hearing motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R.P. Juv. Ct. 103(B) (stating that a juvenile court order may be stayed pending appeal by an appellate court if \"suitable provision is made for the care and custody of the child\"). By following this procedure, the party gives the juvenile court (and other parties) the opportunity to address alleged errors without delay. If the court denies the motion, then the party has preserved the right to raise the issue on appeal, and the troubling situation presented to us here is avoided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 31 Moreover, to the extent Father argues waiver would deprive him of a remedy, that is, of course, a consequence of waiver. Father has not shown how the order terminating his rights failing to include written findings creates a due process issue or, if it did, that the issue resulted in fundamental error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brenda D. v.

The juvenile court could therefore presume that Father admitted the allegations of the motion for termination. The court then conducted an evidentiary hearing and verbally listed findings of fact and conclusions of law from the bench. Unfortunately, those findings of fact and conclusions of law were not repeated in the court's written findings. Father did not ask the superior court to clarify or take any other action in that court; instead, he waited months to raise the issue with this court for the first time on appeal. Given Father's waiver, I would affirm the termination order.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
