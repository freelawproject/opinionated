A.R.S. \u00a7 23-1023(D). In\n   <em>\n    Aitken v. Industrial Commission\n   </em>\n   , this Court held that the insurance carrier may assert the lien \"only to the extent that the compensation benefits paid exceed the [non-party] employer's proportionate share of the total damages fixed by verdict in the [third-party] action.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490801\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/183/387/#p392\">\n    183 Ariz. 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 392,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490801\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/183/387/#p392\">\n    904 P.2d 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 461 (1995). We today hold that a claimant who settles all of his or her third-party claims is not entitled to a post-settlement trial to determine the percentage of employer fault solely to reduce or extinguish the insurance carrier's lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 2 Victor Leija died while working as a window washer when he fell from a building after a scaffold collapsed. Victor's widow and children (collectively, \"Leijas\") claimed workers' compensation benefits through Victor's employer's workers' compensation carrier, Twin City Fire Insurance Company (\"Twin City\"). Twin City accepted the claim and pays monthly benefits of $1857 to the Leijas. Eventually, the payments will total approximately $575,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 3 Exercising their right under the Act to bring a tort claim against any third person who negligently caused Victor's death,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 23-1023(A), the Leijas filed a negligence action against the City of Glendale, which owned the building from which Victor fell, the building's property manager and maintenance company, and the companies that furnished and fabricated the scaffold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 During settlement negotiations between the Leijas and the third-party defendants, Twin City asserted its right under \u00a7 23-1023(D) to fully enforce a lien against all settlement proceeds for the amount of workers' compensation benefits it had paid and would pay in the future. Nevertheless, Twin City offered to reduce its lien by five percent if the Leijas settled all their third-party claims. The Leijas rejected the offer, arguing that Twin City was required to reduce its lien by more than five percent due to the alleged comparative fault of Victor's employer in causing the accident. Although Twin City did not object to any settlement, it never wavered from its position that it was not required to reduce its lien. The Leijas\n   ultimately settled with all the third-party defendants for $1.6 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 After that settlement, Twin City filed this action against the Leijas to enforce its lien. Consistent with its pre-settlement position, Twin City sought to fully enforce its lien under \u00a7 23-1023(D) against all the settlement proceeds to the extent of past and future workers' compensation benefits. The Leijas counterclaimed, arguing, as relevant here, that Twin City breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing by refusing to reduce its lien to account for Victor's employer's alleged comparative fault. Alternatively, the Leijas requested that the superior court set a trial to establish the employer's proportionate fault and the resulting amount of Twin City's lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6 On the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, the superior court ruled in Twin City's favor, reasoning that \"a separate action after compromise of the third-party claim is not the appropriate vehicle to allocate fault\" to a non-party employer. The court further reasoned that, contrary to the Leijas' assertions, a workers' compensation insurance carrier does not owe a duty of good faith and fair dealing to reduce its lien against a claimant's settlement proceeds to account for a non-party employer's alleged comparative fault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 The court of appeals reversed, holding that \"when a worker settles a claim against a third party for less than the limits of the third party's insurance, the worker may obtain a judicial determination of whether the carrier's lien should be reduced to account for the employer's comparative fault.\"\n   <em>\n    Twin City Fire Ins.

The court reasoned that \"the fact that the Leijas settled their [third-party] claims rather than try them to a verdict does not preclude equitable apportionment under\n   <em>\n    Aitken\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=403%20P.3d%20587\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 181 \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=403%20P.3d%20587\">\n    403 P.3d at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court observed that \"the settlement with [the City of] Glendale did not touch multiple layers of coverage and the record contains significant evidence of employer fault.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. Therefore, the court stated, Twin City's lien should be equitably apportioned because \"estimations of [Victor's] employer's comparative fault undoubtedly affected the amount the Leijas were able to recover in settlement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. The court of appeals remanded the case to the superior court to set \"a trial to equitably apportion Twin City's lien\" and directed that court to \"address the specifics of such a proceeding,\" including \"whether damages and the employer's comparative fault should be determined by the court or by a jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 Finally, because the court of appeals \"ruled that the Leijas have a right to a trial by which Twin City's lien may be apportioned,\" it found \"no need\" to reconsider the principle that a workers' compensation carrier does not breach its duty of good faith and fair dealing when, \"absent a fair adjudication of damages and employer comparative fault,\" it refuses to compromise or reduce its lien under \u00a7 23-1023(D).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 182 \u00b6 28,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=403%20P.3d%20587\">\n    403 P.3d at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 We granted review because this case presents recurring issues of statewide importance.

When an employee brings such a third-party claim, the Act vests the employer's insurance carrier with a lien on any recovery (less reasonable and necessary expenses) that the employee collects from the third-party to the extent of the compensation benefits paid by the insurance carrier. \u00a7 23-1023(D) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dietz v.

Simply stated, neither the applicable statutes nor our prior decisions authorize a post-settlement trial process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 22 In addition, there are good reasons to limit application of the equitable apportionment rule to only those cases that are tried to verdict. The inequity we recognized in\n   <em>\n    Aitken\n   </em>\n   will exist in\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   such case when the jury allocates some percentage of fault to a non-party employer. But that inequity will not exist in every case where a claimant settles with a third-party defendant. It is purely speculative to assume that, based solely on a claimant and a third-party defendant settling at some amount below the defendant's insurance policy limits, the claimant's recovery was reduced by the non-party employer's alleged fault. In short, a third-party defendant's insurance policy limits are not a proxy for employer fault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 23 Many factors may influence a plaintiff/employee's decision to settle with a third-party defendant and the settlement amount. Indeed, a claimant may settle below a third-party defendant's insurance policy limits for many reasons that have nothing to do with employer fault. For example, the claimant may not have suffered a severe injury, might have difficulty proving fault or causation on the part of the third-party defendant, or might be risk-averse and would prefer a potentially smaller recovery to avoid the risk of trial, including the risk that the jury will apportion a substantial amount of fault to the claimant or the claimant's employer.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488534\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/185/74/#p76\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488534\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/185/74/#p76\">\n    at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488534\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/185/74/#p76\">\n    912 P.2d at 1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that \"it is uncertainty about the result that most often leads to settlement\"). There is no basis to assume that in\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   settlement between a claimant and a third-party defendant, the claimant suffered the inequity that\n   <em>\n    Aitken\n   </em>\n   sought to cure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 24 Notably, an insurance carrier could also be concerned with the risk that a jury will apportion a substantial amount of fault to the claimant or the claimant's employer because that could adversely affect the carrier by reducing the claimant's recovery and, consequently, the value of the carrier's lien. Therefore, a carrier may understandably wish to incentivize the claimant to settle by voluntarily reducing its lien in exchange for a settlement.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boy v.

Generally, a claimant in a third-party action \"has every incentive to maximize the percentage of fault allocated to the third-party defendant\" because the claimant wants to receive the highest amount of damages he or she can obtain.\n   <em>\n    Stout v. State Comp.

Consequently, the claimant \"necessarily has every incentive to\n   <em>\n    minimize\n   </em>\n   the percentage of fault allocated to the employer\" because \"any fault assigned to the employer will typically reduce that assigned to the third-party defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"946323\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/202/300/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 26 But a post-settlement trial process would transform this incentive structure. Under the court of appeals' construct, a claimant would try to maximize a third-party defendant's fault (and therefore to minimize the fault attributable to the claimant's employer) so as to maximize the amount of the claimant's settlement. Then, in the post-settlement trial with the insurance carrier, the claimant would be incentivized to take the diametrically opposite position by maximizing the fault attributable to the employer (and therefore minimizing the fault accruing to the settling third-party defendant) solely to reduce or extinguish the insurance carrier's lien on the settlement proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 27 Even assuming that an insurance carrier's refusal to waive or reduce its lien\n   might be inequitable in some circumstances, it is difficult to understand how the possible gamesmanship created by a post-settlement trial process is more equitable than permitting an insurance carrier to exercise its statutorily authorized lien on a claimant's settlement proceeds to the extent of compensation benefits paid when, for the reasons previously discussed, there may be no inequity at all. Accordingly, we hold that a claimant who settles all his or her third-party claims may not obtain a post-settlement trial to determine the percentage of employer fault solely to reduce or extinguish the insurance carrier's lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 28 In so holding, we recognize that even in a settlement context, an insurance carrier has an obligation to act in good faith toward a claimant by giving equal consideration to the claimant's interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stout I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"216991\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/197/238/\">\n    197 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   242 \u00b6\u00b6 19-22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"216991\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/197/238/\">\n    3 P.3d at 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1499234\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/154/334/#p337\">\n    154 Ariz. at 335, 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1499234\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/154/334/#p337\">\n    742 P.2d at 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding pre-\n   <em>\n    Aitken\n   </em>\n   , that workers' compensation insurer \"did not breach its duty to act in good faith when it refused to compromise its lien against any [third-party] recovery,\" and noting that \"[t]he duty of good faith ... merely requires the insurer to give equal consideration to the interests of both parties\"). Under these circumstances, as amicus CopperPoint Insurance Company acknowledged at oral argument, good faith might entail a workers' compensation insurer considering and reasonably acting on a claimant's request to reduce the lien on third-party settlement proceeds, particularly when evidence of employer fault is clear, undisputed, and substantial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 29 The record in this case includes some evidence of employer fault. Perhaps for that reason, Twin City offered to reduce its lien by five percent if the Leijas settled with the third-party defendants.
