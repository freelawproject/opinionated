Mr. Sanchez contends that he was under extreme emotional distress at the time because the victim allegedly told him that she was cheating on him with his brother and refused to promise she would stop. If proven, Mr. Sanchez's extreme emotional distress would be a special mitigating factor reducing the level of offense from criminal homicide to manslaughter. At trial, the court excluded statements Mr. Sanchez made to a detective that he contends would have supported his claim for a reduced charge based on special mitigation for extreme\n   emotional distress. He was convicted of first-degree murder by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 On appeal, the court of appeals determined that the trial court abused its discretion by not admitting the statements under Utah Rule of Evidence 106.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, the court of appeals found that the error was harmless because, even if the statements were admitted, Mr. Sanchez would not have met his burden of proving extreme emotional distress mitigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Mr. Sanchez petitioned for a writ of certiorari of the harmless error determination, and the state filed a cross petition on the rule 106 determination. We granted certiorari review on both Mr. Sanchez's petition and the state's cross petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Typically, when an appellate court reviews an alleged error in the trial court's determinations on the rules of evidence, we first look to see if there was error under the appropriate standard of review. Next, if error is found, we determine if the \"error is so prejudicial and so substantial that, absent the error, it is reasonably probable that the result would have been more favorable for the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11625531\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/974/269/\">\n    1999 UT 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11625531\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/974/269/\">\n    974 P.2d 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nevertheless, in this case, we decline the invitation of the state to decide whether the testimony should have been admitted under rule 106 because, like the court of appeals, we find that if in fact the court erred in not admitting the evidence, the error would be harmless. Additionally, we note that the court of appeals used the incorrect standard for measuring extreme emotional distress. Therefore, we vacate the portions of the court of appeals' decision that deal with rule 106 and the standard for extreme emotional distress, we clarify the correct standard for extreme emotional distress, and we affirm the court of appeals' harmlessness determination on alternative grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 The victim in this case was killed by her boyfriend in her apartment on May 5, 2011, after a prolonged period of brutalization. The events that led to her death began the previous night when Mr. Sanchez claims she told him that she was cheating on him with his brother.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Sanchez's initial reaction was to pull her hair. However, over the course of the next seven to ten hours, Mr. Sanchez engaged in a brutal attack on the victim. Mr. Sanchez admitted to detectives that over the course of the night he repeatedly pulled the victim's hair, slapped her, kicked her, choked her, used the heel of his foot to stomp on her, bit her, and grabbed her stomach and clenched hard enough to leave bruises. Mr. Sanchez also grabbed the victim's lips and pulled them so hard that they tore away from her mouth and backhanded her hard enough to cause her nose to bleed uncontrollably.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 At several points throughout the night, Mr. Sanchez choked the victim to the point of losing consciousness. When she lost consciousness, Mr. Sanchez would sometimes attempt to revive her through resuscitation. At another point that night, Mr. Sanchez took\n   the victim to the bathroom and ran water over her head in an attempt to \"fully arouse her or awaken her\" and to clean her up because \"she was bleeding profusely from her face.\" He also tried to clean the victim up using hydrogen peroxide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 The victim's downstairs neighbors could hear portions of the attack. One downstairs neighbor testified that she could hear crying from at least one to six a.m., with quiet periods lasting no longer than five minutes. In the middle of the night, that neighbor said that she could \"hear[ ] a lot of crying, more so like despair, and then ... excessive like crying, and ... muffled yelling or grunting.\" The neighbor became so concerned by the noises that she asked her mother to call the police. The mother went upstairs several times and knocked on the victim's door and tried to call the victim's phone. When the victim did not answer the door or the phone, the mother finally called 9-1-1. Police arrived around 6:40 a.m. They knocked on the door several times, but nobody answered. Dispatch also tried calling phone numbers associated with the apartment, but they went unanswered. Police listened at the door for several minutes to see if they could hear noises coming from inside, but they could not hear anything. The call was cleared around seven a.m. Between 6:30 and 7:15 a.m., the downstairs neighbor did not hear any noises. And by the time she left for work at 8:15 a.m., the apartment above was silent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Around eight or nine in the morning, Mr. Sanchez choked the victim for the final time. Mr. Sanchez, realizing that his first method of choking-a headlock-was not working, tried a second method-placing his elbow on her throat while on top of her. And then, when that method also proved ineffective, Mr. Sanchez turned to a third method-placing his forearm on her throat and leaning into her. This third method caused the victim to lose consciousness, which she never regained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 After the victim lost consciousness, Mr. Sanchez lay down next to her and took a nap. When he woke up one to two hours later, the victim was still unresponsive, so he called a friend to come and get him. When his friend arrived around twenty minutes later, Mr. Sanchez called 9-1-1 for an ambulance and then got in his friend's car and left. Police were able to track Mr. Sanchez to his friend's house a few hours later, and Mr. Sanchez eventually surrendered after taking several methadone pills. Mr. Sanchez was taken to the hospital and later interviewed by Detective Chad Reyes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 At trial, Detective Reyes provided lengthy testimony about his interview with Mr. Sanchez. The trial court denied Mr. Sanchez's attempt to get additional statements he made to Detective Reyes admitted under rule 106 of the Utah Rules of Evidence. Mr. Sanchez appealed this decision to the court of appeals. The court of appeals held that the trial court should have admitted the evidence under rule 106, but that the error was harmless.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court of appeals concluded that the trial court erred in not admitting Mr. Sanchez's proffered statements under\n   rule 106 of the Utah Rules of Evidence but determined that the error was harmless. Mr. Sanchez sought certiorari review of this decision, arguing that the court of appeals erred (1) by using the incorrect harmlessness standard and (2) in its construction and application of the extreme emotional distress special mitigation statute. The state cross petitioned, arguing that the court of appeals was incorrect in holding that rule 106 required admission of statements that would otherwise constitute self-serving, inadmissible hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 Although we granted the state's cross petition as a separate issue for our review, it functions as an alternative ground for us to affirm the court of appeals. Since we determine that if error existed, it was harmless, we first provide some discussion as to whether rule 106 would apply to the proffered statements, but we decline to reach the issue, proceeding to the prejudice prong. We do so because, even under the assumption that the trial court erred, the court of appeals used the correct prejudice standard in finding any potential error harmless and reached the correct result. Finally, we discuss and apply the correct standard for the extreme emotional defense mitigation and conclude that any error was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   I. ADMISSIBILITY OF DEFENDANT'S STATEMENTS TO DETECTIVE REYES UNDER RULE 106\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 The first issue we consider is whether the court of appeals was correct in concluding that Mr. Sanchez's statements to Detective Reyes should have been admitted under Utah Rule of Evidence 106. We begin by discussing the relevant trial court testimony and the lower court rulings. After that, we discuss the threshold questions necessary to determine whether rule 106 applies. The parties did not brief these threshold questions. And we decline to render an opinion where the parties have not \"provide[d] reasoned argument and [valid] legal authority.\"\n   <em>\n    A.S. v. R.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2077\">\n    2017 UT 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567069\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/465/\">\n    416 P.3d 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (second alteration in original) (citation omitted). Further, because we determine that any error in not admitting the evidence under rule 106 would be harmless, we do not need to determine if there was error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    A. Trial Testimony and Lower Court Rulings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b614 At trial, Detective Reyes provided lengthy testimony regarding his interview with Mr. Sanchez. Relevant to the rule 106 argument, Detective Reyes testified that Mr. Sanchez told him that the fight started the night before when \"he got mad at her and he pulled her hair.\" Additionally, Detective Reyes asked Mr. Sanchez \"specifically about the choking,\" and \"if [the victim] was saying anything or reacting at all to him when he was choking her[,] and [Mr. Sanchez] said that she wasn't saying much[;] she was just screaming.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b615 On cross-examination, Mr. Sanchez wanted to elicit testimony from Detective Reyes about statements Mr. Sanchez made during the interview where he claimed that the victim repeatedly told him that she was having an affair with his brother and refused to say she would stop. Mr. Sanchez acknowledged that his statements to the detective were hearsay, not admissible under rule 801(d)(2) of the Utah Rules of Evidence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   but argued several theories for admissibility, including Utah Rule of Evidence 106. The trial court ruled that the proffered statements were not admissible under any of the theories Mr. Sanchez presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 Before us, Mr. Sanchez has only presented the argument that his statements should have been admitted under rule 106 of the Utah Rules of Evidence. Rule 106 provides as follows: \"If a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party may require the introduction, at that time, of any other part-or any other writing or recorded statement-that in fairness\n   ought to be considered at the same time.\" UTAH R. EVID. 106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 The trial court rejected Mr. Sanchez's rule 106 argument, concluding that fairness did not require admitting the statements because they were a self-serving, after-the-fact explanation, temporally unrelated to the inculpatory portions of the interview previously admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b618 A majority of the court of appeals concluded that rule 106 covers both timing and admissibility and that the trial court abused its discretion by not admitting the proffered portions of the testimony.\n   <em>\n    State v. Sanchez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177629\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/380/375/12177629/\">\n    2016 UT App 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 18, 30-31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12340428,12340813,12177629\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/380/375/\">\n    380 P.3d 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nevertheless, the court of appeals affirmed, holding that the error was harmless.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. Mr. Sanchez filed a writ of certiorari on this determination, and the state cross petitioned, arguing that the court of appeals erred by (1) deciding rule 106 applied without first determining whether the introduced statements were misleading and (2) concluding that rule 106 can overcome other rules of evidence that prevent admissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    B. Applicability of Rule 106\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b619 Other jurisdictions are split on the question of whether rule 106 is solely a rule of timing or if it also overcomes other rules of evidence that preclude admissibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882146\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/1195/\">\n    2015 UT 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 41 n.56,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882146\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/1195/\">\n    345 P.3d 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (comparing holdings in other jurisdictions (citations omitted) ). We have yet to weigh in on this divisive issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b620 However, before we reach the timing versus admissibility issue raised by the court of appeals, there is a threshold question that must be answered: Does the evidence to be admitted qualify as a writing or recorded statement under rule 106 ?\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Neither party adequately addressed this threshold question either in their briefing or at oral argument. And, based on the record before us, we are unconvinced that we can properly answer the question in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b621 We previously left open the question of whether \" rule 106 applies to transcribed oral statements that are used extensively at trial but are not actually introduced into evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Some courts have said that reading a writing or recorded statement into the record or directly quoting it on cross-examination is enough, while other courts require actual introduction of the evidence before rule 106 applies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41 n.55 (noting that \"[c]ourts have not reached a uniform decision on whether rule 106 applies to statements that are not introduced into evidence\" and comparing rules across jurisdictions (citations omitted) ). It is not clear here that the prosecutor's use would even meet the lower bar. And we have certainly left open the question of whether rule 106 applies if transcribed oral statements are not used extensively at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b622 Neither party introduced the actual transcript of the detective's interview at trial, and the transcript does not appear in the record. From the record, it appears that Mr. Sanchez's counsel repeatedly quoted from the transcript during cross-examination of Detective Reyes. However, Mr. Sanchez cannot rely upon his own use of the transcript to trigger additional admissibility under rule 106.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH R. EVID. 106 (allowing \"an\n   <em>\n    adverse\n   </em>\n   party [to] require the introduction\" of a writing or recorded statement when \"a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement\" (emphasis added) ). Instead, Mr. Sanchez may only rely upon rule 106 if the prosecution has introduced all or part of a writing or recorded statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b623 While Detective Reyes testified extensively about his conversation with Mr. Sanchez at trial, mere testimony about a conversation that happened to also be recorded is insufficient to trigger rule 106. From the record, it is clear that Detective Reyes used the transcript on multiple occasions to refresh his recollection under rule 612 of the Utah Rules of Evidence. The prosecution's use of the transcript to refresh Detective Reyes's recollection at trial provided Mr. Sanchez with specific options of which he may take advantage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH R. EVID. 612(b) (providing the adverse party with options when a writing is used to refresh memory). But it is unclear from the record if the prosecution ever directly quoted from the transcript when questioning Detective Reyes or if Detective Reyes quoted directly from\n   the transcript when responding to questions from the prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b624 We need not reach the issues of whether rule 106 would apply to the prosecution's use of the transcript or require the admission of statements that would otherwise be inadmissible hearsay. Moreover, we decline to answer such an important question in a case where we have serious doubts about the threshold applicability of rule 106, especially given the importance of the question of whether rule 106 can defeat other rules of evidence that work against admissibility, such as the rules on hearsay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is unnecessary to decide these issues in this case because we conclude that any potential error was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b625 Because of the importance of the issue and our decision not to reach the question in this case despite the State challenging the court of appeals' decision, we vacate the portion of the court of appeals decision on rule 106.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Therefore, we vacate the court of appeals' decision on the extreme emotional distress standard but uphold their conclusion on other grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   2. There Is No Reasonable Likelihood That a Jury Would Have Concluded That Mr. Sanchez Was Subjectively Under Extreme Emotional Distress at the Time He Caused the Victim's Death\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b650 Based on the evidence that would have been admitted under rule 106,\n   there is no reasonable likelihood that a jury would believe that Mr. Sanchez was subjectively under extreme emotional distress at the time of the victim's murder. Defense counsel was given an opportunity to proffer the evidence he would have introduced under rule 106. This proffer only contained two pieces of testimony relevant to extreme emotional distress. First, the detective testified that Mr. Sanchez said he was \"enraged\" when he found out that the victim was cheating on him with his brother, and \"that's when he began the assault.\" Second, at some unidentified part of the assault, Mr. Sanchez asked the victim to say she would not cheat again, \"but she wouldn't\" say that, and \"that hurt [his] feelings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b651 If they had been admitted, these two statements would have been the only evidence introduced at trial that would be relevant to the defendant's ability to meet the special mitigation standard. However, when these two statements are considered against the backdrop of the other evidence introduced at trial, we are satisfied that there is no reasonable likelihood that a jury would find by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant proved he was subjectively acting under extreme emotional distress when he killed the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b652 The two proffered statements only show that (1) Mr. Sanchez was enraged at the beginning of the torture and (2) at some unknown point during the torture he asked the victim to say she would stop cheating, and, when she would not, he had hurt feelings. But having \"hurt feelings\" simply does not demonstrate that Mr. Sanchez's \"reason [was] overborne by intense feelings, such as passion, anger, distress, grief, excess agitation, or other similar emotions.\"\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10399378\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/753/439/#p471\">\n    753 P.2d at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And there is no evidence that would allow a jury to consider\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   Mr. Sanchez was suffering those \"hurt feelings\" during his attack on the victim. Without that information, the jury would have no evidence to connect those \"hurt feelings\" with the time that Mr. Sanchez caused the victim's death. And the statute requires that the actor be \"under the influence of\n   <em>\n    extreme\n   </em>\n   emotional distress,\" not just \"hurt feelings,\" \"when the actor causes the death of another.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-5-205.5(1) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2046\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2046\">\n    \u00b6 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring the extreme emotional reaction and loss of self-control to be contemporaneous).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b653 Similarly, there is no evidence that Mr. Sanchez continued to feel \"enraged\" beyond the beginning of the attack. In fact, the two statements, taken together, make it clear that although Mr. Sanchez was \"enraged\" when he initiated his attack on the victim, at some point during that attack, his emotional level was downgraded to \"hurt feelings.\" And there is no evidence that Mr. Sanchez again became enraged, or was under any other \"intense feeling[ ]\" that would qualify for extreme emotional distress. This solitary statement only possibly demonstrates that Mr. Sanchez was enraged at least seven hours before the victim's death. This does not show that any extreme emotional reaction Mr. Sanchez may have had was contemporaneous with his loss of self-control that led to the death of the victim. Nor does it show that he was subjectively under the influence of extreme emotional distress when he caused the victim's death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b654 When evaluating these statements, even considered in isolation, we see no reasonable likelihood that a jury would find by a preponderance of the evidence that Mr. Sanchez was subjectively under the influence of extreme emotional distress when he murdered the victim. Considering the other evidence presented at trial, it becomes even less likely that the jury would reach such a conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b655 There was significant evidence introduced at trial that Mr. Sanchez was not experiencing \"a loss of self-control and that [his] reason [was not] overborne by intense\n   feelings\" at the time he caused the victim's death.\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10399378\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/753/439/#p471\">\n    753 P.2d at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Several times during the torture, Mr. Sanchez attempted to undo or minimize the damage he had done. On multiple occasions, when the victim lost consciousness, Mr. Sanchez attempted to resuscitate her by breathing on her behalf. He also brought the victim to the bathroom and ran her head under water to try to wake her up and clean blood off her face. Additionally, Mr. Sanchez used hydrogen peroxide to try and clean the victim up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b656 Although Mr. Sanchez engaged in a brutal attack on the victim, there were multiple quiet periods of up to five minutes from one to six a.m. Over two hours before Mr. Sanchez finally strangled the victim, the downstairs neighbor stopped hearing frequent noises. And around an hour before the victim's death, the police showed up to the apartment, specifically listened at the door to see if they could hear noises coming from inside, and were unable to hear a sound. Unlike the previous hours, there were no indications of tumultuous conduct around the time of the victim's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b657 The deliberation and thought that Mr. Sanchez displayed when finally strangling the victim also helps discredit any notion that his ability to reason was overborne by intense feelings to such a point that his \"ability to make a rational choice [was] overwhelmingly and substantially undermined.\"\n   <em>\n    Lambdin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2046\">\n    2017 UT 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 39, --- P.3d ----.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Mr. Sanchez began his final attempt to strangle the victim, he had the wherewithal to recognize that the method he was using was not working. Mr. Sanchez was able to use enough reason to change to a second method of strangling. And when the second method was similarly proving ineffective, he had the capacity to reason that he needed to try a third, and finally successful, method. A person subjectively suffering from extreme emotional distress-a person who has lost self-control and whose ability to reason is \"overborne by intense feelings\" to the point that his ability to think logically was \"overwhelmingly and substantially undermined\"-would not be capable of such a calculated choice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b658 Overall, Mr. Sanchez's minimal proffered evidence creates little, if any, potential argument that he was subjectively under the influence of extreme emotional distress when he finally caused the victim's death. And that argument becomes even more tenuous when considered with the other evidence presented at trial. Under this special mitigation statute, Mr. Sanchez bore the burden of proving extreme emotional distress by a preponderance of the evidence. Frankly, we see no reasonable likelihood that a jury would find that Mr. Sanchez had met his burden of proving that he was subjectively under extreme emotional distress. Therefore, if there were any error in not admitting the proffered evidence under rule 106, that error would be harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b659 We again leave open the question of when rule 106 can apply to writings or recorded statements not actually introduced into evidence and whether rule 106 defeats other rules of evidence that preclude admissibility. Since the court of appeals unnecessarily reached the issue of whether rule 106 overcomes other rules that preclude admissibility, and we do not weigh in on the issue, we vacate the rule 106 portion of the court of appeals' decision. Therefore, without deciding that the trial court's rule 106 determination was erroneous, we reach a determination as to the harmlessness of an error if it existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b660 We conclude that if there were any error, it would have had no effect on the outcome of the case because there is no reasonable likelihood that any jury would have found that Mr. Sanchez was subjectively under extreme emotional distress at the time he committed the murder. Because the court of appeals reached its conclusion under an incorrect standard for whether a defendant was objectively under extreme emotional distress, we vacate that portion of the\n   court of appeals' decision. We affirm the court of appeals on alternative grounds.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Utah Rule of Evidence 106 provides that \"[i]f a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party may require the introduction, at that time, of any other part-or any other writing or recorded statement-that in fairness ought to be considered at the same time.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    While defense counsel emphasized the victim's \"sexual relations\" with Mr. Sanchez's brother in his opening statement, he was unable to put any evidence on this point before the jury.
