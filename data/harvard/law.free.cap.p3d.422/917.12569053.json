STW argues that the superior court did not have the authority to conduct a pre-election review of the proposed initiatives, that the superior court erred by determining that various provisions were beyond the scope of the local initiative power and conflicted with state law, and that the injunction violated STW's right to free speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 We hold that the superior court had the authority to review whether the proposed initiatives exceeded the scope of the local initiative power and that its review did not offend separation of power principles. We also hold that the superior court properly determined that the challenged provisions were beyond the scope of the local initiative power and that one of the provisions conflicted with state law. Finally, we hold that the injunction preventing the initiatives from appearing on the ballot did not violate STW's right to free speech. Consequently, we affirm the superior court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 In 2016, STW, a political committee, began circulating two initiative petitions among Tacoma residents in order to place the proposed initiatives on the upcoming municipal ballot. One initiative proposed an amendment to the Tacoma City Charter (Charter Initiative) and the other sought to enact a new municipal ordinance. The two initiatives contained text that was substantially identical in effect. The following are the provisions of common effect that are of significance to this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [From the Charter Initiative]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (A) People's Vote on Large Water Use Applications [ (Water Provision) ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   .... Before providing water utility service to any applicant for 1336 CCF [ (centum cubic feet) ] (one million gallons), or more, of water daily from the City, the City shall place the applicant's request for water utility service before the voters on the next available General Election Ballot, in a manner substantially conforming to the rules for Section 2.22 of this Charter. The applicant shall pay for the costs of the vote of the people. Only if a majority of the voters approve the water utility service application and all other application requirements are met may the City provide the service. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (B) Sustainable Water Protection is an Inviolable Right that Government Cannot Infringe [ (Preemption Provision) ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   .... The People's Right to Water Protection vote provides a democratic safeguard, on top of the City's existing application process, to ensure that large new water users do not threaten the sustainability of the people's water supply. To prevent subsequent denial of the People's Right to Water Protection by state law preemption, all laws adopted by the legislature of the State of Washington, and rules adopted by any state agency, shall be the law of City of Tacoma only to the extent that they do not violate the rights or mandates of this Article.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (C) Water Protection supersedes Corporate Interests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   As the People's Right to Water Protection is foundational to the people's health, safety, and welfare, and must be held inviolate, no government actor, including the courts, will recognize as valid any permit, license, privilege, charter, or other authorization, that would violate the rights or mandate of this Article, issued for any corporation, by any state, federal, or international entity. [Subordination of Judicial Review Provision]. In addition, corporations that violate, or seek to violate the rights and mandates of this Article shall not be deemed \"persons\" to the extent that such treatment would interfere with the rights or mandates enumerated by this Article, nor shall corporations possess any other legal rights, powers, privileges, immunities, or duties that would interfere with the rights or mandates enumerated by this Article [ (Subordination of Corporate Rights Provision) ]. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (D) Enforcement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The City or any resident of the City may enforce this section through an action brought in any court possessing jurisdiction over activities occurring within the City of Tacoma, including, but not limited to, seeking an injunction to stop prohibited practices. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [From the initiative amending Tacoma ordinance](E) Severability and Construction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The provisions of this Ordinance shall be liberally construed to achieve the defined intent of the voters. The provisions of this Ordinance are severable, and the petitioners intend that all valid provisions of the initiative be placed on the ballot and enacted into law even if some provisions are found invalid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 28-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b64 On June 6, 2016, the Port, the Economic Development Board for Tacoma-Pierce County, and the Tacoma-Pierce County Chamber filed a complaint in superior court for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against STW, various sponsors of that organization, the City and the Pierce County Auditor. The City filed an answer to the complaint, which included cross-claims against STW and the additional parties named as defendants. The City then filed a motion for a preliminary and a permanent injunction to prevent STW's initiatives from appearing on the municipal ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b65 On July 1, the superior court granted the Port's motion for declaratory judgment and permanently enjoined the Pierce County Auditor from placing the initiatives on the 2016 ballot. The court determined that the Water Provision, Part A in the excerpt above, concerned an administrative matter beyond the scope of the local initiative power. The court further ruled that the Water Provision conflicted with state law and determined also that the Preemption Provision,\n   Part B above, was beyond the scope of the local initiative power because the provision attempted to subordinate all other law to the Water Provision. The court additionally determined that the Subordination of Corporate Rights Provision, part of Part C above, was beyond the scope of the local initiative power because it attempted to alter corporations' rights under existing law. Similarly, the court ruled that the Subordination of Judicial Review Provision, part of Part C above, was beyond the scope of the local initiative power because it conflicted with existing law. Finally, the court concluded that the remaining initiative provisions were not severable and that no portion of the initiatives could be placed on the ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b66 According to the declaration of Sherry Bockwinkel, STWs signature collection effort \"stalled when people heard that [STW] was being sued for circulating the petition\" and its \"signature turn-ins\" went down.

The court deemed the ordinances to be time, place, and manner restrictions and held that such restrictions on speech that are viewpoint-neutral but subject-matter based are valid so long as they are narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest and leave open ample alternative channels of communication.\n   <em>\n    Collier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1365805\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/121/737/\">\n    121 Wash.2d at 752-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=854%20P.2d%201046\">\n    854 P.2d 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court then concluded that the ordinances' durational requirements failed this test and therefore violated the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, section 5 of the Washington Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 758-60,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=854%20P.2d%201046\">\n    854 P.2d 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b635 For several reasons, the holdings and rationale of\n   <em>\n    Collier\n   </em>\n   do not serve STW's position. First, the challenged injunction before us does not classify speech on the basis of subject matter or content as did the measures in\n   <em>\n    Collier\n   </em>\n   . Instead, the injunction rests on the principles that a measure is beyond the local initiative power if it is administrative or in conflict with state law. Neither the injunction nor the principles on which it is based distinguish among measures or in associated speech activities on the basis of content or subject matter. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Collier\n   </em>\n   does not show that the injunction at issue violates article I, section 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b636 Second, if the inquiry into whether a measure is administrative or in conflict with state law were deemed to make it content-based, STW's position would still reduce to the claim that it has a constitutional right to place an initiative on the ballot, without regard to the scope of the initiative power under state law. As noted above, the Ninth Circuit held to the contrary with respect to the First Amendment in\n   <em>\n    Angle\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Collier\n   </em>\n   did not decide whether placing a local initiative on the ballot constitutes political speech protected under article I, section 5, and STW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   cites to no other authority for its contention that pre-election review of a local initiative violates article I, section 5. For these reasons also, we hold that the injunction at issue does not violate article I, section 5 under\n   <em>\n    Collier\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b637 The superior court had authority to review whether the proposed initiatives exceeded the scope of the local initiative power, and its review did not offend the separation of powers. In exercising that authority, the superior court properly determined that the challenged provisions were beyond the scope of the local initiative power and that one of the provisions conflicted with state law. Finally, the injunction preventing the initiatives from appearing on the ballot did not violate STW's right to free speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b638 We affirm the superior court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Worswick, P.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Melnick, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    STW's notice of appeal states that Sherry Bockwinkel, Donna Walters, and Jon and Jane Does 1-5, defendants in the case before the superior court, are not participating in this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Although STW refers to both article I, sections 4 and 5 of the Washington Constitution as part of its argument, it has not cited to any cases for an analysis of this issue under article I, section 4. We do not consider conclusory arguments unsupported by citation to authority or rational argument. RAP 10.3(a)(6) ;\n    <em>\n     Cowiche Canyon Conservancy v. Bosley\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372147\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/118/801/#p809\">\n     118 Wash.2d 801\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 809,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=828%20P.2d%20549\">\n     828 P.2d 549\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1992). Therefore, we do not separately consider STW's claims under article I, section 4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    With the holdings in this opinion, it is unnecessary to reach any other issues raised by the parties.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
