Defendant assigns error to the trial court's admission of printed internet pages that advertised prostitution services. In his first three assignments, he contends that the trial court erred in ruling that the advertisements were admissible under OEC 404(3)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to prove defendant's plan or \"general prostitution enterprise,\" and that the trial court abused its discretion under OEC 403\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in determining\n   that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect. In his fourth assignment, he contends that the advertisements contained out-of-court statements made by declarants who did not testify at trial and, therefore, that they were admitted in violation of OEC 802\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We conclude that the advertisements did not contain hearsay because they were verbal acts that were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted in them, and, thus, the admission of the advertisements did not violate OEC 802 or defendant's right under Article I, section 11, to confront witnesses. However, we conclude that the trial court erred in\n   admitting the advertisements as nonpropensity evidence of defendant's plan to commit the charged crimes and that the error was not harmless with respect to defendant's convictions for attempted promoting prostitution and attempted compelling prostitution. We therefore reverse and remand defendant's convictions on Counts 1, 10, and 11, and otherwise affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.

A was struggling financially and living in a hotel. She considered engaging in prostitution so that she could afford to rent an apartment. Defendant was living at that time with three women, Young, Wilson, and Holman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Early in their relationship, defendant asked A to engage in an act of prostitution with Wilson and Holman, but A refused. After about two and one-half months, A and defendant's relationship became violent; on one occasion, defendant choked A after she refused to have sex with him and another woman. When defendant learned that A had had sex with a pimp, he pushed and kicked A and took money from her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant told A that, if she wanted her money back, she would have to listen to what he said, and he urged her to begin prostituting herself. A believed that defendant would leave her if she did not prostitute herself. At first, A tried to prostitute herself on the \"track\" along 82nd Avenue in Portland, but she was not offered enough money by prospective customers for her to agree to engage in sexual acts with them. Defendant encouraged A to keep trying, explaining that the money would add up. A became frustrated and sent a text message to defendant, \"I will never again walk the track for anyone. I'm not that desperate for cash.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant suggested that A place prostitution advertisements on the internet-specifically on craigslist. com and backpage.com-rather than walk the track. He took photos of A for use in the advertisements and paid for the advertisements with Young's credit card. Defendant also rented hotel rooms and gave A ecstasy to facilitate her prostitution transactions. Although A received responses to the online advertisements, she ultimately refused to have sex with any of the customers because they wanted to have unprotected sex with her. Defendant became angry and threw a chair at A, accusing her of wasting the money that he had spent on the hotel rooms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At one point, he sent a text to A, demanding that she \"[put her] info back up on the post.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 21, 2014, A sent defendant several text messages telling him that she wanted to make him happy by putting \"money in his pocket.\" She told him that she was \"trying\" and assured him that she would walk the track. When defendant ignored the text messages, A responded, \"I know I'm getting brushed off, 'cause I'm not waving $800 in your face.\" A knew from looking at messages on defendant's phone that \"the girls who are offering him money are getting a lot more responses than the girls who aren't.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant asked A to place an internet advertisement for a \"two-girl special.\" He told her that he wanted her to do the \"special\" with Wilson or Holman. A told defendant that she was uncomfortable with engaging in prostitution with either of them. Knowing that he would be angry with her because of her response, A sent defendant a text asking him \"to wait to beat [her] ass\" until after she dropped her son off at her mother's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At around noon the day of the exchange of text messages between defendant and A, defendant picked up A and her son at her home. Defendant was angry, and, while A was trying to put her son's car seat into defendant's car, defendant assaulted A from behind, causing an abrasion to her shoulder. When A turned around, defendant hit her in the face, cutting her lip. A got in the passenger seat and began arguing with defendant. Defendant then shot A in the left leg with a small-caliber handgun, causing her to suffer extreme pain and to vomit out of the window.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A asked defendant to drop her son off at her mother's house, which he did. Defendant then drove to his house nearby, where he gave A ecstasy and prescription painkillers. Cach, a friend of defendant's who was also a nurse's assistant, came over and bandaged A's leg wound. When Cach asked defendant what had happened, he replied, \"What happens when you waste my time?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant drove A to a motel where his cousin and two other women were staying. He left A with a laptop, instructing her to take a shower and place an advertisement on backpage.com. When A failed to post the advertisement, defendant hit A in the face and stomach and then instructed her to get into his car. After she got into defendant's car, he hit her in the face a few more times. Defendant told A that she \"could either stop playing around with his time and with his money and buckle down and be serious,\" or he could let her go and \"the next time he sees [her] he's going to kill [her] with whoever [she's] with.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant and A separated at around 10:00 p.m. near a local high school. Defendant told A that he was going to leave for a few hours to give her time to \"think about what [she] wanted to choose to do,\" and told her to text him \"when [she] was ready.\" He then threatened to kill her if she contacted the police. A locked herself in a bathroom at the school and called an acquaintance for a ride. She also sent her mother a text message telling her that defendant had shot her, after which A's mother called 9-1-1. While A waited for her friend to arrive, she sent defendant several text messages. First, she told defendant to stay away from her and her family. Then, an hour later, she sent defendant a message asking him to take her and her son to Minnesota with him, stating, \"My family doesn't get it. I'm not going to square up. I will go to rehab and get some help, but I'm not a square, nor will I ever be.\" Defendant did not respond to those messages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A then called the police. In a recorded 9-1-1 call, she explained that defendant had shot her and that she wanted to go to a hospital. When the police arrived, A told an officer that her boyfriend had shot her because he was upset that she had recently cheated on him and because she \"did it for free\" instead of making him money. A explained that she was disrespecting defendant and told the police that she had placed an advertisement on craigslist.com to \"make him happy.\" She also said that defendant had threatened to hurt her \"if she didn't obey him regarding that.\" At the hospital, the police questioned A again, and she repeated her story. She told a detective that she prostituted \"for herself for stability,\" but added that she believed that\n   defendant shot her because she had cheated on him \"for free,\" without making him any money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The police ultimately arrested defendant and took two cellphones from him at his arrest. Defendant gave the police permission to search the content of those phones, including his contact list, call log, text messages, and photographs. The police found over 700 contacts in defendant's phones. Detective Cui began to \"run\" some of the phone numbers listed as contacts in defendant's phone. After running less than 25 percent of the contacts, Cui found 10 to 15 phone numbers that were connected to online prostitution advertisements. Cui conducted an internet search of defendant's phone number and found a July 23, 2011, advertisement on backpage.com for \"Nina,\" which was a nickname for Wilson. Cui also found photographs in defendant's cellphone that were similar to the photographs in the July 23, 2011, advertisement, as well as a text message that said, \"Hi Nina.\" Cui showed the advertisement to A, who identified the woman in the photographs as Wilson. Cui found two additional advertisements featuring Wilson and Holman dated September 13, 2011, and November 9, 2011. Those advertisements were not directly connected to defendant by his phone number, and they were placed at a time that defendant was not having phone contact with either Holman or Wilson. The police subsequently recovered a .25-caliber bullet that was embedded in a door of defendant's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Defendant's Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Young, the mother of one of defendant's children and defendant's best friend, testified that she was unaware that defendant was involved in prostitution activities. She testified that, in the summer of 2011, she lived with defendant and a number of other individuals, including her and defendant's son, defendant's girlfriend (Holman), and her friends (Wilson and Red). During that time, the cellphone that police had linked to the online advertisements was not used exclusively by defendant but operated as the house phone. Young testified that she had thrown her son out of the house in the summer of 2011 because she believed that he was engaging in prostitution activities with Holman. After defendant was arrested, Young had frequent phone contact with defendant while he was in jail. Those calls were recorded and, on cross examination, the state introduced them into evidence. In one of the calls, defendant told Young that he \"never received a wooden nickel\" from A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant testified that, when he met A, she was living in a dirty hotel with her son. He began a sexual relationship with her and often helped her care for her son, which gradually led defendant to feel concern for A's son. Defendant believed that, after his affections for A began to wane, A tried to use her son as \"a hook\" to get him to spend time with her, and that she would offer him money to assist her with her son. Defendant denied that he had encouraged A to place prostitution advertisements on the internet and testified that A's text messages to him on October 21 had nothing to do with prostitution. When confronted with his text message to A stating, \"Put your info back on the post,\" defendant stated that the message was about A soliciting clients for the Golden Dragon strip club, which was having trouble attracting patrons because it served juice and not alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant denied assaulting and shooting A on October 21 and stated that he did not own or carry a gun; he said that the gun belonged to A. Defendant testified that, while she was in the car with him, A began complaining that her toes were cold and that her leg was \"getting worse.\" He claimed that he did not know how she had been injured, but he could see that she had an injury to her calf. According to defendant, A said that she did not want to go to the doctor, so he called Cach and asked for her help in tending to A's wound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant explained that he had two phones because one of the phones had a cracked screen and barely functioned; he also testified that one of the phones was considered to be a house phone and was used by other members of the household. Defendant denied being involved in any prostitution-related activities and stated that he never used his phone to post internet prostitution advertisements. He testified that he was unaware\n   that Holman and Wilson had been posting such advertisements while they were living with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Defendant's Motion To Exclude Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant moved before trial to exclude all of the evidence obtained through Cui's inspection of defendant's phone records, including sixteen online advertisements offering prostitution services. One of the advertisements contained defendant's cellphone number and photographs of Wilson that were similar to photographs found on defendant's cellphone; two of the other advertisements contained photographs of Wilson and Holman; and the remainder of the advertisements contained phone numbers that were listed in defendant's contact list on his cellphone. Defendant argued that none of the advertisements was admissible under OEC 404(3) because none was relevant for any nonpropensity purpose. Alternatively, he argued that, to the extent that any of the evidence was admissible under OEC 404(3), it should be excluded because its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Defendant argued further that the advertisements contained inadmissible hearsay and that their admission would violate his constitutional right to confront witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In response, the state argued that all of the other-acts evidence that defendant sought to exclude was relevant to show defendant's plan or common scheme in promoting prostitution. The state explained that a detective would testify \"that prostitution and human trafficking is not a crime that occurs in a singular nature. It's an ongoing pattern-type crime.\" Thus, the state argued, the advertisements were relevant as \"direct evidence of a plan or a scheme of an ongoing human trafficking enterprise.\" The state also argued that the advertisements were direct evidence that defendant was attempting to promote A as a prostitute, because some of the advertisements involved Wilson and Holman, the women with whom defendant had asked A to engage in acts of prostitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The trial court admitted the evidence, adopting the state's argument that it was relevant to defendant's plan or common scheme. The court also concluded that the evidence was admissible under OEC 403 because the probative value of the evidence outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice. The court did not specifically address defendant's hearsay and confrontation arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Hearsay and Confrontation\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant challenges the trial court's admission of the online prostitution advertisements, renewing his argument that the advertisements contained inadmissible hearsay statements of non-testifying witnesses and that their admission as evidence violated his right under Article I, section 11, to confront witnesses. We review the trial court's ruling on those issues for legal error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Kaino-Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12168390\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/277/516/#p523\">\n    277 Or.

The state contends that defendant's objections were perfunctory and did not alert the trial court to his argument\n   on appeal. We disagree. Before trial, defendant expressed concern about the admission of the online prostitution advertisements, stating \"I'm concerned if we're talking about these * * * Backpage.com ads, [be]cause again we get into a hearsay and a confrontation problem. These women are not coming in as witnesses. We have no ability to cross-examine them.\" Then, when the state offered the first of the advertisements as evidence at trial, defendant objected, citing \"relevance, confrontation issues and the fact that the document itself is hearsay.\" After the state offered the remainder of the advertisements into evidence, defendant objected, again citing his confrontation right as a basis for his objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant's objections, coupled with his pretrial assertions, were sufficient to provide the trial court with an explanation of his objections that the online advertisements contained inadmissible hearsay and that their admission would violate his constitutional right to confrontation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

A person is guilty of compelling prostitution when the person knowingly \"[u]ses force or intimidation to compel another to engage in prostitution or attempted prostitution.\" ORS 167.017(1)(a). Thus, an act of prostitution can serve as direct evidence of an element of both crimes.

The state contends that the trial court did not err in admitting the evidence, but the state has abandoned on appeal the argument that it made at trial that the advertisements were relevant to prove defendant's plan. Instead, the state argues, for the first time on appeal, that the evidence was relevant to show defendant's intent. That is, the state asserts that \"the advertisements were relevant [to] support the state's theory that defendant acted with intent to promote prostitution when he demanded that [A] post online advertisements.\" The state argues that the advertisements \"also allowed the state to rebut the defendant's theory that his demands had an innocent explanation.\" In a supplemental brief, the state argues that, even if the advertisements were not relevant for a nonpropensity purpose under OEC 404(3), they were nevertheless relevant as propensity evidence under OEC 404(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   OEC 404(3) provides that \"[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in\n   order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.\" However, other-acts evidence may be admissible for other purposes, including to prove \"motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\" The Supreme Court has explained that OEC 404(4)\"supersedes the first sentence of OEC 404(3)\" by making other-acts evidence\n   <em>\n    admissible\n   </em>\n   to prove a defendant's character.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The state failed to demonstrate a high degree of similarity between the online advertisements involving Wilson, Holman, and other women and defendant's commands to A to place internet prostitution advertisements. To the extent that the online advertisements were connected to defendant, the state adduced no evidence that defendant had ordered or forced any of the women to post the advertisements. There was not even evidence to suggest that defendant had\n   <em>\n    asked\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    en\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    couraged\n   </em>\n   the women to post online prostitution advertisements. The advertisements themselves were not sufficient to show that defendant had a spurious plan to command women to engage in acts of prostitution, in the same way that he allegedly commanded A to do that. At most, they demonstrated that defendant associated with women who engaged in online acts of prostitution. Thus, the trial court erred in admitting the advertisements for the nonpropensity purpose of demonstrating defendant's plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The state offers two alternative theories of admissibility on appeal-first, that the advertisements were relevant to prove intent and, second, that they were relevant as propensity evidence under OEC 404(4).
