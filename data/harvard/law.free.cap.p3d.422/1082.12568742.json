Because we conclude that the sale of Empire's fuel truck was exempt from transaction privilege tax, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 The facts in this case are undisputed. Empire is an equipment retailer operating in Arizona. In 2014, Empire sold a modified Caterpillar 777G WT truck (the Truck) to the Pinto Valley Mine (the Mine) for use in its open pit copper mining operation. Pinto uses the Truck to transport fuel and lubricants from the Mine rim to equipment located in the pit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Empire added $121,777.68 in transaction privilege tax to the Truck's purchase price, but Pinto refused to pay the tax claiming the Truck was exempt from tax pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) section 42-5061(B)(2) (2018), which exempts equipment used directly in the process of extracting ores or minerals from the earth. Empire paid the tax itself and, thereafter, sought a refund, which the Department denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 After an unsuccessful administrative appeal, Empire filed a complaint in tax court. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The tax court granted Empire's motion and denied the Department's motion finding that the Truck qualified for the tax exemption. The Department timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) and -170(C) (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 The sole issue on appeal is whether the Truck is exempt from transaction privilege tax pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 42-5061(B)(2).

The court determined that the following items were exempt from use tax: (1) spare and replacement parts for machinery and equipment, (2) a conveyor belt used to transport ore between crushers, (3) steel pipes used to transport slurry from the mill to flotation tanks, and (4) booster pumps needed to transport water to the mill.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 205-06,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1592195\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/116/200/#p204\">\n    568 P.2d at 1103-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The prominence of an item's role in maintaining a harmonious \"integrated synchronized system\" with the indisputably exempt items will also directly correlate with the likelihood that the exemption applies.

More recently, in\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   , this court applied A.R.S. \u00a7 42-5061(B)(2) to conclude that \"industrial oils and greases used in mining and metallurgical operations ... are exempt from the transaction privilege tax.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Chevron,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041622\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/238/519/#p520\">\n    238 Ariz. at 520, \u00b6 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041622\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/238/519/#p520\">\n    363 P.3d at 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 11 Here, the Department argues the Truck is not used directly in the process of extracting ore from the earth. Rather, the Department describes the Truck's use as fulfilling \"the ancillary support or maintenance role of transporting fuel and lubricants to the exempt mining equipment.\" Following the lead of our supreme court in\n   <em>\n    Capitol Castings\n   </em>\n   , we apply the \"integrated rule\" test to evaluate the Department's contention. In doing so, we answer the three questions identified in\n   <em>\n    Duval Sierrita\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duval Sierrita,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1592195\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/116/200/#p204\">\n    116 Ariz. at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1592195\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/116/200/#p204\">\n    568 P.2d at 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 12 First, the Truck is necessary to the Mine's production.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1592195\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/116/200/#p204\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As explained in Empire's statement of facts below, the Truck transports fuel and lubricants from the pit rim to equipment located several hundred feet below, including shovels, drills, bulldozers, and front-end loaders. The drills and shovels require refueling every twelve hours of operation. The shovel would lose eight hours of production time if it had to be moved from the pit floor to the pit rim for refueling. Likewise, the drill would lose four hours of production time. Thus, by servicing the mining equipment in the pit, the Truck permits the equipment to operate twenty-four hours per day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 13 Second, the Truck is close, physically and causally, to the ore.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1592195\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/116/200/#p204\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Truck comes near the ore when it services the equipment in the pit. Moreover, the function of the Truck is causally related to the efficient extraction of the ore from the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 14 Third and finally, the Truck operates harmoniously with the admittedly exempt drills, shovels, loaders, and dozers as part of an integrated synchronized system.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1592195\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/116/200/#p204\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As reflected in the record, the Truck \"continuously services all of the Pit Equipment to keep it operating 24 hours per day.\" The Department itself agreed that \"[w]ithout the Truck, the need to take the equipment to fueling and lubricating stations would result in significant periods of stoppage and severely limit copper production.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 15 On appeal, the Department argues that the Truck \"does not perform extraction activities as defined in the statute but instead supports the extraction equipment.\" In\n   <em>\n    Duval Sierrita\n   </em>\n   , this court found that steel pipes that transported slurry from the mill to the flotation tanks were used directly in copper mining.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duval Sierrita\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1592195\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/116/200/#p204\">\n    116 Ariz. at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1592195\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/116/200/#p204\">\n    568 P.2d at 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Given the ordinary meaning of the statute's text, the fuel truck used to fuel other machinery is not used directly in the process of extracting ores or minerals from the earth and, thus, would not be exempt from transaction privilege tax. But\n   <em>\n    Capitol Castings\n   </em>\n   precludes that result. Therefore, I reluctantly agree with our holding that after application of the integrated rule test, the superior court did not err in granting summary judgment for Empire, finding that its fuel truck was exempt from the transaction privilege tax.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
