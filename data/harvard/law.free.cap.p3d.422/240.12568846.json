In response to that question, defendant disclosed that he was carrying a knife, which led to his conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, ORS 166.240(1). Defendant contends that the officer's question unlawfully extended the stop because, the officer lacked an objectively reasonable, circumstance-specific perception that defendant posed a danger, as required by Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Court of Appeals agreed with defendant and reversed his conviction, emphasizing that nothing about defendant's conduct during the encounter gave the officer a reason to be concerned for his safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We allowed the state's petition for review of that decision and now reverse. We held in\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   that the constitutional standard for an officer to\n   <em>\n    ask\n   </em>\n   a lawfully detained citizen about weapons is less demanding than the particularized reasonable suspicion that Article I, section 9, requires before the officer may\n   <em>\n    search\n   </em>\n   the citizen for weapons.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n    357 Or. at 427-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n    353 P.3d 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Article I, section 9, does not prohibit law enforcement officers from asking about the presence of weapons during a lawful stop if (1) \"the officer perceived a circumstance-specific danger and decided that an inquiry about weapons was necessary to address that danger;\" and (2) \"the officer's perception and decision were objectively reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n    at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n    353 P.3d 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude that the officer in this case perceived a circumstance-specific of danger, within the meaning of\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   , based on his explanation of the risk of performing late-night field sobriety tests on a person whom the officer reasonably suspected\n   was intoxicated. We also conclude that the state met its burden to prove that the officer's perception of danger and decision that a question about firearms was necessary were objectively reasonable.\n   I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In reviewing the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress, we are bound by the court's findings of historical fact if the evidence in the record supports them.\n   <em>\n    State v.

To the extent that the trial court failed to make express findings on pertinent historical facts, we will presume that the trial court found those facts in a manner consistent with its ultimate conclusion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3959263\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/355/812/#p814\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, the pertinent historical and procedural facts are undisputed, except as indicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While defendant was driving late one night, a law enforcement officer\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   saw defendant's car hesitate before proceeding on a green light and then pull off to the side of the road. The officer pulled his marked patrol car in behind defendant's car and asked if defendant needed assistance. Based on his initial encounter with defendant, the officer developed reasonable suspicion that defendant had committed the crime of DUII. The officer asked defendant for his identification and returned to his own car to conduct a records check.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The officer walked back to defendant and asked if he had a firearm with him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, defendant indicated that he \"had a knife on his boot, or leg.\" The officer removed two knives from defendant's boot. The officer then administered field sobriety tests to defendant. He ultimately determined that defendant was not intoxicated but cited defendant for carrying a concealed weapon in violation of ORS 166.240(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant moved to suppress the evidence that the officer had obtained as a result of his question about weapons. Defendant argued to the trial court that the officer's question had unlawfully extended the stop because the officer did not possess a \"reasonable suspicion, based upon specific and articulable facts,\" that defendant posed an \"immediate threat of serious physical injury.\" In support of that argument, defendant elicited testimony from the officer that nothing about defendant's conduct during the encounter had caused the officer to be concerned for his safety:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel:] So he had done absolutely nothing to give you concern that he might attack you at this point, had he?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"[Officer:] No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel:] In fact, he was being civil and cooperative with you, wasn't he?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"[Officer:] Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel:] Not threatening or angry, combative in any way?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[Officer:] That is correct.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court concluded that the officer had asked a reasonable question \"from the standpoint of officer safety\" and denied defendant's motion. Defendant entered a conditional guilty plea to carrying a concealed weapon, but reserving his right to appeal the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 135.335(3) (providing that a defendant may reserve the right to appeal from a conditional plea of guilty or no contest).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   While the case was pending before the Court of Appeals, this court decided\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n    357 Or. 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n    353 P.3d 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying the standard articulated in\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals concluded that the officer had lacked\n   a reasonable circumstance-specific concern that defendant posed a danger and, accordingly, reversed and remanded the judgment of conviction. That court primarily relied on the evidence that nothing about defendant's conduct during the stop had contributed to a perception of danger.\n   <em>\n    State v.

DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We allowed the state's petition for review to consider whether the state proved that the officer perceived an objectively reasonable, circumstance-specific danger that justified the weapons inquiry, despite his acknowledgment that defendant's conduct during the stop was not threatening.

That reasonable suspicion to justify the investigatory stop, however, also defined the constitutionally permissible boundaries of the stop.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

The key issue that this court addressed in\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   was how to determine if the trooper's question about weapons unlawfully extended the stop. We concluded that the test for whether a question about weapons falls within the constitutionally permissible scope of the stop should be the same as the test for questions, generally: \"[W]hen an officer has seized an individual and has a constitutional basis to continue to temporarily detain and question him or her,\" the officer may ask questions that are \"reasonably related to and reasonably necessary to effectuate\" the officer's investigation.\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n    357 Or. at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n    353 P.3d 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the state to prove that a question about weapons meets that test, the state must \"present evidence\n   that (1) the officer perceived a circumstance-specific danger and decided that an inquiry about weapons was necessary to address that danger; and (2) the officer's perception and decision were objectively reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 430,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n    353 P.3d 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In arriving at that conclusion, this court rejected the state's proposed categorical rule that an \"officer always may inquire about weapons\" because \"a weapons inquiry invariably serves to protect officer safety.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n    at 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 426 n. 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n    353 P.3d 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We emphasized that, \"if the officer does not have at least a circumstance-specific safety concern, then the officer's weapons inquiry has no logical relationship to the traffic investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n    at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n    353 P.3d 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, we emphasized, \"if the officer's circumstance-specific safety concerns are not reasonable, then an officer who acts on those concerns violates\" the detained person's Article I, section 9, right to be free from an \" 'unreasonable search, or seizure.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Applying the Jimenez Standard to Resolve this Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Although\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   addressed the constitutional limits on an officer's authority to ask a question during the course of a noncriminal stop, we have held that the same general standard governs the scope of questioning that is permitted during a stop that is based on reasonable suspicion to investigate a crime, as was the stop here: \"[T]he state must be able to point to a 'reasonable, circumstance-specific' relationship between the inquiry and the purpose of the detention.\"\n   <em>\n    Pichardo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187601\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/754/#p762\">\n    360 Or. at 760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187601\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/754/#p762\">\n    388 P.3d 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, there is no dispute that\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   supplies the standard by which this court must evaluate whether the officer's question about weapons had a \"reasonable, circumstance-specific\" relationship to the DUII stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The parties disagree, however, regarding how to apply the\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   standard to the circumstances of this case. As evidence that the officer \"perceived a circumstance-specific danger,\" the state points to his testimony that \"[t]here is absolutely nothing safe about administering field sobriety tests on the side of the road at 12:30 in the morning\"; that, in performing field sobriety tests, \"it's inevitable\" that he is \"going to put [himself] in a compromising situation\"; that it is \"police work 101\" that he would not allow a\n   DUII suspect \"to have a handgun on his person\" during the investigation; and that he decided to ask about the gun for his own safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant emphasizes, however, that the officer admitted that defendant had been civil and cooperative when stopped, and had done nothing during the stop to give the officer reason to believe that defendant presented a threat. Although defendant does not concede that the officer subjectively perceived a danger based on the identified circumstances, the officer's testimony and actions permit a finding that he subjectively held that perception, and we presume that the trial court found that the officer subjectively had suspected that defendant posed a danger because that finding was necessary to the court's ruling on the motion to suppress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holdorf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3959263\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/355/812/#p814\">\n    355 Or. at 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3959263\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/355/812/#p814\">\n    333 P.3d 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, we evaluate defendant's arguments as a challenge to the sufficiency of the circumstances that gave rise to the officer's perception of danger.

The state also failed to prove that the officer's weapons inquiry had been related to any perceived danger. Rather, the record showed that the officer had conversed with the defendant long enough to get the information that would be needed for a citation\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   asking about weapons.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 430,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n    353 P.3d 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As an initial matter, we emphasize that there is no dispute that circumstances specific to defendant gave the officer reasonable suspicion that defendant had been driving while intoxicated. In contrast to\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   , the officer explained that he was concerned for his safety because of the nature of the ongoing interaction needed to investigate whether defendant had committed the crime of DUII. He testified that there is \"absolutely nothing safe about administering field sobriety tests on the side of the road at 12:30 in the morning\" and that, in performing field sobriety tests, it was \"inevitable\" that he was going to be placing himself \"in a compromising situation.\" He also specifically testified to a concern that defendant could be carrying a gun and that it is \"police work 101\" that an officer not allow a DUII suspect \"to have a handgun on his person\" during field sobriety tests. His testimony permitted the trial court to find that the officer perceived a danger based on circumstances specific to this stop and also perceived that it was necessary to ask about weapons to address that danger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The officer's actions also support a finding that he asked his question about a firearm to address his circumstance-specific perception of danger. By asking whether defendant had a firearm before conducting the field sobriety tests, the\n   officer's actions connected his weapons inquiry to his articulated perception of danger in a way that the actions of the officer in\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   did not. Thus, the evidence permitted the trial court to find that the officer here had perceived a danger based on circumstances specific to the stop of defendant and also to find that he had decided that a question about weapons was necessary to address the perceived danger, which in turn permits this court to evaluate whether those perceptions were objectively reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    State's burden to prove objectively reasonable perception\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The parties also dispute whether the state proved that the officer's perception of danger was objectively reasonable. As\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   explains, \"[t]o demonstrate that an officer's weapons inquiry is reasonably related to a traffic investigation and reasonably necessary to effectuate it, the state must present evidence that * * * the officer's perception and decision were objectively reasonable.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n    357 Or. at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n    353 P.3d 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The trial court was permitted to credit the officer's explanation, based on his experience and training, that performing the field sobriety tests would put him \"in a compromising situation\"; that, in addition, \"[t]here is absolutely nothing safe about administering field sobriety tests on the side of\n   the road at 12:30 in the morning\"; and that, to address that risk, he needed to know if defendant was carrying a weapon. The officer identified a specific basis to believe that defendant might be carrying a gun, and he testified that it is \"police work 101\" that an officer not allow a DUII suspect \"to have a handgun on his person\" during the field sobriety tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Although such testimony does not make a question about weapons categorically\n   reasonable, if an officer credibly testifies about an assessment of risk that is based on training and experience, it is appropriate for the court to consider that assessment. Indeed, here, no evidence in the record calls into question the officer's description of the risk to which he would be exposed while performing field sobriety tests late at night if the suspect were intoxicated and carrying a firearm during the tests. On this record, therefore, we conclude that the state met its burden to prove that the officer reasonably perceived a circumstance-specific danger and also reasonably decided that a question about firearms was necessary to address that danger. That perception and decision were not made unreasonable by evidence that defendant displayed a peaceful demeanor, that other cars were driving by, and that light sources illuminated the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We emphasize that it is undisputed that the officer had a constitutional basis to seize and continue to detain defendant. The issue we resolve is whether the officer's single question about a firearm unlawfully extended the stop. Unlike conducting a\n   <em>\n    search\n   </em>\n   for weapons during a lawful stop, which must be justified by reasonable suspicion that the citizen \"might pose an immediate threat of serious physical injury\" and must be based on factors particular to the detained person, asking a\n   <em>\n    question\n   </em>\n   that is reasonably related to and reasonably necessary to effectuate a lawful investigative stop requires no independent constitutional basis and no circumstances particular to the detained person.\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n    357 Or. at 428-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n    353 P.3d 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On this record, we accept the trial court's implicit finding that the officer subjectively perceived a danger from the circumstances attendant to a\n   roadside DUII investigation and decided that an inquiry about weapons was necessary to address that danger. We also conclude that the officer's question was reasonably related to and reasonably necessary to effectuate his DUII investigation because we conclude that he \"perceived a circumstance-specific danger\" that necessitated the question about weapons and that his \"perception and decision [to ask about weapons] were objectively reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n    357 Or. at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364183\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/417/\">\n    353 P.3d 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
