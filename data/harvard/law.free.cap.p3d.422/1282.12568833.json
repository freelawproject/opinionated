The State filed a Supplemental Information alleging one prior felony conviction for sentence enhancement on Counts 1, 2, and 4. Stark filed a motion to quash the Information and Bind Over Order and to suppress the narcotics and firearms evidence, alleging the search yielding the contraband was illegal. The Honorable Gerald Neuwirth sustained on the record Stark's motion to quash and suppress on January 11, 2017, and again by written order dated January 18, 2017. The court found that the warrantless entry into the trailer house under the guise of a protective sweep was a subterfuge and amounted to an illegal search that tainted the later consent search and search conducted pursuant to a search warrant. The State of Oklahoma filed the instant appeal of the district court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 Once the cause was submitted for decision, this Court determined supplementation of the record was necessary to resolve the issues presented. We remanded the case to the district court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the police officers had permission from any lawful occupant to enter the trailer house before officers conducted a protective sweep and whether Stark's presence in the trailer house was with the permission of the home's lessee resident. The district court filed its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law after the evidentiary hearing, finding that Stark had permission to be in the trailer house from the lawful lessee resident and that no lawful occupant gave the officers permission to enter before they conducted the protective sweep of the trailer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 The State of Oklahoma raises four issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   (1) The district court's order granting Appellee's Motion to Quash the Information, Quash the Arrest and to Suppress Evidence should be reversed because Appellee has not established that he has standing to challenge any search of the residence;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (2) The district court erred in its ruling that Officer Witten conducted an illegal search of the residence when it was in fact a protective sweep of the residence for the purpose of officer safety;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (3) The district court erred in its ruling that Officer Witten did not obtain proper consent from the homeowner before conducting any type of search of the residence; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (4) The district court erred in its ruling that the actions of the officers rose to the level of misconduct requiring suppression of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 We reverse the district court's order and remand this matter to the district court for further proceedings for the reasons discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 Siya Menefee called the Lawton Police Department, on October 5, 2015, requesting assistance in retrieving her belongings from inside a trailer house where she had been living. She reported to the dispatcher and to the patrol officers who responded to her call that the men inside, out-of-town visitors of her roommate, had marijuana, cocaine, and guns. She further stated that the men would not let her inside her residence and that she feared for her safety while attempting to retrieve her belongings. Officers knocked on the door with guns drawn in a ready position, removed the men, including Stark, and then made entry for the stated purpose of a \"protective sweep\" based on Ms. Menefee's report of the presence of weapons in the home. The officers secured two firearms in plain view and cleared the home of occupants, with the exception of one man with mobility issues who was seated just inside the front door of the trailer house. The odor of raw marijuana was noticeable. The police informed the lessee\n   resident, whom they had summoned home, of the presence of firearms and the odor of marijuana in her trailer. She consented to a search of her trailer house. Patrol officers found a large amount of marijuana in a backpack in the lessee resident's bedroom and notified special operations. The special operations detectives obtained a search warrant and seized the drugs and guns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b66 The State challenges the district court's order granting Stark's motion to quash and suppress.

At the point in time that the officers knocked on the door of this trailer, they had already obtained from Ms. Meneffee almost exactly the same information officers had in\n   <em>\n    McArthur,\n   </em>\n   and which the Supreme Court found sufficient to support the detention of the occupant outside the residence and the issuance of a search warrant. Specifically, officers had probable cause to believe that the trailer house contained evidence of a crime based on Ms. Menefee's statements. The police had the opportunity to speak with her and make at least a rough assessment of her reliability. The details she provided about the types of guns and drugs inside the trailer house indicated a firsthand knowledge of their presence. The officers had reason to believe that the occupants knew Ms. Menefee was aware of the guns and drugs inside the trailer house and that she was angry enough to call police about being denied admission to retrieve her belongings. The officers had reason to believe the trailer house occupants were aware of their presence, and fearing an imminent entry for Menefee's belongings or a search, would destroy evidence or otherwise pose a threat to the officers or other persons who might interfere with their criminal activity. Armed with this information, the officers took action to confirm the existence of criminal activity by knocking on the door and seizing Stark and the other occupants. The immediate detection of the odor of raw marijuana and observation of guns in plain sight from the doorway instantly confirmed Ms. Menefee's reported accusations. This was a rapidly evolving incident under circumstances giving rise to a reasonable concern about the nature of the danger involved. Understandably the officers conducted a protective sweep for their safety. In an effort to reconcile their law enforcement needs and the demands of personal privacy, the officers obtained consent from the trailer home lessee to search and later obtained a search warrant after finding a large amount of marijuana in a backpack. Based on the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    McArthur,\n   </em>\n   we find the seizure of Stark, the warrantless entry for the protective sweep, and the subsequent searches of the trailer were reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b612 Even assuming, however, for argument's sake that the initial protective sweep was unauthorized and that no valid consent to search was given by the lessee, the search warrant ultimately obtained by officers was sufficiently supported by probable cause not derived from any illegal source to support the search. As noted above, Ms. Menefee's statements provided probable cause to believe criminal activity was afoot inside the trailer. \"Evidence may be admissible where it was discovered through an independent source, or where intervening circumstances break the connection between the illegal government conduct and discovery of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Jacobs v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8991163\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/128/1085/\">\n    2006 OK CR 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8991163\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/128/1085/\">\n    128 P.3d 1085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1087. Hence, the search warrant affidavit, extirpating any information\n   gained after the officers contacted the occupants at the front door, still supported the issuance of the warrant and the resultant search. \"The law is clear that the inclusion of illegally obtained evidence does not vitiate a search warrant otherwise lawfully issued upon probable cause.\"\n   <em>\n    Simon v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1973%20OK%20CR%20429\">\n    1973 OK CR 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10552337\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/515/1161/#p1164\">\n    515 P.2d 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1164.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b613 Deciding the present case upon this narrow ground of extirpating the challenged information from the affidavit and then reviewing for probable cause serves two public policy aims. First, showing preference to searches based upon warrants encourages officers to obtain them rather than relying upon warrantless search exceptions. \"Although in a particular case it may not be easy to determine when an affidavit demonstrates the existence of probable cause, the resolution of doubtful or marginal cases in this area should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

During the evidentiary hearing held by the district court, one of the responding officers testified that Ms. Menefee \"wanted us to go with her to get her stuff. She said she did not want to go in without officers being there because she was in fear of her safety.\" The officer admitted that Ms. Menefee never explicitly stated he could enter, although the context led him to believe she was giving consent for him to enter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b615 The officer's evaluation of his conversation with Ms. Menefee was the only reasonable interpretation under the circumstances to be made of her words and actions. She called police, complaining that armed men with drugs in her house would not let her inside to retrieve her belongings and that she needed officer assistance. If she had no intent to allow the officers inside the trailer, it strains the imagination to determine how exactly she expected the officers to obtain her belongings. Furthermore, it is well-settled that although silence or failure to object cannot manifest one's consent to search, consent can be inferred from one's conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lumpkin v.
