Huffine collaterally challenges the validity of the underlying 2006 protective order and further asserts that pretrial delay denied him a speedy trial in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 Huffine presents the following issues for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    1. Did the District Court err by failing to analyze Huffine's speedy trial claim?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    2. Did the District Court err by denying Huffine's motion to dismiss in which he collaterally challenged the constitutional validity of the 2006 protective order?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 In 2006, Toba Lord filed a petition in the Montana 18th Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, for a permanent order of protection against Huffine. The petition alleged that Huffine stalked Lord and her family and sent numerous unwanted communications causing her to fear for their safety. Huffine failed to appear at the show cause hearing on the petition on November 16, 2006, and the court granted the petition and issued a permanent protective order enjoining Huffine from having contact with Lord and her family. On December 22, 2006, Huffine timely appealed and challenged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the validity of the protective order on the asserted ground that he did not receive notice of the November 2006 hearing upon which the District Court issued the order. He subsequently filed numerous rambling related pro se motions and petitions. On November 14, 2007, we dismissed the appeal on procedural grounds pursuant to M. R. App. P. 12(1)(f) (2007) due to failure to cite to relevant legal authorities and the pertinent portions of the District Court record upon which he asserted error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 In spring 2007, while his appeal was still pending, Huffine again sent numerous letters to Lord's address. In June 2007, the State charged him in the Montana Eighteenth Judicial District Court with\n   one count of stalking and two counts of violating a protective order. At Huffine's request, the court appointed a public defender to represent him. After the State amended the charges to eight counts of violating a protective order in violation of \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA, the matter proceeded to jury trial on January 29, 2009. On the morning of trial, Huffine alleged that the District Court did not have jurisdiction over him, that the court was biased and prejudiced against him, that he had the right to represent himself, that the court unlawfully denied him the right to depose Lord and file legal documents in the case, and that the State failed to provide him with requisite discovery. Later that same day, the court allowed Huffine to leave the courtroom\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and observe the trial via closed-circuit television from another room. On the second day of trial, Huffine returned to the courtroom but the court later excluded him after he ignored repeated warnings to be quiet and allow his counsel to represent him. Huffine did not challenge the validity of the 2006 protective order in the 2007 criminal proceeding. After the jury convicted him on all eight counts of violating a protective order, Huffine timely appealed, asserting only that his 2009 conviction was invalid on the ground\n   that the District Court denied him his constitutional rights to be personally present and represent himself at trial. In March 2010, we affirmed his 2009 conviction.\n   <em>\n    State v. Huffine\n   </em>\n   , 2010 MT 67N,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=355%20Mont.%20550\">\n    355 Mont. 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=228%20P.3d%20452\">\n    228 P.3d 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Between 2013 and 2015, in continued disregard of the 2006 protective order, Huffine sent four additional letters to Lord. On March 4, 2015, the State charged Huffine in Park County Justice Court with four counts of attempted violation of a protective order in violation of \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA. Upon dismissal in Justice Court, the State refiled the charges in District Court on March 19, 2015. After the District Court continued the original April 21st hearing date, Huffine appeared on June 9, 2015, for initial appearance and arraignment. Huffine subsequently filed hundreds of rambling pro se documents challenging the validity of the underlying 2006 protective order due to lack of notice and opportunity to be heard. Lacking pertinent legal citation, cogent legal analysis, and supporting evidentiary showing, Huffine's filings, liberally construed, are best characterized as motions to dismiss. At various hearings on April 21, June 9, July 14, and September 15, 2015, Huffine continued to orally assert that the underlying protective order was invalid, each time without evidentiary\n   showing or request for an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 At a pretrial conference on September 15, 2015, in opposition to the State's August 2015 motion for a trial continuance, Huffine orally objected that the requested continuance would violate his constitutional right to a speedy trial. The District Court overruled the objection and granted the requested continuance on the asserted ground that the 200-day trigger for the constitutional speedy trial analysis had yet to elapse. The court set trial for November 19, 2015, 260 days after the State filed the original charges in Justice Court and 245 days after refiling in District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 At trial on November 19, 2015, upon consideration of Huffine's incessant, unsupported written and oral ramblings, the District Court denied his motions to dismiss on alternative grounds. The court first ruled that Huffine could not, in a subsequent criminal proceeding, collaterally challenge the validity of a protective order previously issued by another court of competent jurisdiction. Additionally, the court ruled that Huffine, in any event, failed to make a threshold evidentiary showing sufficient to support his repeated cursory assertions of procedural error in the 2006 proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Huffine also reiterated his prior and continuing assertion that the November trial date violated his right to a speedy trial. The court advised Huffine to \"[f]eel free to raise that in your appeal.\" The matter ultimately proceeded to trial following which the jury convicted Huffine of four counts of felony violation of a protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Huffine timely appealed. On appeal, Huffine filed numerous pro se documents that may be liberally construed as motions to set aside the guilty verdicts based on the alleged invalidity of the underlying 2006 protective order. Huffine centrally asserts that the delay between the filing of the original Justice Court charges and subsequent District Court trial violated his constitutional rights to a speedy trial and that the underlying 2006 protective order was invalid\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   due to lack of notice of the predicate hearing in violation of his federal and state constitutional due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Whether the pertinent facts manifest a violation of the right to a speedy trial is ultimately a question of law.\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, the State was not a party to the 2006 civil protective order proceeding. The parties to the proceeding were Lord and Huffine. Moreover, we dismissed Huffine's 2006 appeal on purely procedural grounds pursuant to M. R. App. P. 12(1)(f) (2007). Thus, even if collateral estopped applied in this context, our dismissal of Huffine's 2006 appeal would not satisfy at least one of the four elements necessary to preclude a subsequent collateral attack on the constitutional validity of the 2006 protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b618 Our 2010 affirmation of Huffine's criminal conviction for violating the 2006 protective order is another matter. Huffine and the State were both parties to his 2009 criminal conviction and subsequent appeal. As affirmed on appeal, Huffine's conviction on eight counts of violating the 2006 protective order was a final judgment on the merits. Though Huffine did not challenge the validity of the underlying protective order in the 2009 criminal proceeding, collateral estoppel also precludes a party from raising \"a new legal theory or factual assertion\" in a subsequent action involving the same parties if the new issue relates to the same subject matter, is relevant to a related issue previously adjudicated in the prior action, and the party\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   raised the issue in the prior litigation.\n   <em>\n    Mont.

Nevertheless, the threshold validity of the 2006 protective order was directly and inextricably related to the central matter litigated before the District Court in that case, i.e. whether Huffine violated the order as alleged. If so inclined, and to the extent otherwise permissible as a matter of law, he could have challenged the validity of the 2006 protective order in 2009 as he did here in 2015 when again faced with criminal prosecution for violating the order. Thus, if applicable, collateral estoppel would bar Huffine from subsequently challenging the validity of the 2006 protective order in the context of his 2015 criminal case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b620 However, this case presents a fundamental question as to whether collateral estoppel, a common law rule of civil procedure, may apply in a subsequent criminal case to conclusively establish or preclude contest of an essential element of a charged offense. None of the civil cases cited by the State address or support its assertion that it does. While neither this Court nor the United States Supreme Court have addressed the issue, the majority of federal courts of appeal and state appellate courts that have considered it have held that the government may not use res judicata or collateral estoppel to establish or preclude contest of a fact that is an essential element of proof in a subsequent criminal prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bies v.
