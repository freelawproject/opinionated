J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this criminal case, the factual issue at trial was whether, as the state contended, defendant forcibly raped, sodomized, strangled and assaulted J, or, as defendant claimed, J's injuries resulted from consensual \"rough sex.\" A preliminary legal issue was whether defendant could compel the production of evidence that he viewed as supportive of his position. After the encounter with defendant, J had used her computer to conduct a Google search and make journal entries about defendant and the encounter. Defendant sought to compel the production of that digital data: Defendant filed a motion to compel the state to use its authority under the federal Stored Communications Act (the SCA) to obtain J's records from Google, and he issued a subpoena\n   <em>\n    duces tecum\n   </em>\n   requiring J to appear at trial and bring her computer with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The trial court granted defendant's motion to compel, and, after some time and a number of hearings, the state eventually sent Google a subpoena for the records. Google did not comply; it took the position that a search warrant was required. Defendant, frustrated with what he viewed as the state's defiance of the court's order and refusal to do what was necessary to get the Google information, filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him. The court, unhappy with the state's delay and \"resistance or reluctance\" to comply with its order, but satisfied that the state had done all that the court could direct it to do, informed the parties that it would not require the state to obtain a search warrant and denied defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court then conducted a bench trial. J testified, but she did not produce her computer in response to defendant's subpoena. On cross-examination, J told the court that she had \"flattened\" her computer and that it therefore no longer contained digital information. The court denied defendant's motion for an order requiring J to bring the computer\n   to court for a forensic examination and, at the trial's completion, found defendant guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant appealed his judgment of conviction.\n   <em>\n    State v.

To address that issue, a rudimentary understanding of the provisions of the SCA is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The SCA is a federal law that was enacted in 1986 as part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act to address the privacy of stored internet communications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Orin S.

Defendant sent his own subpoena\n   <em>\n    duces tecum\n   </em>\n   to Google, but Google refused to honor it, citing the SCA. Defendant then sought the court's assistance. Defendant argued that, although Google had rebuffed his subpoena for the records of J's search, it would be required to produce that information if the state sought it. Defendant filed a motion to compel, asking the court to order the state to do what he could not. On December 20, 2011, after a hearing, the court determined that J's Google searches were potentially exculpatory and ordered the state to \"make whatever effort the federal statute allows them to make\" to obtain them (December 20 order). The court's thinking was that the state \"has little interest in ignoring or avoiding exculpatory evidence\" which might affect the result in the case, and that it was appropriate \"for this court to order the State of Oregon to use its power under [the] federal statute to obtain the information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After significant delay, the state issued its own subpoena.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Google again demurred. Google informed the state\n   that it would not produce the records that the state sought without a search warrant requiring their production, and, some weeks later, the state so informed defendant and the court. By that time, trial was fast approaching, and defendant told the court that he would be filing a motion to dismiss the charges against him based on prosecutorial misconduct. Defendant took the position that, to comply with the court's December 20 order, the state was required to apply to the court for a search warrant or an SCA order. The state took the position that it could not and would not make the averments necessary for such an application and that the court could not and should not force it to do so. The court indicated that it would issue a search warrant if the state applied for one, but it did not enter an order requiring the state to take that action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   When defendant did in fact file a motion to dismiss, the trial court denied it, giving two interrelated reasons for its decision. First, the court explained, the state may have done\n   all that the court could require it to do when it issued a subpoena for J's Google records. Although the court disagreed with the district attorney's position that, to apply for a search warrant, he would have to aver that he had probable cause to believe that a search would produce \"evidence of a crime\"-explaining that \"a search warrant can be issued for evidence or information concerning the commission of a crime\"-the court was not convinced that it could order the district attorney to make averments that he was not willing to make.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Second, the court explained, it considered the Google searches to be important and exculpatory, but it did not consider them to be the \"heart of the case.\" The \"heart of the case,\" in the court's view, was the \"physical evidence, [J]'s statements to the police, [J]'s testimony, which is subject to cross-examination, and * * * defendant's testimony or other evidence if he chooses to testify or present it.\" Moreover,\n   the court expanded, the evidence that J conducted a Google search would be presented, and J could be thoroughly cross-examined about it. The court opined that that evidence was \"probably more damning or more critical than the exact content of the search itself.\" The court concluded that the unavailability of the Google searches themselves was \"not the sort of thing that would require the Court-or justify the Court in dismissing the case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, the Court of Appeals described the trial court's decision as a combination of rulings, including a denial of defendant's \"motion to compel the state to obtain J's internet information.\"\n   <em>\n    Bray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190278\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/281/584/#p586\">\n    281 Or. App. at 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190278\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/281/584/#p586\">\n    383 P.3d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As noted, the Court of Appeals affirmed that denial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190278\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/281/584/#p586\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court reasoned that ordering the state to obtain J's Google searches would exceed the court's statutory and constitutional authority, and it did not distinguish between the trial court's initial order requiring the state to take steps permitted by the SCA and the trial court's later retreat from that order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190278\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/281/584/#p586\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190278\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/281/584/#p586\">\n    at 595-607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190278\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/281/584/#p586\">\n    383 P.3d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing motion to compel Google information issue).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   That distinction is, however, essential to our analysis. The trial court effectively entered two different orders with respect to the Google searches-an initial order granting defendant's motion to compel, and a second order, reconsidering, retreating from, or reversing that initial order. The state did not challenge the court's initial order by seeking a writ of mandamus or by cross-assigning it as error on appeal to the Court of Appeals. On review in this court, it is defendant who brings a challenge, and that challenge is not to the court's initial order, but to its retreat from it. Thus, the issue before us is not whether the trial court had authority to enter its December 20 order; the issue is whether the trial court had an obligation to enforce that order by requiring the state to take further action deemed necessary to obtain the Google records-to apply for a search warrant or an SCA order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant argues that the trial court was obligated to order that assistance and begins his argument with the Oregon statute that requires the state to disclose exculpatory evidence in its \"possession or control.\" ORS 135.815. Defendant contends that the SCA places J's internet information within the state's \"possession or control,\" and, therefore, that the state was required to obtain and disclose it, and the trial court had a duty to compel its compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court of Appeals considered ORS 135.815(1)(g) to be the applicable statute.\n   <em>\n    Bray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190278\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/281/584/#p586\">\n    281 Or.

But, as the state points out, that statute was not enacted until 2013, after the trial court proceedings in this case were complete. Or. Laws 2013, ch. 525, \u00a7 1. Instead, as defendant recognizes, the applicable statute is ORS 135.815(1)(a). That statute requires the district attorney to disclose the \"relevant written or recorded statements or memoranda of any oral statements\" of any witness the state intends to call to testify at trial, if the\n   materials are in the district attorney's \"possession or control.\" ORS 135.815(1)(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This court construed that statute in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The state does not read\n   <em>\n    Warren\n   </em>\n   as expansively. The state observes that when\n   <em>\n    Warren\n   </em>\n   was decided, CSD was effectively an investigative arm of the state comparable to the police, and argues that\n   <em>\n    Warren\n   </em>\n   and ORS 135.815 require the state to produce documents only when they are held by state agencies with comparable investigative authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The parties' arguments hinge on the meaning of the statutory term \"control.\" The relevant definition of that term set out in\n   <em>\n    Webster's Dictionary\n   </em>\n   is \"to have power over: rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary\n   </em>\n   496 (unabridged ed. 2002). Given that definition, we do not agree with either party's argument\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   . We do not agree with the state that it does not have control over documents held by third parties lacking statutorily imposed investigative duties. When the state has the authority to obtain documents in the hands of third parties on request, it has the power to obtain those documents on its own volition and without other outside assistance and thereby has \"control\" over them; that is true even if those third parties do not themselves have investigatory responsibilities. Under\n   <em>\n    Warren\n   </em>\n   , the state may obtain such documents \"directly\" and, at least when a defendant makes a specific request for them, must obtain and disclose\n   them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, we also disagree with defendant in part. We do not agree with defendant that the state has power to obtain documents held by third parties when it cannot obtain those documents on request but must issue process to do so. When the state cannot obtain documents without judicial assistance, it cannot be said to have power over them.

As noted, the state did not seek a writ of mandamus contesting the order, and the district attorney responded by issuing a subpoena that Google rebuffed. The question before us is whether, when defendant sought the court's assistance in compelling the district attorney to take further action, such as applying to the court for a search warrant or an SCA order, due process required the court to provide that particular assistance. It did not. Although the internet searches may have been sufficiently important and exculpatory to justify the trial court's initial order, there are two reasons that, together, persuade us that the need for the evidence was not so great that the court's failure to order the district attorney to issue process to Google deprived him of a fair trial. First, even if defendant could not prove the precise search terms that J used to search the internet without the searches themselves, he could prove that J had consulted the internet to determine whether what happened to her counted as rape. And second, issuance of process to Google was not the only means available to defendant to obtain evidence of the searches that J conducted. As more fully discussed below, J's computer may contain that evidence. Given those alternative means of informing the jury that J may have had doubts about whether she had been raped, we are not convinced that the Supreme Court would hold that the trial court's failure to order the district attorney to issue process to obtain that information from Google constituted a due process violation. The Court has been clear that, to prove a due process violation based on a deprivation of evidence, a defendant must demonstrate that the loss of evidence was so material and favorable that it prevented a fair\n    trial.\n    <em>\n     United States v.

The trial court described the state's conduct as \"foot-dragging and delay and resistance or reluctance * * * to comply.\" Yet, the court reasoned, the state eventually had done all that the trial court believed it could require, and defendant could establish that J conducted an internet search to determine whether what\n    had happened to her counted as rape. Consequently, the court concluded, the state's conduct did not justify dismissal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The Court of Appeals used stronger terms to describe the state's conduct.

As explained above, this is not a case in which the state withheld material information that was in its possession or control, a due process violation that requires production of the information and a new trial.

This case is different. At this point, defendant has not demonstrated either that J's digital data is irretrievably lost or that the state's delay in subpoenaing that data caused its loss.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    As we explain below, there still is a possibility that defendant will be able to obtain J's\n    internet searches from her computer. Below, we conclude that the trial court erred in refusing to enforce defendant's subpoena of that computer and remand to that court to determine whether to grant a new trial. It is possible that J's computer will contain evidence of J's internet searches and that defendant will be able to obtain and use that evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    In addition, even if J's internet searches are irretrievably lost, defendant has not demonstrated that the state's delay in issuing its subpoena caused that loss. In response to the state's subpoena, Google refused to disclose J's internet searches, taking the position that only a search warrant would suffice. Defendant did not establish that, had the state acted more promptly, Google would have produced the requested searches. Thus, defendant has not established that the state's conduct, no matter how egregious, resulted\n    in irretrievable loss. Defendant does not cite legal authority demonstrating that a due process violation occurs or that dismissal with prejudice is warranted in that circumstance.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    We therefore conclude that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss for prosecutorial misconduct and turn to the state's petition for review and the issue on which the potential for a new trial pivots-whether the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to compel J to produce her computer at trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    II. THE STATE'S ISSUE ON REVIEW\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Defendant served J with a subpoena requiring her to \"appear before the Circuit Court\" on the date and at the time of the trial \"to give evidence in the above-entitled matter on behalf of the defendant,\" and to bring with her to court:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n    \"1. The computer or its cloned hard drive copy that [J] used on February 26, 2011 to perform an internet search;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n    \"2. Any and all writings, journal entries, or diary entries that [J] created regarding [defendant] or the allegations associated with this case from 2/22/11 until the present date; and,\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n    \"3. Any external storage devices containing data from items 1 &amp; 2.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    J did not comply. She appeared and testified, but told the court that she had not brought her computer with her.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    J testified that any data that defendant sought to examine no longer existed; she had \"flattened\" the hard drive of the computer-\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , used the installation disk to wipe it free of all saved data-in March 2011, within weeks after the rape. J said that she had done so because she was afraid that the media, which had reported intrusive information about her, would hack her computer. J testified that she had given copies of the only relevant journal entries that still existed to the prosecutor and that they had been offered into evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    At the conclusion of J's testimony, the court considered defendant's motion to compel J to bring her computer to court. Defendant told the court that even a \"flattened\" computer could disclose the contents of J's Google search and any journal entries that she had created. Defendant added that the computer might contain data that could contradict J's testimony about the timing of her efforts to \"flatten\" the hard drive and disclose whether J had made those efforts after he had attempted to obtain her internet records from Google. Defendant offered the services of a forensic examiner who could decipher\n    the computer's digital information and provide relevant data to the court for\n    <em>\n     in camera\n    </em>\n    inspection. In opposition, the state argued that enforcing the subpoena would violate J's constitutional right to privacy; it also suggested that defendant had not sufficiently demonstrated that the computer would provide admissible impeaching evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The trial court was not troubled by defendant's failure to more particularly describe the evidence that he sought or to demonstrate its admissibility more conclusively. When the state told the trial court that, \"[i]n order for a prior inconsistent statement to be admissible at trial, it must be inconsistent, and [not] just speculation as to whether it's inconsistent,\" the court interrupted. The court told counsel that that argument was directly contrary to this court's decision in\n    <em>\n     State v.

The trial court was troubled, however, by the privacy concerns that the state raised. The court was concerned that a forensic examiner would have access to private information and denied defendant's motion to compel.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    In the Court of Appeals, the state echoed the trial court's privacy concerns. In its brief before that court, the state argued that, \"even if it [is] assumed\n    <em>\n     arguendo\n    </em>\n    that defendant made an adequate showing that the victim's computer might have exculpatory information in it,\" the trial court was in no position to separate relevant information from irrelevant, confidential information. Turning the computer over to a defense expert, the state asserted, would \"violate the witness's legitimate expectation of privacy.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The Court of Appeals began its analysis with a review of the controlling Oregon statutes.\n    <em>\n     Bray\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190278\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/281/584/#p586\">\n     281 Or.

Parkins\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668149\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/346/333/#p341\">\n     346 Or. 333\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 341,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668149\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/346/333/#p341\">\n     211 P.3d 262\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2009).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Here, we conclude that the state raised, at least in a general sense, in both the trial court and the Court of Appeals, the issue of what is necessary for a subpoena\n    <em>\n     duces tecum\n    </em>\n    to be both statutorily and constitutionally valid. Although the state assumed, for purposes of argument in the Court of Appeals, that defendant had made a sufficient showing of materiality and admissibility to justify its production, that did not stop that court from discussing the statutory and constitutional contours that a subpoena\n    <em>\n     duces tecum\n    </em>\n    must meet and evaluating whether they had in fact been met. Those standards are fairly in play. Although the question in this case is a close one, we conclude that the policies underlying the preservation rule have been sufficiently served. We therefore turn to the merits of the state's argument-\n    <em>\n     viz.\n    </em>\n    , that, under ORS 136.580, a party seeking enforcement of a subpoena\n    <em>\n     duces tecum\n    </em>\n    must describe with particularity the evidence that it seeks and demonstrate that that evidence will be relevant and admissible. In this case, the state contends, defendant did not make the necessary showing with respect to any of the categories of evidence that he claimed would be disclosed on inspection of J's computer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    As to J's internet searches, the state argues that defendant did not demonstrate that those searches necessarily would disclose evidence that would impeach J's trial testimony and therefore be relevant and admissible. As to journal entries about \"defendant or the rape,\" the state argues that defendant's request was too broad and that defendant did not show that the computer ever had contained any relevant and admissible entries: Any such entries would be inadmissible hearsay in defendant's case-in-chief, and their impeachment value was purely speculative. As to evidence about when J \"wiped\" her computer, the state argues that defendant did not demonstrate that the computer would contain such information or conflict with J's testimony. As a result, the state contends, defendant did not meet the statutory requirements of specificity, relevance and admissibility.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    For the reasons that follow, we conclude that ORS 136.580 does not require that a party serving a subpoena\n    <em>\n     duces tecum\n    </em>\n    describe the evidence that it seeks and demonstrate its admissibility with that degree of certainty. Rather, as we will explain, when a party subpoenas a witness to produce material for cross-examination at trial, ORS 136.580\n    requires a court to order the production of the material unless it is clear that the material has \"no potential use\" for that purpose.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    As noted, ORS 136.580 permits parties to subpoena witnesses to produce documents and other materials at trial, and this court interpreted that statute in\n    <em>\n     Cartwright\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"60639\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/336/408/#p420\">\n     336 Or. 408\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"60639\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/336/408/#p420\">\n     85 P.3d 305\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

First, a party is not entitled to use a subpoena\n    <em>\n     duces tecum\n    </em>\n    to\n    <em>\n     compel\n    </em>\n    production on a date prior to trial when no evidence will be taken, although a party may request and a trial court may allow pretrial production. Second, a party\n    is entitled to use an ordinary subpoena\n    <em>\n     duces tecum\n    </em>\n    to\n    <em>\n     compel\n    </em>\n    production at trial. After a witness testifies, the court must require production of the subpoenaed material.\n    The court then must make that material available to the party subpoenaing it for use in cross-examination, unless it is clear that the material or testimony has \"no potential use\" for that purpose. In that circumstance, there is no reason to require a court to predict, with certainty, in advance of that witness's testimony, whether the subpoenaed material will in fact be relevant and admissible. When a party uses a subpoena\n    <em>\n     duces tecum\n    </em>\n    to compel production of materials for cross-examination at trial, the court has control over those materials and will have an opportunity to make the more exacting determinations necessary to their admissibility.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Requiring a more specific demonstration of the admissibility of evidence before a party obtains it would not only be impractical, it also would fail to give due consideration to the role that the full disclosure of facts plays in our system of justice and the constitutional underpinnings of the subpoena statute. As the court explained in\n    <em>\n     Nixon\n    </em>\n    , \"[t]he very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system depend on full disclosure of all the facts, within the framework of the rules of evidence.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p711\">\n     418 U.S. at 709\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p711\">\n     94 S.Ct. 3090\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Moreover, \"[t]he right to the production of all evidence at a criminal trial * * * has constitutional dimensions.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p711\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p711\">\n     at 711\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p711\">\n     94 S.Ct. 3090\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution confer the right of confrontation and compulsory process, and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution ensures due process.

In\n    <em>\n     Cartwright\n    </em>\n    , the subpoenaed materials were the prior tape-recorded statements of witnesses.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"60639\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/336/408/#p420\">\n     336 Or. at 410\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"60639\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/336/408/#p420\">\n     85 P.3d 305\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court could ascertain the nature of those statements without forensic assistance and, from their nature, could determine that any objection under the work product doctrine that might be asserted would be waived when the witnesses testified; the court was not required to consider problems that could arise if the subpoenaed material included both relevant and irrelevant information. In\n    <em>\n     Cartwright\n    </em>\n    , the employer did not argue that production of the audiotapes would necessitate forensic examination or a broad review of additional potentially irrelevant, confidential, or privileged information and thereby raise constitutional privacy concerns.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    But here, as the trial court recognized, neither the parties nor the court could know, without a forensic examination of J's computer, precisely what data it contained, and there was no doubt that it contained chaff as well as wheat.

J also testified that she had made journal entries on her computer about defendant or the rape and that she had \"flattened\" her computer to delete all digital information.

Whenever a court is asked to order such an examination and report, the court must impose conditions necessary to protect against the unreasonable invasion of a witness's privacy, including prescribing the contours of the examination and the terms of requested protective orders. In addition, if a party seeks information protected against disclosure by privilege or statute, the court must consider whether to conduct an\n    <em>\n     in camera\n    </em>\n    inspection to ensure against their dissemination.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n    Finally, when a trial is underway at the time of a party's request for forensic examination, a court is entitled to consider the delay, if any, that would result from such an examination.
