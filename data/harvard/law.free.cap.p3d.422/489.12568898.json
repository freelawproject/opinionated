We hold that (1) kidnapping is a course of conduct crime; (2) under the facts of this case, Classen's first degree kidnapping conviction and attempted first degree kidnapping conviction were based on two separate acts and, therefore, do not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy; and (3) Classen's counsel did not provide ineffective assistance by failing to request a voluntary intoxication instruction or by failing to raise a voluntary intoxication defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 However, we hold that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to request an inferior degree offense instruction on one assault charge. Consequently, we affirm Classen's convictions for felony harassment, first degree kidnapping, one count of second degree assault, and one count of attempted first degree kidnapping. We reverse Classen's second degree assault convictions in count IV and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 Crista Cole was an acquaintance of Classen's. On the morning of September 5, 2015, Classen arrived at Cole's residence\n   near Portland, Oregon as she was entering her vehicle with her infant son. Cole offered to give Classen a ride and Classen accepted, saying that Cole could take him \"right down the street.\" Report of Proceedings (RP) at 79. Classen got in the front passenger seat; Cole's son sat in the back seat in his car seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 After driving down the street, Cole asked Classen if he wanted to get out and Classen did not respond. Cole told Classen that he needed to get out of the car, but Classen refused. Classen then began poking Cole's ribs and grabbing her hair. Classen also began calling Cole a \"cop\" and a \"fed.\" RP at 82. Classen punched Cole in the ribs, head, and face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Classen then directed Cole to drive. Using scissors he found in the vehicle, Classen cut off a chunk of Cole's hair. At one point, Classen duct-taped Cole's hands to the steering wheel, but he removed the tape after Cole started crying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 While Cole continued to drive, Classen took a bandana, rubbed it on his genitals, and put the bandana on Cole's face. Classen also touched Cole's genitals. Classen told Cole that he was going to rape her and her son and threatened to slit her throat. Classen cut Cole's arm with the scissors and hit her with a curling iron.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Cole drove onto Interstate 205 heading north into Washington. Right after crossing into Washington, Cole's vehicle ran out of gas and she pulled over to the side of the highway. All the while, Classen continued to hit and threaten Cole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 After pulling over, Cole opened her door and ran onto the highway. Classen exited the vehicle and began to chase Cole. Classen caught Cole and pushed her down. Cole got up and began to run, and Classen again ran after her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 Cole ran up to a man in a truck and screamed, \"Please help me.\" RP at 100. Classen then grabbed Cole by the neck and pushed her head against the side of the truck. Several passersby stopped as Classen continued to chase Cole. When one of the people who had stopped stepped between Classen and Cole, Cole then ran back to her vehicle and retrieved her son who was still seated in the back seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 After retrieving her son, Cole ran in front of a vehicle driven by Eva Scherer. Cole told Scherer that Classen was trying to kill her. Another woman pulled her vehicle to the side of the road behind Scherer's vehicle and Cole got into that vehicle with her son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 Classen approached Cole and Scherer. As Classen approached, Scherer attempted to prevent Classen from passing her by putting her hand up and asking him to stay by Cole's vehicle. Despite her attempts, Classen continued to approach Scherer. Classen told Scherer that he would \"take\" her instead of Cole and told Scherer to get in the car. RP at 235. Classen then hit Scherer across the side of her face and ran away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 Some of the bystanders started to chase Classen, who tried to escape by running. Eventually, two men were able to catch and subdue Classen. They restrained him until the police arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13 The State charged Classen with felony harassment, first degree kidnapping, two counts of second degree assault, and one count of first degree attempted kidnapping. Cole was the victim of both kidnappings. Classen's contact with Scherer served as the basis for one of the second degree assault charges (count IV).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14 Prior to trial, Classen underwent competency evaluations. Dr. C. Kirk Johnson, a psychologist, conducted one such evaluation and diagnosed Classen with amphetamine use disorder based on \"file review and recent history.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 34. Dr. Johnson also reported that Classen stated he had no memory of his behavior on the day of the incident and only remembered \" 'waking up in the back of a car.' \" CP at 32. Classen denied drug and alcohol use to Dr. Johnson. The examiners both determined that Classen was competent to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II. TRIAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 At trial, the witnesses testified consistently with the above facts. In addition, Cole testified that prior to the day of the incident she had never had any issues with Classen. Cole stated that on the day of the incident\n   Classen did not at first seem paranoid, but his actions \"progressively started getting worse\" and he started \"saying a bunch of stuff that didn't really make sense at the time.\" RP at 82, 83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16 Scherer testified that Classen was \"talking and talking and talking,\" that he appeared agitated, that he \"made several references to being an undercover cop, and that [Cole] was his test subject and he needed her back.\" RP at 234. Ronnie Thomas, a bystander who helped detain Classen, testified that Classen kept saying \"odd\" things like \"I'm going to live my life.\" RP at 135. Thomas also testified that Classen would \"count to five\" and then attempt to escape restraint. RP at 135.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17 Sergeant Blaise Geddry, one of the responding officers, testified that he contacted Classen as Classen sat in the back of a patrol car. Sergeant Geddry said that Classen's\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ... muscles were twitching. He was smacking his lips, as if he were extremely thirsty. He was nonresponsive to any questions as far as, \"What's your name?\" He was making weird nonsensical statements and just odd types of noises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   RP at 180.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 18 Sergeant Geddry further testified that during the course of his work, he often comes in contact with people who are under the influence of intoxicants and that he has come to recognize certain signs people exhibit when they are under the influence of various types of intoxicants. Sergeant Geddry opined that Classen appeared to be under the influence, but the sergeant did not mention which substance might have been affecting Classen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 19 Classen's counsel did not propose a jury instruction on voluntary intoxication or a jury instruction on the inferior degree offense of fourth degree assault concerning the assault against Scherer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 20 During closing arguments, the State argued the following regarding the second degree assault charge in count IV:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Assault in the Second Degree, Count IV, against Eva Scherer: Same scenario outside the vehicles, Eva is trying to stop him from getting [Cole]. He strikes her, assaults her. What's his intent? Again, we don't have to guess at it because he tells us. He makes it clear. He is going to get [Cole] back in the car. He is going to get Eva. He is assaulting her to further his crime of kidnapping.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   RP at 296.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 21 Regarding the attempted kidnapping charge, the State argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Count V, Attempted Kidnapping: Again, this relates to his attempt to get [Cole] back, chasing her across lanes of travel, chasing her across the freeway, all of that that we've talked about. What's he trying to do there? Is he trying to catch her so he can give her a bouquet? No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   He is trying to catch her because he wants her back in the car so she is back in his control, so he can get her away from these good people that have stopped there on the roadside.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   RP at 296.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 22 During Classen's closing argument, his counsel mentioned the assault charges briefly. Counsel stated, \"Is Mr. Classen guilty or is he not guilty? He is guilty of assault. There is no question about that. What kind of assault is it? That's the question.\" RP at 300.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 23 The jury found Classen guilty on all counts. The trial court sentenced Classen to a prison term and imposed legal financial obligations that included a $200 dollar criminal filing fee. Classen appeals his convictions and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   I. DOUBLE JEOPARDY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 24 Classen first argues that his convictions for first degree kidnapping and attempted first degree kidnapping of Cole violate the prohibition against double jeopardy because they constitute one unit of prosecution.

If the legislature fails to define the unit of prosecution or its intent is unclear, any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the defendant and against allowing a single incident to support multiple convictions under the rule of lenity.\n   <em>\n    Tvedt\n   </em>\n   , 153 Wash.2d at 711,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20P.3d%20728\">\n    107 P.3d 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Washington courts have not addressed the unit of prosecution under the kidnapping statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 28 First degree kidnapping is defined in RCW 9A.40.020 (1)(c), (d). That statute states that a person is guilty of kidnapping in the first degree when he or she \"intentionally abducts another person with intent ... (c) [t]o inflict bodily injury on him or her; or (d) [t]o inflict extreme mental distress on him, her, or a third person.\" \"Abduct\" means \"to restrain a person by either (a) secreting or holding him or her in a place where he or she is not likely to be found, or (b) using or threatening to use deadly force.\" RCW 9A.40.010(1). \"Restrain\" means to restrict a person's movements without consent and without legal authority in a manner which interferes substantially with his or her liberty. Restraint is 'without consent' if it is accomplished by physical force, intimidation, or deception.\" RCW 9A.40.010(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 29 It is clear from the plain language of the statute that kidnapping is a continuing course of conduct crime. Because \"abduct\" is defined as restraining in some manner, and \"restrain\" is defined as restricting a person's movements in a way that \"substantially interferes with his or her liberty,\" it follows that a crime of kidnapping continues so long as the victim's liberty is substantially interfered with. The use of the phrase \"restrict a person's movements\" and \"in a manner which interferes substantially with his or her liberty\" contemplates a continued state of being abducted until a person's liberty is no longer substantially interfered with. Thus, the legislature intended to punish a continuing course of conduct, the act of abduction itself and the continued restraint of a victim's liberty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 30 This interpretation is supported by\n   <em>\n    State v.

Classen's attempted kidnapping conviction arose from Classen's pursuit of Cole after she escaped Classen's restraint and begin running across the interstate. As discussed above, a kidnapping continues until a victim regains her liberty. The ultimate question then is whether Cole regained her liberty during the incident or whether Classen continually restricted Cole's movements in a manner which substantially interfered with her liberty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 35 The facts show that once Cole stopped her vehicle and ran across the highway, her movements were no longer restricted by Classen.

The case law does not say the same about methamphetamine\n   or heroin intoxication.

However, Classen failed to provide any evidence about how methamphetamine affected his ability to form the requisite mental states for the crimes. Although there is evidence that Sergeant Geddry testified that Classen appeared to be under the influence, Sergeant Geddry did not testify as to what type of drug or intoxicant he suspected Classen to be under the influence of. Sergeant Geddry also did not testify as to whether methamphetamine or heroin affects a person's ability to form the requisite intent to commit the crimes of kidnapping or assault. Because it is not common knowledge that methamphetamine or heroin can affect a person's ability to form the requisite intent, Classen needed to provide competent evidence to show how his ability to form intent was affected. But here Classen failed to introduce any evidence about the effect methamphetamine had on his ability to form the requisite intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 49 Because Classen provided no evidence of how methamphetamine affected his ability to form the requisite mental states, there is no evidence to suggest that Classen lacked the ability to form the requisite mental state to kidnap Cole and assault both Cole and Scherer. Accordingly, the third element is not satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 50 Classen cannot show that a voluntary intoxication instruction likely would have been given.

Classen argues that the \"only plausible defense\" to all of the charges against him was his defense that he did not have the ability to form the requisite mental states. Classen asserts that his counsel should have brought forth evidence of the pretrial evaluations to prove that he suffered from amphetamine use disorder, that he reported taking methamphetamine, and that he only remembered waking up in the back of a car on the day of the kidnapping and assault. Because the record is insufficient to support a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 52 Even assuming evidence of the pretrial competency evaluation conducted by Dr. Johnson would have been admissible, this evidence does not show that any intoxication affected Classen's ability to form the requisite intent to commit the crimes charged. Dr. Johnson's pretrial evaluation shows only that Classen suffered from amphetamine use disorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 53 Though Classen suggests that his counsel should have presented testimony from Dr. Johnson at trial, there is no information in the record regarding what Dr. Johnson would have testified to and there is no evidence that Dr. Johnson would have testified that Classen lacked the ability to form the requisite mental states to commit the crimes due to any drug use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 54 Although the record contains some evidence regarding Classen's history and diagnosis of amphetamine use disorder, this evidence cannot support a defense of voluntary intoxication under the circumstances. Without expert testimony or some other evidence establishing that methamphetamine\n   use affected his ability to form the requisite intent to commit the crimes, we cannot establish from this record that Classen's defense counsel performed deficiently by failing to present a voluntary intoxication defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Inferior Degree Offense Jury Instruction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 55 Classen next argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to propose an inferior degree offense instruction for the lesser crime of fourth degree assault for his crime of assault of Scherer (count IV).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State argues that an \"all or nothing\" approach was a legitimate trial strategy, and therefore, not deficient.

Classen made no attempt to grab Scherer or Cole when he assaulted Scherer. In fact, after he slapped Scherer, Classen immediately ran away. Despite Classen's statement that he would \"take\" Scherer, the evidence also shows that Classen struck Scherer merely in frustration for her interference.
