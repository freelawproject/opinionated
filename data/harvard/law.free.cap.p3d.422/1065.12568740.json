Because we reject the State's argument that it may pursue enhancement of an animal cruelty crime as a dangerous offense, we accept special action jurisdiction but deny relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 Police responded to a report of animal cruelty. A witness stated she heard a dog crying and went to her apartment complex's courtyard to see where the noise was coming from. She observed Shundong Hu in his apartment using a rod to hit a dog that was inside a pet enclosure. When police entered Hu's apartment, they saw a puppy with a bleeding mouth. The dog was taken to an animal care center for treatment and the medical records indicated the dog suffered \"[c]ranial trauma.\" Police obtained a warrant the next day to search Hu's apartment and discovered a metal rod under the bed that \"appeared to have blood and dog hair on it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 As relevant here, the State charged Hu with intentionally or knowingly subjecting an animal to cruel mistreatment, a class 6 felony, in violation of Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 13-2910(A)(9). The State also alleged the crime was a dangerous offense because it \"involved the discharge, use, or threatening exhibition of a pole and/or rod, a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument, in violation of A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-105 and 13-704.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Hu moved to dismiss the dangerousness allegation, asserting that as a matter of law \"a dangerous offense cannot be committed against an animal.\" He did not dispute that the metal rod could constitute a dangerous instrument; instead, he argued the legislature's inclusion of the phrase \"on another person\" in the statutory definition of dangerous offense, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-105(13), means a dangerous offense may be committed only against a person, not an animal. The State countered that the plain language of \u00a7 13-105(13) indicates that a sentencing enhancement based on the use of a dangerous instrument is not limited to circumstances involving \"another person.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Focusing on the definition of dangerous instrument, the superior court granted Hu's motion, explaining as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   There are two ways to interpret the dangerous instrument definition: (1) it could be limited to items being used in a way readily capable of causing death or serious physical injury\n   <em>\n    to a person\n   </em>\n   ; or (2) it could encompass items being used in a way readily capable of causing death or serious physical injury\n   <em>\n    to anything\n   </em>\n   . Under the latter interpretation, poisoning someone's $1000 exotic fish tank with a gallon of bleach would constitute the crime of criminal damage, a class 6 dangerous felony. Surely the legislature did not intend such results.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 The State petitioned for special action, asserting the superior court erred by dismissing the allegation of dangerousness. We have accepted jurisdiction because the State has no adequate remedy on appeal and the petition presents a legal issue of statewide importance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R.P. Spec.

Construction of Related Statutory Definitions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 As provided in A.R.S. \u00a7 13-704, the legislature has mandated increased punishment for a person convicted of a felony offense that is also considered \"dangerous.\" A\n   dangerous offense is \"an offense involving the discharge, use or threatening exhibition of a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      or\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the intentional or knowing infliction of serious physical injury on another person.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-105(13) (emphasis added). A \"person\" is defined in pertinent part as a \"human being.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-105(30). A dangerous instrument is \"anything that under the circumstances in which it is used, attempted to be used or threatened to be used is readily capable of causing death or serious physical injury.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-105(12). \" 'Serious physical injury' includes physical injury that creates a reasonable risk of death, or that causes serious and permanent disfigurement, serious impairment of health or loss or protracted impairment of the function of any bodily organ or limb.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-105(39). Finally, \" '[c]ruel mistreatment' means to torture or otherwise inflict unnecessary serious physical injury on an animal or to kill an animal in a manner that causes protracted suffering to the animal.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2910(H)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 The State contends the word \"or,\" emphasized above in the definition of dangerous offense, is clear in the sense that it must be read in the disjunctive, meaning the second phrase \"on another person\" does not apply to the first phrase involving a dangerous instrument. In other words, the State argues the two phrases unambiguously constitute independent clauses, meaning that when a dangerous instrument is used in committing a felony, the State need only prove a dangerous instrument was discharged, used, or threatened as part of the felony offense, regardless of whether it was targeted against a person, an animal, or any other living organism. Read in isolation, the State's proffered construction is defensible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Bowsher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4056346,4055354\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/225/586/\">\n    225 Ariz. 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 587, \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4055354,4056346\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/242/1055/\">\n    242 P.3d 1055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1056 (2010) (\"The word 'or' generally means '[a] disjunctive particle used to express an alternative or to give a choice of one among two or more things.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1095 (6th ed. 1990) ) ). However, we must construe the meaning of dangerous offense in light of its related definitions to achieve harmony and thereby discern legislative intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 589, \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4055354,4056346\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/242/1055/\">\n    242 P.3d at 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing that in construing multiple statutes, we seek to harmonize all the provisions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 Like the State, Hu does not offer an interpretation that considers each of the definitions affecting the meaning of dangerous offense. He focuses solely on the definition of dangerous instrument, asserting that \"the only way\" to interpret this provision is to add the words \"to a person\" at the end of the definition. Otherwise, he contends, the statute would be interpreted to cover harm to anything, which would require rewriting the statutory language and lead to absurd results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 Taking into account the parties' competing arguments, we must find the most sensible reading of the definition of dangerous offense that is in harmony with the definitions of dangerous instrument and serious physical injury, as well as other related statutes, including the dangerous offense and animal cruelty statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4055354,4056346\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/242/1055/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In doing so, we note that our supreme court has recognized that not every crime involving the use of a dangerous instrument may be enhanced as a dangerous offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although both terms are \"general\" in nature, that does not mean they encompass every conceivable crime.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips v. O'Neil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=243%20Ariz.%20299\">\n    243 Ariz. 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 302, \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=407%20P.3d%2071\">\n    407 P.3d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 73 (2017) (noting that the \"general terms\" canon of construction \"is based on the reality that it is possible and useful to formulate categories (e.g., 'dangerous weapons') without knowing all the items that may fit-or may later, once invented, come to fit-within those categories\" (quoting Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Garner,\n   <em>\n    Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts\n   </em>\n   101 (2012) ) ). Dangerous instrument and serious physical injury are general in the sense they are broadly defined and would presumably include many items or injuries that could fall within those general categories. But the legislature\n   did not use the same type of language to define the scope of when those two categories apply; instead of defining a general class, the legislature limited dangerous instrument and serious physical injury to specific circumstances, failing to further specify who or what must be the target of the dangerous instrument or the recipient of the serious physical injury. Accordingly, the definitions of dangerous instrument and serious physical injury are reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation as to whether they apply to offenses directed toward non-humans, which also means the definition of dangerous offense can be reasonably interpreted in more than one way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 The State asserts that if \"on another person\" were to modify the first clause of A.R.S. \u00a7 13-105(13), then no crime could be charged as a dangerous offense absent \"direct contact with another person.\" But the State construes the word \"on\" too narrowly, as it can function to identify a variety of situations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   823-24 (1988) (giving the following definitions of \"on\": (1) \"used ... to indicate position in close proximity with ... &lt; stay [on] your opponent&gt;\"; (2) \"used ... to indicate the object of collision, opposition, or hostile action ... &lt; pulled a gun [on] me&gt;\"; and (3) \"used ... to indicate destination or the focus of some action, movement, or directed effort &lt; crept up [on] him&gt;\"). These varied definitions also defeat the State's arguments that \"[o]ne does not discharge nor threateningly exhibit a dangerous instrument 'on' a person\" and that \"a dangerous instrument would be discharged\n   <em>\n    at\n   </em>\n   another person or threateningly exhibited\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   another person.\" Given the broad meaning of \"on,\" there is no grammatical inconsistency in the language the legislature used to define a dangerous offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 Moreover, the State's interpretation that \"on another person\" would not apply to the first clause absent direct contact with another person is inconsistent with established case law.

Further, the defendant is not eligible \"for suspension of sentence, probation, pardon or release from confinement on any basis, except as specifically authorized.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-704(G).

Thus, the legislature already has accorded a more severe designation and punishment for a more egregious act against an animal.

Limiting application of the dangerous offense enhancement to situations where a human is the target or potential target of a crime involving a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument avoids absurd conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 22 For example, as the superior court noted, a person may be charged with criminal damage, a class six felony, for recklessly defacing or damaging property of another valued at $1,000 or more.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1602(A)(1), (B)(4). That type of crime could arise when a person recklessly sprays herbicide that drifts to neighboring property and kills plants valued at $1,000 or more. Under the State's interpretation, it could properly allege dangerousness. Similarly, a person who recklessly uses fireworks, destroying vegetation worth at least $1,000 would also be subject to an enhanced sentence under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-704, regardless of whether any human faced harm as a result of the crime. Recklessly using an ax to destroy a valuable tree would also be subject to enhancement as a dangerous offense. On the other hand, if a person destroyed valuable plants by uprooting them with his hands, or by cutting off the water supply, the State would be unable to charge the crime as a dangerous offense because no deadly weapon or dangerous instrument was involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 23 Additionally, one could cause serious physical injury to an animal with his fists but the State could not seek an enhancement based on dangerousness because it is limited to \"the intentional or knowing infliction of serious physical injury on another person.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-105(13) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

But if a stick caused the injury, instead of fists, the person hitting the animal with the stick would be subject to a dangerousness enhancement. Moreover, taking at face value the State's contention that the legislature sought to treat equally humans and animals, the State's construction of the statutes would not do that-one who punches a person's eye, causing blindness, would be subject to an enhancement while one who punches an animal and causes the same injury would not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 24 Restricting application of the dangerousness enhancement to humans does not yield irrational or unnatural results because the harm resulting from various crimes is treated similarly under the law. If a person uses a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument in any way to assault another person, then it could be charged as a dangerous offense. And if no deadly weapon or dangerous instrument is involved, but a person punches someone so hard it causes serious physical injury, then the attacker's conduct plainly fits within the dangerous offense definition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1482175\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/161/308/#p311\">\n    161 Ariz. at 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1482175\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/161/308/#p311\">\n    778 P.2d at 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
