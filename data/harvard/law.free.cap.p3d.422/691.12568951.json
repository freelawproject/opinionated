R. Civ. P. 41(b), and denying its motion for relief from that dismissal under M. R. Civ. P. 60(b). Diamond cross-appeals from the District Court's order granting partial summary judgment in ECI's favor. We affirm the District Court's orders dismissing ECI's case and denying ECI's motion for relief from that dismissal. We deny Diamond's cross-appeal as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it dismissed ECI's complaint for failing to prosecute under M. R. Civ. P. 41(b) ?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied ECI's motion for relief under M. R. Civ. P. 60(b) ?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    3. Did the District Court err by granting partial summary judgment in ECI's favor on the issues of duty and breach?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 In 2008, ECI purchased real property from Diamond that included several older commercial buildings, including one known as the Watercraft building. In 2010, ECI discovered the Watercraft building had suffered fire damage, including compromise of the roof trusses, at some point in its history. Although Diamond knew, and did not tell ECI, that the Watercraft building had been damaged in a fire in 1977, Diamond denied it had failed to disclose any known defects: It filed an insurance claim after the fire, a contractor repaired the damage, and Diamond believed the damage was repaired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 ECI filed suit in 2012, alleging claims including fraud, negligent representation, and breach of contract. On May 23, 2014, the District Court granted ECI partial summary judgment, ruling that Diamond had breached its duty to disclose a latent defect in the Watercraft building. The court reserved ruling on damages for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 On July 9, 2014, Diamond moved for relief from the summary judgment under M. R. Civ. P. 60(b). On July 28, 2014, ECI responded in opposition. On September 26, 2014, the District Court denied Diamond's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 In December 2014, Diamond's counsel wrote to ECI's counsel and proposed a scheduling order. Diamond's counsel also indicated that Diamond was willing to enter into settlement negotiations. ECI did not\n   respond to the letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 The parties took no further action in the District Court. On January 19, 2017, the District Court issued an Order Closing Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 On February 22, 2017, ECI moved to reopen the case. ECI offered no explanation why it had taken no action after the summary judgment order, but argued the District Court could not dismiss the action pursuant to \u00a7 25-1-104, MCA, because it had not given the parties notice and allowed them the opportunity to recommence prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 Diamond opposed ECI's motion. It acknowledged that the District Court could not dismiss the case under \u00a7 25-1-104, MCA, because the court did not give notice prior to dismissal. Diamond then moved to dismiss the case under M. R. Civ. P. 41(b), which does not require notice, but permits a defendant to move to dismiss a claim for failure to prosecute. Diamond argued ECI had taken no steps to move the case towards the resolution of the remaining issues, having last conducted\n   discovery in the spring of 2013, filing only a single response brief after that point, and taking no action whatsoever since July 2014. Replying to Diamond's Rule 41(b) argument, ECI acknowledged that \"there is no explanation for the delay.\" ECI contended Diamond had suffered no prejudice, argued dismissal was too harsh a remedy, and suggested the District Court instead issue a truncated scheduling order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 On May 18, 2017, the District Court issued an Order Granting Motion to Reopen Case and Granting Motion to Dismiss. The court vacated its earlier closure of the case, admitting it did not provide the notice \u00a7 25-1-104, MCA, requires. The District Court then granted Diamond's motion to dismiss under M. R. Civ. P. 41(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 ECI moved for relief from the Order under M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), alleging the District Court made a mistake in dismissing the case. ECI contended it diligently prosecuted its case prior to September 26, 2014, and although it did not file anything with the District Court afterward, its work on the case did not cease. Counsel stated he created a \"preliminary draft\" of a motion for summary judgment regarding damages. Counsel also stated in an accompanying affidavit that due to staffing changes at his law firm, the case \"slipped through the cracks.\" ECI also alleged the lack of a scheduling order caused the case to sit idle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 The District Court denied ECI's motion for relief. ECI appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 A district court has broad discretion in ruling on a M. R. Civ.

If the trial court refused to set aside the judgment, only a slight abuse of discretion need be shown to warrant reversal.\n   <em>\n    Karlen v.

Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it dismissed ECI's complaint for failing to prosecute under M. R. Civ. P. 41(b) ?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 Rule 41(b) allows a district court to dismiss an action for failure to prosecute upon the defendant's motion. In deciding whether a district court has abused its discretion in dismissing an action for failure to prosecute, we consider four factors: (1) the plaintiff's diligence in prosecuting the claims; (2) the prejudice caused to the defense by the plaintiff's delay; (3) the availability of alternate sanctions; and (4) whether the plaintiff was warned that the case was in danger of dismissal. We consider these factors in light of public policy considerations that favor a plaintiff's right to a hearing on the merits, balanced against the trial court's need to manage its docket and the general policy of encouraging prompt disposition of lawsuits.\n   <em>\n    Becky v. Norwest Bank Dillon, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5315015\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/245/1/#p8\">\n    245 Mont. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5315015\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/245/1/#p8\">\n    798 P.2d 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1015 (1990).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 17 In granting Diamond's motion to dismiss under Rule 41(b), the District Court found that the first factor-whether ECI diligently prosecuted its claims-weighed heavily in Diamond's favor. The court reviewed the docket and found ECI prosecuted its claims through completion of discovery in early 2013 and up to the hearing on summary judgment in November 2013. The court further noted that after prevailing at summary judgment, ECI took no further action until July 2014, when it filed a brief in opposition to a Rule 60(b) motion filed by Diamond. The District Court noted that ECI took no action in the court for 30 months and admitted it had \"no explanation for the delay.\" It noted ECI offered no evidence that it communicated with Diamond's counsel or attempted to\n   resolve the case, and did not attempt to explain its silence and inaction. Considering that ECI filed\n   one brief after November 2013, and filed nothing from July 2014 until the February 2017 motion to re-open, the District Court found ECI had not fulfilled its duty to pursue prosecution and bring the case to trial.\n   <em>\n    Cook v. Fergus Elec. Coop., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2639088\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/235/173/#p177\">\n    235 Mont. 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 177,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2639088\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/235/173/#p177\">\n    765 P.2d 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1140 (1988).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 18 ECI argues the District Court abused its discretion by failing to consider the full circumstances of the case. ECI contends the District Court should have considered ECI's diligence in the earliest part of the litigation. It argues that other failure-to-prosecute cases are factually distinguishable because in those instances, the prosecuting party took few steps to prosecute the case from the very beginning.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pool v.

ECI maintains it diligently prosecuted the case through July 2014, and argues the District Court thus should not have found it failed to diligently prosecute the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 19 Diamond argues ECI's failure to act for 30 months is not diligence. It further argues the District Court knew the case's history when it dismissed the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 20 Clearly, as Diamond argues, the District Court knew the case's history when it granted Diamond's motion to dismiss. Moreover, we fail to see how ECI's early diligence obviates its later two-and-a-half-year inattention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 21 ECI's case is unusual because ECI initially invested considerable time and effort, and received a favorable ruling, before it allowed this case to languish. However, ECI cites no law which would prohibit a court from dismissing a dormant case if the party had previously pursued it diligently. ECI's earlier actions do not change the fact that 30 months passed between its last filing and the District Court's order of closure, during which time the only action ECI took was a \"preliminary draft\" of a motion which it never filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 22 ECI says it knows of no case in which we \"affirmed the dismissal of a case where the plaintiff has successfully negotiated a resolution with one party, has received a liability ruling on summary judgment against the remaining second party, and discovery has been entirely completed, as is the case in the present matter.\" Tellingly, ECI also does not cite a similar case in which we reversed a dismissal. It would not surprise this Court if a factually similar case does not exist, in which, having received a favorable ruling on liability, the plaintiff utterly failed to pursue its claim for damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 23 Our standard of review grants broad discretion to the District Court in ruling on a Rule 41(b) motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Lear\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16. Ho wever, the Dissent would reweigh the first\n   <em>\n    Beck\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    y\n   </em>\n   fac tor and find it preponderates in ECI's favor. Although the District Court evaluated the complete record in considering this factor, the Dissent believes it nonetheless reached the wrong conclusion. The Dissent relies on\n   <em>\n    Brymerski v.

However, the facts of both are distinguishable, and the analysis of each supports the result reached by the District Court here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 24 In\n   <em>\n    Brymerski\n   </em>\n   , we reversed the District Court where it dismissed a case which had had some periods of little to no activity, but which was being actively prosecuted at the time the defendants moved for dismissal under Rule 41(b).\n   <em>\n    Brymerski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2542501\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/195/428/\">\n    195 Mont. at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2542501\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/195/428/\">\n    636 P.2d at 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, which predated the\n   <em>\n    Becky\n   </em>\n   factors, we announced: \"We adopt the rule that a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute will not be granted if the plaintiff is diligently prosecuting his claim at the time the motion is filed, even if at some earlier time the plaintiff may have failed to act with due diligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Brymerski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2542501\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/195/428/\">\n    195 Mont. at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2542501\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/195/428/\">\n    636 P.2d at 848-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 25 Here, ECI had taken no action in this case for well over two years prior to Diamond's Rule 41(b) motion. Therefore, ECI was not diligently prosecuting its claim\n   at the time the motion was filed, and thus the District Court's ruling under the first\n   <em>\n    Becky\n   </em>\n   factor is consistent with the pre-\n   <em>\n    Becky\n   </em>\n   analysis as well. Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Brymerski\n   </em>\n   also recited the pre-\n   <em>\n    Becky\n   </em>\n   factor rule: \"In Montana the law is well established that an action may be dismissed for failure of the plaintiff to prosecute if the action is not prosecuted with due diligence,\n   <em>\n    absent a sufficient showing of excuse.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Brymerski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2542501\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/195/428/\">\n    195 Mont. at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2542501\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/195/428/\">\n    636 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   848 (citing\n   <em>\n    Calaway v.

Here, ECI offered no excuse whatsoever. Therefore, the District Court cannot have abused its discretion in finding that \"showing\" insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 26 Next, in\n   <em>\n    A.M. Welles\n   </em>\n   , we reversed a district court's dismissal under Rule 41(b) where the court ruled that the State, a plaintiff, failed to prosecute the case between the District Court's summary judgment ruling of January 25, 2010 until March 21, 2012, when a defendant moved for dismissal.\n   <em>\n    A.M. Welles\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20. First, we noted that the evidence suggested the parties were engaged in settlement negotiations at least until November 2010. We held, \"That a plaintiff\n   is not filing motions or speaking in a courtroom does not necessarily mean the plaintiff is dawdling.\" Thus, we determined the State caused only a seventeen-month delay from November 2010 and April 2012, during which it did not respond to a settlement offer and failed to move forward with the case.\n   <em>\n    A.M. Welles\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21. However, in examining the facts, we concluded that while the State offered \"little excuse\" for its conduct, the delay was not\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unreasonable given the \"complex case involving multiple parties, contracts, and cross-motions.\"\n   <em>\n    A.M. Welles\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 27 Here, there is no evidence ECI was engaged in settlement negotiations while the District Court case remained inactive; in fact, the evidence demonstrates that Diamond attempted to open negotiations and ECI ignored Diamond's invitation. Furthermore, while this litigation had arguably been complex at the beginning, it had become vastly simplified by the time ECI ceased to pursue it: At that point, ECI had obtained partial summary judgment in its favor and needed only to move forward against a single defendant on the issues of causation and damages. Therefore,\n   <em>\n    A.M. Welles\n   </em>\n   does not lead us to find an abuse of discretion here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 28 As to the second factor, the prejudice caused by the plaintiff's delay, the District Court also found this factor preponderated in Diamond's favor. An unreasonable delay raises a presumption of prejudice and shifts the burden to the plaintiff to show good cause or a reasonable excuse for inaction.\n   <em>\n    Shackleton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2506269\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/207/96/\">\n    207 Mont. at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2506269\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/207/96/\">\n    672 P.2d at 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Since ECI offered no reason for its inaction, the District Court determined it did not meet its burden to show good cause or a reasonable excuse for inaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 29 ECI argues the District Court abused its discretion by finding the delay unreasonable, and it should have required Diamond to demonstrate that it was prejudiced. ECI argues the District Court incorrectly shifted the burden to ECI to demonstrate good cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 30 Diamond responds that an unexcused delay creates a presumption of prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Westland v. Weinmeister\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4587843\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/259/412/#p417\">\n    259 Mont. 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 417,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4587843\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/259/412/#p417\">\n    856 P.2d 1374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1377 (1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 31 Here, ECI acknowledged it had \"no explanation for the delay.\" The District Court was within its discretion to consider \"no explanation\" to be unexcused and therefore unreasonable. It thus properly shifted the burden to ECI to demonstrate either good cause or a reasonable excuse of its inaction.

The court reasoned that ECI did not claim to be unaware of M. R. Civ. P. 41(b) and \u00a7 25-1-104, MCA, and thus was on notice that a case could be dismissed for failure to prosecute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 37 On appeal, ECI argues the fourth factor clearly weighs in its favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 38 Diamond acknowledges that ECI was not warned prior to dismissal, but argues that a warning is not a prerequisite to dismissal under M. R. Civ. P. 41(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 39 We agree this factor weighs in ECI's favor since the District Court offered no warning. We find the District Court's rationale that this factor nonetheless weighs slightly against ECI because ECI's counsel should have been aware of \u00a7 25-1-104, MCA, and M. R. Civ. P. 41(b) unpersuasive. While the District Court correctly vacated its dismissal under \u00a7 25-1-104, MCA, for lack of warning and ruled that a warning was not required when it granted dismissal under Rule 41(b), the better practice would have been for the District Court to have followed\n   the notice requirements of \u00a7 25-1-104, MCA, in the first place. As the Dissent points out, in his concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Becky\n   </em>\n   , Justice Weber stated that he believed a warning and the opportunity to prosecute \"would have been entirely appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    Becky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5315015\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/245/1/#p8\">\n    245 Mont. at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5315015\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/245/1/#p8\">\n    798 P.2d at 1017\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To place the Court's conclusion in its proper context relative to our precedent: In cases where a plaintiff takes no action for over three years, but then takes minimal action three months before a Rule 41(b) motion to dismiss, this Court would hold that \"the policy favoring the resolution of a case on its merits is more compelling than the policy underlying Rule 41(b) which is to prevent unreasonable delays.\"\n   <em>\n    Brymerski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2542501\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/195/428/\">\n    195 Mont. at 430, 431-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2542501\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/195/428/\">\n    636 P.2d at 847, 848-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is a process which inevitably will include periods of greater and lesser activity. There is an irreconcilable dissonance between the Court's acknowledgement that ECI has \"invested considerable time and effort,\" Opinion, \u00b6 21, in prosecuting its claim with its ultimate determination that the claim should be dismissed because ECI has \"failed to prosecute.\" The twenty-eight month delay prior to dismissal was undoubtedly poor practice by ECI. Still, our precedent favoring trial on the merits would reserve dismissals of this nature to the most extreme case where the entire record and circumstances evince an utter lack of diligence by the plaintiff. Rule 41(b) was not intended to be applied in instances, such as this, where the case was vigorously litigated for over two years prior to the period of inactivity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   Becky\n   <em>\n    Factor\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 53 More troubling still is the Court's cursory resolution of the fourth\n   <em>\n    Becky\n   </em>\n   factor-whether there was a pre-dismissal warning to the plaintiff. The District Court conceded that it \"did not issue a formal notice pursuant to [ ] \u00a7 25-1-104, [MCA ],\" but because a warning is not a prerequisite to dismissal under Rule 41(b), and because ECI did not argue it was unaware of \u00a7 25-1-104, MCA, and Rule 41(b), the District Court determined this factor weighed only \"slightly in favor\" of ECI. In affirming the District Court's ruling on this point, this Court summarily concludes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   We agree this factor weighs in ECI's favor since the District Court offered no warning.... [h]owever, we have previously held that a warning is not a prerequisite to dismissal under Rule 41(b). Thus, it is not a prerequisite here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Opinion, \u00b6 39 (internal citations omitted). The Court acknowledges that because ECI's case was dismissed without warning, this factor\n   \"weighs in ECI's favor,\" and admits that warning ECI was appropriate here, but the Court then fails to give it any substantive\n   consideration as a factor because \"it is not a prerequisite.\" None of the four\n   <em>\n    Becky\n   </em>\n   factors are prerequisites. That's the point-they are factors to be weighed relative to each other in reaching a final conclusion. Unfortunately, in minimizing the fourth factor, the Court deemphasizes the pertinent procedural history regarding how ECI's case came to be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 54 Section 25-1-104, MCA, requires that a plaintiff receive a warning before dismissal of a case for failure to prosecute. The District Court did not issue the required warning to ECI before dismissing its case pursuant to \u00a7 25-1-104, MCA. ECI moved to reopen the case because it had not received a warning. Diamond opposed ECI's motion to reopen-even though dismissal was clearly erroneous because of the lack of warning-and at the same time offered the District Court an alternative route to dismissal without warning via Rule 41(b). The District Court acknowledged that it erred by dismissing ECI's case without warning pursuant to \u00a7 25-1-104, MCA, Opinion, \u00b6 39, and reopened the case, but then dismissed it without warning in the same order, pursuant to Rule 41(b). It was not until prompted by the District Court's erroneous dismissal under \u00a7 25-1-104, MCA, that Diamond filed its Rule 41(b) Motion. So despite the error, Diamond sought the same relief under a different procedural mechanism, and the District Court granted it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 55 At its essence, the principle underlying a notice requirement in any statute or rule is to afford parties due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mont.

These factors are not simply boxes to be checked-to merely acknowledge they exist and then move on to a conclusion. A court must thoroughly consider each factor in making its decision.

Just as a district court must give thorough weight and consideration to each factor, so too must this Court carefully review a district court's analysis in this regard. Instead, this Court dismisses the pre-dismissal warning to a plaintiff as a nonfactor.
