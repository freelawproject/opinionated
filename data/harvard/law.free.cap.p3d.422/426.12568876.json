We reject defendant's first assignment of error without discussion. In his second assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in imposing a $560 fine in the written judgment, where the court had announced at sentencing that it was imposing only a $500 fine. The state concedes that the trial court erred in imposing a $560 fine in the judgment and requests that we remand for the court to enter a fine of $500. We agree with and accept the state's concession regarding the fine and, accordingly, reverse the imposition of the fine and remand for the court to impose the $500 fine announced at sentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
