As she walked toward aisle 13, she slipped on a puddle of soapy water. Rodriguez fell, injuring her head, neck, and shoulders. Rodriguez sued The Kroger Company and Smith's Food &amp; Drugs Centers, Inc. (collectively, Smith's), the janitorial company Smith's contracted with to clean the floors, and the independent contractor the janitorial company hired to do the work. Rodriguez settled with the independent contractor before trial. At trial, a jury apportioned 5 percent of the fault to Smith's, none of the fault to the janitorial company, 75 percent of the fault to the independent contractor, and 20 percent of the fault to Rodriguez herself. After trial, Rodriguez argued that Smith's and the janitorial company were liable for the independent contractor's share of the damages. The district court disagreed and entered judgment based on the jury's allocation of fault. The district court also awarded Rodriguez 5 percent of her costs. Rodriguez appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 Rodriguez challenges the district court's final judgment. Rodriguez contends that because Smith's was charged with a nondelegable duty to keep its premises safe, the court should have required Smith's to pay damages for the independent contractor's negligence in addition to its own. Rodriguez also claims that the nondelegable duty doctrine mandated that the district court enter\n   judgment against the janitorial company for the damages flowing from the independent contractor's negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 We conclude that Smith's is liable for the damages the independent contractor caused. But because Rodriguez did not demonstrate that the janitorial company also assumed Smith's nondelegable duty, we conclude that the district court did not err by refusing to enter judgment against the janitorial company for the independent contractor's negligence. Additionally, we conclude that costs need not be allocated in proportion to a party's fault under the Liability Reform Act, and remand for a redetermination of costs. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the district court in part, affirm in part, and remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 Smith's contracted with J&amp;I Maintenance to clean its floors. In turn, J&amp;I contracted with Benigno Galeno to perform the cleaning services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   While cleaning the store one night, Galeno left a puddle of water at the end of aisle 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Shortly after the store opened, Rodriguez arrived at a Smith's grocery store to purchase her breakfast. Rodriguez walked through the front doors and headed for aisle 13. Rodriguez \"suddenly and unexpectedly slipped on a puddle of water....\" Rodriguez fell, injuring her head, neck, and shoulders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 Rodriguez sued Smith's, J&amp;I, and Galeno. Before trial, Rodriguez settled with Galeno.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shortly before the case went to the jury, the parties agreed to this jury instruction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties have stipulated that J&amp;I Maintenance, Inc. was the independent contractor of [Smith's] to, among other things, clean its floors. The parties have also stipulated that [Benigno Galeno] ... was the independent contractor of J&amp;I Maintenance, Inc. to clean [Smith's] floors. Usually, [Smith's] would not be liable for the negligence of an independent contractor. However, [Smith's] has a nondelegable duty to keep its premises reasonably safe for invitees, and the law imposes liability for physical harm caused by a breach of the nondelegable duty to keep its premises reasonably safe for invitees even though [Smith's] may have contracted with others who performed the work which caused the injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The jury allocated 5 percent of the fault to Smith's, none to J&amp;I, 75 percent to Galeno, and 20 percent to Rodriguez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 Rodriguez filed a proposed judgment and argued that because Smith's owed a nondelegable duty to keep its store reasonably safe for its customers, the court should enter judgment against Smith's for 80 percent of Rodriguez's damages: 5 percent attributable to the fault allocated to Smith's and 75 percent attributable to the fault allocated to Galeno. Additionally, Rodriguez argued that because J&amp;I and Galeno assumed\n   Smith's nondelegable duty, the court should enter judgment against J&amp;I for 75 percent of Rodriguez's damages, attributable to 75 percent of the fault allocated to Galeno.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 Smith's and J&amp;I opposed Rodriguez's proposed judgment. They argued that such a rejiggering of liability would run afoul of Utah's Liability Reform Act (LRA). Smith's and J&amp;I reasoned that under the LRA, no defendant can be liable to any person seeking recovery for any amount in excess of the proportion of fault attributed to that defendant, and that Rodriguez's proposed judgment would do precisely that. (Citing UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-5-818(3) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 The district court agreed with Smith's and J&amp;I's reading of the LRA. The court entered judgment against Smith's for 5 percent of Rodriguez's damages. The court also awarded Rodriguez 5 percent of her costs. Rodriguez appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 10 Rodriguez raises two issues on appeal. First, Rodriguez contends that the district court erred by declining to enter judgment against Smith's and J&amp;I for the portion of damages Galeno's negligence caused.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rodriguez argues that under the nondelegable duty doctrine, both Smith's and J&amp;I are liable for the 75 percent of the fault allocated to Galeno. \"The question of whether a duty exists is a question of law....

At trial, the parties stipulated that Galeno \"was the independent contractor of J&amp;I Maintenance, Inc. to clean Smith's ... floors.\" And because Galeno performed his duties negligently, Smith's is liable for the damages arising out of Galeno's negligence in addition to its own. Accordingly, we reverse the district court's judgment.

Rodriguez claims that the instruction \"stated that J&amp;I Maintenance had assumed Smith's duty, and that it also would be liable for any fault of Galeno.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 30 Jury Instruction 19 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   The parties have stipulated that J&amp;I Maintenance, Inc. was the independent contractor of [Smith's] to, among other things, clean its floors. The parties have also stipulated that [Benigno Galeno] ... was the independent contractor of J&amp;I Maintenance, Inc. to clean [Smith's] floors. Usually, [Smith's] would not be liable for the negligence of an independent contractor. However, [Smith's] has a nondelegable duty to keep its premises reasonably safe for invitees, and the law imposes liability for physical harm caused by a breach of the nondelegable duty to keep its premises reasonably safe for invitees even though [Smith's] may have contracted with others who performed the work which caused the injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Instruction 19 states that J&amp;I was the independent contractor of Smith's to clean its floors.

Allocation of Costs\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 32 Finally, Rodriguez contends that the district court erred in reducing her costs award to an amount representing 5 percent of the taxed costs. Rodriguez argues that \"[w]hile the trial court did not elaborate on its decision, it seems evident that the trial court treated taxed costs in the same manner as 'damages' under Utah Code section 78B-5-820.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 33 The costs our rules contemplate include expenses authorized by statute and certain fees that are paid to the court and witnesses.\n   <em>\n    Frampton v.

Further, \"[d]amages are based on fault [and] are generally limited only by the findings and conscience of the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Aris Vision Inst.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8459264\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/143/278/\">\n    2006 UT 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8459264\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/143/278/\">\n    143 P.3d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations in original) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 34 In other words, costs are distinct from damages. Costs arise out of litigation and are not dependent on fault. Damages, in the context of this dispute, relate to a party's injury and depend on a party's fault for detriment or injury sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 35 This distinction becomes important because Utah Code section 78B-5-820(1) provides that \"the maximum amount for which a defendant may be liable to any person seeking recovery is that percentage or proportion of the\n   <em>\n    damages\n   </em>\n   equivalent to the percentage or proportion of fault attributed to that defendant.\" (Emphasis added). By its plain language, this provision does not require the court to award\n   <em>\n    costs\n   </em>\n   to a prevailing party in proportion equivalent to the percentage or proportion of fault attributed to the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 36 It appears from the district court's award of 5 percent of Rodriguez's costs that the district court believed that it needed to allocate costs in accordance with the jury's allocation of fault. Although the LRA does not dictate the manner in which a court divvies up costs, a district court may, in the exercise of its discretion, allocate costs in parallel with the jury's allocation of fault. But it is not required to do so. Because we remand so the district court can adjust its award with respect to Smith's, and because that adjustment could impact the district court's cost allocation, we vacate the award of costs to permit the court to revisit the question. And we do so with the reminder that the LRA does not dictate the answer to that question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 37 Smith's had a nondelegable duty to keep its premises reasonably safe for invitees. A jury concluded that Galeno's negligence created an unreasonably unsafe condition when he left a puddle of water at the end of aisle 13. Because Smith's cannot delegate its duty to keep its premises safe, it is liable for the damages arising from Galeno's negligence. Accordingly, the district court erred in entering judgment against Smith's for 5 percent of Rodriguez's damages. We remand with instructions to enter judgment against Smith's for 80 percent of Rodriguez's damages to account for Smith's own negligence and the negligence of Galeno. Because Jury Instruction 19 does not provide evidence\n   of a stipulation that J&amp;I assumed the nondelegable duty, and because Rodriguez develops no other argument on this point, we conclude that the district court correctly entered judgment in favor of J&amp;I. We clarify that costs and damages are not the same thing, and accordingly, costs need not be allocated in proportion to a party's degree of fault under the LRA. We remand for a redetermination of Rodriguez's costs in light of this clarification. J&amp;I requests an award of costs pursuant to Utah Rule of Appellate Procedure 34. Because J&amp;I prevailed on appeal, we grant its request and award costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH R. APP. P. 34(a).

The only theory of liability set forth in Rodriguez's opening brief forwards the argument that J&amp;I stipulated that it had assumed Smith's duty, and that it also would be liable for any fault of Galeno.
