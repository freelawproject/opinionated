He was born in Mexico, but came to Hawai'i with his uncle when he was ten years old. He married a United States citizen in 1999 and became a permanent resident alien in 2001, when he was twenty years old. Najera and his wife have four children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2010, Najera was charged with drug offenses, including the main charge of attempted methamphetamine trafficking in the first degree that carried significant mandatory imprisonment. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Najera pleaded no contest to drug charges that enabled him to avoid mandatory imprisonment, but still subjected him to automatic deportation. Najera was sentenced, served a one-year term of incarceration, and then was placed in deportation proceedings. Najera filed a petition to set aside his convictions (Petition) pursuant to Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 (2006). Najera asserted that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel\n   did not advise him that his no contest pleas would subject him to automatic deportation and that had he received this advice, he would not have pleaded no contest. Najera also stated that he never told his counsel that he was not a citizen. The Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ruled that Najera had failed to state a colorable claim for relief and denied his petition without a hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The question presented in this appeal is whether Najera's failure to inform his counsel that Najera was not a citizen absolved counsel of the obligation to advise Najera that his no contest pleas would subject him to automatic deportation. We conclude that the answer to this question is \"no.\" We conclude that Najera's ineffective assistance of counsel claim raised a colorable claim for relief, and therefore, the Circuit Court erred in denying Najera's Petition without a hearing. We remand the case for a hearing to determine whether the representation provided by Najera's counsel was deficient and whether absent counsel's alleged deficient performance, there is a reasonable possibility that Najera would not have pleaded no contest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Najera was born in Mexico. He is not a United States citizen. In about 1991, when Najera was ten years old, he came with his uncle to Maui from Juarez, Mexico. When Najera was fourteen, he was abandoned by his uncle and was placed in foster care. He attended high school on Maui and married a United States citizen in 1999. In 2001, when Najera turned twenty, he became a permanent resident alien of the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January 2010, the State of Hawai'i (State) charged Najera by indictment with attempted first-degree methamphetamine trafficking (Count 1); prohibited acts related to drug paraphernalia (Count 2); and second-degree promoting a detrimental drug (Count 3). Najera's attempted first-degree methamphetamine trafficking charge carried a mandatory indeterminate twenty-year term of imprisonment, a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of between two and eight years, and a fine of up to $2 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 712-1240.7(3) (Supp. 2009). The charges against Najera stemmed from evidence obtained pursuant to the execution of search warrants on Najera's home, truck, and person, and Najera's consent to search another vehicle. During these searches, the police recovered 19.46 grams of purported crystal methamphetamine, over 170 grams of purported marijuana vegetation, three marijuana plants, and an assortment of drug paraphernalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A Deputy Public Defender (DPD) was appointed to represent Najera. The State and Najera subsequently entered into a plea agreement, which called for: (1) Najera to plead no contest to an amended charge of first-degree promoting a dangerous drug instead of attempted first-degree methamphetamine trafficking, in Count 1; (2) Najera to plead no contest as charged to Counts 2 and 3; (3) the State to recommend a sentence of ten years of probation; and (4) Najera to stipulate to one year of imprisonment as a condition of probation and not to move for sentencing under \"Act 44\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   or for a deferred acceptance of no-contest plea. By pleading no contest to first-degree promoting a dangerous drug instead of attempted first-degree methamphetamine trafficking, Najera would still be exposed to a maximum indeterminate twenty-year term of incarceration, but the Circuit Court would have the option of sentencing Najera to probation, rather than a mandatory indeterminate twenty-year term of incarceration, and there would be no mandatory minimum term of incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In May 2011, Najera pleaded no contest pursuant to the plea agreement. During the plea colloquy, the Circuit Court advised Najera: \"And if you're not a citizen you're possibly looking at consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial naturalization [sic] under the laws of the United States. Do you understand?\" Najera responded: \"Yes, your Honor.\" The No Contest Plea form which Najera signed also stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   10. I know that, if I am not a citizen of the United States, a conviction or a plea of guilty or no contest, whether acceptance of my plea is deferred or not, may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization under the laws of the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Circuit Court found that Najera's no contest pleas were validly entered, accepted his pleas, and found him guilty of the amended charge in Count 1 and guilty as charged in Counts 2 and 3. The Circuit Court required the preparation of a presentence investigation and report prior to sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The presentence report contained information indicating that Najera was not a citizen. The report identified Najera's birthplace as \"Mexico\"; the space after \"US Citizen:\" was left blank on Najera's \"Hawai'i Criminal Justice Inquiry-Full Rap Sheet\" contained in the report; and the \"Family Background\" section of the report noted that sometime prior to 2004, Najera was arrested and taken to Los Angeles \"where he awaited deportation proceedings,\" but was released to the custody of the parents of his then girlfriend (who later became his wife). Najera did not move to withdraw his plea after the presentence report was prepared, and the case proceeded to sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Circuit Court sentenced Najera on August 3, 2011. Consistent with the State's recommendation in the plea agreement, the Circuit Court sentenced Najera to ten years of probation, subject to the condition that he serve one-year in prison. Najera did not file a direct appeal from his judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After Najera completed serving his one-year term of incarceration, he was detained by immigration authorities and placed in deportation proceedings. On December 10, 2012, Najera filed his Petition pursuant to HRPP Rule 40 to set aside his convictions. In his Petition, Najera claimed that the DPD who represented him in his criminal case failed to provide him with effective assistance of counsel because counsel had failed to warn him of the direct immigration consequences of his no contest pleas. In particular, Najera claimed that his counsel did not advise him, and he did not know, that by entering his no contest pleas, \"he would be subject to automatic deportation.\" Najera alleged that if he had been advised of the immigration consequences of his no contest pleas, he would not have pleaded no contest and \"would have instead presented [his] defenses at trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Najera stated that he \"never told [his trial counsel] that [he] was not a citizen,\" and he stated that the issue of his citizenship \"was never brought up\" during interviews with his counsel. Najera explained his failure to inform his counsel about his noncitizen status by stating that \"I presumed my status was fine because I was married and had 4 children.\" Najera's wife also submitted a declaration in which she stated that: \"[M]y husband never told [trial counsel] that he was not a citizen, because we never thought that was an issue.\" In connection with his Petition, Najera submitted a declaration signed by his trial counsel. In his declaration, trial counsel stated: \"At this time, I cannot recall what I advised [Najera] with respect to his change of plea.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While Najera's Petition was pending in the Circuit Court, Najera was deported to Mexico. The Circuit Court subsequently denied Najera's Petition without a hearing, and it issued its \"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Dismissing [Najera's Petition]\" (Order Denying Petition) on January 2, 2014. The Circuit found that Najera had waived his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to previously raise it. Alternatively, considering Najera's ineffective assistance of counsel claim on the merits, the Circuit Court found that even assuming the\n   facts alleged in Najera's Petition were true, Najera had failed to raise a colorable claim for post-conviction relief. Accordingly, the Circuit Court denied Najera's Petition without a hearing. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On appeal, Najera contends that the Circuit Court erred in denying his Rule 40 Petition without a hearing. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   HRPP Rule 40(f) provides, in relevant part, that \"[i]f a petition alleges facts that if proven would entitle the petitioner to relief, the court shall grant a hearing which may extend only to the issues raised in the petition or answer.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   As a general rule, a hearing should be held on a Rule 40 petition for post-conviction relief where the petition states a colorable claim. To establish a colorable claim, the allegations of the petition must show that if taken as true the facts alleged would change the [outcome of the case], however, a petitioner's conclusions need not be regarded as true.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Dan v.

However, the Supreme Court stated that in Padilla's case, the immigration consequences of Padilla's guilty plea were obvious because the immigration statute is \"succinct, clear, and explicit,\" in providing that any alien who is convicted of any controlled substance offense, \"except for the most trivial of marijuana possession offenses,\" is subject to deportation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    at 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court reasoned that limiting ineffective assistance of counsel claims to affirmative misadvice would invite two absurd results:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   First, it would give counsel an incentive to remain silent on matters of great importance, even when answers are readily available. Silence under these circumstances would be fundamentally at odds with the critical obligation of counsel to advise the client of \"the advantages and disadvantages of a plea agreement.\" When attorneys know that their clients face possible exile from this country and separation from their families, they should not be encouraged to say nothing at all. Second, it would deny a class of clients least able to represent themselves the most rudimentary advice on deportation even when it is readily available.

Under\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , Najera's counsel had a clear duty to give him correct advice about the deportation consequence of his plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In this case, however, Najera states that he never told his counsel that he was not a citizen. Thus, the question presented by this appeal is whether Najera's failure to inform counsel that Najera was not a citizen absolved counsel of the obligation to advise Najera that his no contest pleas would subject him to automatic deportation. In other words, should the burden be on a noncitizen criminal defendant to tell counsel about his or her immigration status, or should the burden of asking the client about his or her citizenship status rest with defense counsel. We conclude that defense counsel who lacks information about a defendant's citizenship status has the burden of asking the defendant whether he or she is a citizen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As the Supreme Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , \"[i]t is quintessentially the duty of counsel to provide her client with available advice about an issue like deportation,\" which \"is an integral part-indeed, sometimes the most important part-of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    at 364, 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In order to effectively represent a criminal defendant, counsel must at least gather enough information to provide advice pertinent to the defendant's situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants who lack knowledge that their immigration status is relevant to their criminal case would have no particular reason to provide such information to counsel, unless asked. Placing the burden on noncitizen defendants to inform counsel presupposes that such defendants understand that their immigration status is relevant to the criminal proceedings. But, it is not clear why a criminal defendant, who is untrained in the law and is relying on defense counsel for appropriate legal advice, would have such an understanding. Placing the burden on noncitizen defendants to apprehend the significance of their immigration status and inform defense counsel of their noncitizen status would mean that only defendants who were aware, independent of defense counsel, that their criminal convictions could affect their immigration status would be assured of receiving the type of correct deportation advice required by\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   . As between defense counsel and a noncitizen defendant, we believe defense counsel is in a better position to understand that a criminal conviction may have serious deportation consequences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 4-5.5 (a) (4th ed. 2015) (\"Defense counsel should determine a client's citizenship and immigration status[.]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We therefore side with courts that have imposed the burden on defense counsel who lacks knowledge of the citizenship status of a client to ask.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

The Petition further alleged that (1) trial counsel did not advise Najera, and Najera did not know, that his no contest plea to first-degree promoting a dangerous drug would subject him to automatic deportation; and (2) if he had been advised of the deportation consequence of his plea, he would not have pleaded no contest and would have insisted on going to trial. We conclude that Najera's Petition stated a colorable claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and that he therefore was entitled to a hearing on this claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   At a hearing on Najera's Petition, it will be up to the Circuit Court, as the trier of fact, to determine the credibility of Najera's allegations, which have been taken as true in deciding whether Najera was entitled to a hearing. For example, the Circuit Court will have to determine: (1) whether trial counsel, in fact, failed to inquire about Najera's citizenship status and lacked knowledge that Najera was not a citizen; and (2) what advice, if any, trial counsel gave Najera about the deportation consequences of his no contest plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In this regard, we note that trial counsel's declaration does not state that he failed to inquire about Najera's citizenship status, that he lacked knowledge that Najera was not a citizen, or that he failed to advise Najera about the deportation consequences of Najera's plea. Trial counsel's declaration simply states that \"[a]t this time, I cannot recall what I advised [Najera] with respect to his change of plea.\" We also note that Najera's presentence report, which we presume trial counsel reviewed before Najera's sentencing, clearly indicates that Najera was not a citizen. At a hearing on Najera's Petition, trial counsel can be called to testify to obtain a more complete picture of the circumstances surrounding his representation of Najera and whether his memory can be refreshed through various means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Circuit Court will also have to determine the credibility of Najera's allegation that if he had been advised of the deportation consequences of his plea, he would not have pleaded no contest and would have insisted on going to trial. In this regard, we note that the evidence against Najera appeared to be strong and Najera's plea agreement contained terms that were very beneficial to him. By pleading no contest to the amended charge of first-degree promoting a dangerous drug pursuant to his plea agreement, Najera avoided the mandatory twenty-year indeterminate term of imprisonment required for a conviction for attempted first-degree methamphetamine trafficking. He also avoided a mandatory minimum term of\n   imprisonment of between two and eight years. Instead, the plea agreement and his no contest plea made it possible for him to receive a sentence of ten years of probation with one year of imprisonment. To satisfy his burden of showing ineffective assistance of counsel, Najera will be required to show that there is a reasonable possibility that he would not have pleaded no contest and would have gone to trial if counsel had correctly advised him of the deportation consequences of his plea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In keeping with Hawai'i Revised Statutes (\"HRS\") section 802E-2 (1993), Najera was specifically advised by the court prior to the court accepting his no contest plea that he may be subject to immigration consequences as a result of his plea:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   THE COURT: Have you discussed your no contest plea with your attorney?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes, your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   THE COURT: Are you satisfied with his advice?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes, your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   THE COURT: And if you're not a citizen you're possibly looking at consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial [of]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   naturalization under the laws of the United States.

Further, Najera later signed a No Contest Plea form which contained the same warning.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   10. I know that, if I am not a citizen of the United States, a conviction or a plea of guilty or no contest, whether acceptance of my plea is deferred or not, may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization under the laws of the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   11.

Therefore, it is fair to conclude that he understood the court's explicit warning that there may be immigration consequences associated with his plea if he was not a U.S. citizen, and it is reasonable to expect that he would raise the issue with his attorney in that case, without imposing upon counsel a burden to inquire of every client that he or she represents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carrillo v.

App. 2013) (concluding that a trial court's plea dialogue with a criminal defendant that includes a query as to whether he or she is a United States citizen and, if necessary, follows up with questions regarding whether the possibility of deportation has been discussed with counsel, will prospectively address the situation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The majority's conclusion that the burden of inquiry is best placed on counsel is based on an objective, perfect-knowledge perspective, concluding that counsel who had no reason to know that his client was not a citizen, and had no reason to discuss potential immigration consequences with his client, was ineffective based on action he had no reasonable indication that he needed to take. Comparing the impact on a client to heed multiple warnings that there may be immigration consequences and respond accordingly by raising the issue of the client's own immigration status with his attorney, it would seem that the client, not the attorney, is best suited to raise the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   While the attorney is indeed in the best position to understand and advise regarding the actual consequences of a plea once the attorney is aware of the client's circumstances, the conclusion that the attorney is therefore best able to bear the burden of\n   inquiry is faulty. The client clearly has superior knowledge about his own immigration status and therefore is in the best position to raise the issue in response to the court's clearly-stated warnings. To hold otherwise places the court unnecessarily in the position of managing the terms of the attorney-client relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   C. This court should avoid unnecessarily interjecting itself into client intake processes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The majority goes awry in dictating specific questions and subjects which criminal defense counsel and his client must discuss. The attorney-client relationship is a special relationship in which the two are united by a unique consideration of the defendant's interests above all else, as the federal and Hawai'i constitutions demand.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.
