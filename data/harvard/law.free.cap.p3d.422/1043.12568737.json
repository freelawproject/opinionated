(the Patients) for inpatient psychiatric treatment. Both Patients were deemed incompetent to stand trial for violent crimes, but upon commitment were unable to provide documentation establishing their lawful presence in the United States. ASH argues it cannot comply with the commitment orders without violating state and federal law governing the provision of state and local public benefits to unauthorized aliens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 As a matter of first impression, we consider whether court-ordered psychiatric treatment is a \"state and local public benefit,\" as defined within\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201621\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and A.R.S. \u00a7 1-502(I). Because individuals subject to court-ordered psychiatric treatment do not \"apply\" for the services, the treatment is not a \"benefit\" within the meaning of those statutes. Accordingly, we affirm the superior court's orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 In 2013, Edgar was charged with one count of aggravated assault and one count of assault by a prisoner with bodily fluids. Edgar spat upon an officer who tried to end a fight between Edgar and another inmate in the medical area of the Durango Jail. In 2015, Juan was charged with aggravated assault\n   and criminal trespass after attacking officers who tried to remove him from a dumpster in which he had been living for four days. When the officers tried to move Juan, he refused to obey orders and swung a board at one of them. Ultimately, the officers resorted to the use of pepper spray to subdue him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 In March 2014 and July 2015, the criminal court found the Patients incompetent to stand trial and dismissed the charges pending against them without prejudice. The court ordered the Maricopa County Attorney's Office (MCAO) to file a petition for court-ordered psychiatric evaluation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-4517(A)(1) (authorizing the court to \"[r]emand the defendant to an evaluating agency for the institution of civil commitment proceedings\" if it finds he is \"incompetent to stand trial and that there is no substantial probability that the defendant will regain competency within twenty-one months\"); 36-521(F) (authorizing the county attorney to file the petition for evaluation if court-ordered). Both Patients were evaluated, and their evaluators filed petitions for court-ordered treatment pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 36-531(B) (stating that, upon a determination that a patient is disabled or dangerous, the appropriate person \"shall prepare, sign and file a petition for court-ordered treatment\"). After considering the petitions, the superior court in both cases found the Patients to be \"persistently and acutely disabled.\" The court also found Juan to be \"a danger to others.\" Both Patients were ordered to submit to inpatient psychiatric treatment at ASH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 ASH moved to intervene in both cases, asking the superior court to reconsider the commitment orders-not because its findings were incorrect, but because the Patients were unable to provide documents establishing their lawful presence in the United States, and therefore were ineligible to receive public benefits. The court granted the motion to intervene but declined to reconsider its orders, and ASH timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) and -2101(A)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 On appeal, this Court granted the Maricopa County Special Healthcare District (the District) leave to intervene as well. The District operates Desert Vista Behavioral Health Center (Desert Vista), a facility that provides short-term court-ordered evaluation and treatment for individuals with mental disabilities, and therefore has an interest in the outcome of our decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 The parties dispute whether court-ordered psychiatric treatment is a \"state and local public benefit\" subject to immigration verification.

When read as a whole, the unambiguous language in PRWORA limits the definition of public benefits to those benefits for which an individual applies. By its terms, PRWORA is intended to address concerns regarding the \"self-sufficiency\" of immigrants, given that \"aliens have been\n   <em>\n    applying for\n   </em>\n   and receiving public benefits ... at increasing rates.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201601\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), (3) (emphasis added).

In contrast, PRWORA confers no rights or responsibilities upon individual states with regard to services imposed upon a person by court order.

In its motion for reconsideration, ASH stated it was \"left with a Hobson's choice: break the law and indefinitely commit a person or potentially increase the risk to public safety.\" Indeed, interpreting court-ordered psychiatric treatment as a \"state or local public benefit\" subject to immigration verification would allow the Patients-who have already been determined to be a danger to themselves and others-to be released back into the general public because no viable alternative exists. The State is unable to prosecute and incarcerate the Patients because they are incompetent to stand trial for the violent crimes they allegedly committed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cooper v.

Moreover, the District stated within its brief that its facility, Desert Vista, is not equipped for long-term psychiatric care, and, unlike ASH, does not offer \"maximum security.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 36-212 (requiring the state mental hospital to designate and operate a \"maximum security area\").

And, as noted above, even if it were ambiguous, we would not advance an interpretation that lead to absurd results. Accordingly, we hold that court-ordered psychiatric treatment is not a public benefit as defined by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201621\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Court-Ordered Psychiatric Treatment Is Not a \"Public Benefit\" as Defined by State Law.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 14 ASH separately asserts that involuntary civil commitment is a \"public benefit\" not available, under state law, to a person\n   who cannot prove his lawful presence. The Arizona State Legislature has adopted PRWORA's general definition of \"state or local public benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 1-502(I). And like PRWORA, the statute's unambiguous purpose is to restrict the availability of public benefits for which an individual must apply. Section 1-502(A) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [A]ny agency of this state or a political subdivision of this state that administers any state or local public benefit shall require each\n   <em>\n    natural person\n   </em>\n   who\n   <em>\n    applies for\n   </em>\n   the state or local public benefit to submit at least one of the following documents ... demonstrating lawful presence in the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Emphasis added). Thus, the state statute also applies only to benefits for which a person voluntarily applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 15 We find further support in A.R.S. \u00a7 13-4517(B), which, as amended in 2017, explicitly distinguishes court-ordered psychiatric treatment from \"public benefits.\" That statute authorizes the superior court, after determining a defendant incompetent to stand trial, to order \"an assessment of the defendant's eligibility for private insurance or public benefits that may be applied to the expenses of the defendant's medically necessary maintenance and treatment.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-4517(B). Although the relevant language was added after the Patients were deemed incompetent, it demonstrates that the Legislature does not consider court-ordered psychiatric treatment to be a public benefit in and of itself, but rather, as a circumstance whose expense might be mitigated through the use of public benefits, when available. Indeed, the Legislature specifically identified public benefits that could be used to offset the costs of court-ordered psychiatric treatment, including: \"[the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System], state-only behavioral health services, [Social Security] services and [M]edicare part D prescription drug benefits, supplemental security income and supplemental security disability income.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-4517(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 16 In a final public policy argument, ASH contends that because it \"is not required to provide civil commitment treatment that exceeds the funded capacity,\" A.R.S. \u00a7 36-503.03, a U.S. citizen may be denied access to necessary services if its beds are filled by individuals not lawfully present in the United States. This argument is unpersuasive given that the maximum capacity of ASH is recalculated each year after collecting census data,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 36-206(D), -503.03, and that the state maintains a contingency plan for the placement of patients in times of emergency and other unforeseen circumstances,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 36-206(D). Thus, the Legislature has provided avenues for ASH to avoid potential capacity problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 17 Court-ordered psychiatric treatment is not a public benefit as defined by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201621\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and A.R.S. \u00a7 1-502(I).
