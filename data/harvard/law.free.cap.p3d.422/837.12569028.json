The Children's Center provided services to T.M. through Nancy Baird. During Ms. Baird's treatment of T.M., she allegedly engaged in practices that were both contrary to commonly-accepted treatment protocol and expressly rejected\n   by the profession. As a result of Ms. Baird's treatment, false allegations of sexual abuse were levied against Mr. Mower.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 3 Mr. Mower sued Ms. Baird and The Children's Center (collectively, the defendants) for the harm he suffered as a result of T.M.'s treatment. The defendants moved to dismiss these claims under rule 12(b)(6) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. The district court granted the defendants' motion on the grounds that therapists don't have \"a duty of care to potential sexual abusers when treating the alleged victim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 Underlying the district court's decision are two issues of first impression: (1) whether a treating therapist working with a minor child owes a traditional duty of reasonable care to a nonpatient parent to refrain from giving rise to false memories or false allegations of sexual abuse by that parent; and, if so, (2) whether we should extend that duty to exercising reasonable care when placing a nonpatient parent at risk of severe emotional distress. Under the framework for analyzing whether a traditional duty exists, established by\n   <em>\n    B.R. ex rel. Jeffs v.

Similarly, we conclude that a treating therapist owes a duty to refrain from affirmatively causing the nonpatient parent severe emotional distress by recklessly giving rise to false memories or false allegations of childhood sexual abuse by that parent.

In March 2011, Ms. Mower began bringing T.M., then four-and-a-half years old, to The Children's Center to see Ms. Baird, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. She did this without Mr. Mower's knowledge or consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 7 By the end of T.M.'s initial intake assessment, Ms. Baird allegedly assumed, based on information provided by Ms. Mower and Ms. Baird's observation of T.M., that T.M. had been sexually abused by Mr. Mower. Because Ms. Baird assumed that sexual abuse had likely occurred, she called the Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS) to make a report. DCFS told Ms. Baird that the information didn't presently warrant a report but asked her to continue to gather information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 8 According to established guidelines regarding treatment for allegations of potential sexual abuse,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Baird should have ended all therapy and allowed a forensic interviewer (a role for which Ms. Baird wasn't trained) to take over to determine if sexual abuse had occurred. Ms. Baird, however, purportedly decided to act in the capacity of a combined therapist and investigator and continued with her therapy/interview sessions until October 2012. Ms. Baird allegedly conducted these sessions with methods that were tainted by confirmatory bias, diagnostic suspicion bias, and socially desired responses, and were therefore unreliable. She repeatedly asked T.M. questions \"designed to corroborate claims of sexual abuse\" and \"that further reinforced the tainting of T.M.'s memory.\" This type of questioning creates a high risk that a child will \"confuse what she has heard\n   through repeated questioning as something she actually experienced.\" Compounding this problem, Ms. Baird failed to electronically record the initial sessions or take adequate notes of the questions and answers given, which might have made it possible to later determine the accuracy of T.M.'s statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 9 During Ms. Baird's treatment of T.M., The Children's Center purportedly provided little to no training, supervision, or oversight. Ms. Baird had \"no knowledge of or training in false memory, confirmatory bias, diagnostic suspicion bias, or social desirability responses.\" Ms. Baird disregarded standardized test results when diagnosing T.M., kept insufficient records of the sessions, repeatedly questioned T.M. about the same events, and served an inappropriate dual role: therapist for T.M. and investigator for DCFS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 10 Mr. Mower first found out about T.M.'s therapy from papers Ms. Mower filed in their divorce proceedings in summer 2012. Also in 2012, based at least in part upon Ms. Baird's interviews with T.M., DCFS made a \"supported\" finding of sexual abuse against Mr. Mower. Mr. Mower challenged that finding in juvenile court, resulting in DCFS changing the finding from \"supported\" to \"unsupported.\" The juvenile court then found the allegations \"unsubstantiated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 11 Ms. Baird's treatment allegedly damaged the healthy parent-child relationship Mr. Mower and T.M. once enjoyed. Additionally, the false allegations of sexual abuse have harmed and stigmatized Mr. Mower's reputation. Mr. Mower has also allegedly suffered significant emotional turmoil and pain as a result of the defendants' negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12 As a consequence, Mr. Mower filed this lawsuit against the defendants for the harm he allegedly suffered as a result of T.M.'s treatment, asserting causes of action for (1) medical malpractice/negligence against The Children's Center, (2) medical malpractice/negligence against Ms. Baird, and (3) respondeat superior against The Children's Center.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants filed a motion to dismiss these claims under rule 12(b)(6) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.

We must therefore determine whether Ms. Baird did in fact owe Mr. Mower a duty and, if so, whether it extends to emotional harm. We begin by determining that Ms. Baird owes Mr. Mower a limited traditional duty. Next, to help contextualize the disagreement between the parties, we discuss some general principles of negligence for legal context and the development of negligent infliction of emotional distress law in Utah and around the country. Then we consider whether we should adopt a limited duty similar to that provided in section 47(b) of the\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Third) of Torts\n   </em>\n   and, if so, what the appropriate test would be. RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: LIABILITY FOR PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM \u00a7 47(b) ( AM. LAW INST. 2012). And, after concluding that a limited duty test should exist, we go on to determine\n   whether a limited emotional distress duty also exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   I.

Our analysis of the public policy considerations will closely mirror the analysis in the fifth\n   <em>\n    Jeffs\n   </em>\n   factor, with special consideration to any public policy concerns specifically implicated by a limited emotional distress duty, in conjunction with the three overarching policy concerns that frame our negligent infliction of emotional distress case law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b684.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   \u00b6 104 As set out in Part I.B.3, the general policy considerations don't warrant a complete abdication of a traditional duty in this case. However, the policy considerations do warrant limiting the traditional duty to refraining from recklessly causing false memories or fabricated allegations of sexual abuse.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b632. Other than the potential that a duty would \"chill\" a therapist's treatment of the child, none of these policy considerations-the social utility of treating and eradicating sexual abuse, the notion that a duty would place the interests of third parties above the interests of the child, the confidentiality and openness of the therapist-patient relationship, the inexactness of therapy, and the policy behind the reporting immunity statute-requires special consideration when used to implicate an emotional duty. Just as in the traditional duty context, these policy considerations don't support completely eliminating an emotional duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   \u00b6 105 As even Mr. Mower acknowledges, therapists are less likely to cause physical injuries than emotional injuries. Logically, a \"chilling\" effect on the therapy is much more likely to occur if a therapist is burdened with potential liability for a third party's emotional damages. But the limited emotional distress duty that we find in this case won't punish a therapist who comports with the standards required by the practice of his or her profession:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   Importantly, it is not just the nature of the relationship that supports emotional distress damages, but the high likelihood of such damages from negligent acts engaged in by the [therapist].

Thus, that determination doesn't end our analysis. We must still consider whether any of the three overarching policy concerns from our negligent infliction of emotional distress case law mandate a different result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   \u00b6 107 One concern is the genuineness of claims, both in terms of their existence and in causation.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b659.

The potential class of victims is limited because a claim \"may be brought only by those who have been wrongfully accused of sexually abusing their [child], not by the unknown numbers of individuals whose relationship with the patient is negatively affected by the [reckless] therapy.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sawyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11480833\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/227/124/\">\n    595 N.W.2d at 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the severity of the harm hasn't changed: the plaintiff must still establish that he or she has suffered severe emotional distress.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b677. Thus, the second general policy concern doesn't support eliminating a duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   \u00b6 109 The final concern we address is whether plaintiffs should only be allowed to recover for a breach of a duty owed to them.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b659. The duty established here is owed not to the child, but to the parent directly.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b690. Thus, the parent will be recovering for a duty owed directly to him or her, satisfying this policy concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   \u00b6 110 For these reasons, the special policy considerations don't warrant removing liability. Thus, we conclude that a treating therapist has a duty to a minor child's parents to refrain from recklessly giving rise to false memories or fabricated allegations of sexual abuse committed by the plaintiff nonpatient parent through affirmative acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   \u00b6 111 We recognize that this conclusion is contrary to some jurisdictions that preclude all liability for therapists who misdiagnose or give rise to false memories or fabricated allegations of childhood sexual abuse.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Trear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20281\">\n    82 Cal.Rptr.2d at 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a therapist has no duty to the parent of an adult patient for allegedly false recovered memories of sexual abuse);\n   <em>\n    Althaus ex rel.

We conclude that they don't. Treating therapists are obligated to conform to a standard of care when treating their patients. A therapist further owes a duty to a minor patient's parents to refrain from affirmative acts that recklessly violate the standard of care in a manner that gives rise to false memories or false allegations of sexual abuse committed by the plaintiff nonpatient parent. If the therapist breaches that duty in a way that causes a parent to suffer physical injury, property damage, or severe emotional distress that manifests itself through severe mental or physical symptoms, the therapist may be liable for those damages.
