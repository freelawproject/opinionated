The district court found no issues of material fact and granted summary judgment to all defendants, concluding that Mr. Hopkinson and his businesses were protected by a valid release of liability signed by Mr. Dimick; Mr. Hopkinson committed no willful and wanton acts; Mrs. Hopkinson was neither a proximate cause of Mr. Dimick's injuries nor engaged in a joint venture with Mr. Hopkinson; and the family trust did not exist.

Mark III Enterprises, LLC,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which is solely owned by Mr. Hopkinson, owns a 120-acre working ranch (the Ranch) adjacent to the historic site. During the Rendezvous, Mr. Hopkinson operates a portion of the Ranch as a temporary, for-profit campground for approximately 250-400 attendees known as \"Fort Bridger Tin Tipi Village\" (Tin Tipi Village). Each year, Mr. Hopkinson clears a hayfield on the Ranch and designates camping areas. Tin Tipi Village provides well water, portable toilets, commercial garbage containers, fire barrels, and firewood, and allows vendors to sell other amenities. Upon entering, campers sign a release of liability, pay a fee, and park their vehicles or campers in designated camping spaces. Mrs. Hopkinson performs various tasks in the office and around the campground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 4] The Dimicks, who had been attending the Rendezvous and camping at Tin Tipi Village for over twenty years, arrived at Tin Tipi Village on August 30, 2013. Mr. Dimick signed the \"Fort Bridger Rendezvous 2013 Tin Tipi Parking Release &amp; Waiver of Liability\" (the Release), paid the entrance fee, parked their pickup and fifth-wheel camper in a campsite, and set up camp with his family. Soon after, Mr. Dimick's father reported that an irrigation ditch between the campsite and the portable toilets was slick to walk across. The previous year, when faced with the same problem, Mr. Dimick had found a wooden pallet on the Ranch property and placed it in the ditch as a dry walking surface. At the end of the Rendezvous, Mr. Dimick had returned the pallet to where he had found it. When his father reported the\n   slick conditions, Mr. Dimick decided to retrieve the same pallet. Mr. Dimick drove his pickup less than a quarter mile on a dirt road into the Ranch property, parked his pickup, and walked about 20 or 30 feet off the road into a rough patch of land located outside the designated camping areas and used by the Ranch as a \"work area.\" Among cut firewood, unused fire barrels, and other debris, he located what he believed to be the same pallet laying flat on a 15-foot, square concrete slab. Mr. Dimick testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I picked [the pallet] up with my left hand, kind of stepping in towards it to grab the bottom with my right hand. [I saw] a piece of metal that was underneath it, and didn't think anything was unusual with that. And when I stepped onto the metal, instantly [fell through an opening] into the septic tank and-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Suddenly, I don't know where I am, and the pallet come down on top of me and smacked me against the side of the manhole.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 5] Only a few days earlier, Mr. Hopkinson had hired United Services to empty the septic tank. The United Services agent accessed the tank from an opening at the top of the underground tank (level with the surface of the ground), measuring somewhere between 16- to 24-inches in diameter. The cement cover to the opening was either stuck or too heavy for one person to lift, and Mr. Hopkinson and the agent removed it together. Once removed, the agent informed Mr. Hopkinson that the cover was not safe; if stepped on, it could \"swivel\" and fall into the tank. After the agent finished cleaning out the tank, Mr. Hopkinson decided he would not reinstall the cover, either because it was faulty or because it was too heavy to put back himself. Instead, Mr. Hopkinson put a piece of sheet metal over the opening to keep out debris and placed a wooden pallet on top of the sheet metal to prevent someone from stepping on the sheet metal and falling into the tank. Once in place, he jumped up and down on the pallet to test its strength.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 6] Mr. Dimick lifted the same pallet that Mr. Hopkinson had used to cover the opening, stepped on the sheet metal, and fell into the septic tank. As a result of the fall, Mr. Dimick suffered injuries requiring emergency medical treatment and subsequent surgeries. The Dimicks brought negligence claims against the defendants, seeking remuneration for their losses and, due to the defendants' alleged willful and wanton misconduct, punitive damages. Upon the defendants' motions, the district court granted summary judgment to all the defendants on various grounds, discussed in detail below. The Dimicks timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b6 7] A district court may grant summary judgment \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" W.R.C.P. 56(c) (2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The party requesting summary judgment bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that summary judgment should be granted as a matter of law....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Once a prima facie showing is made, the burden shifts to the party opposing the motion to present evidence showing that there are genuine issues of material fact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Bogdanski v.

In the second clause, the signing party releases and discharges Mark III, LLC for injury, loss, or damage suffered by the signing party or his family while on the Ranch, regardless of its cause. A compound sentence containing two ideas does not in itself create an ambiguity.

The Dimicks assert that when Mr. Dimick entered the campground and signed the Release, the person collecting fees and signatures at the entrance of the Ranch indicated to him that the property was in the same condition as the previous year (yet, by removing the septic tank cover and placing the pallet over the opening, Mr. Hopkinson had \"significantly altered\" the condition of the property).

From the vantage point most favorable to the Dimicks, absent conjecture, one cannot reasonably infer that the employee answering \"No\" to the question \"Has anything changed?\" constituted a representation by the defendants that property conditions remained unchanged from 2012 to 2013, upon which Mr. Dimick premised his consent to the Release. We find that the Release was the entire agreement of the parties, did not violate public policy, and plainly expressed the parties' intent to eliminate liability for injuries caused by negligent acts.

He jumped up and down on the pallet to make sure that it would safely hold a person who stepped on it. He did not warn campers about the potential hazard, but the septic tank was in a work site located outside designated camping areas. He did, however, warn the employee who would be responsible for pumping the tank. These facts, if undisputed, establish a prima facie showing that summary judgment should be granted, as they do not demonstrate the type of conduct necessary to establish willful and wanton misconduct. There was not a \"high degree of probability\" that someone would step into a 16- to 24-inch opening covered by sheet metal and a pallet in a work area outside the designated camping area. And, by placing a pallet over the hole, testing the pallet with his full weight, and warning the employee who was required to come into the area, Mr. Hopkinson manifested an intent to avoid-not a disregard of-the harmful consequences of utilizing a makeshift lid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   [\u00b6 20] The Dimicks contend that there are genuine issues of material fact as to Mr. Hopkinson's conduct that should be settled by a jury. The Dimicks identify the following facts in the record: Mr. Hopkinson did not replace the septic tank lid because it was too heavy to put back on by himself; Mr. Hopkinson knew or should have known that campers used pallets on the Ranch property for their own use; and Mr. Hopkinson did not mark off the work area or post warning signs. The Dimicks also offer the testimony of their \"human factors\" expert, Joellen Gill, who stated that Mr. Hopkinson made a \"conscious decision\" to remove the lid to the septic tank and replace it with sheet metal and a pallet; Mr. Hopkinson's makeshift lid \"effectively camouflaged\" an open hole; \"the hazard was intentionally created by Mr. Hopkinson with his own knowledge\"; Mr. Hopkinson's conduct was \"reckless\"; and Mr. Hopkinson \"recognized the hazard yet hid it from anybody who might have occasion to be in that area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   [\u00b6 21] Accepting Ms. Gill's expert testimony as reliable for the purposes of summary judgment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   we must place some of her statements in context. Ms. Gill stated that \"the hazard was intentionally created by Mr. Hopkinson with his own knowledge\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to indicate that Mr. Hopkinson intended to do harm. Instead, Ms. Gill was explaining that the hazard was \"manmade\" rather than an inherent danger of the Ranch property. Ms. Gill's full statement was: \"So it's something that's manmade, the hazard was intentionally created by Mr. Hopkinson with his own knowledge.\" It is undisputed that the hazard was manmade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   [\u00b6 22] Although Ms. Gill characterized Mr. Hopkinson's actions as \"reckless,\" she stated: \"I am not using that language with any kind of legal definition.... [B]y 'reckless,' I mean making decisions without regard for the consequences to other individuals.\" Ms. Gill's definition of \"reckless\" falls short of willful and wanton misconduct. In addition to demonstrating that Mr. Hopkinson disregarded the consequences to other individuals, the Dimicks must show that \"a reasonable person would know that such conduct would, in a high degree of probability, result in harm to another.\"\n   <em>\n    Cramer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7335262\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/204/974/\">\n    2009 WY 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7335262\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/204/974/\">\n    204 P.3d at 979\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   [\u00b6 23] Finally, we are unable to read Ms. Gill's statement that Mr. Hopkinson \"recognized the hazard but yet hid it\" to mean that Mr. Hopkinson intentionally hid the opening. Although an expert witness may \"assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,\" W.R.E. 702, \"to establish ... a genuine issue of material fact, [an expert] must provide not only the conclusion,\n   but also the basis for the conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Chapter IV.

Ms. Gill cites no specific facts in the record indicating that Mr. Hopkinson intentionally hid the opening. To the contrary, in both her report and testimony, Ms. Gill repeatedly states that Mr. Hopkinson's makeshift lid \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     effectively\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   camouflaged\" the opening and \"created a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     functionally\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   hidden hazard.\" (Emphasis added.)

(Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   [\u00b6 24] Altogether, the facts identified by the Dimicks, given the benefit of all favorable inferences, demonstrate that Mr. Hopkinson: consciously decided not to replace the lid onto the septic tank because it was too heavy to put back himself; failed to recognize that his method of covering the opening effectively camouflaged a hazardous condition; knew or should have known that campers placed pallets across slippery irrigation ditches; and disregarded the consequences to other individuals by creating a functionally hidden hazard-of which he did not warn campers. \"A fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WY%2045\">\n    2018 WY 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12566474\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/415/1270/#p1279\">\n    415 P.3d at 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). While these facts, if proven, would bolster a negligence claim, they do not establish the elements of willful and wanton misconduct. There remains no evidence that there existed a \"high degree of probability\" that a camper would enter the work site located outside the designated camping area, let alone remove the pallet and step directly onto the sheet metal covering the 16- to 24-inch opening.

In short, to establish equal right of control, the proponent must prove that the parties agreed, either expressly or impliedly, that each possesses a privilege to control the venture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   [\u00b6 32] It is undisputed that Mr. Hopkinson purchased the Ranch in 1999, and ran the for-profit campground, a business venture, for many years on his own. Mrs. Hopkinson first began \"helping\" her husband in 2011, two years before Mr. Dimick's fall. Mrs. Hopkinson testified that she did \"office things,\" such as typing up the Release, making and setting up signs, and putting up the tent they use as an office. She also greeted campers as they entered the campground, answered questions, and collected garbage from campsites. She would do \"whatever [Mr. Hopkinson] tells me he needs me to do for him.... Whatever I am told to do, I do.\" This testimony establishes a prima facie showing that her agreement to participate in the venture did not include an equal right of control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   [\u00b6 33] The Dimicks counter that the Tin Tipi Village website evidences a genuine issue\n   of material fact as to Mrs. Hopkinson's equal right of control. Specifically, they cite Mrs. Hopkinson's testimony that the contact number listed on the Tin Tipi Village website is Mrs. Hopkinson's personal cell phone number. Additionally, the Dimicks argue, the Hopkinsons use the pronouns \"we\" and \"us\" on the website. For example, the website states: \"Help us help you!\"; \"We want to be able to supply you with water during the week if you run low\"; and \"We appreciate those of you who bring in your own fire barrels, but if you don't have a fire barrel and need to rent one from us, you can do that at the registration tent.\" One cannot reasonably infer from these facts an agreement between Mr. and Mrs. Hopkinson, express or implied, that each \"has the right and is possessed of equal authority\" to direct the business.\n   <em>\n    Lightner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1461766\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/240/21/\">\n    727 P.2d at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

Because the Dimicks do not meet the fourth element-presenting evidence of the existence of an equal right of control-we need not consider the other elements to conclude that Mrs. Hopkinson was not engaged in a joint venture with Mr. Hopkinson. In the absence of facts upon which a jury could find Mrs. Hopkinson to be either a proximate cause of Mr. Dimick's injuries or a coventurer with Mr. Hopkinson, Mrs. Hopkinson is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III.

The only evidence of the trust's existence is that the name of the trust appears on a form titled \"Fort Bridger Rendezvous Association PRE Registration Form\" for \"Tin/Tipi Village\" (the Registration Form). The Registration Form lists Fort Bridger Rendezvous Association's address as a post office box in Woodruff, Utah. Below the registration information, there is a release of liability, which states: \"I/We hereby release Scott Hopkinson, the Hopkinson Family Trust, Mark III Enterprises, LLC, the Fort Bridger Rendezvous Association, their officers, associates, successors in interest\" from liability resulting from activities on \"the Hopkinson Property.\" The Registration Form (and the release of liability contained within it) is not the Release that Mr. Dimick signed, and the Dimicks offered it only to demonstrate the existence of the Hopkinson Family Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   [\u00b6 35] Mrs. Hopkinson testified that she and Mr. Hopkinson did not have a trust, and she had no knowledge of the Registration Form:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Q.
