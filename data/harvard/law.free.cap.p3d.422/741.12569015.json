Stevens, was charged on March 15, 1994 by Amended Information in the District Court of Canadian County with Murder in the First Degree ( 21 O.S.1991, \u00a7 701.7 ) in Case No. CF-1994-90; Shooting With Intent to Kill ( 21 O.S.Supp.1992, \u00a7 652 ) in Case No. CF-1994-91; and Forcible Sodomy ( 21 O.S.Supp.1992, \u00a7 888 ) in Case No. CF-1994-230.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 22, 1995, the State filed a Bill of Particulars in Case No. CF-1994-90 giving Petitioner notice that it intended to seek the death penalty as punishment for his commission of First Degree Murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 On April 19, 1996, Petitioner, while represented by counsel, entered a negotiated plea. Petitioner entered a plea of guilty to the murder offense and a plea of no contest to the other two offenses. The Honorable Edward C. Cunningham, District Judge, accepted Petitioner's pleas. As to CF-1994-90, the District Court sentenced Petitioner to imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole and ordered that this sentence run consecutively to his sentence in District Court of Oklahoma County Case No. CF-1994-5960.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to CF-1994-91 and CF-1994-230, the District Court sentenced Petitioner to imprisonment for ten (10) years and ordered the sentences to run concurrent with Petitioner's sentence in CF-1994-90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 Petitioner did not seek to withdraw his plea and his conviction and sentence became final on April 30, 1996. On April 27, 1997, Petitioner filed his first Application for Post-Conviction relief. On July 10, 1997, the District Court denied Petitioner's application. On October 2, 1997, this Court denied his appeal of the District Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Robert A. Stevens v. State\n   </em>\n   , Case No. PC-1997-1131, unpub. dispo. (Okl. Cr. Oct. 2, 1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 On January 17, 2017, Petitioner filed his Second Application for Post-Conviction Relief. Relying on 22 O.S.2011, \u00a7 1080, Petitioner claimed that his sentence of life without the possibility of parole was in violation of the Constitution in light of the United States Supreme Court's pronouncements in\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

On January 23, 2017, the State filed its Response requesting that the District Court deny Petitioner's application. On February 6, 2017, the District Court entered its Order Denying Post-Conviction Relief summarily denying Petitioner's application without the aid of a hearing pursuant to 22 O.S.2011, \u00a7 1084. Petitioner timely appeals the denial of his Second Application for Post-Conviction Relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 On September 20, 2017, we directed the State to file a response to Petitioner's appeal. The State filed its answer brief on November 20, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 On or about the 8th day of March, 1994, Petitioner, while acting conjointly with Marcus Dewayne Stevens and Michael Ray Goode, kidnapped Johnny Lawrence and Lamount Dority and held them against their will. Petitioner, Goode, and Stevens shot Lawrence with handguns with the premeditated design to effect his death. Petitioner also fired a pistol at Dority, intending his death. On that same day, Petitioner forced a female victim to orally sodomize him. Lawrence died from his wounds. These offenses occurred in Canadian County, Oklahoma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 Petitioner had not attained 18 years of age. He was 17 years and 259 days old at the time of the offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 In his plea form, Petitioner admitted to shooting and killing Lawrence. In addition to that statement, the District Court had several different sources of information about Petitioner available to it at the plea hearing. The court heard evidence concerning the other offenses which Petitioner had committed, including the offense of First Degree Murder which Petitioner had committed in Oklahoma County. Petitioner shot and killed Jessie T. Bradley with a rifle on January 25, 1994. This occurred prior to the present offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 The District Court file in Canadian County contained the records concerning Petitioner's mental capacity. On June 24, 1994, an Application for Determination of Competency was filed on Petitioner's behalf. The District Court held a hearing on the application on June 28, 1994, and ordered that Petitioner be evaluated at the State mental health facility in Vinita. On December 15, 1994, the District Court held a post-examination competency hearing and determined that Petitioner was competent to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610 The District Court file also contained records concerning Petitioner's youthfulness. Based upon the fact that he was seventeen (17) years of age at the time of the charged offenses, Petitioner filed an Application for Certification as a Juvenile. On May 26, 1995, the District Court held a hearing on Petitioner's request, considered Petitioner's evidence and the statutory factors, and denied the application. Petitioner timely appealed the denial of his application and on December 12, 1995, this Court affirmed the District Court's denial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 Petitioner asserts, again on appeal, that his sentence of life without the possibility of parole is in violation of the United States Constitution because he committed the offense before the age of 18. He argues that the District Court wrongly determined that the Supreme Court's recent decisions in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   did not apply to him when it summarily denied his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 This Court reviews the District Court's determination of an application for post-conviction relief for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

As the District Court failed to properly consider the applicable law pertaining to Petitioner's claim, we find that the District Court abused its discretion when it summarily denied Petitioner's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b614 \"The Post-Conviction Procedure Act governs post-conviction proceedings in this State.\"\n   <em>\n    Wackerly v.
