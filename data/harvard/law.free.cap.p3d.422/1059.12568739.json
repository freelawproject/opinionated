Loncar claimed the State discriminated against her based on her gender by offering state employee benefits to unmarried same-sex couples but denying those benefits to unmarried heterosexual couples.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 We hold that the State did not violate Loncar's state or federal constitutional rights because Loncar and her male domestic partner were not similarly situated with same-sex couples who were legally prohibited from marrying. The State's action was based on marriage eligibility and rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. Accordingly, we affirm the superior court's dismissal of Loncar's sex discrimination claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 Loncar and her male domestic partner, Christopher Kutcher (\"Kutcher\"), had a long-term, committed partnership for several decades. They lived together, had two children together, and shared income and expenses, but they were not married. In 2006, Loncar was hired by the State. In 2008, the Arizona Department of Administration and Personnel Board enacted rules giving certain benefits for \"domestic partners\" of state employees, regardless of sexual orientation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Admin. Code R2-5-101(22) (2008). Because Kutcher was Loncar's domestic partner, she identified him as her dependent for state employee benefits, including coverage for life insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 In 2010, the Arizona Legislature enacted Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 38-651(O), defining \"dependent,\" as relevant here, to mean \"a spouse under the laws of this state,\" thereby invalidating Kutcher's previous designation as Loncar's dependent for purposes of receiving state employee benefits. Because same-sex couples were prohibited from marrying in Arizona at that time, their dependent designations for state employee benefits were also negated under A.R.S. \u00a7 38-651(O), and they sued for declaratory and injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

Ariz. 2010). On July 23, 2010, before the statute's effective date, the United States District Court enjoined the State \"from enforcing A.R.S. \u00a7 38-651(O) to eliminate family insurance eligibility for lesbian and gay State employees, and their domestic partners\" and specifically ordered the State \"to make available family health insurance coverage for lesbian and gay State employees ... to the same extent such benefits are made available to married State employees[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4119394\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/727/797/#p815\">\n    727 F.Supp.2d at 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, as of July 2010, same-sex domestic partners were eligible to be dependents for the purposes of state employee\n   benefits, but unmarried opposite-sex domestic partners were not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 On June 7, 2014, Kutcher died in a car accident. Because Kutcher was not Loncar's dependent under A.R.S. \u00a7 38-651(O), he had no state life insurance coverage, and Loncar received no insurance benefits following his death. The District Court then dissolved the preliminary injunction effective December 31, 2014, because, as of that date, same-sex couples could legally marry in Arizona and, if they chose to marry, would qualify for state employee benefits under A.R.S. \u00a7 38-651(O).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 On April 21, 2016, Loncar filed a complaint alleging sex discrimination and seeking \"a declaration that the distinction in State benefits between employees in same sex domestic partnerships and different sex domestic partnerships\" violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Privileges &amp; Immunities and Preferential Treatment of Employees Clauses of the Arizona Constitution. Loncar also sought the life insurance proceeds to which she would have been entitled if she could have designated Kutcher as her dependent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 The State moved to dismiss, arguing Loncar failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because, among other things, A.R.S. \u00a7 38-651(O) did not confer any privilege on unmarried same-sex couples that it withheld from unmarried heterosexual couples. Loncar countered that the State withheld benefits to unmarried heterosexual couples based solely on her sex as female, a protected class. After full briefing and oral argument, in March 2017, the superior court dismissed Loncar's claims. The court found that (1) \"based upon the plain meaning of the term, 'sex' refers only to membership in a class delineated by gender, and not to sexual orientation;\" (2) \"[a]s [Loncar] conceded at oral argument, sexual orientation is not expressly included in the constitutionally protected class;\" (3) Loncar \"therefore does not fall within the protected class and may not bring a claim under the Preferential Treatment of Employees Clause for preferential treatment or discrimination based on sexual orientation;\" (4) the State did not violate the Equal Protection Clause or the Privileges &amp; Immunities Clause because it \"had a reasonable basis in these circumstances for providing life-insurance coverage to unmarried same-sex couples\" in complying with the District Court orders; and (5) as determined by the District Court, \"same-sex domestic partners were not similarly situated with opposite sex domestic partners for purposes of application of A.R.S. \u00a7 38-651(O)... [since] insurance benefits were available to heterosexual couples because there was no legal impediment to such couples, including [Loncar and Kutcher], getting married.\" Loncar unsuccessfully moved to set aside the final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 Loncar timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to Article 6, Section 9, of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) and -2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the superior court's grant of a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    Pivotal Colo.

First, as a heterosexual couple, Loncar and Kutcher were not \"similarly situated\" persons with same-sex couples. Loncar and Kutcher had the fundamental legal right to marry and could have obtained employee benefits, including insurance on Kutcher's life, as \"a spouse under the laws of this state.\" Nothing in the State's decision to offer benefits to same-sex couples impeded or prevented Loncar from doing so at any time. In contrast, short of litigation, same-sex couples had no option to legally marry to obtain employee benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14 Next, the State's extension of benefits to same-sex couples was reasonable and rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. The District Court specifically ordered the State \"to make available family health insurance coverage for lesbian and gay State employees ... to the same extent such benefits are made available to married State employees[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4119394\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/727/797/#p815\">\n    727 F.Supp.2d at 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The State complied with the District Court's explicit directive by offering benefits to same-sex couples-a reasonable basis for distinguishing between same-sex domestic partners and heterosexual domestic partners and rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 15 Loncar argues that the State's action did not serve a legitimate government purpose because \"[s]aving money was the only excuse the State has ever proffered for not providing the same life insurance to unmarried\n   different-sex domestic partners that it provided to unmarried same-sex domestic partners.\" She cites to\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831753\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/1008/\">\n    656 F.3d at 1014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for the proposition that when \"savings depend upon distinguishing between homosexual and heterosexual employees,\n   <em>\n    similarly situated\n   </em>\n   ... such a distinction cannot survive rational basis review.\" (Emphasis added). Again, Loncar and Kutcher were not similarly situated to same-sex couples because they could legally marry. We find that the State's strict compliance with the District Court's direct order was a legitimate government purpose for offering same-sex couples employee benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Church\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1477652\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/173/342/#p349\">\n    173 Ariz. at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1477652\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/173/342/#p349\">\n    842 P.2d at 1363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 16 Nevertheless, Loncar urges us to examine the State's action applying strict scrutiny review, rather than rational basis review, because she argues it implicates a classification based on a person's sex. As discussed,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20, the State's action was not based on Loncar's biological designation as female, but on her marriage eligibility as a heterosexual couple. It is undisputed that sexual orientation is not a suspect class and employee benefits do not involve a fundamental right. Therefore, we evaluate the State's action applying rational basis review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 17 Loncar next argues that \"[f]orcing a person into marriage just to get insurance benefits available to other persons who are not married ... is an assault on personal choice and individual freedom.\" To support her assertion that she has the \"right\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to marry,\" Loncar cites to\n   <em>\n    Obergefell v.

The\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   petitioners, more than a dozen same-sex couples, however were denied the legal right to marry and participate in that most-important institution; they were suing for the right to share in the \"privileges and responsibilities\" attendant with marriage.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 2594. Loncar has always possessed that right - the personal choice and individual freedom to marry (or not marry). But along with that personal right and choice flows the consequences of marital status, none of which are unconstitutional as a matter of law.

These aspects of marital status include: taxation; inheritance and property rights; rules of intestate succession; spousal privilege in the law of evidence; hospital access; medical decisionmaking authority; adoption rights; the rights and benefits of survivors; birth and death certificates; professional ethics rules; campaign finance restrictions; workers' compensation benefits; health insurance; and child custody, support, and visitation rules. Valid marriage under state law is also a significant status for over a thousand provisions of federal law. The States have contributed to the fundamental character of the marriage right by placing that institution at the center of so many facets of the legal and social order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591054\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2584/#p2589\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 18 In sum, the State did not violate Loncar's federal or state equal protection rights. She would not be entitled to relief under any set of facts and dismissal of her complaint was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The State Did Not Violate the Preferential Treatment of Employees Clause of the Arizona Constitution.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 19 Finally, Loncar argues that the State denied her employee benefits provided to same-sex domestic partners simply because biologically she is female and Kutcher was male; whereas partners who were both male or both female were eligible for benefits. Thus, Loncar contends the State committed sex discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 20 Under the Arizona Constitution, the State \"shall not grant preferential treatment\n   to or discriminate against any individual or group on the basis of ... sex ... in the operation of public employment[.]\" Ariz. Const. art. 2, \u00a7 36 (A). In her brief, Loncar spends a great deal of time explaining and defining \"sex\" to mean the classification of organisms into the two divisions of female and male. This, she argues, is the root of the issue (and the State's discrimination) and the superior court erred in \"focus[ing] on irrelevant terms and concepts such as 'gender,' 'sexual orientation,' 'sexual preference,' and 'sexual affiliation.' \" But Loncar's argument misses the mark. Here, as mandated by the District Court injunction, the State's action in offering employee benefits to same-sex couples and not to unmarried heterosexual couples was not based on the biological sex of either person in the couple; it was based solely on the distinction of marriage eligibility. At that time, same-sex couples were not eligible to marry, yet opposite-sex couples were. In other words, the couple's sexual orientation determined their eligibility to marry and obtain benefits; the State's action was based on that distinction alone. As Loncar concedes, sexual orientation is not a constitutionally protected class. Thus, the State did not violate the Preferential Treatment of Employees Clause of the Arizona Constitution and Loncar's claim fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 21 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the superior court's dismissal of Loncar's claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without citation to authority, Loncar requests attorneys' fees and costs on appeal. We deny her request.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Loncar also argues that (1) Arizona's Declaratory Judgment Act supports her claims because her rights were affected by a statute; (2) the one-year statute of limitations does not bar her claims because she is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief only, not monetary damages under a typical tort action; and (3) the State is not immune from liability under either a legislative or administrative function because she is not seeking damages and the State's action involved no exercise of discretion. Because we find the constitutional issues dispositive and affirm the superior court's dismissal on those grounds, we need not address Loncar's additional arguments.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Forszt v. Rodriguez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3236683\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/212/263/#p265\">\n     212 Ariz. 263\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 265, \u00b6 9,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3236683\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/212/263/#p265\">\n     130 P.3d 538\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 540 (App. 2006) (\"We may affirm the trial court's ruling if it is correct for any reason apparent in the record.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Moreover, because the nature of Loncar's claims are ill-defined, we are unable to determine the applicable statute of limitations and rule on that issue. Although Loncar's complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, it also sought the life insurance proceeds for a non-existent policy despite her contention that this is not an action for monetary damages. It is unclear if her claims are based on, for example, a breach of contract (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , pursuant to her employment contract, she was eligible to purchase a life insurance policy and pay the premiums, thereby holding a policy in effect at the time of Kutcher's death) or tort (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , money damages in the amount of the life insurance policy payout rendered void when Kutcher was no longer considered Loncar's dependent). Each cause of action, whether state or federal, involves different statute-of-limitations periods. Because we reach the merits and affirm the superior court's ruling on the constitutional issues, remanding to develop the record regarding the applicable statute of limitations would be futile.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
