Elliott, District Judge. The jury found Fabion guilty on all counts and assessed punishment at death on the two first degree murder convictions, after finding the existence of both of the aggravating circumstances. The jury assessed ten (10) years imprisonment and a $5,000 fine on the conspiracy count. Judge Elliott formally sentenced Fabion in accordance with the jury verdict on August 11, 2014. Thereafter, Fabion perfected his appeal to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 Fabion was the estranged husband of the victim, Jessica Brown. They were in the process of divorcing, and Fabion owed child support for their two children. The Browns' marital problems began sometime in 2009, and Jessica Brown told family and friends that she was afraid of her husband. Ms. Brown filed for divorce in April 2011, and she received temporary custody of the children. Fabion's child visitation was limited by court order but he wanted custody of their two children or, at least, expanded visitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 During the summer of 2011, Ms. Brown became pregnant with a third child. She expressed plans to move back, with her children, to her home State of Washington to be near her family. Fabion told friends and acquaintances that he did not want Jessica to take the children away to Washington. Emily Matheson testified that Fabion discussed his options, including the killing of his wife, to get her out of the picture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 On the morning of January 11, 2012, officers of the Midwest City Police Department responded to a call reporting that two children, ages six and three, were in the street in front of Jessica Brown's home. Officers arrived and noticed that the front door of the home was open. Upon checking the home, officers found Jessica Brown lying lifeless at the foot of her bed. She had been shot in the head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 On that same day, Fabion appeared at the Oklahoma County courthouse for a hearing on his child support. He had told Matheson that he thought he would go to jail for not paying support. While he was at the courthouse, he was told that Jessica was found dead at her house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Matheson testified against Fabion. She met Fabion in October 2011. They moved into an apartment together shortly thereafter. After they moved in together, Fabion began discussing the prospect of murdering Jessica. Fabion was employed at Club ATL as a disc jockey. Matheson spent quite a bit of time at the club. They met Brodric Glover at the club. Glover was employed to clean the club after it closed. Glover was included in the discussions about killing Jessica.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 A plan was conceived whereby Glover would be paid $250 dollars for killing Jessica. Fabion wanted Glover to kill Jessica during the night while she was at home. Fabion told Glover how to get into the house and told him he could not use a .40 caliber weapon, as Fabion had once owned a .40 caliber weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 Matheson testified that the three of them drove by Jessica's house during the first week of January 2012. Fabion said that he wanted Jessica killed before his January 11 child support hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 On January 9, 2012, Fabion leased a Kia Soul, for one day, from a rental company located at the Sears store in Quail Springs Mall. Fabion took out a payday loan that day, met Glover, gave him $125, and gave him the Kia Soul. Fabion and Matheson went to a casino that night and rented a room. About midnight, Glover called and said the killing would not take place that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 The next day, January 10, Fabion extended the lease of the Kia for an additional day. That evening, Fabion asked Jessica Eckiwaudah to spend the night and hang out. She agreed. Fabion, Matheson and Eckiwaudah played video games until about midnight. The three then turned in for the night. Eckiwaudah went to sleep on the couch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 At about 3:00 a.m. that night, Glover called Matheson and told her that the killing was done. She relayed the information to Fabion. Fabion gave her $125, and she drove Fabion's pickup to the Belle Isle Wal-Mart to meet Glover and pay him the $125. Eckiwaudah saw Matheson leave the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13 Glover was at the Wal-Mart in the Kia Soul with two other individuals. After meeting with Glover, Matheson returned to the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14 The investigation revealed that Jessica Brown died from two nine millimeter caliber gunshot wounds to the head. Jessica Brown's unborn child was viable at the time of her death, as her pregnancy was 24 weeks and two days along. The authorities utilized video surveillance tapes, wire-taps, cell phone usage data, and interviews before arresting Matheson, Fabion and Glover. Matheson was the first to be arrested. During her first contact with police, she denied any involvement, but later confessed to the murder plot. Glover did not testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ISSUES RELATED TO WAIVER OF COUNSEL AND\n    <em>\n     PRO SE\n    </em>\n    REPRESENTATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 In proposition one Fabion claims that the waiver of his right to counsel was not voluntary, knowing or intelligent. A defendant's right to waive representation by counsel and proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   is found in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Faretta v.

State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6983480\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/271/67/\">\n    2012 OK CR 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6983480\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/271/67/\">\n    271 P.3d 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 72. Even when a defendant exhibits an unrealistic or foolish view of his case and possible defenses, he may still be granted the right to choose self-representation.\n   <em>\n    Maynard v. Boone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8454165\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/468/665/#p678\">\n    468 F.3d 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 678 (10th Cir. 2006). It is only necessary that a defendant be made aware of the problems of self-representation so the record establishes that he understands that his actions in proceeding without counsel may be to his ultimate detriment.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 678-79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 17 Fabion claims that he was forced to choose between either unprepared, ineffective counsel, or waive counsel and represent himself. Undoubtedly, a defendant who faces a choice between incompetent or unprepared counsel and appearing\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   faces a constitutional dilemma.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Padilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1710215\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/819/952/#p955\">\n    819 F.2d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 955 (10th Cir.1987).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 18 Fabion cites several instances where he complained about counsel before he decided to ask the trial court to allow him to represent himself. His complaints centered on a lack of communication and the inability to assert a speedy trial right. He voiced complaints about access to discovery materials, claimed counsel was misinforming him about significant legal issues, and improperly coercing him into taking a plea deal. Fabion continuously sent letters to the trial court complaining about his appointed counsel. Finally, in a letter dated March 10, 2014, Fabion requested that he be allowed to represent himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 19 On March 13, 2014, the trial court conducted a hearing on Fabion's request pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   . As part of that hearing, the trial court specifically inquired whether or not Fabion was requesting to represent himself because counsel was constitutionally ineffective. A defendant's complaints about counsel must rise to the level of ineffectiveness that would allow a defendant to assert a right to new counsel.\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1710215\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/819/952/#p955\">\n    819 F.2d at 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 20 This Court has recognized valid reasons for discharge of an appointed counsel and appointment of new counsel; they include demonstrable prejudice against the defendant, incompetence, and conflict of interest.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1976%20OK%20CR%20292\">\n    1976 OK CR 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10474503\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/556/1285/#p1294\">\n    556 P.2d 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1294. Neither a personality conflict nor disagreements over the conduct of the defense constitute valid reasons.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10474503\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/556/1285/#p1294\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 21 Fabion's complaints were revealed during the\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   hearing. The trial court was very careful in its inquiry about Fabion's dissatisfaction with appointed counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Silkwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644087\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/893/245/#p248\">\n    893 F.2d 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248 (10th Cir. 1989). Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Silkwood\n   </em>\n   held that a trial court must, in order for a waiver of counsel to be deemed voluntary, delve into reasons why a defendant is dissatisfied with counsel and wants to proceed with self-representation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644087\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/893/245/#p248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This requirement ensures that a defendant is not exercising \"a choice between incompetent or unprepared counsel and appearing\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 22 Fabian's complaints, however, did not rise to the level that would have allowed him the appointment of a new attorney. His complaints were mere personality conflicts and disagreements. Fabion again complained that his attorney tried to convince him to enter a plea instead of risking the death penalty. He argued that counsel, in his words, \"insinuated\" that he could not get a fair trial because of his biracial marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 23 Counsel responded and told the court that she as well as other attorneys involved in the case explained to him about the expected racial makeup of the jury. Counsel indicated that there was some evidence (in\n   the form of text messages) that Fabion knew, well in advance of meeting with his attorneys, that trial would be difficult because of the difference in race between him and his wife. These conversations, in the worst case scenario, are things that experienced trial counsel would point out to a client, so a client could make informed decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 24 Fabion was allowed to further specify his dissatisfaction. He stated that he believed his attorney wasn't totally honest, as he had asked his attorney certain questions and she would give an answer, but he would research and find cases supporting a contradictory answer. He claimed he even found a case where his attorney was involved and when he asked his attorney about it, he got no response. Fabion then generally complained that there was a lack of communication, because he didn't always get responses to his letters, and sometimes he did not \"get a clear answer.\" He complained he didn't get explanations about the contradictory research. He stated that he was \"having issues getting those why's ....\" He summed up his complaint by saying that he didn't trust that he was getting \"her best and I think I can do it better myself.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 25 Fabion expressed no dissatisfaction with co-counsel who was new to the case. Fabion's explanation was that he believed it would be a lot better for him if he went ahead and did it himself. Judge Elliott made the finding that Fabion was \"not dissatisfied with [counsel] ... because of their incompetence or their unpreparedness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 26 The record supports the trial court's decision and indicates that Fabion was not forced between the choice of accepting ineffective, incompetent counsel and the choice of representing himself; thus, his choice was not improperly coerced. On appeal, Fabion has not set forth any basis for the belief that his appointed attorneys were not providing adequate legal assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 27 Once the trial court determined that Fabion's decision of self-representation was not based on a valid belief that his appointed attorneys were constitutionally ineffective, the trial court proceeded to warn Fabion about the dangers of self-representation. The trial court pointed out to Fabion that, in his request to act as his own attorney, he admitted he didn't know what he was doing. Fabion explained that he meant that he was not familiar with the court rules and procedures. He claimed he could present the facts \"easily,\" because he knew \"the facts better than anyone else that would be present. And therefore, I would have an advantage in that area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 28 Judge Elliott acknowledged that he might know more about the facts, but he would also be required to know the law and the rules and procedures of the district court. Judge Elliott explained that his own bench book had taken him twenty-five years to compile, and Fabion would be expected to know the applicable rules, procedures and laws, whether based on cases, statutes or rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 29 Judge Elliott told Fabion that he would be expected to know as much as his appointed attorneys who were among the \"most experienced death penalty litigators in this State.\" He noted that part of their job is to \"save your life\" in a death penalty case. He explained that it is the attorney's job to examine the evidence and the law and make recommendations to their clients based on the law, the evidence, and their combined experience. Judge Elliott warned Fabion against listening to legal advice from others sitting in the jail or others out on the street. He also explained that if he was \"not guilty\" his attorneys would want a result that reflects that truth, even though their primary objective is to \"save your life.\" Judge Elliott then explained the real possibility of the death penalty being carried out in Oklahoma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 30 During the hearing, Judge Elliott warned Fabion several times that the trial court was limited on giving Fabion advice on rules and regulations such as issuing subpoenas, admitting evidence, and conducting\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   . He explained that the decision for Fabion to represent himself was Fabion's alone, and his decision to accept a plea deal was also his decision and no one could make him \"sign for anything.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 31 Judge Elliott warned Fabion that his chances of getting a fair trial were less likely if he represented himself, because he would\n   not \"understand the nuances of trying a death penalty case.\" He opined that the \"stakes are too high\" for self-representation in a death penalty case. Judge Elliott emphasized the fact that this could be a life or death decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 32 Judge Elliott next informed Fabion, as required by\n   <em>\n    Patterson v. Illinois\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775137\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/285/\">\n    487 U.S. 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775137\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/285/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775137\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/285/\">\n    101 L.Ed.2d 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988), of the pitfalls of representing himself, some of which he had already covered. Judge Elliott again explained that he would be bound by the same rules as his attorneys; he would have to voice objections in the same form as attorneys do, and have a legal basis for the objection. Fabion would have to follow courtroom procedures and local court rules, and he would have to conduct himself in the same manner required of attorneys. Judge Elliott explained that Fabion would get no preferential treatment due to his lack of experience and training. Judge Elliott also explained, that in his experience, a jury would not \"cut [Fabion] ... any slack\" because he was representing himself. Judge Elliott again reminded Fabion that he, as the Judge, could not tell him or advise him on the proper way to conduct a trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 33 Judge Elliott noted that Fabion seemed very confident, but warned that his reasonableness could be blinded by his confidence. Judge Elliott also noted that, unlike many defendants, Fabion seemed very articulate, but being articulate does not mean that he would be well versed in the law or in the procedures that he would be bound by. The record indicates that Fabion was twenty-four years old when he was charged. Fabion had already revealed that he was able to research legal matters by filing many\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   documents. The trial court finally advised that Fabion would be responsible for unfavorable rulings when Fabion did not follow the proper procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 34 One of Fabion's attorneys spoke up and reminded Fabion, and the trial court, that, to preserve the record on appeal, a remedy must be suggested. He was concerned that Fabion would not properly preserve a record for appeal. Judge Elliott added that Fabion risked the chance of error being waived on appeal because he did not preserve issues during trial. Judge Elliott explained that even the best trained lawyers make mistakes, so just imagine the mistakes he might make as someone untrained in the law. Even after these weighty warnings, Fabion acknowledged that he understood the pitfalls and still wanted to represent himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 35 Judge Elliott continued to question Fabion to determine whether he was making a knowing decision. He asked Fabion if anyone was encouraging him to represent himself, and Fabion indicated that no one was encouraging him to represent himself. To the contrary, Fabion indicated that his appointed attorneys warned him to be certain before he \"step[ped] off the dock.\" Fabion assured the trial court that he was making this decision of his own free will, that he had not been forced or threatened to make this decision, and no one had made him any promises in exchange for his decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 36 Finally, Judge Elliott warned Fabion that if he engaged in misconduct, obstructionism, or disruption of the proceedings, he was authorized to terminate Fabion's self-representation, and Fabion indicated that he understood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 37 Throughout the proceeding, Judge Elliott emphasized the serious nature of the death penalty.

Initially, at the\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   hearing, the trial court informed Fabion that he was on his own and he could not rely on standby counsel to assist him in any manner.

Fabion was under no disillusionment about the role of standby counsel when he made his waiver of counsel.

Standby counsel does not get to start over with a new strategy and proceeding. Standby counsel and Fabion surely understood this because the trial court told standby counsel that they were limited to Fabion's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   witness lists for first and second stage, should it become necessary for them to take over. Then, again, the trial court told the attorneys that they would, absolutely, be expected to be prepared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 69 Effective representation at the point that a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendant is required to accept representation does not mean that standby counsel may hit reset and start a different trial strategy. When a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendant has made strategic choices, standby counsel should be prepared to accept the strategic choices and take over. None of the trial court's orders regarding standby counsel's role, both active and passive would have created an issue had Fabion never indicated to standby counsel that he was \"in over his head.\" The idea that standby counsel is limited to a defendant's strategy if it becomes necessary for standby counsel to take over inoculates counsel from ineffective claims, especially in cases where a defendant causes a situation where standby counsel must step in and take over the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 70 Understandably, courts face a fine line between limiting standby counsel's participation and forbidding standby counsel from assisting at all. As long as standby counsel's participation does not create the perception before the jury that the defendant has not chosen self-representation, the participation is not harmful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 71 Here, the concept of standby counsel's role was not explained to this extent, so in proposition three, Fabion argues,\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1976%20OK%20CR%20292\">\n    1976 OK CR 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 42, 556 P.2d at 1297, that the most important role of standby counsel is to take over the case if requested by the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendant. This Court in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   actually held that the defendant had knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to counsel pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   decision. This Court strongly encouraged trial courts to appoint standby counsel if a defendant waives his right to counsel. The opinion reasons that standby counsel is encouraged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   If termination becomes necessary or if the defendant changes his mind and decides during the trial that he wants to be represented by counsel, a standby counsel would be able to step in and the trial could continue regardless of whether the defendant forfeits or relinquishes his right of self-representation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Despite the fact that this language is\n   <em>\n    dicta\n   </em>\n   , as it was clearly not necessary to the\n   decision in that case, the language is only an example of what may occur if a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendant believes he can change his mind during trial and wishes to be represented by counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 72 The confusion in the record regarding the role of standby counsel alone does not rise to a level which would require reversal of this case, because Fabion has not shown that he was denied the assistance of standby counsel in any way. The confusion, however, does support a conclusion that Fabion was unaware of the rights he was giving up by waiving counsel in the punishment stage of this trial. The confusion regarding the role of standby counsel and our conclusion that Fabion was unaware of the punishment stage rights he was waiving lead this Court to reverse Fabion's death sentences and remand this case for a new sentencing proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 73 At trial, Fabion's waiver of the right to have competent counsel assist in the presentation of mitigating evidence includes the waiver of competent presentation of that evidence. A defendant, therefore, should at least understand that mitigating evidence may be anything listed in Oklahoma Uniform Jury Instruction (OUJI) 4-79, as well as other evidence which might be considered as mitigating. So while a defendant must be informed of the possible defenses to the charges, he must also be informed about possible defenses to the aggravating circumstances and possible mitigating evidence which might be presented during the punishment stage of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 74 Here, there is absolutely nothing in the record to indicate that the trial court explained possible defenses to the aggravating circumstances or possible mitigating evidence. While neither the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, nor corresponding provisions of the Oklahoma Constitution or statutes require that mitigating evidence be presented on behalf of a defendant, a defendant must be given the opportunity to present such evidence. Along with a waiver of that opportunity, there exists the necessity of a record indicating that a defendant was informed of the mitigating evidence he is forfeiting.\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995%20OK%20CR%2019\">\n    1995 OK CR 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 20-23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10346298\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/893/504/#p512\">\n    893 P.2d at 512-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 75 There is no record in this case to indicate that Fabion sufficiently understood mitigating evidence. Compounding the failure to inform Fabion regarding defenses to second stage aggravators and possible mitigating evidence, is the method by which the trial court determined whether or not Fabion actually wanted counsel to represent him during the second stage. At the beginning of second stage, standby counsel notified the trial court that Fabion told her that he did not want to continue to represent himself. Standby counsel was questioned regarding the possibility of representing Fabion, and she explained she could not be prepared to present a second stage case that met her personal and professional standards without a continuance; the State argued against a continuance; and, when asked, Fabion stated he was ready to proceed to the second stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 76 At that crucial point of trial, the trial court abandoned the idea that Fabion was representing himself. This was a matter of importance where counsel was asked to speak instead of Fabion, which eroded Fabion's\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 77 The trial court allowed standby counsel to take over and act as if Fabion was represented by counsel. Counsel, however, made an argument which was contrary to the interests of Fabion. At that point, Fabion was required to choose between counsel who refused to present mitigating evidence unless given a continuance or continue with self-representation. Counsel's argument, however, presumed that ineffectiveness would be attributed to her and not to Fabion's poor choices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 78 The trial court did not initially address Fabion. It appeared, therefore, that Fabion was no longer representing himself. The trial court, at best, gave everyone the impression that standby counsel was no longer standby, but was now representing Fabion and arguing for a continuance of the punishment phase of the death case. Then, of course, the trial court allowed the State to argue against a continuance. By the time the trial court addressed Fabion, the writing was on the wall, even though the trial court\n   had not ruled on counsel's request for a continuance. Fabion had three choices: announce ready and present his second stage case for which he informed counsel he was unprepared to do, face a ruling denying a continuance where he would be represented by counsel who could not, in good conscience, proceed with Fabion's ill-prepared second stage case, or give up his right to a speedy trial and accept a ruling granting a continuance. Neither Fabion, nor counsel understood that counsel could be required to continue with Fabion's strategy at no consequence to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 79 Fabion was now facing a trial court that, at the March 20 hearing, had told counsel to be prepared but was now learning that counsel was unprepared to take over the punishment stage, even with the witness Fabion had prepared for this phase of trial. The trial court did not address Fabion, the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigant, until after attorneys had made their argument. We find this constituted error and violated Fabion's initial waiver of his right to counsel. As a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigant his desires regarding continuing self-representation should have been addressed initially.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b6 80 At this point Fabion no longer had standby counsel assisting him with the punishment phase of trial. He had an attorney whose argument indicated that professional interests had created a relationship adverse to the defendant. Understandably, standby counsel does not have to agree with a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendant's strategic decisions in a trial. These disagreements, however, should not prevent standby counsel in assisting a defendant who asks for reasonable assistance. Fabion arguably understood at this point that standby counsel's interests had become adverse to his own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 81 This Court cannot predict what Fabion might have told the trial court had the trial court allowed him to speak first without the statements of standby counsel indicating that she had a professional conflict of interest preventing her from stepping in and taking over the case utilizing Fabion's second stage strategy. The trial court foreclosed that possibility by questioning counsel first. This dialogue clearly violated Fabion's right of self-representation as addressed in\n   <em>\n    McKaskle\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 82 The record supports a finding that Fabion made a knowing and voluntary decision to waive counsel and represent himself during the first stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald v.

The record, however, does not support a finding that Fabion made a knowing and voluntary decision to waive counsel for the punishment stage of this proceeding. The death sentences in this case will, therefore, be reversed and the case will be remanded for resentencing.

M.W. was able to say that meaningful consideration could be taken for all three punishment options. M.W., however, admitted that his religious teachings would place him in a camp of never imposing a penalty of death. From the record it appears that M.W. might consider all three punishment options, but would not actually sentence a defendant to death, regardless of the facts. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that M.W. would not give meaningful consideration to all three punishment options, thus the removal for cause was not an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b6 91 Juror D.M., also during individual\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   , expressed reluctance in imposing the penalty of death. Initially potential juror D.M. would not consider the death penalty regardless of the law and facts. The trial court utilized the uniform instructions and D.M. clearly indicated that the death penalty would not be considered. Again, there was no abuse of discretion here, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in not allowing Fabion to attempt to rehabilitate the potential juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b6 92 Both of these jurors gave unequivocal answers about their ability to consider the death penalty. The trial court sufficiently questioned both of the potential jurors to make an informed decision about their ability to truthfully consider all three punishment\n   options. The method of\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   and the decision to excuse these two potential jurors for cause did not amount to an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. FIRST STAGE TRIAL ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b6 93 Fabion argues, in proposition two, that he was deprived of due process many times during trial because the trial court denied specific requests. Fabion raises three sub-propositions, A-C. The first sub-proposition is divided into three parts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b6 94 In sub-proposition A, Fabion claims that Judge Elliott restricted his ability to call witnesses. He first references arguments made in proposition one where he expressed that he needed to know how to get subpoenas out. He argues that the trial court would not offer suggestions on issuing subpoenas and prohibited standby counsel from doing so as well. This argument is somewhat disingenuous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b6 95 The trial court advised Fabion that he was forbidden from giving legal advice. When viewing the record as a whole, it becomes clear that the trial court prohibited standby counsel from giving unsolicited advice. The trial court, however, did tell Fabion that he could ask standby counsel questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 96 Despite his ignorance about issuing subpoenas, Fabion stated he was ready to represent himself. Due to his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   representation at trial, he cannot raise ineffective assistance on appeal, thus he cannot develop a record which indicates who he might have called as a witness. There is no indication in the record that Fabion failed to get subpoenas issued to witnesses he desired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6 97 Next, Fabion claims that the trial court denied him the right to call witnesses who had been subpoenaed and called to testify by the State. Fabion attempted to call Detective Harkins during an \"other crimes\" motion hearing. The trial court had limited Fabion's cross examination due to a question outside the scope of direct, and irrelevant questions, then when Fabion wanted to call him as his own witness, the trial court told Fabion he could not recall him because he \"had ample opportunity to ask him all of the questions you wanted to ask him.\" Fabion has completely failed to show that he was prejudiced by this limitation. Any possible or imagined error is clearly harmless. Nothing here affected Fabion's trial rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6 98 Fabion claims, next, that the trial court would not allow him to call a different witness during the same motion hearing, because of a \"rule of sequestration,\" which had never been ordered. The rule of sequestration had been ordered February 6, 2014, and this\n   <em>\n    Burks\n   </em>\n   hearing was on March 20, 2014. Neither the motion nor the order was limited to trial witnesses. The referenced witness, Kelly Haley, was present at the hearing and was subject to the rule of sequestration ordered by the court. There was no abuse of discretion here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 99 Fabion further complains that the trial court limited the opportunity to raise complaints about his trial counsel. In fact, as part of the\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   hearing and Fabion's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   filings, his complaints were well documented. His complaints, as stated under a prior proposition, were nothing more than personality conflicts and did not rise to the level of ineffective assistance which would be grounds for the substitution of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b6 100 Fabion claims that he was denied access to legal research. Fabion's complaints are not supported by the record. The record is clear that the trial court gave Fabion opportunities to address issues with access to legal research by the use of motions. The record is also clear that Fabion indicated that standby counsel had assisted with legal research. This complaint has no basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b6 101 In proposition four Fabion claims that a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   violation occurred when the trial court refused to allow him to have a copy of Emily Matheson's mental health report.

DEATH PENALTY PUNISHMENT ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   \u00b6 117 Along with Fabion's arguments, in propositions three and eight, that due process and the demand for a reliable sentencing proceeding require that an attorney be forced upon an unwilling defendant in the punishment stage of a death penalty case, he also argues, in proposition nine, that the death penalty, in and of itself constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article II, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 9 and 20 of the Oklahoma Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   \u00b6 118 These propositions are rendered moot by this Court's decision to remand this case for resentencing. Nevertheless, Fabion's proposition is primarily supported by dissenting opinions of United States Supreme Court Justices Bryer and Ginsburg in\n   <em>\n    Glossip v.

This proposition is moot due to our finding that error requires reversal of Fabion's death sentences and remand for resentencing.

Also, as stated in the opinion, during the second stage, the trial court initially appropriately advised Appellant and standby counsel about standby counsel's limited role. The problem occurred when, after being notified by standby counsel, and not Appellant, that Appellant told counsel that he did not want to continue to represent himself, the trial court turned the discussion to counsel, and not Appellant. Once the trial court was informed Appellant no longer wanted to represent himself, the trial court had a duty to question Appellant, who was still proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   at that point, regarding his desire to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   or with standby counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   \u00b6 4 While neither the United States Supreme Court nor this Court have addressed a situation like the one before us and set forth specific warnings to be given a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendant during the penalty phase of a capital case, this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Wallace v.

This advisory role should include standby counsel assisting in discovery and the securing of defense witnesses. The trial court should so advise both Appellant and attorneys appointed to serve as standby counsel.

I suggest the following instruction be forwarded and formatted by the Oklahoma Uniform Jury Instruction Committee-Criminal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-190\">\n   Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the 6th Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that a person charged with a crime has the right to the assistance of counsel. This Constitutional guarantee also provides that an individual charged with a crime has the right to waive representation by legal counsel and proceed to trial representing themselves and act as their own attorney. The defendant has elected to waive his/her right to counsel and represent his/herself in this matter. Mr./Mrs./Ms. __________________ has been appointed as standby counsel to the defendant but not to act as his/her attorney in this case. The role of standby counsel is limited to answering the defendant's questions and providing other assistance but standby counsel will not be participating directly in the trial. In electing to represent himself/herself, the defendant has assumed the full responsibility of acting as his/her own attorney in this case and will be held to the same standards and requirements of an actual practicing attorney. Standby counsel will be available to answer the defendant's questions during the course of the trial but the defendant will solely make all of decisions concerning his/her defense. You are not to let the fact that the defendant has elected to represent himself/herself influence your decision in this case. Instead, you must decide this case based upon the law in the court's instructions and the evidence received during the course of the trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   HUDSON, J., SPECIALLY CONCURS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   \u00b6 1 This case demonstrates the critical need for the trial judge to advise aspiring\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   capital defendants of the specific warnings contained in\n   <em>\n    Wallace v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995%20OK%20CR%2019\">\n    1995 OK CR 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10346298\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/893/504/#p512\">\n    893 P.2d 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 512-513 concerning mitigating evidence and the capital sentencing process. This information, in my view, should be conveyed during the initial\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   inquiry so the defendant will understand up front the nature of his or her rights and the importance and purposes of the capital sentencing process. In this way, the defendant will understand fully the high stakes and potential consequences of self-representation in a capital case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   \u00b6 2 Additionally, the trial court must also inquire of a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendant if, at any point during the trial, it appears the defendant wants standby counsel to take over the case. This should include a full inquiry of the matter on the record and an unequivocal statement by the defendant should he decide he wants standby counsel to takeover. Because these things were not done in the present case, I concur in today's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   \u00b6 3 I agree with the majority that, when standby counsel takes over midtrial, he or she must simply takeover wherever the defendant has left off and work from there. The defense is not entitled to a mistrial or continuance such that a new strategy may be implemented. Trial courts must clearly explain to aspiring\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendants up front that they will not get a \"redo\" of their trial if standby counsel takes over the defense of the case midtrial at the defendant's request. In other words, the defendant who makes his proverbial bed by representing himself at trial must lay in the mess of his own creation even when standby counsel takes over midtrial. This should also be conveyed to a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendant anytime he requests standby counsel to take over the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   \u00b6 4 Moreover, once standby counsel takes over the case, the defendant is no longer \"in charge\". As explained by the majority, there is no hybrid representation. No longer does the defendant \"control the organization and content of his own defense\" or have the authority \"to make motions, to argue points of law, to participate in voir dire, to question witnesses, and to address the court and the jury at appropriate points in the trial.\"\n   <em>\n    McKaskle v.

However, due to the nature of the issues arising from the waiver of counsel and the role of standby counsel in this matter, further guidance for the trial court is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   \u00b6 2 I take no issue with the Opinion nor with P.J. Lumpkin and J. Hudson's Specially Concurring Opinions and would adopt the recitation of facts, law and conclusions contained therein. In particular, as it relates to the resentencing in this matter, I agree that the trial court should re-address the\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   factors as it relates to the sentencing phase of a capital trial, consistent with the Opinion in this matter. However, this case also demonstrates the need for the trial court to define the role of standby counsel in any case that a defendant chooses to waive his/her right to counsel, whether that matter is a capital case or non-capital matter where standby counsel is assigned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   \u00b6 3 While the role of standby counsel is a nebulous concept and hard line rules would not be prudent due to the variations within each individual case, clarification by the trial court is possible and should be required. The requirements of any individual case would be known by the trial court and the scope and limitations of standby counsel should be set at the time of appointment of standby counsel. As this often happens in conjunction with the\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   hearing, it is appropriate for the trial court to advise a defendant of the scope and limitation at that time. The first consideration should be to determine the scope of assistance a defendant is requesting. The ABA Standards, in conjunction with the holding in\n   <em>\n    McKaskle v.

At a minimum, a defendant should be advised that standby counsel shall be required to attend all court proceedings and shall ensure that a defendant has adequate access to legal research as more fully set forth in the Opinion of this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   \u00b6 4 In addition, once the broad scope of assistance is established, a trial court should then determine, inter alia, whether standby counsel is required to perform any of the following tasks:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-202\">\n   Assist in any investigation of the case\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-203\">\n   Identify or prioritize issues on which the defendant should focus attention\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-204\">\n   Develop a full understanding of the prosecution's records, documents, reports and other investigations pertaining to the case Assist in specific areas or aspects of the case (e.g., discovery, subpoenas)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-205\">\n   Undertake research and render advice about specific areas of the law applicable to the case\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-206\">\n   Interview, research or develop knowledge about witnesses Assist the defendant in locating witnesses helpful to the defense, including expert witnesses\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-207\">\n   Bring to the attention of the defendant matters beneficial to the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   \u00b6 5\n   <em>\n    McKaskle\n   </em>\n   clearly defines the limitations on standby counsel. These limitations should be clearly stated to ensure that an accused is making an informed decision to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . For example, the trial court should make it clear that the defendant alone is responsible for the preparation and presentation of that defendant's case. Furthermore, it should be made clear that standby counsel is not an advocate, and will play no advocacy role in hearings, pleadings, or at trial unless directed by the Court to assume the defense. If standby counsel is directed by the trial court to assume the defense, the defendant should be cautioned that standby counsel is bound by the tactical and strategic decisions made by the defendant and that\n   standby counsel is not subject to an ineffective assistance of counsel claim when bound by those strategic/tactical decisions of the defendant. In addition, a defendant should be aware that, during trial, standby counsel may answer the defendant's questions of law and courtroom procedure, but may not interject himself/herself into the case without the consent of the defendant. Other case specific limitations should also be delineated at this time such as the fact that standby counsel will not serve as a defendant's lackey or legal assistant. However, as stated by Judge Hudson, a defendant should be advised that if standby counsel assumes control over a case, whether by court order or at defendant's request, that the defendant will no longer \"control the organization and content of the defense\" from that point forward.\n   <em>\n    See McKaskle\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   \u00b6 6 For these reasons, while I concur with the Opinion in this matter as well as with the Specially Concurring Opinions of P.J.
