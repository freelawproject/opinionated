R. Crim. P. In that petition, he had argued, amid other claims, that following his convictions for two related crimes, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-116 barred the court from ordering that a term of probation for one conviction begin after his release from prison for the other conviction. We will not disturb the court's denial of relief unless it abused its discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Roseberry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329635\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/507/\">\n    237 Ariz. 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329635\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/507/\">\n    353 P.3d 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). Redzinak has not shown such abuse here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 In 2012, Redzinak pled guilty to attempted sexual assault and kidnapping. The trial court sentenced him to a 3.5-year prison term for attempted sexual assault and, for kidnapping, suspended the imposition of sentence and ordered a consecutive, seven-year term of probation. In 2014, Redzinak sought to modify his sentence, arguing the consecutive probation term was improper. The court denied that motion, and we dismissed his subsequent appeal pursuant to Rule 17.1(e), Ariz. R. Crim. P., as well as his attempt to seek review of that ruling pursuant to Rule 32.9(c) because he failed to submit the trial court's ruling on the motion. Redzinak raised the same argument in a subsequent notice of and petition for post-conviction relief, which the court dismissed as untimely. This court denied relief on review.\n   <em>\n    State v. Redzinak\n   </em>\n   , No. 2 CA-CR 2015-0063-PR,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202231999\">\n    2015 WL 2231999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ariz. App. May 13, 2015) (mem. decision).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 In 2015, Redzinak pled guilty to aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and, as a result, the trial court found he had violated the terms of his probation. The court continued Redzinak on probation, imposing a seven-year term to commence after he completed a 6.5-year prison term imposed for aggravated assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 Redzinak sought post-conviction relief from the disposition, and appointed counsel filed a notice stating she had reviewed the record but found no claims to raise under Rule 32. Redzinak then filed a pro se petition repeating his argument that the trial court was not permitted to order the new probation term for the kidnapping to be consecutive to his prison term for attempted sexual assault because the two crimes constituted a single act. He contended he was entitled to raise this claim as a \"collateral[ ] attack\" on the original judgment \"after revocation of probation,\" because the \"reimposition [of probation] or resentence begins the process anew.\" He also claimed counsel had been\n   ineffective in failing to raise this argument when the court reinstated probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 The trial court summarily denied relief, concluding that the revocation of probation does not extend the time to seek review of the \"underlying sentence\" and, thus, \"the time to challenge the original conviction and sentencing under Rule 32 has long since passed.\" The court also concluded that Redzinak had not been resentenced, and the continuation of probation was merely \"a continuation of the earlier sentence.\" This petition for review followed the court's denial of Redzinak's motion for rehearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 On review, Redzinak repeats his argument that he is permitted to challenge the original imposition of a consecutive probation term. He reasons that his guilty plea for aggravated assault \"automatically revokes probation\" pursuant to Rule 27.8(e), Ariz. R. Crim. P., thereby allowing him to again challenge the original order imposing a consecutive term of probation which, he contends, violates the protection against double jeopardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 We first observe that, although Redzinak characterizes his claim in terms of double jeopardy, that doctrine is not implicated because attempted sexual assault and kidnapping are distinct offenses with different elements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Eagle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"208678\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/196/188/\">\n    196 Ariz. 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"208678\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/196/188/\">\n    994 P.2d 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) (\"[W]hen statutes describe different offenses, consecutive sentences are permissible without implicating the prohibition against double jeopardy\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-1304, 13-1406. Instead, Redzinak's argument is best understood as a claim that the probation term imposed for kidnapping violates the prohibition against double punishment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-116, and, indeed, he characterized it as such in his petition below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to \u00a7 13-116, \"[a]n act or omission which is made punishable in different ways by different sections of the laws may be punished under both, but in no event may sentences be other than concurrent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 Section 13-116, however, by its plain language, does not apply where, as here, only one sentence has been imposed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

As our supreme court explained in\n   <em>\n    Muldoon\n   </em>\n   , \"A sentence is a judicial order requiring a defendant convicted in a criminal case to presently suffer a specified sanction such as incarceration, monetary fine, or both.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1526765\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/159/295/#p298\">\n    159 Ariz. at 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1526765\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/159/295/#p298\">\n    767 P.2d at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, \"[p]robation is a judicial order allowing a criminal defendant a period of time in which to perform certain conditions and thereby avoid imposition of a sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1526765\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/159/295/#p298\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, because probation is not a sentence, \u00a7 13-116 does not prohibit a trial court from ordering a term of probation to run consecutively to a sentence even if the underlying convictions are based on the same conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488537\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/185/358/#p365\">\n    185 Ariz. at 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488537\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/185/358/#p365\">\n    916 P.2d at 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, by law, a term of probation cannot run concurrently to a previously imposed prison term. \"If probation is imposed on one who at the time is serving a sentence of imprisonment imposed on a different conviction, service of the sentence of imprisonment shall not satisfy the\n   probation.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-903(E) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
