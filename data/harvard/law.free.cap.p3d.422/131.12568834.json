In the 1970s, a gate was placed about nine miles up the Road from West Fork Road, preventing public access beyond the gate. In 1982, previous landowners abutting the Road filed a petition with the Ravalli County Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) to abandon the Road beyond the gate. The BOCC denied the previous landowners' petition, ordered that the gate be removed, and made a finding of fact that the Road was 11.8 miles long.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 When the previous landowners failed to remove the gate, the County commenced an action against them seeking an order directing removal of the gate and a temporary restraining order. In 1984, Judge James B. Wheelis orally denied the county road supervisor's motion for\n   a temporary restraining order. After being inactive for approximately nine years, the case was dismissed by stipulation of the parties.\n   <em>\n    Jay Unrue, Road Supervisor for Ravalli Cnty. v. Royal Teton Ltd., et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. DV-84-248, Or. (21st Judicial Dist. Dec. 10, 1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 In 2016, Landowners filed a new petition with the BOCC to abandon the Road at the same spot that was proposed by previous landowners in the 1982 proceeding. Landowners are alleged successors in interest to the previous landowners and others that own property accessed by the Road. Following a hearing on January 25, 2017, the BOCC denied the petition and directed the landowners to remove the gate no later than June 1, 2017. The BOCC found that, pursuant to \u00a7 7-14-2615(3), MCA, the Road provided public access to public lands or waters, and that no other public road or right-of-way provides substantially the same access to public lands or waters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Two and a half months later, on April 10, 2017, Landowners filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the District Court. In their complaint, they presented four claims: (I) claim preclusion regarding removal of the gate; (II) declaratory judgment regarding the end of the Road; (III) declaratory judgment regarding the construction and application of \u00a7 7-14-2615(3), MCA ; and (IV) unconstitutional taking of private property. On June 29, 2017, the District Court dismissed Landowners' complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. They appeal the decision regarding claims I and II.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 A district court's decision to grant or deny a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law that we review for correctness.\n   <em>\n    Rimrock Chrysler, Inc. v.

The proceedings involved in the 1984 action are entirely different from the one at issue here. Whereas this case was essentially brought by Landowners in an attempt to challenge the County's decision to deny their 2016 petition for abandonment, the 1984 action was brought by the County to remove a gate from the Road.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 22 (citations omitted) (holding that this Court compares pleadings, evidence, and circumstances surrounding the two actions when determining whether the issues are the same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b612 Further, a valid final judgment on the merits was never entered regarding the 1984 action.

As the District Court points out, the first sentence of the Stipulation and Order states \"with prejudice,\" but clearly the actual court order states \"without prejudice.\" And more to the point, in the 1984 oral pronouncement, Judge Wheelis denied the County's request for a\n   <em>\n    temporary restraining order\n   </em>\n   , stating \"I will deny your restraining order at this time. That doesn't prejudice you in your case in chief on the issue....\" However, the case languished and a final order and judgment was never made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b613 Nine years later, the District Court ordered the parties to \"show cause, if any there be, why an order should not be entered dismissing this action without prejudice\" based on inactivity. Clearly, there is not a final judgment or order that precludes the County from asserting the gate should be removed from the Road.

In its opinion and order, the District Court stated that re-establishing the length of the Road as urged by Landowners would abandon the Road by implication, which cannot be done by a court without a writ of review. Conversely, Landowners allege that their request for declaratory judgment has nothing to do with the 2016 petition and abandonment of the road. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b618 Landowners seek a declaratory judgment that the Road ends at the east edge of Mineral Survey 5898. This same argument was made by Landowners when they petitioned the BOCC for abandonment of the Road in 2016. The alternative declaratory relief and injunction sought would contradict the BOCC's findings of fact that the Road not be abandoned beyond the gate. Either way, Landowners seek an injunction from interfering with their constitutional right to exclude the public from their private property beyond that point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b619 Instead of filing a complaint in the District Court, Landowners should have challenged the BOCC's denial pursuant to the statutory requirements for county road abandonment cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7-14-2601, MCA ;\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Cnty.

However, the\n   <em>\n    Board of County Commissioners\n   </em>\n   case is very similar to this case. In 1979, landowners filed a petition to vacate a dedicated road right-of-way, also in Ravalli County. In addition, a second group of landowners filed a petition for removal of \"road obstructions,\" and requested that the dedicated right-of-way be opened. In September 1979, following public hearings on both, the BOCC declined to take action on either petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b624 One of the parties filed a civil action in November of 1979. In August 1981, the district court ordered the BOCC to retain the subject land in trust for the public or return it to the land grantors. In response, following a properly noticed public hearing, the BOCC entered findings of fact and denied the petition for vacation of the right-of-way. In June 1982, the district court issued an order holding\n   the BOCC in contempt for failing to abide by the prior order. The BOCC then filed a petition for a writ of review with this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b625 The Montana Supreme Court overturned the orders of the district court, reasoning that the \"effect of the [d]istrict [c]ourt order was to abandon the road,\" that the district court did not have original jurisdiction, and the dissatisfied landowners should have petitioned the district court for a writ of review.\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Cnty.

This exact point was restated in\n   <em>\n    Lee v. Musselshell\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , this Court held that \"the [d]istrict [c]ourt did not have jurisdiction to issue an order that would have effectuated a forced abandonment\" of a county road without a writ of review.\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 27. Here, Landowners seek an order that would have the same impact on the Road as that identified in\n   <em>\n    Board of County Commissioners\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ; Landowners seek abandonment by implication outside of the abandonment process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b626 Landowners petitioned the BOCC to abandon the Road in 2016. However, they did not petition the District Court for a writ of review upon denial of their petition. Thus, Landowners' civil action, filed two and a half months later regarding the length of the Road, was properly dismissed because they failed to follow the proper procedure for county road abandonment cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b627 The District Court was correct when it granted the County's motion to dismiss. Landowners did not satisfy all factors for claim preclusion and Landowners failed to follow the proper procedure for seeking review of a BOCC's denial of a petition to abandon a county road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b628 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We Concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   LAURIE McKINNON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   INGRID GUSTAFSON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   BETH BAKER, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   DIRK M.
