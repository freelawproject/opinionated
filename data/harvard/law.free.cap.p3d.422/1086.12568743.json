We affirm, holding that a single event caused by several independent acts is a single occurrence under the applicable policy language, which defines \"occurrence\" as an \"accident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Appellants Colby Hale and Curtis Moreland were apprentices in an electrical lineman training program operated by Appellants Southwestern Line Constructors Joint Apprenticeship and Training Program, Southwestern Line Constructors Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee, and Southwestern Line Construction Electrical Joint Apprenticeship and Training Program (collectively, \"Southwestern\"). While Hale and Moreland were working at the top of a utility pole at Southwestern's training facility, the pole broke and they fell, sustaining serious injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Hale and Moreland sued Southwestern for negligence and agreed to settle their claims for the limits of Southwestern's commercial general liability insurance policy (the \"Policy\"). The Policy limits coverage to $1,000,000 per \"occurrence,\" with a total aggregate claims limit of $2,000,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Southwestern's insurer, Cincinnati Indemnity, sued, seeking a declaratory judgment that Hale and Moreland's injuries were the result of a single \"occurrence\" and, therefore, the maximum coverage available under the policy is $1,000,000. On summary judgment, the superior court ruled that both claims resulted from a single occurrence under the Policy. Southwestern, Hale, and Moreland timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 A court may grant summary judgment when \"the moving party shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and ... is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Ariz. R. Civ. P. 56(a). We review a grant of summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   and \"view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party against whom summary judgment was entered.\"\n   <em>\n    Duncan v.

The Policy defines an \"occurrence\" as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\" The facts are undisputed-Hale and Moreland were not injured by continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions. The issue is whether their injuries resulted from a single \"accident\" within the meaning of the Policy. The superior court ruled that \"accident\" means an unforeseen and unplanned event, and since there was only one accident (the collapse of the pole), there was only one occurrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Relying on\n   <em>\n    Arizona Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Fund v.

The policy at issue in\n   <em>\n    Helme\n   </em>\n   defined \"occurrence\" in relation to incidents, acts, or omissions that result in injury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1496653\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/153/129/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1496653\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/153/129/\">\n    at 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1496653\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/153/129/\">\n    735 P.2d at 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Cincinnati Indemnity's Policy, in contrast, defines an \"occurrence\" as an \"accident,\" not the precipitating causes of the accident. This difference in policy language renders\n   <em>\n    Helme\n   </em>\n   inapplicable here.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    GRE Ins. Group v.

Appellants argue the Policy's provision that Cincinnati Indemnity would pay amounts Southwestern became legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an \"occurrence\" is functionally the same as the definition of \"occurrence\" at issue in\n   <em>\n    Helme\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 We disagree. It is not the separation of the causation language that distinguishes the Policy from the one at issue in\n   <em>\n    Helme\n   </em>\n   , but the difference in the policies' definitions of \"occurrence.\" The pole collapse was one accident and, therefore, one occurrence under the Policy. Appellants' identification of five acts or omissions that allegedly caused the collapse does not create five \"occurrences.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
