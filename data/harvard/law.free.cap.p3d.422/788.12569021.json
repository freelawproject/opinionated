The jury assessed punishment at life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The Honorable William J. Musseman, District Judge, presided at trial and sentenced Bramlett accordingly. Bramlett appeals his Judgment and Sentence, raising the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   (1) whether his statement should have been suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree because his arrest violated Oklahoma law and was therefore illegal;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (2) whether the admission of his video recorded interview was error which violated his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (3) whether he was denied his right to due process and a fair trial by the admission of evidence of prior bad acts;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (4) whether inadmissible hearsay was admitted in violation of his rights under the Confrontation Clause;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (5) whether a discovery violation deprived him of his right to a fair trial;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (6) whether the trial court erred in ruling that Corporal Shilling's testimony was lay testimony rather than expert testimony; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (7) whether prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of a fair trial requiring modification of his sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 2 We affirm the judgment but vacate the sentence of the district court and remand the case for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 3 On the night of March 19, 2015, Michelle Spence took her fourteen and eleven year-old sons to their grandparents' house to spend the night. Between 6:00 and 7:00 p.m. the following day, their grandfather took the boys home to Spence's house and dropped them off. Their mother wasn't home and when Spence had not come home by 10:00 p.m., the boys walked down the street to see if she was at Renese Bramlett's apartment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the two boys arrived at Bramlett's apartment complex, they saw their mother's vehicle, a blue Mercedes-Benz SUV, parked in the parking lot of the apartment complex across the street. They tried to call Bramlett but he did not answer. The boys walked around the apartments and when they did not find their mother, they went to her vehicle to charge their phone. Inside the SUV they found their mother dead in the backseat. She was naked and wrapped in a blanket. The boys went to an apartment for help and the occupants called the police. Michelle Spence's death was subsequently ruled a homicide caused by asphyxia due to strangulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 4 The case against Bramlett was pieced together from information the police gathered from Spence's neighbors, video surveillance footage from a security guard at the apartment complex where Spence's SUV was found, video footage from a QuickTrip located between Spence's house and Bramlett's apartment, and cell phone records from Spence's phone and from Bramlett's phone. Cell phone records indicated that Spence called Bramlett from her home at 10:48 p.m. on March 19, 2015. At around 11:11 p.m. video surveillance from a QuickTrip located between Spence's house and Bramlett's apartment showed a Cadillac similar to Bramlett's traveling on 129th East Avenue in the direction of Spence's house. Cell phone records showed that Bramlett's phone was\n   taken to Spence's house around this time and remained there until after 2:00 a.m. when it was taken back to his apartment. Spence's phone remained at her house until 2:10 a.m. when it, too, was taken to Bramlett's apartment. Video Surveillance from the Quicktrip showed a vehicle that looked like Spence's SUV traveling on 129th East Avenue toward Bramlett's apartment around this same time at 2:14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 5 A security guard patrolling several apartment complexes in his vehicle noticed Spence's SUV in the Stonecrest apartment complex across the street from Bramlett's apartments during his patrol at 3:57. The SUV had not been there when he drove by earlier at 11:07.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 6 At approximately 6:45 a.m. on March 20, 2015, when Spence's neighbor left his house to go to work, there was a dark Cadillac blocking his driveway. Another neighbor also noticed the Cadillac between 7:30 and 7:45 a.m. She had seen it at Spence's residence before. Video surveillance from the QuickTrip showed an African-American man with a body type similar to Bramlett's walking in the direction of Spence's house at about 7:30 a.m. Approximately 28 minutes later the QuickTrip video surveillance showed a green Cadillac traveling in the direction of Bramlett's apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 7 Cell phone records showed that a call was made from Bramlett's phone to the bus station and that Spence's phone was at the bus station at 1:47 p.m. on March 20, 2015. That was the location of the last activity on Spence's phone. Bramlett's Cadillac was discovered later parked near the bus station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 8 Bramlett was subsequently located in Chicago, Illinois. He was arrested on a material witness warrant and taken into custody in Chicago where he was interviewed by Tulsa detectives on July 22, 2015. During this interview, Bramlett denied seeing Spence on the night she was killed; he claimed to have last seen her several days earlier. When advised that the detectives had evidence to the contrary, Bramlett terminated the interview. He was arrested, charged with first degree murder, and returned to Oklahoma to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 9 Bramlett testified at his trial. He acknowledged that he and Spence had been friends since 2012 and although they had been boyfriend/girlfriend in the past, they were not romantically involved at the time of her death. They remained friends because they used drugs together multiple times a week; their drug of choice was PCP. Bramlett testified that on Thursday, March 19, 2015, Spence contacted him right before he got off work around 10:30. He went home, got some PCP, and went over to her house. They smoked the PCP and when they had used all that he brought over, she wanted more. They got in her car and she drove him to his apartment where she left him to go meet her dealer to get more PCP. Bramlett testified that he made her leave her phone with him so that she would be sure to come back to get him. He wanted her to take him back to her house to get his car so that he would not have to walk there to get it. Bramlett testified that he eventually went to sleep until morning. When he awoke and Spence had not come back or called he started walking to her house to get his car. Bramlett testified that went he returned to his apartment complex in his car he noticed Spence's SUV parked in that parking lot of the complex across the street. He thought she had a drug deal there and started panicking because he was worried that something went wrong. Bramlett testified that he started operating out of fear because he knew that he was one of the last people to see her. He called the bus station, bought a ticket to Chicago, and left that day. He testified that Spence's phone died so he threw it into the trash at the bus station. Bramlett acknowledged that the QuickTrip video introduced by the State of the car driving by and person walking could have been his car and him. He denied that he killed Spence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Legality of Arrest and Admissibly of Statement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 10 Bramlett argues that his statement to the police should not have been admitted at trial because it was made during an illegal arrest and detention and was therefore fruit of the poisonous tree. Bramlett raised the issue below and appeals the trial court's ruling overruling his objection to the\n   admission of his statement.

He was taken into custody in Chicago on the material witness warrant and Tulsa detectives traveled to Chicago to ask his consent for an interview which he granted. Bramlett asserted below and again on appeal that because his arrest and detention on the material witness warrant was illegal, his statement made during the illegal arrest and detention should have been suppressed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 13 Bramlett's complaint concerns his extradition to Oklahoma from Illinois under the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act (Extradition Act) ( 22 O.S.2011, \u00a7\u00a7 1141.1 - 1141.30 ) and his summons from Illinois to Oklahoma as a material witness under The Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses from Without a State in Criminal Proceedings (Uniform Act) ( 22 O.S.2011, \u00a7\u00a7 721 - 727 ). While failure to follow the procedural requirements of either of these Acts would be relevant to a determination of whether Bramlett was properly removed from Illinois to Oklahoma, the allegation that he was removed to Oklahoma in violation of the procedural requirements of these Acts is not relevant to deciding whether his statement to the Tulsa detectives made before his removal was tainted by an illegal arrest and detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 14 The specific question before us on appeal is whether Bramlett was under legal arrest and detention on a material witness warrant at the time he was interviewed in Chicago by the Tulsa Detectives. That determination requires review of the arrest warrant and related documents. Neither the material witness warrant nor any documents associated with it are included in the record before this Court on appeal. \"In Oklahoma a defendant bears the burden to provide a sufficient record upon which this Court may determine the issue raised.\"\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

Video Interview\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 16 Bramlett's videotaped interview with detectives at the police station in Illinois showed him in the interview room in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs which appeared to be fastened to his body. Prior to its admission into evidence, defense counsel objected to this exhibit on the grounds that the videotape depicted him in custody and was unnecessarily prejudicial. Counsel asked that the audio of the conversation be played for the jury but the video be omitted so that the jury would not see Bramlett handcuffed and in the jail jumpsuit. This request and objection was overruled because the trial court found it important for the jury to see Bramlett's demeanor during the interview. Bramlett complains on appeal that this ruling was error. Decisions on the admissibility of evidence are left to the sound discretion of the trial court and this court will not disturb the trial court's ruling absent a clear showing of abuse and resulting prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Baird v.

In\n   <em>\n    Deck\n   </em>\n   , the Court reasoned that routine use of visible shackling during the guilt phase of trial undermines the presumption of innocence, interferes with the accused's ability to communicate with his lawyer and participate in his own defense, and is an affront to the dignity of judicial proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Deck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869317\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/622/#p629\">\n    544 U.S. at 631-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869317\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/622/#p629\">\n    125 S.Ct. at 2013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, 22 O.S.2011, \u00a7 15 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   No person can be compelled in a criminal action to be witness against himself; nor can a person charged with a public offense be subjected before conviction to any more restraint than is necessary for his detention to answer the charge, and in no event shall he be tried before a jury while in chains or shackles.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 18 Bramlett argues that although not specifically barred by statute or case law, these same concerns should have prohibited the jury from viewing him in jail clothing and handcuffs in the videotaped interview. Bramlett's argument is unpersuasive. Clearly, his appearance in the video in handcuffs and jail clothing had no bearing on his ability to communicate with his lawyer nor was it an affront to the judicial proceedings. While it is easy to understand how viewing a defendant in handcuffs and jail clothing during trial might risk diluting the presumption of innocence, the same cannot be said about exposure to a video showing the defendant in jail clothing and handcuffs during an interview prior to trial. As the State argues, most jurors would not be surprised by the fact that a defendant was handcuffed and wearing jail clothing while in jail prior to trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gilbert v.

The concerns which arise when a criminal defendant appears at trial in jail clothing or shackles were not implicated under the circumstances of this case. The same degree of potential prejudice was simply not present and we decline to extend the\n   <em>\n    Deck v. Missouri\n   </em>\n   ruling to such situations. The trial court's ruling, that it was important that the jurors see Bramlett's demeanor during the interview to determine whether his statement was voluntary or the product of coercion,\n   was not an abuse of discretion. The video of the interview was relevant and its probative value was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   12 O.S.2011, \u00a7\u00a7 2402, 2403.

The court gave a contemporaneous limiting instruction in connection with the introduction of this evidence instructing the jury that they could not consider the evidence of other bad acts as proof of guilt or innocence of the offense charged; it was to be considered solely on the issue of Bramlett's alleged motive, intent, common scheme or plan or absence of mistake and accident.

He claims that Stephanie Spence's knowledge about the status of his and Michelle Spence's relationship during that time could only have been based upon what Michelle Spence told her and that Stephanie Spence admitted as much at trial. This argument is not supported by the record. The record shows that defense counsel actually made this argument prior to trial during a hearing on the State's notice of intent to introduce evidence of other bad acts. The prosecutor responded that Stephanie Spence's testimony about Michelle Spence's and Bramlett's relationship would not be hearsay because her knowledge of the relationship was based on her personal observations; she socialized with Michelle and Bramlett during this time and she knew from her observations that Bramlett was Michelle Spence's boyfriend when she was assaulted. Defense counsel did not object to Stephanie Spence's testimony at trial, presumably because he anticipated her to further clarify how she knew that Bramlett was her sister's boyfriend at the time of the assault. The record does not support Bramlett's claim that Stephanie Spence's testimony was hearsay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The admission of this testimony was not error, plain or otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 25 Bramlett also argues in this proposition that the introduction of Stephanie Spence's testimony violated his right to confrontation because the Confrontation Clause forbids the admission of testimonial hearsay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crawford v.

Again, the record does not support Bramlett's claim that the testimony at issue was hearsay. Stephanie Spence's testimony was based on her personal observations and she was available\n   for cross examination at trial. Accordingly, his claim that the testimony violated his constitutional right to confrontation fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 26 Prior to trial defense counsel filed a motion to produce requesting that the State disclose all material in the State's possession which was favorable to the defendant or exculpatory in nature. In his motion the defendant requested that the trial court \"conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection of the District Attorney's file in order that a neutral and detached judicial officer may determine the existence or nonexistence of such material.\" Bramlett argues on appeal that the district court's failure to conduct the requested\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection of the District Attorney's file violated the Oklahoma Discovery Code and his right to due process under the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 27 Bramlett's argument centers around the \"decline sheet\" presumably showing the reason(s) why the State declined to file charges against him for the assault against Michelle Spence reported in November of 2013. He speculates that this document could have been exculpatory if it showed that he was not charged because there was insufficient evidence to establish probable cause to believe that he committed that crime. It would, Bramlett speculated, refute the State's evidence that he was Michelle Spence's boyfriend at the time of the 2013 assault and the State's evidence of his alleged prior bad act. While defense counsel raised this issue at the pretrial hearing on the State's notice of intent to introduce evidence of other bad acts, he did not object to this alleged discovery violation at trial.

The prosecutor's \"decline sheet\" would be considered work product and not subject to discovery under section 2002(E)(3).

He asserts that the\n   mere fact that the State declined to charge him with the prior assault creates a sufficient question to either reverse and remand the case for a new trial or to remand the case for an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   hearing. The record belies his claim. When the State filed its notice of intent to introduce evidence of other wrongs, crimes or bad acts, the prosecutor attached a copy of the police report made by the officer who spoke with Spence at the hospital when he investigated the reported assault. The officer noted in this report that Spence named Bramlett as her assailant. Defense counsel mentioned this report at the hearing on the notice of intent to introduce evidence of other bad acts and acknowledged that it was \"clear that [Spence] was not cooperative.\" We find no error, plain or otherwise, in the trial court's denial of Bramlett's request for an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection of the District Attorney's records to look for exculpatory evidence.

His testimony was based upon his review of cell phone data retrieved from both Spence's and Bramlett's cell phones as well as geographic location data from Google and Facebook. The trial court ruled prior to trial that Corporal Schilling could not give this testimony as an expert but could testify as a lay witness. Bramlett argues on appeal that Corporal Schilling's testimony was not lay testimony and the trial court abused its discretion in permitting Schilling to give expert testimony without first performing the 'gatekeeping' function of determining that Schilling was qualified as an expert and that his opinions were reliable.

Corporal Schilling agreed that he was not reaching a scientific conclusion but rather was drawing together facts to reach an inference. Defense counsel's cross examination of Corporal Schilling was primarily focused on discrediting him as an expert and at the conclusion of the hearing the prosecutor argued that although Corporal Schilling had some training, the better part of his testimony was more properly characterized as lay witness opinion testimony.

Defense counsel, who had specifically objected to the court or the prosecutor calling Corporal Schilling an expert, stated that she did not object to this ruling.

In\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , the Court noted that the prosecutor's improper argument mischaracterizing the 85% Rule was mitigated by other statements made by the prosecutor directing the jurors to the instructions telling them that the instructions set forth the ground rules explaining how the 85% Rule works.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988545\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/248/362/\">\n    2011 OK CR 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 53,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988545\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/248/362/\">\n    248 P.3d at 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There were no such mitigating factors here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 40 During the first closing argument the prosecutor told the jury that if Bramlett was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole he would be required to serve 85% of forty-five years, \"which means in 38 1/3rd years, should he make it to that age, he will be paroled.\" Defense counsel objected and the objection was overruled. Then again, in the State's final closing, the prosecutor stated, \"If you give [Bramlett] life, he will only serve 85 percent of the crime. He will only serve those 38 years, while Michelle is gone forever.\" As in\n   <em>\n    Florez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , the prosecutors' argument flatly misstated the law's intent and effect and encouraged jurors to misapply the law in considering an appropriate punishment. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Florez\n   </em>\n   , however, the jury did not sentence Bramlett below the statutory maximum but rather sentenced him to the maximum punishment possible which was requested by the prosecutor, i.e., life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , the prosecutors here did nothing to mitigate the effects of the erroneous statements. While the prosecutor in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   directed the jury's attention to the\n   written jury instructions and told them that the instructions properly informed them about the effect of the 85% Rule, the prosecutor in the present case mentioned the instructions and then misstated the law regarding the 85% Rule inferring, misleadingly, that the instructions mirrored his argument. While defense counsel admirably attempted to correct the misstatement and argued the appropriate application of the law, the potential impact of her argument was weakened both by the trial court's failure to sustain her objection to the prosecutor's initial misstatement of the law and by the prosecutor's second misstatement which, unfortunately, was the last argument the jurors heard before they were excused to deliberate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 41 As the United States Supreme Court has admonished, a prosecutor \"is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.
