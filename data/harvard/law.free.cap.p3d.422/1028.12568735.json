Although the credit-card agreement gave the creditor the option of declaring the debt immediately due and payable upon default, we hold that even if that option was not exercised, the cause of action to collect the entire debt accrued as of the date of Santos's first uncured missed payment. Mertola's claim was barred by the statute of limitations six years after that date pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 12-548(A)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 Santos acquired a credit card from Washington Mutual Bank (\"the Bank\"). The card was issued with a $25,000 credit limit under the terms of the Bank's Account Agreement, which required monthly minimum payments with interest. Under the Account Agreement, if Santos \"fail[ed] to pay any amount due,\" the Bank had the right to \"declare [the] Account balance immediately due and payable.\" The Account Agreement further stated that Santos waived any right to notice of acceleration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 From August 2007 to January 2008, Santos repeatedly made late minimum payments, and pursuant to the Account Agreement the Bank increased its finance charges and began charging late fees. Santos missed the February 2008 payment completely and never made another minimum payment, although he made a $50 payment-below the minimum due-in August 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 The account continued to accrue interest until the Bank charged it off (i.e., treated it as a bad debt) later in 2008, at which point the unpaid balance was $17,066.91. Eventually, Mertola acquired Santos's debt and, on July 18, 2014, sued for breach of the Account Agreement, seeking the entire outstanding balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 Santos moved for summary judgment, arguing that the claim was barred by the six-year statute of limitations applicable to credit-card debt under \u00a7 12-548(A)(2). Santos maintained that the Bank's cause of action to recover the entire debt accrued after the first missed payment in February 2008. Mertola countered that a missed payment gives the creditor the right to sue only for that payment. According to Mertola, the cause of action for the entire debt could not accrue until the creditor accelerated the debt. The superior court granted Santos's motion, finding that \"all of the breaches\" alleged by Mertola \"occurred more than six years prior\" to it filing this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 The court of appeals reversed, agreeing with Mertola that Santos's missed payments, by themselves, gave the creditor the right to sue only for those payments.\n   <em>\n    Mertola, LLC v.

Because a closed-end installment contract involves an exact sum that must be paid in full in equal payments by an agreed-on date, a cause of action for the entire balance owed will accrue no later than that date. After that date, the creditor may not prevent the statute of limitations from running simply by refusing to accelerate the debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 18 Under credit-card contracts like the one at issue here, however, the date when the entire debt will become due is uncertain and may not occur until far in the future.

This would functionally eliminate the protection provided to defendants by the statute of limitations. We decline to extend such power to the creditor. As aptly expressed by the Iowa Supreme Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   While the acceleration clause is for the creditor's protection he should not be permitted to divert it to another purpose.\n   <em>\n    It is a shield, not a sword.\n   </em>\n   It is to enable him to take steps to enforce payment or prevent further default, not to impose an additional interest burden upon an already distressed debtor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Wentland v.

But, for at least two reasons, a credit-card company has less incentive than a closed-account creditor to accelerate a debt. First, upon default the interest rate charged increases, in this case to 23.99%. When a credit-card company delays acceleration, the compounding of default interest substantially increases the total amount owed. Selling the debt to a third-party debt collector like Mertola is likely more profitable than attempting to immediately collect from a defaulted debtor who is already unable or unwilling to pay. Second, debt on a closed account, unlike credit-card debt, is often secured by collateral, requiring the creditor to accelerate the debt to exercise the right to repossess or foreclose. Indeed, proceeding against collateral is effective notice of acceleration.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baseline\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755629\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/229/543/\">\n    229 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   544 \u00b6\u00b6 2-3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755629\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/229/543/\">\n    278 P.3d at 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing the repossession of a debtor's automobile). Credit-card debt is typically unsecured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 20 The court of appeals also noted that \"both sides can benefit from a rule that allows the lender time to permit the cardholder [to] bring the account current.\"\n   <em>\n    Mertola\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310556\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/572/\">\n    241 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   574 \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310556\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/572/\">\n    390 P.3d at 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is surely correct. But the legislature determined, in establishing a statute of limitations, that six years following default is long enough to bring an action to collect a credit-card debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 21 Without deciding whether to adopt the\n   <em>\n    Navy Federal\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baseline\n   </em>\n   holding for other types of debt, we decline to apply it to credit-card debt. Consistent with our decision in\n   <em>\n    Gust, Rosenfeld\n   </em>\n   , we hold that when a credit-card contract contains an optional acceleration clause, a cause of action to collect the entire outstanding debt accrues upon default: that is, when the debtor first fails to make a full, agreed-to minimum monthly payment.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

But, as we held in\n   <em>\n    Browne\n   </em>\n   , a debtor may cure a default if the creditor accepts a payment of arrearages that brings the account current consistent with the parties' contract.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1603048\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/117/73/#p75\">\n    117 Ariz. at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1603048\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/117/73/#p75\">\n    570 P.2d at 1248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By allowing the debtor to cure the default, the creditor relinquishes its pending cause of action to collect the debt, and the statute of limitations commences only upon a new default. Partial repayment, however, does not cure the default or reset the limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 22 This bright-line rule establishes a clear accrual date and respects creditors' contract rights to choose not to accelerate credit-card debt, at least for six years following a borrower's default. Parties remain free to contractually define default and otherwise negotiate repayment of debt. And this rule permits parties to exercise other statutory or contractual rights to extend the time to negotiate settlement of the debt such as an agreement to pay some or all the outstanding debt, thus curing the default and stopping the statute of limitations from running. Mertola's action against Santos is barred by \u00a7 12-548(A)(2) because it was filed more than six years after Santos defaulted on the credit-card payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
