In limited cases, we will overturn a trial court's exercise of authority on appeal. But this is not one of them. After finding Kittitas County and the Kittitas County Sheriff's Office (collectively the County) violated the PRA, the trial court considered the relevant PRA penalty factors and, based on substantiated facts, selected a reasonable penalty assessment. Nothing more was required for a fair exercise of PRA penalty discretion. We therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 Randall Hoffman submitted a public records request to the Kittitas County Sheriff's Office on June 29, 2015. The request sought police reports referencing an individual named Erin Schnebly. The request was received by Carolyn Hayes, the designated public records clerk for the sheriff's office. Hayes had 10 years of experience and training responding to PRA requests directed to the sheriff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 Hayes conducted an initial search for records and identified seven incident reports. Her initial search did not locate photos or videos. A careful review would have revealed the existence of numerous photos and two videos responsive to the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Hayes called Hoffman about his request. Hayes's primary concern was that her review did not show Hoffman had any involvement in the seven incidents. Hayes told Hoffman that because he was not involved in the incidents, she could not provide him the majority of the documents he requested. As the parties now agree, this information was incorrect. Based on Hayes's misinformation, Hoffman limited his request to face sheets of reports, which identified the type of incident, date, and location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Kallee Knudson, a records clerk who began training under Hayes in the sheriff's office earlier that June, overheard Hayes's phone call to Hoffman. She could hear what Hayes said but not what Hoffman said. Specifically, Knudson heard Hayes tell Hoffman she \"would not be able to provide the majority of documents\" per specific statutes. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 15-16, 459. Knudson had never noticed Hayes saying anything similar to this before, and it did not make sense to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Knudson questioned Hayes about Hoffman's request. Hayes discussed a statute that she believed supported her position. She also added that Hoffman had agreed to limit his request to the face sheets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Hayes made the following notation on Hoffman's PRA request: \"2009-2015 face sheet only.\" CP at 13. Hayes, relying on a statute that the parties now agree did not apply to the request, made significant and improper redactions to the face sheets. The next day, Hayes provided the redacted face sheets to Hoffman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 In early September 2015, Knudson was cleaning Hayes's desk prior to Hayes's pending retirement. Knudson saw a stack of PRA requests in Hayes's desk, including Hoffman's. Because she was still troubled by how Hayes handled Hoffman's request, Knudson discussed the request with her two supervisors. Both supervisors instructed Knudson to call Hoffman, to tell him that she was reviewing past requests, and to determine whether Hoffman was satisfied with the response of the sheriff's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 Knudson called Hoffman. After Hoffman told her he had received records responsive to his request, Knudson thanked him and ended the call. Knudson did not express her concerns to Hoffman about the handling of his request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 Several days later, Hayes spoke with the same two supervisors about Hoffman's PRA request. Like what was told to Knudson, the supervisors instructed Hayes to call Hoffman to see if he was satisfied with what he received. Hayes called Hoffman to confirm he had received what he needed. Hoffman indicated that he had, but explained he had been looking for an incident where Schnebly allegedly ran someone over. Hayes remained on the phone with Hoffman while she looked for the report, but was unable to locate it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 On February 25, 2016, Hoffman returned to the sheriff's office. He told Knudson he should have received more documents in response to his June 2015 request, that he could sue, and that he might want to make another records request. Hoffman claimed Hayes and the person whom he sought information about, Schnebly, were drinking buddies, and this relationship was the reason he did not receive all appropriate records. Hoffman left with a blank PRA request form and said he needed to talk to some folks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 Although Hayes knew who Schnebly was, the two did not socialize. The fact that Hayes knew of Schnebly was not a factor in Hayes's handling of Hoffman's PRA request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13 On February 29, 2016, Hoffman submitted a new request, which is not at issue in this appeal. The same day, he also resubmitted his old request. Knudson properly processed both requests and provided all documents to Hoffman on March 1, 2016. The documents relating to the resubmitted request total 126 records, and consist of 29 pages of reports, 2 videos, and 95 photos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Procedure\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 Two days after receipt of the response to his final PRA request, Hoffman filed this PRA action against the County. He asserted that Hayes and the County acted in bad faith when Hayes withheld the records he requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 Hoffman filed a motion for summary judgment, but it was never heard. Instead, the parties conducted limited discovery and then agreed to waive their right to a jury trial and submit the matter to a bench trial based on stipulated facts, concessions of the parties, exhibits, and testimony through depositions, affidavits or declarations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16 After reviewing the written submissions of the parties and hearing argument of counsel, the trial court ruled in Hoffman's favor, finding the sheriff's office improperly redacted and withheld 126 records for 246 days. The court concluded, however, that Hayes's error was a result of negligence, not bad faith. The court found that Knudson had not acted negligently, that the sheriff's office had provided appropriate supervision, and that the response to Hoffman's PRA request was timely, though inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17 The trial court weighed the penalty factors set by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Yousoufian v.

Because the penalty days totaled 246, and the number of records totaled 126, the penalty totaled $15,498. Hoffman appeals the penalty award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 18 This case is governed by the applicable standard of review.

For one thing, there is no requirement that a trial judge make findings in this context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yousoufian\n   </em>\n   II,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4007219\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/168/444/\">\n    168 Wash.2d at 468-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=229%20P.3d%20735\">\n    229 P.3d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Supreme Court imposed penalty of $45 per day without issuing any findings or conclusions).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It would therefore be curious for us to engage in a heightened critique of a trial court's discretionary penalty decision simply because the court chose to articulate its decision in a way that was more transparent than necessary. But in addition, the abuse of discretion standard encompasses the ability to review a trial court's factual findings or assumptions. A trial court abuses its discretion when it relies on unsupported facts in issuing its decision.\n   <em>\n    Hundtofte v.

According to Hoffman, the primary consideration that must guide a trial court's PRA penalty assessment is the presence or absence of bad faith. Hoffman argues the record indisputably shows the County engaged in bad faith when processing his PRA request. Thus, the trial court should have imposed a higher daily penalty amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 22 Hoffman's myopic focus on bad faith is misplaced. Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Yousoufian\n   </em>\n   II, bad faith was considered the \"principal factor\" to be considered in a PRA penalty determination.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4007219\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/168/444/\">\n    168 Wash.2d at 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=229%20P.3d%20735\">\n    229 P.3d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the\n   <em>\n    Yousoufian\n   </em>\n   II court took a more nuanced approach.\n   <em>\n    Yousoufian\n   </em>\n   II reversed a trial court's penalty assessment because it was too reliant on the absence of bad faith. Rather than focus on the presence or absence of bad faith, the Supreme Court held that trial courts should be guided by a series of aggravating and mitigating factors, only some of which address a violator's level of culpability.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sargent v.

Under RCW 42.56.565(1), a court is prohibited from awarding PRA penalties to an incarcerated person unless the court makes a specific finding of bad faith. Given the singular importance of bad faith in the context of incarcerated persons, our courts have appropriately analyzed the contours of what constitutes bad faith in the context of RCW 42.56.565(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faulkner v.

However, such precision is simply not necessary in the general PRA context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 27 Based on the foregoing, a trial court's choice of how to label agency noncompliance should not be the basis for affirming or reversing a penalty decision. Instead, it is sufficient under\n   <em>\n    Yousoufian\n   </em>\n   II for a trial court to recognize that culpability exists in matters of degree and that more culpable conduct merits a higher PRA penalty than less culpable violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 28 Having clarified the nature of the trial court's legal inquiry, we turn to its application in the present case. Because Hoffman does not challenge any of the factual findings underlying the trial court's penalty assessment, our review is limited to the legality of the trial court's approach and overall reasonableness of its selected remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 29 We find no reversible error in the trial court's culpability assessment. Regardless of the exact nature of Hayes's individual fault, the trial court appropriately observed that the problems leading up to the County's PRA violation were attributable solely to Hayes and, given Hayes's retirement from employment, a large penalty would not be necessary to deter future PRA violations. Contrary to Hoffman's assertions, the trial court's culpability assessment need not have focused solely on Hayes's level of culpability.

Unlike what may be true in some PRA violation cases, the sheriff's office maintained prompt contact with Hoffman throughout the pendency of his PRA inquiry. It responded to each of Hoffman's PRA requests within five working days. In addition, Hayes and Kundson both acted immediately when requested by their supervisors to contact Hoffman for follow-up. While the response of the sheriff's office to Hoffman's initial PRA request was incomplete, that was not an independent aggravating factor. It is instead what caused the PRA violation in the first place. Based on the failure of the sheriff's office to provide an accurate response, the trial court awarded Hoffman daily penalties for 246 days. No further enhancement was required based on a lack of timely compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 31 In the end, the penalty chosen by the trial court was reasonable. Although the daily penalty was low, the court maximized the number of records eligible for the penalty by assessing an award for each individual page that had not been disclosed. In addition, the ultimate penalty of $15,498.00 amounted to an assessment of almost $0.34 per Kittitas County resident on a per capita basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is commensurate with other PRA violation assessments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zink v.

Given\n   that Mr. Hoffman suffered no financial harm as a result of the County's PRA violation, and that the subject matter of Mr. Hoffman's PRA request was not of public importance, the trial court's overall penalty amount was not unreasonably small.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The award was commensurate with the County's PRA violation and sufficient to deter future violations. Based on this overall reasonableness, we lack any basis to disturb the trial court's assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 32 The trial court appropriately exercised its discretion in assessing PRA penalties against the County.

Nothing in RCW 42.56.550 supports this extension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   B.
