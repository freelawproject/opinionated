LaFortune, District Judge, denying McNeely's Motion For Determination of Immunity in Tulsa County District Court Case No. CF-2013-343. Petitioner's request for extraordinary relief is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 Petitioner is charged in Case No. CF-2013-343 with one count of Murder in the First Degree for the shooting death of her husband inside their home. Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the charge based on her claim of immunity from prosecution under 21 O.S.2011, \u00a7 1289.25\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , commonly referred to as the Stand Your Ground law (hereinafter \" Section 1289.25\" or \"Stand Your Ground\"). In denying the motion, Judge LaFortune determined that McNeely was not entitled to immunity because \"it was not the Legislature's intent to include a person's residence, in the context of the use of deadly force as between lawful residents therein, within the meaning of 'any other place' as those words are used in \u00a7 1289.25(D).\" McNeely seeks an order reversing the District Court's ruling and dismissal of the charge filed against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 Petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus and thus indicates her acknowledgement that there is no statutory interlocutory appeal to this Court from the District Court order.

Petitioner offers no such authority in this matter and we find none. The Oklahoma Legislature has not included in Section 1289.25 any statutory right to an interlocutory appeal to this Court on Stand Your Ground issues. 21 O.S.2011, \u00a7 1289.25. There is thus no interlocutory appeal to this Court from Judge LaFortune's order, or any other District Court ruling that denies a motion to dismiss charges based on a claim of Stand Your Ground immunity from prosecution under Section 1289.25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 This Court has previously allowed in a series of unpublished opinions the use of a writ of prohibition as the vehicle to allow a defendant to seek pre-trial review of a trial court's denial of Stand Your Ground immunity from prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Ramos\n   </em>\n   , Nos. S-2013-509 and S-2013-510 (Okl.Cr. June 9, 2015) (not for publication). Petitioner argues here that a petition for writ of mandamus is the proper method of challenging the District Court order denying her request for Stand Your Ground immunity from prosecution. Whether through a writ of prohibition or mandamus, we now expressly reject our previous approach to these cases. We hold today that an extraordinary writ proceeding is not cognizable to allow merits review of a District Court's pretrial ruling denying Stand Your Ground immunity. While we recognize a direct appeal is not a true substitute for the\n   interlocutory appeal Petitioner seeks, there is simply no statutorily authorized means under existing law to address the issue pretrial as it is presented here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 The Rules of this Court specifically state the requirements that must be established before issuance of a writ of mandamus or a writ of prohibition. Before a writ of prohibition will issue, a \"[p]etitioner has the burden of establishing (1) a court, officer or person has or is about to exercise judicial or quasi-judicial power; (2) the exercise of said power is unauthorized by law; and (3) the exercise of said power will result in injury for which there is no other adequate remedy.\" Rule 10.6(A),\n   <em>\n    Rules of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\n   </em>\n   , Title 22, Ch.18, App. (2018). The purpose of the writ of prohibition is thus to address whether the exercise of judicial power is unauthorized by law, and is not to address the merits of a decision rendered after the exercise of authorized judicial power.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . When a judge of a district court addresses and decides a defendant's motion to dismiss charges based on a claim of Stand Your Ground immunity from prosecution under 21 O.S.2011, \u00a7 1289.25, that judge is exercising judicial power that is sanctioned by law. Judge LaFortune's exercise of judicial power in denying Petitioner's motion to dismiss charges based on a Stand Your Ground immunity claim is not unauthorized by law. Petitioner has thus not established that a writ of prohibition can or should issue in this matter. Rule 10.6(A),\n   <em>\n    Rules\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b66 Before a writ of mandamus will issue, a \"[p]etitioner has the burden of establishing (1) he has a clear legal right to the relief sought; (2) the respondent's refusal to perform a plain legal duty not involving the exercise of discretion; and (3) the adequacy of mandamus and the inadequacy of other relief.\" Rule 10.6(B),\n   <em>\n    Rules\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Stand Your Ground immunity is necessarily a factual determination and thus can never be a clear legal right. Rule 10.6(B),\n   <em>\n    Rules\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Petitioner may be able to establish a factual basis for a Stand Your Ground defense; but she cannot establish a clear legal right to the relief of Stand Your Ground immunity from prosecution.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Judge LaFortune did not refuse to perform a plain legal duty, and exercised discretion in denying Petitioner's claim of Stand Your Ground immunity from prosecution. Rule 10.6(B),\n   <em>\n    Rules\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Reviewing the merits of Judge LaFortune's decision is not the proper function of the extraordinary writ of mandamus. Rule 10.6(B),\n   <em>\n    Rules\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Thus, Petitioner has also not established that a writ of mandamus can or should issue in this matter. Rule 10.6(A),\n   <em>\n    Rules\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b67 The use of the term \"immun[ity]\" in the Stand Your Ground law is somewhat a misnomer. Immunity is generally defined as an exemption from a duty or liability, as granted by law to a person or class of persons.\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   751 (6th ed. 1990);\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1130-31 (1986). Immunity as used in Oklahoma's Stand Your Ground law can be easily misconstrued to mean absolute immunity from prosecution regardless of the underlying facts and circumstances. Yet, the immunity created in section 1289.25 is a\n   <em>\n    conditional\n   </em>\n   immunity meaning that it applies only if certain factual elements are established.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v. Guenther\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10409927\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/740/971/#p977\">\n    740 P.2d 971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 977 (Colo. 1987) (finding Colorado's equivalent Stand Your Ground law provides \"conditional immunity\" that requires the adjudicatory role of the court to determine if a sufficient factual predicate exists for application of the statute). The applicability of Stand Your Ground is thus entirely dependent on the specific and unique facts and circumstances of the particular incident at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   21 O.S.2011, \u00a7 1289.25. The pivotal determination of whether Stand Your Ground applies to any given scenario requires judicial application of the law to the specific facts at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b68 When criminal charges are filed, the only way courts can truly determine whether a defendant is immune from prosecution under the Stand Your Ground law is for the State to present evidence showing all of the facts and circumstances regarding the commission of the alleged crime; and then for the defendant to present evidence showing why, under all the facts and circumstances of the case, the defendant's use of force was reasonable and justified under the Stand Your Ground law. Such a procedure is the very essence of a criminal prosecution. In other words, a defendant must be prosecuted\n   to some extent in order for Oklahoma courts to determine if he or she is legally not guilty of a crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b69 District Attorneys of Oklahoma should continue to include Stand Your Ground considerations in the exercise of their general discretion and authority to decide what criminal charges should be filed. Okla. Const. Art II, \u00a7 17 ; 22 O.S.2011, \u00a7 303 ; 21 O.S.2011, \u00a7 1289.25 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woodward v.

We are confident that all due process and statutory Stand Your Ground requirements will be fully satisfied by such efforts even though there are no available appellate challenges for interlocutory Stand Your Ground decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DECISION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610 The petition for writ of mandamus asking this Court to overturn the order entered by Judge LaFortune in Tulsa County District Court Case No. CF-2013-343 is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .

The District Courts do not have the authority to unilaterally grant immunity.

An adverse ruling denying immunity under Section 1289.25 is nothing more than an intermediate order made in the\n   progress of the case that is reviewable on direct appeal following conviction, the adequacy of relief at that time notwithstanding.

Okla. Const. art. VII, \u00a7 4. The underlying reasoning focused on what the majority viewed as the unfairness of a right without an adequate remedy because the right to immunity from prosecution \"is effectively lost if the defendant is erroneously forced to stand trial.\" As Judge Hudson's summary opinion points out, the use of the term \"immune from criminal prosecution\" creates some confusion as it is impossible for one to have absolute immunity from\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   prosecution when determination of that immunity requires at least\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   initial prosecution.

My point is that choices would have to be made in fashioning this right, and the selection of policy choices from among a variety of available options is the very essence of legislating. This Court has recognized:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   It is our duty to declare the law as we find it, whether or not we agree as to its policies or purposes.

As pointed out in today's summary opinion, one seeking a writ of prohibition must show, among other things, the exercise of judicial authority not authorized by law, but the exercise of authority by a trial judge ruling on the question of immunity is explicitly authorized by law. One seeking a writ of mandamus must show, among other things, a clear legal right to the relief sought and that the trial court is refusing to perform a plain legal duty not involving the exercise of discretion. A trial court's ruling on this issue is the very epitome of an exercise of discretion, and no defendant can show a clear legal right to relief which doesn't exist until this Court makes it exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b69 Had I drafted this statute, I would likely have included some vehicle for review of the initial ruling on the question of immunity. But that belief, however well founded and sincerely held, does not equate to judicial authority where none otherwise exists. Whether or not I think the Legislature has given an accused who claims this immunity enough protection doesn't change the amount of protection the Legislature has clearly given.

The Court in\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   viewed its procedure for pre-trial adjudication and review of Stand Your Ground immunity claims as a logical and practical approach. In three intervening sessions, the Oklahoma Legislature declined to alter the\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   procedure, and similar interlocutory review is the norm in other states with Stand Your Ground immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet the logical and practical virtues of\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   cannot forestall its destruction today.\n   <em>\n    Stare decisis\n   </em>\n   would not have saved it, either. The struggle, as they say, is real.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b63 The\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   Court reasoned that criminal prosecution and trial of a person entitled to immunity are judicial proceedings\n   <em>\n    unauthorized by law\n   </em>\n   , for which there is clearly\n   <em>\n    no adequate post-trial remedy\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court pretty much concedes this reality today, and avoids its obvious implications only by misconstruing its\n   <em>\n    original\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    appellate\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction, as well as its existing authority to arrest unauthorized proceedings by issuing the writ of prohibition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, while some defendants may well be immune from criminal prosecution and trial under the Stand Your Ground law, they must first be criminally prosecuted and tried to see if they are immune.

Under 21 O.S.2011, \u00a7 1289.25(f), an individual who uses certain kinds of defensive force against an intruder is \"immune from criminal prosecution\", which includes both charging and prosecuting. This determination by a district court judge is dispositive. If one is held to be immune from prosecution, then the case is over. If a district court judge finds that an individual is not immune from prosecution, then the criminal case continues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b62 The majority finds there is no right for a defendant to appeal because one is not explicitly provided for in the Stand Your Ground statute. This finding disregards the fact that other Oklahoma criminal statutes have been interpreted to include an appeal right where it is not explicitly written in the statute. One example is found in the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, 22 O.S.2011, \u00a7\u00a7 1345 - 1349 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hopkins v.

In 1999, this Court found that a defendant had the right to appeal a decision to revoke or terminate participation in Drug Court, although the statute provided no explicit right to appeal.\n   <em>\n    Hagar v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11497148\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/990/894/\">\n    1999 OK CR 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11497148\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/990/894/\">\n    990 P.2d 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 898. Of course, some criminal statutes explicitly allow or disallow an appeal. 10A O.S.2011, \u00a7 2-5-101(G) (order certifying a person as a child or denying the request for certification as a child shall be a final order, appealable when entered); 10A O.S.2011, \u00a7 2-5-203 (decision to join multiple youthful offender offenses shall not be appealable as a final order). Because a district court order regarding Stand Your Ground immunity is dispositive, an intermediate appeal is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b63 I agree with Judge Lewis that McNeely's appeal falls under a writ of prohibition. A defendant seeking review from a pretrial decision denying a Stand Your Ground claim must establish that the court has exercised a judicial power unauthorized by law, and that exercise of power resulted in injury for which there is no other adequate remedy. Rule 10.6(A),\n   <em>\n    Rules of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\n   </em>\n   , Title 22, Ch.18, App. (2018). Immunity from prosecution, a right which is necessarily lost if a prosecution continues, is exactly the kind of dispositive claim ripe for a writ of prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b64 The majority and concurring opinions all refer to the ambiguity of the term \"immunity\" under the statute, but the intent of the Legislature is clear. If a district court judge finds you are immune under the statute, you are immune from prosecution-in fact, the statute goes even further and explicitly states you should not be charged with a crime. This language, explicitly granting immunity from criminal prosecution, was added by amendment in 2011, and was not included in any previous version. The amendment proves the Legislature intended \"immunity\" to mean what it says. We must construe this provision according to the plain and ordinary meaning of its language, as our \"fundamental\n   principle\" is to give effect to the Legislature's intent.\n   <em>\n    Gerhart v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6843137\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/360/1194/\">\n    2015 OK CR 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6843137\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/360/1194/\">\n    360 P.3d 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1198.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b65 The Oklahoma Legislature amended the Stand Your Ground statute to make clear that it includes a right to immunity, distinguishing it from a traditional self-defense claim. On its face, \"immunity\" means that there will be no further prosecution. According to the procedure we set forth in\n   <em>\n    State v. Ramos\n   </em>\n   , this determination is made by a district court judge.\n   <em>\n    State v. Ramos\n   </em>\n   , Nos. S-2013-509 &amp; S-2013-510, slip op. at 9-10 (Okl.Cr. June 9, 2015) (not for publication). A special judge could only make such a ruling if she was fulfilling the role of a district court judge by agreement of the parties. Therefore, the only avenue of appeal is to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b66 The trial court's decision on a Stand Your Ground claim is a final disposition of the issue of immunity from prosecution. While a defendant may raise the issue as a defense at trial, obviously if he is defending against charges during a trial, his right not to be prosecuted no longer exists. The majority as good as admits this when it says that a defendant must be prosecuted \"to some extent\" to determine whether he is immune. The defendant must establish he is factually entitled to immunity before the statute applies. The majority disregards the fact that this particular factfinding happens before trial begins. In a pretrial hearing the State and defendant present evidence, and the trial court makes factual and legal findings and rules on the Stand Your Ground issue. If the ruling is in the defendant's favor, he goes free. The majority suggests that the presentation of evidence and factfinding which take place in a pretrial hearing is \"the essence of a criminal prosecution\", comparable to a trial, and thus, it implies, immunity is preserved even if a trial occurs. It is not. The Legislature did not say that a person fitting the parameters of \u00a7 1289.25 could be prosecuted to the extent necessary to establish that his use of force was reasonable and justified; nor did it say that immunity is lost when evidence is presented in pretrial proceeding. The Legislature said instead that person \"is immune from criminal prosecution and civil action\", including \"charging or prosecuting the defendant.\" 21 O.S \u00a7 1289.25(F). There is no equivocation in that language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b67 I am deeply disturbed by the majority's decision here, which removes all possibility of pretrial appeal from the defendant while preserving the State's right to a pretrial appeal. This Court's previous decisions granted both parties a right to interlocutory review. In fact, this Court has previously allowed the State to appeal a pretrial decision granting Stand Your Ground immunity in two different ways. In\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   we determined that, because such a decision involves a legal bar to further prosecution, the State could only appeal it under 22 O.S.2011, \u00a7 1053(3) as a reserved question of law.\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   , Nos. S-2013-509 &amp; S-2013-510, slip op. at 8-9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under a reserved question of law, this Court will answer the question presented, but even if the answer is in the State's favor that particular prosecution remains barred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    City of Norman v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8180356\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/189/726/\">\n    2008 OK CR 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8180356\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/189/726/\">\n    189 P.3d 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 729. However, we held in\n   <em>\n    State v. Cooper\n   </em>\n   that the State may appeal such a decision under 22 O.S.2011, \u00a7 1053(4)\n   <em>\n    where a defendant raises Stand Your Ground immunity in a motion to quash\n   </em>\n   , rather than moving to dismiss the charges directly under Stand Your Ground.\n   <em>\n    State v. Cooper\n   </em>\n   , No. S-2014-961, slip op. at 6-7 (Okl.Cr. July 5, 2015) (not for publication). Of course, if this Court grants a State appeal under \u00a7 1053(4), the prosecution may proceed. So the State will always have an avenue of appeal from an unfavorable decision below, and may have the opportunity to continue the prosecution, depending on how a defendant happens to raise the issue in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b68 After today's decision, by contrast, defendants cannot appeal at all, and must undergo prosecution (losing their immunity from prosecution) before this Court will even\n   hear their claim. Such a result is fundamentally unfair. Because a trial court's pretrial Stand Your Ground decision is final on the question of immunity, both the State and the defendant should have an equal right to an interlocutory appeal of the decision before this Court. Only that way will both parties be protected and the Legislature's clear intent be preserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b69 Allowing defendants an interlocutory appeal through writ of prohibition-and thus preserving both legislative intent and parity between the parties-is not, as my colleagues fear, an act of judicial legislation. Rather, it is \"incidental to judicial administration.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Haskell v. Huston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1908%20OK%20157\">\n    1908 OK 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 75,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8880852\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/okla/21/782/\">\n    21 Okla. 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8880852\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/okla/21/782/\">\n    97 P. 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 995. We are deciding a question of law, not policy. The Legislature intended that individuals who are immune under the statute should not be prosecuted or even charged. To give effect to this intent and preserve immunity, Stand Your Ground\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   include an interlocutory appeal. That determination is incidental to the judicial administration of the law as the Legislature wrote it.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In its narrow focus on whether a right to appeal is explicitly written in the statute, the majority strips away the explicit language, which is written in the statute, granting immunity from prosecution. The majority thus fails to honor the Legislature's intent that a defendant immune under Stand Your Ground should be free from prosecution. I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    While it may be more common that only issues concerning the facts of the case will arise from a pretrial decision granting Stand Your Ground immunity-issues clearly not answerable under \u00a7 1053(3) -it is certainly possible that the State will present questions of law which fit squarely within the limits of a reserved question of law. For example, in\n    <em>\n     Ramos\n    </em>\n    the State presented three questions of law, which were answered by this Court.\n    <em>\n     Ramos\n    </em>\n    , Nos.
