Brock, Special Judge. The jury set punishment at life imprisonment without parole and Judge Brock pronounced judgment and sentence according to the verdict. Mr. Williamson now appeals to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Appellant shot and killed his step-brother, Michael Sean Daniel, in the middle of the road near Idabel, Oklahoma, in McCurtain County. Two witnesses, Kathy Minor and Gwen Devasier, saw Daniel on his knees in the road while Appellant shot him once in the chest. Daniel fell and Appellant shot him again in the face. Daniel had also been shot in the arm. Appellant walked to his pickup and drove away, leaving Daniel in the road. Daniel's motorcycle was parked just a few yards from where he was lying and the killing took place near Daniel's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Earlier, another witness saw the victim's motorcycle and Appellant's pickup traveling east on the road at a high rate of speed with the pickup just about fifty yards behind the motorcycle. Investigators found spots that appeared to be blood on the left side of the motorcycle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 The medical examiner found three wounds to the victim; a wound to his left arm went through his arm and into the left side of his chest. There was one to the right side of his chest, and one to the right side of the victim's face. The victim had a blood alcohol content of .14 percent. He also had levels of the anti-depressants Sertraline and Trazodone in his system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 This shooting was the culmination of a feud between Appellant and his step-mother's family, including his step-brother Michael Daniel, which began soon after his father died. His step mother, Anita Williamson, testified that when her estranged husband, John Henry Williamson, died, Appellant moved into his house. Mrs. Williamson was, however, a joint owner and she started proceedings to have him removed from the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 One day, about seven months prior to this shooting, Mrs. Williamson went with the victim, who was her son, to visit a couple of friends and talk about getting Appellant out of the house. They sat around drinking beer and decided they should get Appellant out of the house before he had a chance to cause damage. They went to the house and Daniel and one friend went to the door. Appellant met them at the door carrying a cane. Appellant\n   struck both men with the cane and they went to the ground. Mrs. Williamson went to the door carrying a baseball bat. She told her step-son that the house was hers and she wanted him out. Appellant gathered his children and drove away. Mrs. Williamson stayed there that night and apparently moved in.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Another time, about five weeks prior to the shooting, Mrs. Williamson and Daniel drove by Appellant and he started hollering, yelling and cursing them out. They just drove on by. Later that day, however, Daniel received threatening text messages from Appellant in an attempt to get Daniel to fight him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 The night before the shooting Appellant stayed at the home of Jeffrey and Gayla Alford. On the morning of May 6, Appellant drove to Wal-mart in Idabel, where he was caught on video, and drove back to the Alford home. Around 2:30 p.m. Appellant received a call and went outside to answer the call. He came back in and told Gayla Alford that he would be spending the night in Broken Bow. Witnesses remembered seeing the shooting occur at about 3:40 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 After Appellant drove away from the scene of the shooting he drove to Cheryl Tutt's house arriving there about 4:00 p.m. Tutt is Gayla Alford's sister. Tutt testified that she invited Appellant in and he looked scared. He was shaking and sweating. His color was pale. He told her, \"I done it and somebody saw my truck.\" Appellant was wearing the same Carhartt shirt that Wal-mart video showed he was wearing before the shooting. Appellant asked Tutt to drive him to Texarkana, but she could not because she did not have her car. Appellant asked for back-road directions to Gayla's house. He asked Tutt to not say anything to anybody. After Appellant left, Tutt called Gayla and told her Appellant was on his way and something was not right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 Appellant arrived at the Alford home, but he was no longer wearing the blue Carhartt shirt. Appellant asked Gayla to take him to Texarkana, but she could not. He asked her for money, told her he loved her, and asked her to take his dog. He wanted her to not think he was a bad person, but he had to go.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 Investigators found the blue Carhartt shirt near where Appellant had parked at the Tutt house. They also found a box of .22 caliber shells nearby. Appellant's pickup was located in Hope, Arkansas the next morning and Appellant was eventually arrested nearby at around 8:00 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 Appellant claims in proposition one that his trial was fundamentally unfair because the admission of prejudicial and otherwise improper law enforcement testimony invaded the province of the jury. Appellant concedes that most of the testimony came without objection, so this Court reviews those instances for plain error only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 To be entitled to relief for plain error, an appellant must show: \"(1) the existence of an actual error (i.e., deviation from a legal rule); (2) that the error is plain or obvious; and (3) that the error affected his substantial rights, meaning the error affected the outcome of the proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Hogan v.

His testimony, Appellant contends, was a rehash of other witnesses' testimony using a timeline to summarize the State's theory of the case. Appellant also complains that Agent Kent was allowed to testify regarding the contents of recordings of Appellant's jail conversations before the recordings were introduced to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b615 Agent Kent testified about a timeline prepared by him and introduced as an exhibit with no objection by Appellant. His testimony about the timeline was a summary of the investigation and what information he gathered to form the basis for the\n   timeline. His testimony did not give an opinion regarding the veracity of the witnesses' testimony. As such, his testimony did not amount to improper bolstering or vouching.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Warner v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8462112\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/144/838/\">\n    2006 OK CR 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8462112\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/144/838/\">\n    144 P.3d 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 860-61,\n   <em>\n    overruled on other grounds\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

Contrary to Appellant's argument, Kent's testimony did not force the jury to ignore its responsibility to make its own conclusions based on the facts and circumstances appearing in evidence. This testimony, therefore, was not improper as it did not tell the jury what conclusions to reach.\n   <em>\n    Romano v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995%20OK%20CR%2074\">\n    1995 OK CR 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10330224\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/909/92/#p109\">\n    909 P.2d 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 109.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b616 Kent's testimony may have reiterated some of the witnesses' testimony; however, the reiteration was not so cumulative that its probative value was substantially outweighed in violation of 12 O.S.2011, \u00a7 2402. The testimony was probative to show the steps in the investigation, why the focus was on Appellant, and how law enforcement conducted their investigation leading to Appellant's apprehension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b617 Kent's testimony about the recordings of Appellant's jail conversations also garnered no objection by defense counsel, thus we review for plain error only. Appellant complains that, in setting a foundation for the introduction of the recordings, Kent testified about incriminating phrases on the recordings just before the trial court admitted the tapes. Appellant's only complaint is that the testimony bolstered the recordings, was cumulative of the recordings, and usurped the jury's ability to decide what was on the recordings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b618 Here, the jury was not asked to abandon its own perception of the recordings and substitute its interpretation for that of Kent. Kent only testified about the phrases he thought were important in the investigation and which statements were incriminating based on his training and experience. The jurors were free to determine the weight of these recordings on their own. There was no error in Kent's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b619 Finding no error in the admission of Kent's testimony, this Court cannot find plain error. Proposition one is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b620 In proposition two, Appellant argues that the admission of State's Exhibits 9, 21, and 42-55 was error because the exhibits were more prejudicial than probative and were unnecessarily cumulative. Appellant failed to object at trial, therefore, we review only for plain error.\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1994%20OK%20CR%2040\">\n    1994 OK CR 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10352673\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/876/690/#p694\">\n    876 P.2d at 692-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To obtain relief, Appellant must prove a plain or obvious error affected the outcome of the proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Hogan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8406179\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/139/907/\">\n    2006 OK CR 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 38,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8406179\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/139/907/\">\n    139 P.3d at 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b621 Appellant first claims that it was error to admit the timeline prepared by Agent Kent (Exhibit 9), because it was only a demonstrative aid. Again, Appellant made no objection at trial, thus we review for plain error only.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   12 O.S.2011, \u00a7 2104. Appellant cites\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8411471\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/136/671/\">\n    2006 OK CR 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 59,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8411471\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/136/671/\">\n    136 P.3d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 698, where this Court held that plain error occurred when a demonstrative timeline was admitted as evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b622 The timeline in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   was a \"best guess\" timeline prepared by a crime scene reconstruction expert in order to aid the jury in understanding his expert testimony. Furthermore in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   the State admittedly characterized the timeline as a demonstrative aid during trial. The timeline in this case, however, was based on the factual testimony of several witnesses who testified about times and places relevant to the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b623 In\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   , the introduction of the timeline did not serve as the sole purpose for the reversal and remand for a new sentencing, thus this Court is free to determine whether the introduction of the timeline in this case affected Appellant's substantial rights. Here, the timeline accurately reflected the witnesses' testimony and was not based on any speculation. Thus, no clear error is shown. Moreover, the introduction of the summation of witnesses' testimony as represented by the timeline did not adversely affect Appellant's rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b624 Appellant next complains about the introduction of the victim's blood soaked\n   shirt (Exhibit 21). He claims the shirt was not relevant to any issue in the case and served only \"to inflame the jury and prejudice the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brewer v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1966%20OK%20CR%2058\">\n    1966 OK CR 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10586565\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/414/559/\">\n    414 P.2d 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 564 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   12 O.S.2011, \u00a7\u00a7 2402 - 2403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b625 In\n   <em>\n    Brewer\n   </em>\n   , the appellant objected to the introduction of the bloody clothing. Here there was no objection. Not only did Appellant fail to object, he stipulated to the admission of the shirt. As stated, we will review for plain error only. This shirt is the only piece of evidence showing the amount of blood at the scene of the crime. This shirt represents the best evidence of the color of the shirt, which corroborates the witnesses' description of the shirt worn by the victim. Furthermore, Appellant has not shown that the introduction of this bloody shirt prejudiced him in any way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b626 Appellant next complains about the introduction of fourteen different photographs of bullets and bullet fragments which were removed from the victim's body. (Exhibits 42-55) No objection to the introduction of these photographs was made at trial. Appellant's argument is that the numerous photographs \"likely confused the jury and made them believe many more than three bullets had been fired....\" Again, Appellant cannot show that he suffered any prejudice from the introduction of these photographs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b627 All of the evidence complained of in this proposition was probative and relevant for the jury to understand the criminal elements, the overall context of the crime, Appellant's method of committing the crime, his actions after the crime was committed, and the identity of the victim. Appellant cannot show that the introduction of this evidence was substantially outweighed by any of the dangers outlined in 21 O.S.2011, \u00a7 2403. This Court, finding no error in the introduction of this evidence, therefore, cannot conclude that the introduction of this evidence rises to the level of plain error. Proposition two is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b628 Appellant complains, in proposition three, about the giving of the instructions by the trial court. He first complains that the trial court's reading of the instructions to the jury was confusing and misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b629 He points out, first, that the trial court took out an instruction during the reading of the instructions. The trial court had just read the elements of first degree murder for the second time and began to read the elements of manslaughter. The trial court commented that instruction 26 was a repeat of the elements of heat of passion manslaughter so he was removing it. There was no objection from Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b630 Appellant next points out that the trial court's comment during the reading of the instructions that he is \"reading ahead of myself\" was confusing. There is nothing at all confusing in the record here. Appellant next notes that the trial court took out instruction 35 because it was a repeat of the eighty-five percent instruction. Again there was no objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b631 A reading of the transcript does not reveal confusing or misleading instructions. There is no error evident on the record. The initial hurdles for plain error cannot be met here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b632 Appellant argues error occurred because the trial court failed to define malice aforethought during the initial instructions to the jury, but gave the instructions after the State had presented the first closing argument. The trial court obviously corrected its own error and there was no objection by Appellant. He cannot show that he was harmed in any manner. There is no plain error here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b633 Appellant argues that it was error for the trial court to fail to define re-establishment, in the context of self-defense, in the instructions. See OUJI CR 2d, 8-51. Appellant failed to request this instruction, so, again, we review for plain error only. The trial court indicated that it had a duty to instruct on manslaughter in the first degree and self-defense if there was any evidence, however slight, to support the instruction. The court, therefore, gave instructions on manslaughter and self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b634 Re-establishment is relevant where a defendant, who was the original aggressor, regained the right of self-defense when the defendant withdrew or attempted\n   to withdraw from the altercation and communicated his desire to withdraw. When the victim continued the altercation he becomes the aggressor and a defendant has the right of self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b635 In this proposition, Appellant does not identify specific facts which would have entitled him to instructions on re-establishment. There is no evidence that Daniels was the aggressor or that Appellant attempted to withdraw from a confrontation. Appellant only theorizes that if the trial court instructed on self-defense, he must have been entitled to this instruction as well. This belief is an inappropriate measure of the law. The correct standard is that the instructions are warranted when self-defense has been properly raised.\n   <em>\n    Perez v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1990%20OK%20CR%2067\">\n    1990 OK CR 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10382216\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/798/639/#p641\">\n    798 P.2d 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 641. The evidence presented during trial must make out a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of self-defense in order to receive the benefit of the instructions. Appellant cites jail recordings and a Facebook post. The jail recordings are found in State's Exhibit 34A and the Facebook post is part of State's Exhibit 10. None of these exhibits make out a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of self-defense. There must be a prima facie case of self-defense.\n   <em>\n    Ball v.

He just wanted to \"whoop his ass.\" He also claims on the recordings that he didn't know \"how it came in my hands.\" He says that he must have taken it from Sean. His Facebook post shows that he moved his boys back to Florida; he asserts that it's \"open season\"; and he's not sure he will make it back. No reading of this evidence provides a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of self-defense on the day of the killing.

Appellant did claim that he was acting in self-defense because of earlier encounters with the victim.

The first section argues that trial counsel failed to utilize available extra-record evidence which forms the foundation of his 3.11 motion. The exhibits attached to Appellant's motion for an evidentiary hearing contain documents which were in the possession of trial counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b655 The exhibits contain written statements by Kathy Minor and Gwen Devasier, a crime scene investigation report by OSBI Agent Michael Shufeldt, a report regarding jail recordings by Agent Kent, and two reports from the McCurtain County Sheriff's office regarding the earlier disputes and confrontations between Appellant and the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b656 The attachments to the application do not show this Court by clear and convincing evidence there is a strong possibility trial counsel was ineffective for failing to utilize this information. The information does not contradict evidence introduced at trial, nor does the information show that Appellant acted in self-defense. Appellant cannot show that counsel was ineffective for failing to use this evidence during trial; therefore, Appellant's application for evidentiary hearing is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b657 Next, Appellant claims counsel was ineffective for failing to utilize evidence which was available in the record in the form of evidence introduced, reports filed with the trial court, and preliminary hearing testimony. Appellant claims counsel was ineffective for failing to question Agent Whit Kent about the jail recordings where Appellant stated that he did not own a gun. These recordings were introduced as evidence to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b658 He also claims counsel was ineffective in failing to question Agent Kent or call witnesses regarding a criminalist report which contains information that Appellant had blood stains on his blue Carhartt shirt found at the Tutt home and on the jeans he was wearing at the time he was arrested. The blood DNA matched Appellant. This later evidence, Appellant argues, would have prevented the State from arguing that Appellant didn't have a drop of blood on him; \"does that look like self-defense?\" The State used Tutt's testimony regarding the lack of blood on Appellant to support their argument about the lack of blood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b659 Appellant claims that counsel was ineffective for failing to cross-examine Agent Shufeldt about blood stains on the victim's motorcycle seat. Shufeldt testified there were blood stains, but the OSBI lab report states that no blood was detected on the seat swabs. Appellant argues that his self-defense claim would have benefited from the evidence that the victim was not shot as he sat on the motorcycle seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b660 Appellant claims counsel was ineffective for failing to cross-examine Gwen Devasier and Gayla Alford with their preliminary hearing testimony. Devasier testified at trial\n   that she did not see the victim do anything. At the preliminary hearing she testified that the victim who was on his knees was still moving until he received the final shot to the head. Appellant claims this is a key point in his self-defense claim. There is nothing in this testimony which would hint at the possibility that any reasonable person could believe that Appellant was justified in using deadly force in self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b661 Gayla Alford testified during the preliminary hearing that she was not really sure why Appellant left her house just before this homicide occurred. At trial she testified that Appellant received a phone call just before leaving her house in a hurry. Appellant argues that the State used this testimony as part of its evidence of malice aforethought. Based on the testimony, the failure to cross-examine regarding the phone call is clearly a reasonable strategic decision that does not fall outside reasonable bounds of advocacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b662 Appellant has not presented clear and convincing evidence that there is a strong possibility trial counsel was ineffective for failing to identify or utilize this available evidence. The failure to utilize this evidence does not overcome the presumption that counsel's actions constituted sound trial strategy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b663 Next, Appellant argues that counsel failed to be a zealous advocate by failing to argue persuasively during closing argument. Counsel's argument was based on the evidence presented. His argument constituted a valid strategic decision and Appellant cannot show that he was prejudiced by counsel's closing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b664 Lastly, Appellant argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to preserve error in the record, by stipulating to evidence and failing to object to other evidence, and failing to object to improper jury instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b665 In the first instance, Appellant claims that counsel was ineffective for stipulating to the introduction of State's Exhibit 21, which is the victim's blood soaked shirt discussed in proposition two. As discussed in proposition two, the introduction of this shirt did not prejudice Appellant in any manner. He cannot, therefore, overcome the prejudice prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland's\n   </em>\n   ineffective assistance test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b666 Next, Appellant claims that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the introduction of State's Exhibits 9 and 42-55. Exhibit 9 is the timeline prepared by Agent Kent, and discussed in Appellant's substantive argument in proposition two. Counsel stated, \"without objection\" when the State moved its introduction. This timeline was wholly consistent with the witnesses' testimony and the chronology of the events. Counsel's failure to object did not fall below the wide range of reasonable professional conduct. Moreover, Appellant has not shown that he was prejudiced by counsel's actions. Exhibits 42-55 are the numerous photographs of bullets and bullet fragments which were removed from the victim's body. In proposition two, this Court concluded that Appellant cannot show that he suffered any prejudice from the introduction of these photographs. Here, he cannot overcome the prejudice hurdle of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b667 Appellant claims that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the testimony of Agent Kent. Appellant does not specifically point to the testimony which trial counsel should have objected to, but in proposition two, Appellant claimed that it was error for Kent to testify by summarizing other witnesses' testimony, utilizing the timeline he had prepared, and to testify regarding his perception of the jail recordings. We found no error in Agent Kent's testimony. Counsel's conduct here did not fall below reasonable professional conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b668 Lastly, Appellant claims that counsel was ineffective for failing to ensure that the instructions given by the trial court represented a correct, accurate statement of the law. Substantive claims regarding the jury instructions were raised in propositions three (self-defense instructions) and five (flight instruction). In the propositions we found that, under current law, the giving of the flight instruction was improper; however, an improper inference was not attached to the instruction, so Appellant was not prejudiced. We found that there was no error in the self-defense instructions as the trial court was overly generous in giving those instructions\n   at trial. In no manner can Appellant show a reasonable probability, sufficient to undermine the confidence in the outcome, that the result of the proceeding would have been different. Appellant cannot show he was prejudiced by counsel's failure to object to the instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b669 This Court has examined each of Appellant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and has concluded that counsel was not ineffective under the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   test.
