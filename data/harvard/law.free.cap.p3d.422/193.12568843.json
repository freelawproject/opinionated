ORS 813.010(5). In this case, defendant was charged with felony DUII based on his two prior convictions in the preceding 10 years, but he successfully asserted a statutory challenge to one of them, a Georgia conviction, because it had been obtained in violation of his right to legal counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 813.328(1) (a defendant may challenge \"the validity of prior convictions alleged by the state\" as an element of felony DUII). As a result, defendant was convicted of misdemeanor rather than felony DUII. However, the trial court counted the Georgia conviction when it permanently revoked defendant's driving privileges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 809.235(1)(b) (court shall permanently revoke a defendant's driving privileges when convicted for a third time of DUII).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed without opinion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Standerfer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2185504\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/297/725/\">\n    297 Or. 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2185504\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/297/725/\">\n    688 P.2d 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984) (applying Sixth Amendment right to counsel). We conclude that the trial court correctly relied on the Georgia conviction to revoke defendant's driving privileges as a civil disability-not a criminal punishment-and that the revocation was consistent with defendant's right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the trial court and the decision of the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The relevant facts are undisputed. Defendant drove while under the influence of alcohol and was arrested. The\n   state charged him with felony DUII because defendant had two previous DUII convictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 813.010(5) (a person's third DUII within a 10-year period is a Class C felony). Defendant had been convicted of DUII in Georgia in 2007, and then again in Clackamas County, Oregon in 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before trial, defendant moved to prohibit the use of the 2007 Georgia DUII conviction to aggravate the DUII from a misdemeanor to a felony. During the hearing on that motion, defendant testified that he had pleaded guilty to the Georgia DUII, but that he did not have an attorney at the time of his plea and was not advised about the benefits of having an attorney or the risks of proceeding\n   without one. He also testified that, at the time of his arraignment in Georgia, he did not know that he had a right to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After hearing evidence about the Georgia proceeding, the trial court in this case determined that the Georgia conviction could not be used against defendant to aggravate the DUII from a misdemeanor to a felony, noting that the record from the Georgia case did not contain any indication that there had been a valid waiver of the right to counsel. The court proceeded with a stipulated facts trial and found defendant guilty. Accordingly, the trial court convicted defendant of misdemeanor DUII as a lesser-included offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At sentencing, defendant moved to prohibit the use of the 2007 Georgia DUII conviction to permanently revoke his driving privileges under ORS 809.235(1)(b). Defendant argued that the court's determination that the Georgia conviction was obtained in violation of Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution and the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution meant that the Georgia conviction was invalid as a matter of Oregon law and could not be used for any purpose. The trial court disagreed and imposed a permanent revocation of defendant's driving privileges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant appealed, arguing that Article I, section 11, and the Sixth Amendment both prohibited the use of uncounseled prior convictions to impose a less favorable disposition in a later proceeding. The Court of Appeals affirmed without issuing a written opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On review, defendant argues that the trial court's use of the prior uncounseled DUII conviction to permanently revoke his driving privileges as part of his criminal sentence violated his right to counsel under Article I, section 11, and the Sixth Amendment. For the reasons stated below, we decide only the Sixth Amendment issue, and we begin with that analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Sixth Amendment provides that, \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall * * * have the Assistance of Counsel for his [defense].\" The Sixth Amendment requires that a defendant in a criminal prosecution have the benefit of counsel or that the defendant validly waive counsel.\n   <em>\n    Gideon v.

The Court held that an uncounseled prior felony conviction\n   could be used to support the defendant's misdemeanor conviction for violating the prohibition on felons possessing firearms, when he was not sentenced to any incarceration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777878\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/55/#p65\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777878\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/55/#p65\">\n    at 65-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777878\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/55/#p65\">\n    100 S.Ct. 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court determined that an uncounseled prior conviction could be used to enforce an \"essentially civil disability through a criminal sanction,\" because such a use would not \" 'support guilt or enhance punishment.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777878\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/55/#p65\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777878\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/55/#p65\">\n    at 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777878\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/55/#p65\">\n    100 S.Ct. 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Burgett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335442\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/109/#p115\">\n    389 U.S. at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335442\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/109/#p115\">\n    88 S.Ct. 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Thus, whether the Sixth Amendment prohibits the use of defendant's uncounseled Georgia conviction to support the\n   permanent revocation of defendant's driving privileges under ORS 809.235 boils down to whether the revocation of driving privileges is essentially a \"civil disability\" as in\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   , which the state urges, or a punishment enhancement as in\n   <em>\n    Burgett\n   </em>\n   , which defendant urges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Supreme Court, however, has not stated a test to draw the line between civil disability and punishment enhancement for purposes of determining whether an uncounseled conviction can be used to impose a particular consequence. The Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   set out the distinction between civil disabilities and criminal penalties, but gave little indication as to how to differentiate between the two, aside from the conclusory statement that enforcement of a civil disability does not \"support guilt or enhance punishment.\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777878\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/55/#p65\">\n    445 U.S. at 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777878\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/55/#p65\">\n    100 S.Ct. 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Burgett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335442\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/109/#p115\">\n    389 U.S. at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335442\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/109/#p115\">\n    88 S.Ct. 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Therefore, to make that determination in this case, we look beyond Sixth Amendment right-to-counsel jurisprudence to see how that distinction plays out in other contexts. The Double Jeopardy Clause and\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause are particularly useful because they require the same fundamental inquiry as the Sixth Amendment issue at hand: whether a particular consequence is a punishment. The Double Jeopardy Clause requires a determination as to whether a particular consequence is a criminal punishment because it prohibits punishing a person twice for the same offense; however, imposing a punitive sanction and a civil sanction for the same offense is permitted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Helvering v. Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141190\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/303/391/#p399\">\n    303 U.S. 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 399-400,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141190\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/303/391/#p399\">\n    58 S.Ct. 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141190\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/303/391/#p399\">\n    82 L.Ed. 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1938) (stating rule).

First, we look to legislative intent to determine if the driving privilege revocation was intended to be a punitive or civil sanction. If we determine that the legislature intended a civil sanction, then we look to whether the effect of the revocation is nonetheless so punitive as to negate that intent, and, in doing that, we consider the relevant\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Martinez\n   </em>\n   factors. Ultimately, we conclude that the legislature intended the permanent driving privilege revocation to be a civil, remedial sanction, aimed at safeguarding public safety. We further conclude that the effect of the revocation does not negate that remedial purpose and that consideration of the relevant\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Martinez\n   </em>\n   factors supports that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We first review the text, context, and legislative history of ORS 809.235 to determine the legislative intent behind the statute. The trial court ordered the revocation of defendant's driving privileges under ORS 809.235(1)(b), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"The court shall order that a person's driving privileges be permanently revoked if the person is convicted of felony driving while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 813.010 or if the person is convicted for a third or subsequent time of any of the following offenses in any combination:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"(A) Driving while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \"(i) ORS 813.010 ; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"(ii) The statutory counterpart to ORS 813.010 in another jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"(B) A driving under the influence of intoxicants offense in another jurisdiction that involved the impaired driving of a vehicle due to the use of intoxicating liquor, cannabis, a controlled substance, an inhalant or any combination thereof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"(C) A driving offense in another jurisdiction that involved operating a vehicle while having a blood alcohol content above that jurisdiction's permissible blood alcohol content.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On its face, the text of ORS 809.235(1)(b) does not indicate the legislative purpose of the revocation of driving privileges. But in the context of other provisions of the statute, the rationale behind the revocation provision appears to have been to promote public safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Under ORS 809.235(2)(a), after 10 years, a person who has had driving privileges revoked may petition the court \"for an order restoring the person's driving privileges.\" And under ORS 809.235(4), the court \"shall order a petitioner's driving privileges restored\" if\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the petitioner:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"(a) Is rehabilitated;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \"(b) Does not pose a threat to the safety of the public; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"(c) If the sentence for the crime for which the petitioner's driving privileges were revoked required the petitioner to complete an alcohol or drug treatment program, has completed an alcohol or drug treatment program in a facility approved by the Director of the Oregon Health Authority or a similar program in another jurisdiction.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Thus, the restoration procedure permits a person to prove that he or she is \"rehabilitated\" and no longer \"a threat to the safety of the public,\" thereby justifying restoration of driving privileges. That required showing of a petitioner seeking restoration of driving privileges indicates that the legislature's primary concern in mandating the driving privilege revocation was to promote public safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Legislative history confirms that the legislature's intention was to protect the public from repeat impaired\n   drivers. The permanent driving privilege revocation in ORS 809.235 originated in 2001 with Senate Bill (SB) 492. That bill introduced the permanent driving privilege revocation for any defendant convicted of a felony DUII. Or. Laws 2001, ch. 786, \u00a7 1. Senator Peter Courtney,\n   who introduced the bill, explained to the Senate Committee on Judiciary that the bill was necessary to send a message to people with serious drinking problems.

Peter Courtney), http://records.sos.state.or.us/ORSOSWebDrawer/Record/4160644# (accessed June 28, 2018). Senator Verne Duncan added that the bill would help \"get 'em off the road.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48.38 (comment of Sen. Verne Duncan). Senator Courtney again testified before the House Committee on Rules, Redistricting and Public Affairs, saying that \"the point [is] this: we are not going to wait for a habitual drunk driver to kill or injure before revoking their license to drive. *** This bill makes sure they don't get behind the wheel of a car.\" Audio Recording, House Committee on Rules, Redistricting and Public Affairs, SB 492, June 21, 2001, at 2:13.25 (statement of Sen.

Those statements all point to a public safety rationale: preventing people who habitually drive while intoxicated from killing or injuring other people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"In 2003, the legislature amended ORS 809.235 to require permanent revocation of a person's driver's license 'if the person is convicted of misdemeanor driving while under the influence of intoxicants under ORS 813.010 for a third time.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Both the House and Senate heard testimony from members of Crime Victims United, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and Parents of Murdered Children, who gave statistics about the dangers of driving while intoxicated.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Audio Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, HB 2885, Apr. 3, 2003, at 1:53.10 (statement of Anne Pratt), http://oregon.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=30&amp;clip_id=11433 (accessed June 28, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   And during the floor debate on HB 2885, Senator Joan Dukes invoked public safety. She stated that she supported HB 2885 because it was an incremental improvement that was necessary because \"we have given people far too many opportunities to kill and maim people. *** [T]his bill is an improvement, but at this rate, we're gonna have a lot more deaths from drunk drivers that we could have stopped if we would simply have the guts to strengthen these laws.\" Audio Recording, Senate Chamber, HB 2885, May 21, 2003, at 1:00.50 (statement of Sen.

Hart, Jr.,\n   <em>\n    The Aims of the Criminal Law\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20Law%20%26%20Contemp.%20Probs.%20401\">\n    23 Law &amp; Contemp Probs 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404 (1958) (\"What distinguishes a criminal from a civil sanction * * * is the judgment of community condemnation which accompanies and justifies its imposition.\"). A few remarks in the legislative history could suggest that part of the rationale for the permanent driving privilege revocation was to punish drunk drivers. However, punishment does not seem to have been the legislature's primary motivation. As described above, the vast majority of the testimony on SB\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   492 in 2001 and on HB\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   2885 in 2003 focused on the necessity of permanently revoking driving privileges for people who repeatedly drive under the influence of intoxicants, in order to protect public safety. In short, the legislative history strongly indicates that the legislature's purpose in imposing the permanent driving privilege revocation was remedial, not punitive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We next consider the effect of the permanent driving privilege revocation and weigh that effect against the legislature's remedial purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/#p89\">\n    538 U.S. at 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/#p89\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the effect of the consequence does not outweigh the public safety purpose that appears from ORS 809.235 as a whole and from the legislative history of the revocation sanction that the statute contains. There is no doubt that, as defendant argues, the revocation of a person's driving privileges can have a huge impact on that person's life and ability to work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bell v. Burson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11734271\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/402/535/#p539\">\n    402 U.S. 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 539,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11734271\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/402/535/#p539\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11734271\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/402/535/#p539\">\n    29 L.Ed.2d 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971) (\"Once licenses are issued *** their continued possession may become essential in the pursuit of a livelihood.\"). However, the statute appropriately balances that effect against the legislature's remedial purpose. First, because permanent revocation of driving privileges is not imposed after only one or even two DUII convictions, it appears that instead of seeking retribution, as defendant suggests, the legislature sought to balance the hardship of a driving privilege revocation against the need to reduce the risk of death and injury by taking repeat DUII offenders off Oregon roads and highways. Second, ORS 809.235 (2)(a) allows a person whose driving privileges have been permanently revoked to petition for an order restoring driving privileges after 10 years. Even a \"permanent\" revocation is not entirely permanent if the court determines that a particular person has successfully effected long-term behavioral changes and can once again be allowed driving privileges without posing a significant danger to society. ORS 809.235(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Once a court determines that the legislature intended the revocation to be remedial, a defendant faces a difficult burden. The United States Supreme Court has stated that \" 'only the clearest proof' \" can override the legislature's remedial intent, thereby reforming the sanction from a\n   civil disability into a criminal penalty.\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787659\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/242/#p249\">\n    448 U.S. at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787659\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/242/#p249\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Flemming v.

It is quite possible that the threat of a permanent driving privilege revocation serves a deterrent purpose-indeed, for some defendants, such a revocation may be more onerous than a short jail stay. However, the Supreme Court has noted that deterrence \"may serve civil as well as criminal goals.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

A third conviction for DUII does not require a finding of a particular\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   , so this factor seems to cut toward the revocation being a civil disability. The other factor is whether the behavior to which the consequence applies\n   is already a crime, which arguably cuts in defendant's favor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1765344\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/372/144/#p168\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, as discussed above, the fact that the revocation is associated with a criminal judgment is not conclusive, and many federal courts applying\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Martinez\n   </em>\n   have downplayed that factor.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Herbert v.

As discussed earlier, the legislature's purpose in enacting ORS 809.235(1)(b) was public safety, not punishment. Moreover, we have determined that the permanent driving privilege revocation is not excessive in relation to that remedial purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Having applied the\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Martinez\n   </em>\n   factors, we do not find sufficient proof that the revocation is punitive to outweigh the legislature's remedial purpose in enacting ORS 809.235(1)(b). Accordingly, we conclude that the Sixth Amendment is not violated by using defendant's uncounseled Georgia conviction for DUII as a predicate for revocation of his driving privileges, because the revocation of his driving privileges is a civil disability, not an enhancement of punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Other state and federal courts have come to the same conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Herbert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11680437\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/160/1131/#p1138\">\n    160 F.3d 1131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a license suspension is not a punishment for Double Jeopardy purposes);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Article I, section 11, provides, in part: \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right * * * to be heard by himself and counsel * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant's overarching argument is that barring the state's use of an uncounseled prior conviction to enhance sentencing consequences vindicates his individual right to counsel under Article I, section 11. More specifically, defendant asserts two primary arguments under Article I, section 11. First, defendant contends that the sentencing court's permanent revocation of his driving privileges is\n   \"inseparable from the criminal conviction, regardless of any non-criminal purpose or effect\" of the sanction, and, thus, that it is a direct, additional consequence of his uncounseled criminal conviction that is prohibited under Article I, section 11. In effect, defendant urges a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule based on whether the court (as opposed to an administrative agency) issues the sanction. Second, he argues, even standing alone, the permanent revocation of his driving privileges constitutes a criminal, punitive sanction, and Article I, section 11, prohibits using his uncounseled Georgia conviction to impose such a sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   To a large extent, defendant's arguments are based on his view that the scope of the right to counsel under Article I, section 11, is broader than that afforded under the Sixth Amendment. But, as we next explain, defendant does not sufficiently develop an argument supporting that underlying premise for us to consider the merits of his Article I, section 11, arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   To determine the meaning of a provision of the original Oregon Constitution, this court in\n   <em>\n    Priest v. Pearce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192812\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/411/#p415\">\n    314 Or. 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 415-16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192812\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/411/#p415\">\n    840 P.2d 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992), examined the text of the provision in context, the historical circumstances leading to the adoption of the provision, and the case law construing it. But defendant offers no textual or historical analysis of Article I, section 11, to support his argument that using the uncounseled Georgia conviction as part of the calculus to revoke his driving privileges violates Article I, section 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Defendant instead relies heavily on a single paragraph from this court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Standerfer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2185504\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/297/725/\">\n    297 Or. at 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2185504\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/297/725/\">\n    688 P.2d 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to contend that Article I, section 11, applies \"more broadly\" than the Sixth Amendment.
