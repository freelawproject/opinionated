The only eyewitness to the incident was Andrea Sattler. Polak, Sattler, and Hofferber were all recently acquainted. Sattler occasionally worked in the trailer park cleaning vacant trailers. Hofferber lived in the park. Sattler and Hofferber were involved in an intimate relationship. Polak also pursued a romantic relationship with Sattler. Polak testified that Hofferber had \"a reputation for being a fighter and that he was violent.\" On one occasion, Hofferber poured a bottle of bleach out in front of Polak and Sattler. Polak testified Hofferber informed Polak that he poured the bleach out in preparation of killing Polak. Sattler described it as a \"scare tactic\" and testified Hofferber told her later, \"that's what you do before you kill somebody so that the blood doesn't\n   soak into the fibers of the wood.\" Sattler testified that when she told Polak that Hofferber criticized her relationship with Polak, Polak responded that he would not fight Hofferber but would shoot him instead. On April 27, 2015, Sattler brokered a car sale between Polak and Sattler's father-in-law. That evening, Sattler told Polak she had money left over from the sale to return to him, and they agreed to meet at the trailer park. In the early morning hours, Polak's friend drove him to the trailer park to collect the money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 At trial, Polak testified that as he walked toward the trailer Sattler had been cleaning, he saw Sattler and believed she was high on methamphetamine. Polak testified he and Sattler had previously gotten high on methamphetamine together. Polak testified he then heard someone say, \"Hey, motherfucker,\" and looked up to see Hofferber walking towards him. Polak testified Hofferber also appeared to be high on methamphetamine and angry. Polak testified that he asked Hofferber what his problem was, and Hofferber responded, \"you're my problem,\" and \"you're going to bleed, bitch.\" Polak testified that Hofferber brandished a rod with a spike on the end of it in his right hand (called a \"catspaw\"), causing Polak to step backward. Polak testified he told Hofferber, \"don't,\" before pulling out his .45 caliber handgun. In response to the drawn weapon, Polak testified that Hofferber dared Polak to \"go ahead\" and kept coming toward Polak. Polak shot Hofferber, then he turned and ran. Polak got in his friend's car, telling him to leave, and the two drove off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Sattler testified to a slightly different version of events. The night of the shooting, Sattler was with Hofferber inside the abandoned trailer that she was employed to clean. When Polak arrived, Sattler testified that he appeared angry and was asking about his money. Sattler testified that Polak saw Hofferber and asked, \"What's your problem, bro?\" Hofferber replied, \"You're my problem, bro.\" Sattler stated that Hofferber took out a catspaw, held it out to Polak, and said, \"Here. You are going to need this.\" She testified Hofferber did not step towards Polak, who was standing about six feet away. Sattler testified Polak backed up two steps, pulled out a handgun, and fired one shot into Hofferber's chest. Sattler testified Hofferber then grabbed his chest, fell backwards, and said, \"I can't believe you did that, man.\" Sattler testified she then fled to a friend's trailer but returned briefly to grab her purse. Sattler's recollections regarding the details of the incident changed depending on whom she told. Some of these details included the distance between Polak and Hofferber when he fired the gun, the words exchanged by Polak and Hofferber, how Hofferber was\n   holding the catspaw, and whether Hofferber stepped toward Polak.\n   Sattler also testified that she did not clearly recall a lot of the details.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 After the incident, Officer Jay Stovall of the Billings Police Department responded to a 911 call that a man had been shot at the trailer park on Lake Elmo Drive. Stovall observed that Hofferber was already deceased when he arrived. Stovall recovered a single .45 caliber shell casing in the street near the trailer. When police officers arrested Polak, Polak attempted to flee by ramming his truck into a patrol car and reversing into a federal marshal's vehicle. He was ultimately apprehended. Police officers discovered a loaded 9mm handgun in the vehicle Polak was driving. Police never located the .45 caliber handgun used to kill Hofferber. Polak admitted to shooting Hofferber but claimed he was acting in self-defense. The State charged Polak with (1) deliberate homicide in violation of \u00a7 45-5-102(1)(a), MCA ; (2) a weapons enhancement, \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA ; (3) tampering with or fabricating physical evidence in violation of \u00a7 45-7-207(1)(a), MCA ; and (4) criminal endangerment in violation of \u00a7 45-5-207(1), MCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Polak moved to dismiss the tampering charge for lack of probable cause. On September 2, 2015, the District Court denied Polak's motion, determining there was probable cause to charge Polak with tampering with evidence. The District Court opined that the proper means for Polak to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence was after it had been presented to the trier of fact. At trial, Polak took the stand in his defense. During direct and cross-examination, no one questioned Polak as to the location of the .45 caliber handgun used in the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 During voir dire, prospective juror John Wittman admitted he knew Hofferber and that Hofferber was a \"distant relative.\" Defense counsel did not inquire further into Wittman and Hofferber's relationship, did not move for automatic dismissal of Wittman for cause, and did not use any peremptory challenges on Wittman. Wittman sat on the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 Sattler initially hid from police in a friend's trailer and asked friends to lie about her whereabouts. Later, Sattler contacted law enforcement and was interviewed. Police also found a glass pipe with methamphetamine residue resting on top of Sattler's cleaning sponge inside the trailer where she and Hofferber had been. A text message conversation from Sattler's phone the night of the shooting showed a text from Sattler inviting a friend to \"come smoke\" with her. When\n   questioned at trial, Sattler denied using methamphetamine the night of the incident. Toxicology reports showed that Hofferber had ingested methamphetamine the night of his death in an amount that exceeded the average overdose level. The State moved in limine to prevent Polak from offering testimony or other evidence to impeach Sattler with the presence of the methamphetamine pipe. Polak responded that the evidence and questions were relevant to his defense and argued the State's motion should be denied. Following an in-camera discussion, the District Court agreed with the State and disallowed the evidence and Polak's proposed line of questioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Polak proceeded under a self-defense \"justifiable use of force\" (\"JUOF\") theory. After both parties presented their case-in-chief, the State proposed a \"first-aggressor\" jury instruction in response to Polak's claim of JUOF. Polak objected that there was no evidence to support such an instruction. The District Court disagreed and gave the instruction, which was patterned off Montana's model criminal jury instructions (\"MCJI\") No. 3-104. During closing arguments, the State directed the jury multiple times to \"focus on the use of force by aggressor\" and to \"[p]ay attention to the initial aggressor instruction.\" The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts: deliberate homicide with a weapons enhancement, tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, and criminal endangerment. On March 1, 2016, the District Court sentenced Polak to sixty years for deliberate homicide, ten years consecutive for weapon enhancement, ten years consecutive for criminal endangerment, and ten\n   years to run concurrent for tampering with evidence; in total, an eighty-year prison sentence. Polak appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 We review for abuse of discretion a district court's grant or denial of motions to admit or exclude evidence, including motions in limine.\n   <em>\n    Hulse v.

The District Court agreed with the State, reasoning, \"[y]ou cannot merely assume that they were [under the influence] or that their behavior was adversely affected ....\" Thus, the District Court concluded, Polak \"failed to make a requisite showing under\n   <em>\n    Gleim\n   </em>\n   that the meth pipe\" in the trailer was sufficient to show Sattler was intoxicated at the time of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620 The State argues that Polak failed to establish a sufficient connection between the methamphetamine pipe and any alleged impairment of Sattler's memory of the events to establish the pipe's relevance. The State further argues that the only evidence in the record of Sattler's alleged intoxication was Polak's self-serving statement that he believed Sattler was under the influence of methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b621 Polak counters that in disallowing the evidence and the proposed line of questioning, the District Court abused its discretion and erroneously deprived the jury of important impeachment evidence. Sattler's and Polak's testimonies conflicted in ways that were potentially decisive as to whether Polak justifiably used force against Hofferber. Polak argues the methamphetamine pipe found on Sattler's cleaning sponge in the trailer near where the shooting occurred was relevant to whether Sattler was high that night and admissible for two purposes: (1) challenging the accuracy of her perceptions and memories of the incident, rendering her an unreliable witness, and (2) contradicting her claim she was not high that night, rendering her a liar and an untrustworthy witness. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b622 Sattler's testimony served as the crux of the State's case. Polak's proposed line of questioning was relevant to Sattler's accuracy of her perception the night of the shooting and relevant to whether the jury would believe Sattler's or Polak's version of events.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sorenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2557774\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/190/155/#p166\">\n    190 Mont. at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2557774\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/190/155/#p166\">\n    619 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1191 ;\n   <em>\n    Gleim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4372264\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/17/17/#p30\">\n    17 Mont. at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20P.%20998\">\n    41 P. at 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, there was ample evidence that tended to lay the foundation that Sattler was potentially under the influence of methamphetamine at the\n   time of the shooting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matz\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 38. Polak testified he had previously seen Sattler high on methamphetamine and thought she was high the night of the shooting; Sattler was in the presence of, and intimately involved with, someone (Hofferber) high on methamphetamine; phone records show Sattler invited a friend to \"come smoke\" shortly before the shooting; and a glass methamphetamine pipe was found on top of her sponge in the trailer that she was cleaning and staying in. Second, the pathologist testified that people high on methamphetamine suffer from hallucinations and impaired perceptions, diminishing the accuracy of memories. The jury was entitled to consider facts bearing on Sattler's ability to perceive and remember the shooting accurately.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sorenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2557774\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/190/155/#p166\">\n    190 Mont. at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2557774\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/190/155/#p166\">\n    619 P.2d at 1191-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b623 The evidence was also relevant to impeaching Sattler's credibility and trustworthiness if she was able to be cross-examined as to whether she used methamphetamine the night of the shooting. On direct examination, the State adduced testimony from Sattler claiming she was not high on methamphetamine during the incident, and that her text message inviting a friend to \"come smoke with me\" minutes before the incident did not reference smoking methamphetamine. The State opened the door to Polak using the methamphetamine pipe for impeachment through contradiction. The evidence concerning the glass pipe was relevant, and the jury should have been able to hear and consider Polak's questions concerning it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M. R. Evid. 611(b)(1), 402.
