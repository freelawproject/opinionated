In 2003, Fleetwood obtained an insurance policy from Wilshire Insurance Company meant to cover all of Espenschied's vehicles and trailers; the list of insured vehicles was based on a list of equipment provided by Espenschied. However, Fleetwood gave Wilshire an incorrect list not containing all the equipment Espenschied had listed, resulting in Espenschied's believing that certain equipment was covered by the insurance policy when, in reality, it was not. One of the trailers that Espenschied believed to be covered, but that was not on the policy schedule, was involved in a deadly accident, resulting in litigation. Wilshire refused to defend Espenschied in the litigation, causing Espenschied to incur attorney fees and a consent judgment; Espenschied sued Fleetwood and Wilshire under various theories of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b62 The district court concluded that Espenschied had suffered no damages and granted summary judgment to Fleetwood. Additionally, the district court granted summary judgment to Wilshire, finding that the trailer was not on Wilshire's insurance policy and Fleetwood was not Wilshire's agent. Additionally, the district court ruled that Wilshire could have no vicarious liability because Fleetwood had no liability. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b63 Espenschied was an interstate trucking company established in 1982.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For a majority of its existence, Espenschied used Fleetwood to procure insurance from a variety of insurers. In December 2003, Fleetwood procured a commercial lines insurance policy from Wilshire to cover Espenschied's vehicles. The policy was a scheduled vehicle policy, meaning that a vehicle must be listed on the policy to be covered. Espenschied intended to have all of its vehicles covered by the policy. Wilshire listed the insured vehicles on the policy based on a list provided by Fleetwood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b64 On January 1, 2005, Espenschied sold or leased almost all of its assets to DATS Trucking, Inc. The leased assets consisted of ninety-three trailers. As part of the lease agreement, DATS agreed to indemnify Espenschied from and against all claims, liability, or expenses (including attorney fees) relating to the trailers. Espenschied did not cancel its insurance on the trailers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b65 On January 30, 2005, one of the trailers Espenschied leased to DATS killed Kimball Herrod in an accident. Mr. Herrod's family brought a wrongful death action against Espenschied and DATS. Espenschied submitted a claim to Wilshire for coverage. Although the trailer was on the list of equipment that needed to be insured that Espenschied had provided to Fleetwood, the trailer was not listed on the schedule for the policy Wilshire issued. After determining that the trailer involved in the accident was not covered by the policy, Wilshire denied the claim. Espenschied then made a claim for coverage to Fleetwood for failing to procure insurance, which Fleetwood also denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b66 Espenschied defended itself in the wrongful death suit. Ultimately, Espenschied entered into a settlement agreement with the Herrods for $1.1 million; that settlement was reduced to a judgment. By the time Espenschied entered into the settlement agreement, it was no longer doing business, had formally dissolved, and had no assets other than potential claims against third parties. As part of\n   the settlement agreement, Espenschied assigned the Herrods any claim it had against DATS (except for indemnification for attorney fees) and agreed to pursue claims against Fleetwood and Wilshire. Espenschied was not required to pay any attorney fees up front for its lawsuit against Fleetwood and Wilshire. Instead, any recovery from claims against Fleetwood and Wilshire would first be used to pay the attorney fees and costs, then the settlement amount, and any remainder would go to Espenschied. In return, the Herrods agreed that they would not pursue claims against the principles of Espenschied and would withhold collection against Espenschied's assets until the claims against Fleetwood and Wilshire were fully resolved. Additionally, Espenschied agreed to \"fully pursue and prosecute all claims it may have\" against Fleetwood or Wilshire and to hire the Herrods' attorney from the wrongful death suit to pursue those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b67 In defending the wrongful death suit, Espenschied incurred approximately $93,500 in attorney fees and costs. Based on the indemnity agreement, DATS paid Espenschied $90,000 for the attorney fees. Espenschied has not paid any money toward the settlement agreement. Additionally, at oral argument in this matter, Espenschied's attorney conceded that the Herrods will never be able to collect against Espenschied unless Espenschied recovers in this case because Espenschied is a defunct corporation with no assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 Fleetwood and Wilshire moved for summary judgment. The district court concluded that Fleetwood was, \"at most, ... a contract breacher [and] .... would only be obligated to pay what [Espenschied] actually had to pay. ... [which was] zero dollars.\" Because the district court determined that Espenschied had suffered no actual damages, it granted Fleetwood's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 The district court also granted Wilshire's motion for summary judgment. Relevant to this appeal, the district court concluded that Fleetwood was not acting as Wilshire's agent, and therefore Wilshire would not be liable for Fleetwood failing to procure insurance for the trailer. Alternatively, the district court concluded that because Fleetwood had no liability, Wilshire could have no vicarious liability for Fleetwood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 Espenschied appealed these decisions. We have jurisdiction pursuant to Utah Code section 78A-3-102(3)(j).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b611 A party is entitled to \"summary judgment if the moving party shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" UTAH R.

The district court granted Fleetwood's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that Espenschied was unable to raise a dispute of material fact regarding damages. We agree with the district court and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b613 The district court granted summary judgment to Wilshire on the four claims against Wilshire and on the theory of vicarious liability. On appeal, Espenschied only challenges the vicarious liability determination, which was based on two alternative grounds: 1) there was no material dispute of fact that Fleetwood was Wilshire's agent and 2) Fleetwood had no liability, and therefore Wilshire could have no vicarious liability. We conclude that Espenschied failed to adequately attack the district court's decision on the vicarious liability ground and therefore affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I.

This would leave Espenschied with approximately $3,400 in damages from the attorney fees. Ordinarily, this would cause us to reverse summary judgment as Espenschied has raised a dispute of material fact to show that it has suffered compensable harm. However, at oral arguments in this matter, Espenschied's counsel stated that Espenschied would be uninterested in pursuing the case against Fleetwood for $3,400. Because, as we discuss below, Espenschied has not raised another dispute of material fact that would show any other compensable harm, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment to Fleetwood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    B. The Settlement Agreement and Consent Judgment Do Not Constitute Actual Damages in This Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b621 Espenschied contends that the settlement agreement with the Herrods and the corresponding consent judgment constitute actual harm in this case even though Espenschied has no assets and has never had to pay any money to the Herrods. In support of its position, Espenschied makes two arguments. First, Espenschied argues that the policy considerations we announced in\n   <em>\n    Ammerman v. Farmers Insurance Exchange\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8867466\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah-2d/22/187/\">\n    22 Utah 2d 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8867466\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah-2d/22/187/\">\n    450 P.2d 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Utah 1969) (\n   <em>\n    Ammerman II\n   </em>\n   ), should be extended to insurance agents and brokers. Second, Espenschied claims that it suffered damages because it lost part of its claims against Fleetwood and Wilshire as part of the settlement agreement. We disagree and affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b622 By the time Espenschied entered into the settlement agreement with the Herrods, Espenschied was a defunct corporation with no assets except for potential claims against third parties. Espenschied has never paid any money to the Herrods. And, at oral arguments, Espenschied's counsel conceded that he could not hypothesize a scenario where the Herrods would ever be able to collect against Espenschied. However, Espenschied argues that this should not matter because the policy considerations in\n   <em>\n    Ammerman II\n   </em>\n   should extend to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b623 In\n   <em>\n    Ammerman II\n   </em>\n   , we held that collection from an insured by a \"judgment creditor was not a prerequisite to a cause of action against the insurer for the excess judgment.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8867466\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah-2d/22/187/\">\n    450 P.2d at 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We found three sound reasons to justify the adoption of this view: 1) it \"prevents an insurer from benefiting from the impecuniousness of an insured who has a meritorious claim;\" 2) it \"negates the possibility that the insurer would be ... less responsive to its trust duties where the insured is [un]able to pay the excess judgment\" because \"at worst, it would only be liable for the amount specified by the policy,\" which would \"impair the usefulness of insurance for the poor [person];\" and 3) it \"recognizes that the fact of entry of the judgment itself against the insured constitutes a real damage to him because of the potential harm to his credit rating.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8867466\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah-2d/22/187/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (first alteration in original) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b624 These policy considerations make sense in the context of the cause of action at issue: breach of the insurer's fiduciary duty to defend the insured in the third-party context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ammerman v.

In\n   <em>\n    Ammerman I\n   </em>\n   , we recognized that an insurer has a fiduciary duty to \"act in good faith and be as zealous in protecting the interests of its insured as it would in looking after its own.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 579 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b625 Espenschied argues that an insurance agent or broker should be treated like an insured. But we have declined to extend an insurer's fiduciary duty to first-party insurance claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beck v. Farmers Ins.

And Espenschied has not convinced us that the policy considerations behind recovery for breach of an insurer's fiduciary duty to defend should extend to a breach of contract or duty to procure insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b626 These policy considerations do not all translate to insurance agents and brokers. A contract breacher is required \"to compensate the nonbreaching party for actual injury sustained.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Trans-Western Petroleum, Inc. v.

An insurance agent or broker does not have the same perverse incentive to breach its contract or duty to procure insurance. The agent's breach would occur when there is significant financial downside (a claim for breach of contract or negligence) with little to no financial upside (the agent must only find an insurer willing to cover the risks).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b628 However, entry of the judgment itself may constitute real harm for which an insurance agent or broker may be held liable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steele v.

But this real damage does not exist in a vacuum, and we will not presume it exists. Instead, it is up to the plaintiff to establish that it has suffered harm that can be monetized, such as harm to its credit rating or reputation, loss of business opportunities, or even being forced into bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b629 An insurance agent or broker is not an insurer who has breached its fiduciary duty to defend. And we do not believe that the policy considerations that apply to an insurer's breach of its duty also apply wholesale to an insurance agent or broker. Therefore, we refuse to extend\n   <em>\n    Ammerman II\n   </em>\n   outside of the context of an insurer's breach of its fiduciary duty to defend. However, we do not believe that it is impossible to monetize an unexecuted judgment, and if Espenschied is able to show a dispute of material fact of such harm, summary judgment would be inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b630 Because Espenschied has never and will never pay money to the Herrods, the only theory of harm Espenschied puts before us (aside from the attorney fees and costs from the wrongful death suit, discussed above) is that it lost part of its claims against Fleetwood and Wilshire because it would be required to use any judgment against Fleetwood or Wilshire to pay the Herrods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b631 Espenschied has failed to convince us that its partial loss of claims against Fleetwood or Wilshire would constitute actual injury. To this day, Espenschied has not paid any money to the Herrods. If Espenschied does not recover against Fleetwood or Wilshire based on the settlement agreement and consent judgment, Espenschied will not suffer\n   any actual injury because it will never have any assets to pay the Herrods. However, if Espenschied does recover against Fleetwood or Wilshire based on the settlement agreement and consent judgment, Espenschied would then be obligated to pay the money to the Herrods and would suffer an actual injury. We decline to conclude that a party has suffered an actual injury if their injury would only exist if they were successful in the lawsuit to recover for that injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b632 Because Espenschied has failed to show a material dispute of fact of damages, other than the potential $3,400 in attorney fees and costs it stipulated was not worth pursuing alone, we affirm summary judgment for Fleetwood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   II. WILSHIRE WAS ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT BECAUSE ESPENSCHIED HAS NOT SHOWN IT CAN RECOVER UNDER VICARIOUS LIABILITY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b633 The district court granted summary judgment for Wilshire on Espenschied's four causes of action and separately on the theory of vicarious liability. On appeal, Espenschied only attacks the district court's decision to grant summary judgment to Wilshire based on vicarious liability. The district court granted summary judgment on this theory for two alternative reasons: 1) there was no dispute of material facts that could show Fleetwood was Wilshire's agent and 2) because Fleetwood has no liability, Wilshire cannot have vicarious liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b634 In its brief, Espenschied recognizes that these were alternative grounds for the district court's decision. Before us, Espenschied makes three arguments for why the district court erred: 1) there was a dispute of material fact of agency, 2) Wilshire should be held vicariously liable for Fleetwood's breach of its duty to procure insurance, and 3) Wilshire is bound by Espenschied's reasonable reliance on Fleetwood's representations that the policy would cover the trailer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b635 We do not need to reach whether there was a dispute of material fact of agency because we find Espenschied's two other arguments insufficient. As set forth above,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b632, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment to Fleetwood. Espenschied has not provided any argument that Wilshire should be vicariously liable for Fleetwood's breach of contract or duty to procure insurance if Fleetwood itself is not liable. Nor has Espenschied argued that a different damages analysis should apply to Wilshire than the one that applies to Fleetwood. Therefore, we conclude that Espenschied cannot be successful under a theory of vicarious liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b636 Espenschied is similarly unable to prevail on its reasonable reliance argument. \"An insurance company may be vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of its agent, or it may directly incur tort liability by imputation of the agent's knowledge.\"\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

It is unclear whether Espenschied's argument sounds in vicarious liability or direct liability. To the extent that Espenschied's reasonable reliance argument is grounded in vicarious liability, it must fail because Espenschied loses on the vicarious liability ground.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b635.
