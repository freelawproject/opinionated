A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b502-15\">This appeal raises important issues concerning the relationship between the sentencing provisions of the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice (Code), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-1 <em>et seq., </em>and convictions for violations of the Controlled Dangerous Substances Act <em>(Title </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>24), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-1 <em>et seq. </em>The specific question here raised is whether a first offender convicted of a <em>Title </em>24 offense is entitled to the presumptive noncustodial sentence provided for by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1 e for first offenders convicted of an offense other than a crime of the first or second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The factual context in which the issue is posed is relatively simple and undisputed. In December 1979 defendant Marvin H. Sobel, who had not been previously convicted of crime, sold about 12 grams of marijuana to an undercover agent. As a result of that sale a warrant authorizing a search of his wife\u2019s store was issued in January 1980. The ensuing search yielded a pound and three quarters of marijuana and a quantity of valium. Defendant was then charged in a four-count indictment with possession with intent to distribute and distribution of less than 25 grams of marijuana, and with possession and possession with intent to distribute of over 25 grams of marijuana and valium.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Pursuant to a plea negotiation, defendant pleaded guilty to distribution of the smaller quantity of marijuana and possession with intent to distribute of the larger quantity of marijuana. Both were violations of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-19(a)(l) and subject to a maximum prison term of five years. The State\u2019s undertaking was to move to dismiss the remaining two charges and to excise the reference to valium in the charge of possession with intent to distribute which was pleaded to. The only sentencing recommendation included in the plea agreement was a recommendation for the concurrency of any custodial terms imposed. The sentences which were imposed, from which defendant appeals, were concurrent terms of four years each.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Defendant first argues that he was entitled to the presumptive noncustodial sentence provided for by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1 e, which reads in full as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">The court shall deal with a person convicted of an offense other than a crime of the first or second degree, who has not previously been convicted of an offense, without imposing sentence of imprisonment unless, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history, character and condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>of the defendant, it is of the opinion that his imprisonment is necessary for the protection of the public under the criteria set forth in subsection a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Our analysis of the relevant provisions of the Code in light of the apparent legislative scheme and purpose respecting the relationship between the Code and <em>Title </em>24 persuades us that the sentencing subtitle of the Code is generally applicable to <em>Title </em>24 offenses. It is our conclusion that the only sentencing provisions of the Code which are inapplicable thereto are those provisions which are specifically and expressly applicable solely to degree-classified offenses and those provisions which prescribe specific terms of imprisonment. Since neither of these exceptions here obtain, we are satisfied that the presumptive noncustodial provision applies to <em>Title </em>24 offenses subject to the considerations and qualifications hereafter set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">In reaching this conclusion we start with the obvious proposition that a <em>Title </em>24 offense is not an offense defined by the Code but rather by another statute. The first constructional consequence of the non-Code status of <em>Title </em>24 offenses is the applicability of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-4 c, which first provides that offenses defined by statutes other than the Code are to be classified in accordance with the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-4 and, to the extent applicable, of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-1. That classification system on its first level is the designation by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-4a and b of both Code and non-Code offenses as crimes, disorderly persons offenses or petty disorderly persons offenses, the \u201ccrime\u201d designation reserved for those offenses subject to a term of imprisonment in excess of six months. <em>Title </em>24 offenses are obviously so classifiable and were intended to be so classified.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The second level of classification is provided for by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-1, applicable not to all offenses but only to crimes. Subsection a of that provision classifies crimes as being of the first, second, third, or fourth degree. It is clear, however, that crime-degree classification, in contradistinction to offense classification, was not intended to apply to <em>Title </em>24 offenses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>That is the explicit import of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-1 b, whose scheme is to provide for degree-classification of non-Code crimes but expressly excepting <em>Title </em>24 offenses. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-1 b provides in full as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a crime defined by any statute of this State other than this code and designated as a high misdemeanor shall constitute for the purpose of sentence a crime of the third degree. Except as provided in sections 2C:1-4c and 2C:1 5b and notwithstanding any other provision of law, a crime defined by any statute of this State other than this code and designated as a misdemeanor shall constitute for the purpose of sentence a crime of the fourth degree. The provisions of this subsection shall not, however, apply to the sentences authorized by the \u201cNew Jersey Controlled Dangerous Substances Act,\u201d P.L. 1970, c. 226 (C. 24:21-1 through 45), which shall be continued in effect. A sentence imposed upon violation of the \u201cNew Jersey Controlled Dangerous Substances Act\" shall be governed by this subtitle but shall be subject to the maximum sentence authorized for the relevant offense under said act, or if there is no specific penalty under that act, by imprisonment for not more than 3 years or a fine of not more than $1,000.00 or both, in the case of a misdemeanor or other indictable offenses, or by imprisonment for not more than 6 months or a fine of not more than $500.00 or both, in the case of a nonindictable offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Since the primary purpose of degree classification is to prescribe sentence limitations, the question before us is the extent to which the Code sentencing provisions are applicable, if at all, to non-Code crimes which are exempt from Code crime-degree classification, and more particularly, to <em>Title </em>24 offenses. Initial resort must again be made to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-4 c, which stipulates that except as otherwise provided by 2C:1-5 b and chapter 43 of the Code, sentencing for non-Code offenses shall be governed by the Code. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15 b provides in relevant part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">. . . The provisions of subtitle 3 [sentencing] are applicable to offenses defined by other statutes but the maximum penalties applicable to such offenses, if specifically provided in the statute defining such offenses, shall be as provided therein, rather than as provided in this code, except that if the non-code offense is a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of more than 18 months imprisonment, the provisions of section 2C:43-1b shall apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Clearly then, in respect of those <em>Title </em>24 offenses for which <em>Title </em>24 prescribes the maximum penalty, it is the express stipulation of this section that the Code sentencing provisions, except for those relating to length of sentence, apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>General applicability of the Code sentencing provisions to <em>Title </em>24 offenses is also expressly mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-1 b, above quoted. The initial undertaking of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-1 b is to classify non-Code high misdemeanors as third degree crimes and non-Code misdemeanors as fourth degree crimes for sentencing purposes. The very next sentence of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-1 b states that \u201cThe provisions of this subsection shall not, however, apply to the sentences authorized by the New Jersey Controlled Dangerous Substances Act. ...\u201d In the context of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-5 b and the preceding provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-1 b, the only rational interpretation of the above-quoted sentence is that the Legislature intended to exempt <em>Title </em>24 offenses from the Code\u2019s prescription of authorized imprisonment terms attendant upon Code crime-degree classification and thereby to preserve the terms of imprisonment prescribed by <em>Title </em>24 itself. This is indeed the view of one commentator who has noted that \u201cit was clear when the Code was first adopted that the Legislature did not want to start amending sentences which can be imposed under <em>Title </em>24 because of the relatively recent vintage of the amendment thereto.\u201d Stern, \u201cPreserving Jurisdiction Under the Code,\u201d 7 <em>Crim. Just. Q. </em>1, 2 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">But as that commentator further points out, the length of imprisonment terms is only one aspect of the sentencing process and procedure. The legislative intent to exempt that aspect from Code application did not extend to all aspects of sentencing. Thus, after excepting <em>Title </em>24 offenses from the sentence consequences of degree classification, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-1 b goes on to stipulate that \u201cA sentence imposed upon violation of the \u2018New Jersey Controlled Dangerous Substances Act\u2019 shall be governed by this subtitle but shall be subject to the maximum sentence authorized for the relevant offense under said act .... \u201d Finally, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-1 b prescribes the maximum length of sentences for those <em>Title </em>24 offenses where <em>Title </em>24 itself does not itself do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">It is, therefore, evident that it is only the length of sentence and other penalties prescribed by <em>Title </em>24 to which the Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>does not apply. Thus, all other Code sentencing provisions do apply to <em>Title </em>24, except those sentencing provisions applicable to a specific degree of crime. And <em>Title </em>24 offenses, as noted, are not crimes of any degree since they have not been so graded by the Code. See Stern, <em>op cit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">We do not perceive any legislative intent or consideration of public policy suggesting otherwise. To the contrary, such Code sentencing provisions as indeterminate sentences for young adult offenders <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-5), parole <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-9), place of imprisonment <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-10), presentence procedure <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-6), the consequences of multiple sentences <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5), and suspension of sentence and probation <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2045-1 to 4), clearly apply to <em>Title </em>24 offenses since their pre-Code analogues applied. Nor, for example, do we see any cogent reason for withholding from <em>Title </em>24 offenses the provisions of subsections a, b and c of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1 (sentencing criteria), or <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2044 \u2014 4 (definition of prior conviction).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">In view of the foregoing, we conclude that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2044 1 e is applicable to <em>Title </em>24 offenses. As heretofore pointed out, the availability of the presumptive noncustodial disposition is withheld from a first offender only is he is convicted of a crime of the first or second degree. Since <em>Title </em>24 offenses are ungraded, a <em>Title </em>24 conviction is a crime neither of the first, the second or any other degree. Thus, the provision applies not only literally but for all of the reasons heretofore stated. We further note that if the Legislature had intended generally to except <em>Title </em>24 offenses from the applicability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1 e, it could easily have done so explicitly. Its failure to have done so and its exclusion therefrom only of first and second degree crimes further suggests its intention that <em>Title </em>24 offenses be subject thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">We are, of course, aware that <em>Title </em>24 offenses vary in gravity and that some are subject to severe sentences. See, <em>e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-19(b)(l) authorizing a maximum of 12 years, and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-19(b)(2) authorizing a maximum of life imprisonment for crimes involving specific quantities of specific drugs. Thus, while the <em>Title </em>24 offenses are not graded, the Legislature has expressed its view as to the seriousness of various <em>Title </em>24 offenses by its penalty prescriptions. We further note that the noncustodial sentence authorized by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1 e, may be withheld where the \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense\u201d indicate to the sentencing judge that a custodial term is required for protection of the public. In our view, the legislative provision of a sentence for a <em>Title </em>24 offense which equals or exceeds the sentence it has prescribed for a first or second degree offense would suggest, at least presumptively, that the nature of that <em>Title </em>24 offense is incompatible with a noncustodial sentence. Compare <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1 d. That, however, is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">For the reasons herein expressed, we conclude that defendant was entitled to the application of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1 e and we accordingly remand to the trial court for resentencing pursuant thereto. Should the trial court decide to withhold the noncustodial sentence therein authorized, he shall state his reasons therefor with particularity and within the statutory intent. In view of this disposition we do not address defendant\u2019s argument that in any case the sentences imposed were excessive and constituted a mistaken exercise of the court\u2019s sentencing discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">We reverse and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\">With respect to the general applicability of Code sentencing provisions to <em>Title </em>24 offenses, we note that prior to its amendment by <em>L. </em>1981, c. 290, \u00a7 38, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6 b permitted imposition of a minimum period of parole ineligibility only in respect of first and second degree crimes. Thus, since <em>Title </em>24 crimes are ungraded, this section did not apply thereto irrespective of their individual gravity. The amendment deleted the reference to first and second degree crimes, substituting therefor the phrase \u201cany crime,\u201d one of the consequences of which was clearly to extend applicability of the section to <em>Title </em>24 offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
