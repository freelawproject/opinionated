Roesch, Esq., justice of the municipal court of the city of New York, borough of Manhattan, Fourth district, denying defendant\u2019s motion made herein on the 28th day of April, 1898, to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint herein; for a direction of a verdict herein in favor of the defendant; and for a judgment for defendant on his counterclaim herein; and for a direction of a verdict for the defendant on his said counterclaim; to go to the jury on his defense herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-19\">The right of appeal to this court from a determination of the municipal court of the city of New York is a purely statutory one, Schwartz v. Schendel, 23 Misc. Rep. 476, 51 N. Y. Supp. 415. And, as expressly declared in Adolph v. Klein, 23 Misc. Rep. 701, 52 N. Y. Supp. 32, such appeals are limited to judgments, and to such orders as are, in terms, made appealable under some specific provision of the statute. No reference has been made by appellant to any statutory provision, nor have we, after industrious effort, been able to discover any, from which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>even the remotest semblance of authority could be spelled out in support of an appeal so unique as the one here sought to be urged. Hence this court is without jurisdiction in the premises, and powerless to entertain the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The appeal must therefore be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
