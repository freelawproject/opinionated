The contract provided for the owner\u2019s completion upon the contractors\u2019 default. Therefore the subcontractor\u2019s lien would attach to any balance remaining in the owner\u2019s hands, over the contract price, after deducting the cost of completion. Van Clief v. Van Vechten, 130 N. Y. 571, 577, 29 N. E. 1017; Campbell v. Coon, 149 N. Y. 556, 44 N. E. 300; Manufacturing Co. v. Rohrig, 16 App. Div. 633, 45 N. Y. Supp. 1139. And the plaintiff assails the finding that there was no balance, and claims that the evidence fails to support the fact, in a substantial degree. The exception tak\u00e9n to the finding of fact that the defendant owner had expended the whole of the contract price would present error of law, if the evidence were insufficient to support the finding, prima facie. Morowsky v. Rohrig, 4 Misc. Rep. 167, 23 N. Y. Supp. 880, and citations. And our examination of the record discloses that there was no evidence to sustain certain credits made to the owner in the course of the decision, with the result that the finding is to be declared unfounded; there being, beyond question, a balance in the hands of the defendant owner applicable to the plaintiff\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>The amount payable to the contractors, had they completed, was $751.50, and the payments claimed to have been made by the owner under the contract, and in the course of his own completion of the work, were $760.84, according to an abstract from the record submitted on the argument; but the evidence shows that at least three items going to make up this last sum were not allowable. One item of $5 for ceiling work, while adverted to by counsel for the defendant O\u2019Brien in the course of his client\u2019s direct examination, was not proven, as in fact an expense, by any statement of the witness. A further item of $6.50 for lumber was clearly embodied in the general lumber bill, and thus was credited to defendant twice over. So, too, of the item of $11.50 for plastering, since the amount was made the basis of a credit to defendant upon payment to the plasterer at the contractors\u2019 order, and once again because the amount thus paid was included in the latter\u2019s receipt. We also find the proof to be very unsatisfactory as to the owner\u2019s alleged payment of $100 to the carpenter, Goldberg, since ft would certainly seem, from the owner\u2019s (O\u2019Brien\u2019s) testimony, that he had credited himself with this same sum as paid to one of the contractors, Walter Powers. His testimony as to this was self-contradictory, and could well have called for disapproval by the general term as proof of the particular facts sought to be supported; but we are not inclined to place our reversal of the judgment upon the failure of proof touching this item, since it may be that some evidence for its support is found in this witness\u2019 testimony, given at one stage of.the trial, that the payments to Goldberg and to said Walter Powers were distinct. In any event, the finding as to the state of the fund in the owner\u2019s hands should have been in the plaintiff\u2019s favor for some amount, as we have shown, and the finding which was made was without evidence for its support; hence there was substantial error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The judgment should therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
