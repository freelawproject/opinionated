The tenant alone defended, and her amended answer, while admitting the fact of possession, denied all the other allegations of the petition. For a separate defense, it was alleged that the petitioner\u2019s interest in the premises was not that of an owner, but, equitably, of a mortgagee; and that she (the tenant), a former holder of the fee, was entitled to a conveyance of the property upon payment of a certain sum by way of redemption. In the course of the allegations of this defense, the fact that the tenant had entered into possession under the lease pleaded by the petition was set up, and the justice thereupon made a final order in favor of the landlord; holding that the affirmative defense could not be entertained, because proceeding for equitable relief, and that the admission of possession by virtue of the lease, as set forth in the separate defense, concluded the question of holding over, and completed the landlord\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">It would seem that the ruling against the admissibility of the defense was correct, since there was no dispute as to the regularity of the landlord\u2019s legal title, and the tenant\u2019s success could only result from the court\u2019s affirmative finding that the title rested in her; that the petitioner\u2019s deed, although a conveyance in law, was equitably a mortgage; and that the tenant was entitled to a conveyance upon making a payment such as was tendered. Thus, the tenant sought actual equitable relief, and this was beyond the power of the court below to afford; its jurisdiction to entertain equitable defenses being limited to cases where the defense is of a nature cognizable in \u00e1 court of law, and not calling for the exercise of jurisdiction peculiar to a court of equity. Rodgers v. Earle, 5 Misc. Rep. 164, 24 N. Y. Supp. 913; Constant v. Barrett, 13 Misc. Rep. 249, 34 N. Y. Supp. 163; Bien v. Bixby, 18 Misc. Rep. 415, 41 N. Y. Supp. 433; Hattersley v. Cronyn, 22 Misc. Rep. 259, 49 N. Y. Supp. 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">But, conceding the propriety of the conclusion reached by the justice so far, still the case was improperly disposed of upon the pleadings, since there was an issue as to the nature of the tenant\u2019s possession, raised by the general denial; and the allegations of the answer, touching the existence of the lease, did not make the petitioner\u2019s case complete. The tenant set up the lease as a part of the separate defense, and therefore the allegation did not operate to aid the petition, in the face of the general denial (Balmford v. Lodge, 19 Misc. Rep. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>1, 42 N. Y. Supp. 881; Fox v. Held, 24 Misc. Rep. 184, 52 N. Y. Supp. 724); and, as an admission, this allegation was not conclusive, in any event, unless the whole defense were admitted for the pur-, poses of the pleading, and the tenant could still give proof in explanation of the admission (Young v. Katz, 22 App. Div. 542, 48 N. Y. Supp. 187). Accordingly, the final order must be reversed; but, in view of the fact that no probability of the tenant\u2019s success upon a new trial is apparent, a motion for restitution should not be entertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The final order should therefore be reversed, and a-new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
