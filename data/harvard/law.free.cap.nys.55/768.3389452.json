On the contrary, it is contended by the plaintiff that an amendment of the constitution duly adopted according to the provisions of the original constitution did not affect outstanding policies. The defendant offered to show that there were no votes cast in opposition to the proposed amendment, which was excluded on the plaintiff\u2019s objection, and that Augustus M. Koeth voted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>in favor of the amendment, which was excluded on the plaintiff\u2019s objection. To these rulings the defendant excepted. These rulings were error. It was competent for the defendant to show that the insured expressly assented January 14, 1896, to a change of the contract existing between him and the defendant as to the manner of giving notices of assessments, and when such assessments became payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">For this error the defendant\u2019s exceptions should be sustained, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the defendant to abide the event. All concur, except WARD, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
