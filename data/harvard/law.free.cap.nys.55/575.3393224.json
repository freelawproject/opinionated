Colwell v. Devlin, 20 Misc. Rep. 355, 45 N. Y. Supp. 850; Thornall v. Turner, 23 Misc. Rep. 363, 51 N. Y. Supp. 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-22\">One condition essential to the granting of an order opening a default is that an affidavit of merits must be filed and served, or, if this has already been done, that proof thereof be made upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>motion. Thornall v. Turner, 23 Misc. Rep. 363, 51 N.Y. Supp. 214. The moving affidavit of the defendant contains the only reference to what seems to have been intended as an affidavit of merits, and so far the allegation is: \u201cThat, as deponent is advised by his counsel, T. J. Malloy, of the borough of Brooklyn, the said defendant had a good and sufficient defense, upon the merits, to said action for conversion.\u201d This is insufficient, because it fails to state, in conformity with the requirements of rule 23 of the general rules of practice, that the defendant \u201chas fully and fairly stated the case to his counsel,\u201d and such affidavit is also defective because it omits to allege that the defendant \u201chas a good and substantial defense on the merits in this cause,\u201d etc. Bank v. Gill, 23 Hun, 406. See 1 Enc. Forms, pp. 672, 673 ; 2 Abb. Forms, p. 692. The following averments have been held not to be a compliance with the rule and practice last set forth, viz.: \u201cThat the defendant has a good and substantial defense to the bond\u201d (Meech v. Calkins, 4 Hill, 534); \u201cthat they have a good and substantial defense upon the merits in the above-entitled cause to the promissory note on which the action is brought,\u201d etc. (Durant v. Cook, 1 How. Prac. 45); \u201cthat he has a good, valid, and sufficient defense upon the merits in the above-entitled cause to the plaintiff\u2019s declaration filed in this suit\u201d (Howe v. Hasbrouck, Id. 68); \u201cthat the said defendants have a good and substantial defense upon the merits to the plaintiff\u2019s demand on the promissory note, on which this action is brought\u201d (Mason v. Moore, 2 How. Prac. 70); that \u201ceach of the' defendants' had a good and valid defense to the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s claim as set forth in said complaint upon the merits thereof,\u201d etc.; and that the defendant Mrs. Gill has a \u201c.valid defense upon the merits to the whole of plaintiff\u2019s claim herein,\u201d etc. (Bank v. Gill, supra). Testing the sufficiency of that portion of the affidavit under review in the light of the foregoing rule and adjudications, it must be held that the same is wholly insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The explanation given by the defendant for his failure to appear upon the return of the summons was, to my mind, satisfactory; and, in view of his poverty, there was no abuse of discretion in opening the default without terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">It results from the views above expressed that the order must be reversed, with costs, and the proceedings remitted to the court below for further hearing to be brought on upon at least five days\u2019 notice, with leave to serve an affidavit of merits. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
