Bassett v. Leslie, 123 N. Y. 396, 25 N. E. 386; Railroad Co. v. Arthur, 90 N. Y. 234; Stevenson v. Insurance Co., 10 App. Div. 233, 41 N. Y. Supp. 964. Defendant\u2019s affidavit states that the action is for a balance due for use of horses and teams, and for services rendered in connection with work done on the defendant\u2019s property at Montauk Point, in Suffolk county. It states that Sirignano claims that he called for and fed the horses, and that his balance now sued for is really due him. The plaintiff and Sirignano are not claiming the same money. Defendant is a debtor to plaintiff for work done on its property, and the plaintiff owes Sirignano for caring for and feeding horses. The facts as set forth do not establish a lien on the money at common law, and he has no mechanic\u2019s lien under the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-16\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with costs, and the motion denied, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-17\">MCCARTHY, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
