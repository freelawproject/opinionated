Laws; 2 Rev. St. [Banks &amp; Bros.\u2019 9th Ed.] p. 1285; Laws 1890, c. 565, as amended by chapter 676. Laws 1892, and further amended by chapter 545, Laws 1895), and without which the statute declared that \u201cno railroad corporation * * * shall exercise the powers conferred by law upon such corporations.\u201d Further, it appeared that the organization tax had not been paid, and the tax law (chapter 24, Gen. Laws; 5 Rev. St. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>[Banks &amp; Bros.\u2019 9th Ed.] p. 3280; Laws 1896, c. 908) provided, as to this (section 180), that \u201cno corporation shall have or exercise any corporate franchise or powers, or carry on business in this state until such tax shall have been paid.\u201d The life of a corporation dates from its organization, and not from the time it begins to do business (Thomp. Corp. \u00a7 217); and, under Railroad Law, supra (section 2), the subscribers of the certificate \u201cbecome a corporation\u201d by executing, acknowledging, and filing the paper, such certificate being-presumptive evidence of incorporation (Gen. Corp. Law, \u00a7 9; Gen. Laws, c. 35; 2 Rev. St. [Banks &amp; Bros.\u2019 9th Ed.] p. 970). From the wording of the restrictions above quoted, as to the certificate of the railroad commissioners and the payment of the tax, it is apparent that the organization of the corporation precedes the restriction, and that the corporate existence is recognized, the benefits of incorporation to be deferred until the condition is complied with. See Thomp. Corp. \u00a7\u00a7 226, 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">We have not to determine whether the defendant's existence as a corporation could be successfully assailed in a direct proceeding-on the part of the state, the rule being that, where an action' is brought against an alleged corporation by a party contracting with it, the corporate existence is to be upheld if, colorably, there has been an organization under the statute; it being held that the corporation exists de facto, for the purpose of the case, and that both parties are estopped from asserting the contrary. Railroad Co. v. Cary, 26 N. Y. 75, 77; Vinegar Co. v. Schlegel, 143 N. Y. 537, 543, 38 <em>N. </em>E. 729; Thomp. Corp. \u00a7\u00a7 218, 3683, et seq. In the present case the dealings of the parties were carried on throughout with acquiescence in the fact that the defendant was a corporation, and any defense that the defendant had no- power to make the contract, because not authorized to do business, cannot be entertained. It would seem, certainly, that this very agreement\u2014one for the making of a preliminary survey and maps\u2014was within the defendant\u2019s powers, and expressly reserved from the restriction above noted (Railroad Law, \u00a7 59); but, assuming the contrary, the agreement being executed and the purported corporation having had the benefit of it, the plea of ultra vires could not be interposed, for the transaction was opposed to no principle of public policy, and the defendant was estopped fom availing itself of this defense (Arms Co. v. Barlow, 63 <em>N. </em>Y. 70; Peck v. Doran-Wright Co. [Sup.] 10 N. Y. Supp. 401; Thomp. Corp. \u00a7\u00a7 6015, 6016).</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
