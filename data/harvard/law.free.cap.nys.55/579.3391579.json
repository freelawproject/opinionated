Should my death occur soon, or at any time, and the said Clara Donald (n\u00e9e Frey) is still in my employ, then my wife, Wilheimina Schwarz (n\u00e9e Bremer), my daughter, Elizabeth Forger (n\u00e9e Schwarz), and my son-in-law, William Forger, will pledge themselves, according to agreement, that . Clara Donald (n\u00e9e Frey) shall inherit five hundred dollars ($500.00) in legal tender of my money inside of thirty days after my death. For which the said Clara Donald (n\u00e9e Frey) pledges herself not to leave my wife suddenly, but to assist her in all business transactions for a weekly salary, the same as the last she had before my death, to the best of her ability and knowledge, for three months after my death, if my wife so desires. Should the said Clara Donald (n\u00e9e Frey) still be in my employ three years after the above date, and she then wishes to marry, I will pay her personally the above sum, instead of an inheritance, about eight days after her marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-10\">\u201cIn agreement to the above we herewith affix our signatures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-11\">\u201c[Signed] Elizabeth Forger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-12\">\u201cWilliam Forger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-13\">\u201cManna Schwarz, gb. Bremer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-14\">\u201cE. F. Schwarz.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-15\">\u201cNew York, May the 25th, 1896 (eighteen ninety-six).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-16\">The defendants, while admitting the plaintiff\u2019s performance of the agreement, assail the recovery upon the ground that they were not individually bound by the contract, and that the claim, therefore, is one which should be determined in an action against the estate of the late E. F. Schwarz, who has, since the execution of said instrument, departed this life.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-17\">Stripped of its attempted legal embellishments, the writing quoted merely embodied a promise by the defendants that the plaintiff should receive $500 within 30 days after Schwarz\u2019s death, there being an express guaranty of payment from the estate within that time. This payment was not made, and for the resulting liability of the guarantors the judgment was properly rendered. The word \u201cinherit,\u201d if used in the instrument in a strictly legal sense, was utterly meaningless, since the expression, when confined to the definition as accepted in law, is applicable only to a right of possession as vested in a lineal heir. 1 Bouv. Law Dict. [Rawle\u2019s Revision] p. 1037; Stand. Dict., ad verb. Surely the plaintiff\u2019s transformation could not be effected by means of this paper, nor could the parties thereto have intended to have made her a legatee, inasmuch as they, by their own convention, had no such power vested in them, even though they \u201cpledged\u201d themselves by all the important words in their vocabulary.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Construing the contract with a view to the natural understanding of the parties, it is evident that the plaintiff was to receive the sum stated as a recognized claim against the estate, and that the defendants bound themselves individually for its payment within 30 .days after it became due. Consideration for the defendants\u2019 promise is found in the plaintiff\u2019s performance of her part of the agreement, in reliance upon its good faith; and, the condition of the guaranty having arisen, viz. the death of Schwarz, the plaintiff\u2019s performance, and nonpayment by the estate, though solvent, the action was maintainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">For these reasons/ the judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
