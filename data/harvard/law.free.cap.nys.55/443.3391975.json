We have carefully examined the evidence, and believe that the jury was justified in finding that defendant represented to plaintiff\u2019s agent that his storage warehouse was fireproof, and, relying upon such statement, he (plaintiff) sent his goods to defendant\u2019s warehouse for storage. It was conceded upon the trial that the warehouse in which plaintiff\u2019s goods were stored was not fireproof, and that the goods were entirely destroyed by fire. The representation made by defendant that Ms warehouse was a fireproof one was not the expression of an opimon, but was the representation of a fact. It also appears that such representation was false, and was made for the purpose of inducing plaintiff to store his goods with defendant; that plaintiff relied upon such representation, and was deceived and injured thereby. Under these circumstances, plaintiff was entitled to a judgment against defendant for the damage sustained by Mm. Hickey v. Morrell, 102 N. Y. 454, 7 N. E. 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-19\">As usual in cases like this one, plaintiff placed a very high value upon Ms destroyed property. The -defendant also estimated such loss, and, of course, put a very low value upon the same. The jury evidently believed that plaintiff\u2019s estimate was too high, and defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>estimate was too low, and, exercising their prerogative, placed upon the goods a just and reasonable value, based upon the whole testimony. The finding ($500), we think, was -not high, but just about right.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We also think that plaintiff\u2019s expert, who was produced to testify as to the value of the destroyed property, had enough knowledge of. the value of such goods to give an opinion and estimate the value thereof. For many years he had purchased and sold such goods; also was present upon a great many occasions when purchases and sales of goods were made; and was an adjuster for the insured in many instances when property was destroyed or injured by fire. This experience was sufficient,' we judge, to make him an expert, and a person fit to express an opinion as to the value' of the goods in question, particularly in view of the fact that he was personally and intimately acquainted with their kind and character, having seen and examined them upon many occasions while in plaintiff\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The appellant\u2019s contention that the plaintiff waived the \u201cfireproof condition,\u201d we think, is not borne out by the evidence. We cannot find any evidence herein that would justify us in so deciding. We also think that plaintiff sustained the burden of proof, as he was required to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">We believe that no error was committed. The judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
