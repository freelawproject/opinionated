Coincidently, the defendant employed \u25a0 another city marshal, named Barker, to foreclose a chattel mortgage against property owned by the same lessee, and contained within the demised premises. Thus, the two marshals, in the performance of their respective missions, met at the premises named, and, by mutual understanding, deferred action upon the warrant until the following day, when the plaintiff Simon H. Rosenblatt, the lessor\u2019s husband, and the defendant, together with several others, again met at the said premises. Exactly what occurred at this second meeting is seriously disputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>by the parties litigant and their witnesses. According to the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony, the defendant there stated that he had arranged with Mrs. Joyce to take charge of the business for the purpose of effecting its sale, and, for the occupancy of said premises, agreed to pay a monthly rental of $175. The plaintiff Eosenblatt was partly corroborated by the assistant to Marshal Gross, who testified, in effect, that execution of the warrant was abandoned upon defendant\u2019s promise to make compensation during the period he might occupy said premises. Yet the defendant denied in toto the making of any such representations or promises, or that he had ever arranged for or taken possession of the premises. The defendant\u2019s version is confirmed by two of his witnesses, one of whom, named Coger, the bookkeeper for the Joyce Trucking Company, testified that the defendant did not promise to pay the rent, and did not represent him (witness) as his agent or the person who would pay the rent; and another, a witness named Harris, one of his attorneys, who likewise swore to having been present at the interview of September 1st, and to the absence there of any statement regarding the payment of rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The defendant urged upon the trial, with considerable zeal, that Mrs. Joyce, and not the defendant, was in actual possession of the premises in suit during the period for which rent is claimed; that the plaintiffs demised said premises to Mrs. Joyce for one year from May 1, 1896, by a lease bearing date April 29, 1896; and that, upon \u2022 the expiration thereof, she became, with the assent of the plaintiffs, a tenant from year to year. In support of such contention, there was introduced in evidence, at the instance of the defendant, a paper purporting to be a yearly lease of the premises in question to Mrs. Joyce, from May 1,1896, at a rental of $2,100, and which contained a covenant that the defendant would become surety for the payment of such rent. This paper bore the signatures of the respective parties thereto, save that of the defendant. Testimony was given by the plaintiff Eosenblatt to the effect that Mrs. Joyce took and retained possession, pursuant to such lease, until January 1, 1898; but later in his examination we find evidence that the instrument referred to \u201cwas never executed, because Mr. Samson refused to sign it as surety, and it was never transferred to.Mrs. Joyce\u201d; and when asked, \u201cHave they ever had any lease since that lease?\u201d he answered, \u201cThey have not, and never had, that lease.\u201d The defendant, on his direct examination, was asked this question, . \u201cHad Mr. Eosenblatt asked you before that to become surety on the lease?\u201d and, it being excluded on the plaintiffs\u2019 objection, an exception was noted by the defendant. In view of the sharp conflict of testimony with respect to the making of the alleged promise on the part of the defendant to pay the rent for .the period referred to, this question, in my opinion, should have been allowed. It certainly was relevant to the issues whether or not the defendant had theretofore refused to become a surety for the faithful performance by Mrs. Joyce, as tenant, of the covenants of a lease. Manifestly, it was so regarded by the plaintiffs, one of whom volunteered upon cross-examination the statement, as cited, that the writing was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>executed, because of the defendant\u2019s refusal to become a surety thereon; and such testimony having been received without objection, and no motion to strike it out having been made, leave should have been accorded the defendant to introduce testimony upon the subject. Under the circumstances, the exclusion of such question was error of so substantial a nature, to my mind, as to necessitate a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">It follows from these views that the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
