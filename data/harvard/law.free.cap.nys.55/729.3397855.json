Shaver, 55 N. Y. Supp. 701. It was also claimed in this case that the original judgment and sentence was void for uncertainty, because it fixed no place of imprisonment; and that the court of sessions had no power to modify the judgment of a court of special sessions by adding the words, \u201cin the county jail of Delaware county.\u201d Under the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, I should say there could he no doubt as to the power of the court below to modify the judgment rendered by the justice by adding the words in question. I think the same disposition should be made of this case as in that of People v. Shaver.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-14\">Judgment of conviction affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
