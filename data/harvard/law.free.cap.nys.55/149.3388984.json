Notwithstanding the repeal, the proceedings might be continued, if properly brought, to a, final determination, in virtue of section 31 of chapter 677 of the Laws of 1892. That section provides that \u201call actions and proceedings, civil and criminal, commenced under or by virtue of any provision of a statute so repealed, and pending immediately prior to the taking effect of such repeal, may be prosecuted and defended to final effect in the same manner as they might if such provisions were not so repealed.\u201d See Laws 1892, vol. 2, p. 1492. The petition, signed by Maloney and Lowe, water and light commissioners, verified June 5, 1897, presented to the court for the condemnation of the property described therein, to wit, the gaslight company, referred to an election purporting to have been held under chapter 680 of the Laws of 1894. The court acted upon that petition, and appointed commissioners to appraise the property of the appellant, and the order approving the award of the appraisers purported to be made in virtue of the provisions of the act of 1894. It was assumed that the election provided for in section 5 of the act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>1894 had been held, and authority given to take condemnation proceedings by the electors of the village of Le Eoy. That section provides: \u201cNo village shall establish a lighting system as provided by this act until the proposition be submitted to popular vote at an annual or special election.\u201d The title of chapter 680 of the Laws of 1894 was, viz.: \u201cAn act to authorize the villages of the state of New York to furnish electric light or gas light to the inhabitants thereof.\u201d The first section confers upon boards of water commissioners \u201cpower to establish a lighting system within said village, for the purpose of supplying light, by means of electricity, gas or other approved system, to the inhabitants of said village.\u201d The second section provides for the issue of bonds to \u201cprocure the necessary funds for establishing such lighting system. * * Section 3 of the act provides that water commissioners \u201cshall have power to establish and maintain such lighting system to supply the inhabitants with light. * * *\u201d The fifth section limits the right and power \u201cto establish a lighting system\u201d as provided by the act, and declares that no such system shall be established \u201cuntil the proposition be submitted to popular vote at an annual or special election.\u201d The statute also declares that \u201cat such election the ballots shall be \u2018For a lighting system\u2019 or \u2018Against a lighting system.\u2019 \u201d Subsequent proceedings to establish a lighting system are only authorized when a majority of votes cast be in favor \u201cof a lighting system.\u201d The power to take condemnation proceedings is conferred in section 6, and is to be used only in case \u201ca majority of the voters of such village voting * * decide to establish a lighting system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u25a0 Was the election held, and ballots used, in accordance with the provisions found in section 5 of the act? Doubtless the parties who prepared the ballots used sought to apply the provisions of section 82, c. 909, of the Laws of 1896, to the election held. That statute does not repeal chapter 680 of the laws of 1894. Therefore the latter statute must be followed, in order to effectually derive the power given by its provisions. Village of Harrisville v. Lawrence, 66 Hun, 303, 21 N. Y. Supp. 62; In re Taylor, 3 App. Div. 244, 38 N. Y. Supp. 348, affirmed 150 N. Y. 242, 44 N. E. 790. The ballots used were in the following form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">\u201c(Notice to Voters. For an affirmative vote upon any question submitted upon this ballot, make a cross (X) mark in the square after the word \u2018Yes.\u2019 For a negative vote, make a similar mark in the square following the word \u2018No.\u2019 Any mark or erasure made on this ballot, except as above indicated, makes this ballot void, and it cannot, be counted. Use only a pencil having black lead.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">\u25a1 \u201cShall the taxes authorized in chapter 680 of the Laws of 1,894, entitled \u2018An act to authorize the villages of the state of New York to furnish electric light or gas light to the inhabitants thereof\u2019 for No I\u2014i The purposes specified in said act, be levied and collected from the 1_I village of Le Roy, New York, as in said act provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The statute of 1894 does not provide for submitting any question as to taxes. It provides, as stated, that the electors shall declare by ballot either \u201cFor a lighting system,\u201d or \u201cAgainst a lighting system.\u201d Upon the face of the ballot the words \u201clighting system\u201d do not appear. In the act of 1894 there is no provision for submitting the proposition or question stated upon the ballots used. The electors did indicate, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>the ballots used, by a majority of 35, a willingness that taxes be levied and collected in the village of Le Roy authorized by the act of 1894, but they did not indicate or authorize the establishment of a lighting system for the village. The precise question which the statute of 1894 provided should be submitted was not voted upon. Hence the provision of the statute that, until the proposition named in the act shall be submitted, \u201cno village shall establish a lighting system,\u201d controls and restricts the village and all of its officers. This being so, it is not needful to consider any question of estoppel or waiver raised by the appellant\u2019s argument. The petition for the condemnation was without authority, and conferred no jurisdiction upon the court to appoint commissioners of appraisal, or to entertain the further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Chapter 551 of the Laws of 1897 does not ratify the proceedings had under .the act of 1894. Inasmuch as the court acted upon the assumption that the act of 1894 had been complied with, and such was not the fact, the proceedings for condemnation were without authority of law. Indeed, they were a violation of the provisions found in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">It is contended that the court had no power, upon motion, to set them aside. The power of the court over its judgments and proceedings is one that is important, and has been exercised in numerous cases. Hatch v. Bank, 78 N. Y. 487; Underwood v. Sutcliffe, 21 Hun, 357-362; Kiefer v. Railway Co. (Sup.) 8 N. Y. Supp. 230; Van Denburgh v. City of New York (Super. N. Y.) 7 N. Y. Supp. 675; Eighmie v. Taylor, 39 Hun, 367; Naughton v. Vion, 91 Hun, 362, 36 N. Y. Supp. 312; Vanderbilt v. Schreyer, 81 N. Y. 646; Ladd v. Stevenson, 112 N. Y. 326, 19 N. E. 842. The application at special term was not to declare abandoned the proceedings. It was to set them aside as having been made without authority, or in violation of law. Section 3374 of the Code of Civil Procedure regulates the costs upon an application for \u201can abandonment or discontinuance of the proceedings.\u201d Laws 1894, c. 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The foregoing view's lead to an affirmance of that part of the order appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">So much of the order as is appealed from is affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements against the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">FOLLETT and ADAMS, JJ., concur.
