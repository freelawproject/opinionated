On the following day, as appears from the return, a disposition of the case was made as follows, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-18\">\u201cThe above case being called to-day, on the regular call of the calendar, on a motion to open the default, the attorney for the defendant consents to the opening of the default, and both sides agree to go to trial to-day; the counsel for the plaintiff answering \u2018Beady for trial.\u2019 The case being called for trial in the regular order of business of the court, the plaintiff fails to answer \u2018Beady for trial,\u2019 and the defendant again answers \u2018Beady.\u2019 The court thereupon orders that the opening of the default of this morning be vacated, and that the judgment, as taken yesterday, stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-19\">This ruling was irregular, and the judgment cannot stand. The justice should have taken fresh proofs as to- the counterclaim, and rendered a fresh judgment. The judgment, having been set aside, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>could not be revived. See McCollum v. McCIave, 1 Hilt. 140, 3 Abb. Prac. 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The judgment is reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
