In 1896 the respondent was the owner of a large brick building, four stories high, and known as \u201cNo. 112 Main Street,\u201d Buffalo. He leased a portion of this building to Anton D\u2019Andrea, or to Joseph Carlino, which portion one or the other, or perhaps both, by turns, occupied as a liquor saloon; having on the first floor an office and a bar, on the second floor a kitchen and dining room, on the third floor six rooms, and on the fourth floor six rooms. The rooms on the third and fourth floors were occupied by renters and lodgers. No register was kept in this hotel, which was run on the European plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-16\">Assuming, without deciding, that No. 112 was, November 1, 1896, an hotel, within the meaning of section 40 of chapter 376 of the Laws of 1896 (the \u201cDomestic Commerce Law\u201d), and assuming, without deciding, that the plaintiff was an hotel guest, within the meaning of that section, I think she waived all right to maintain an action against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>\u25a0&amp;e defendant for injuries received by reason of his failure to supply her room with a rope. The plaintiff had occupied a room in this buildiag for 10 months, and for 6 months had occupied the room in which she slept on the night of the fire, paying a weekly rent therefor, and eating when and where she chose. She knew that there was no rope Ie the room, but made no complaint. There were outside iron fire escapes, and the platform to one of them was directly under one of the windows opening out of the plaintiff\u2019s room, which window she kept nailed down to prevent unbidden persons from entering her room by the escape. The man who occupied the room with the plaintiff on the night of the fire escaped from the burning building by means of this fire escape, which the plaintiff, through fear or confusion, neglected to avail herself of, and jumped to the ground, receiving injuries, for which she seeks to recover damages. The plaintiff testified that she was 27 years of age, and for 10 years had been, by occupation, a professional bicycle rider, riding in races, and thereby, before her injuries, making a comfortable living, but by her injuries her health and strength have been so impaired that she is unable to make a living as before. In Huda v. Glucose Co., 154 N. Y. 474, 48 N. E. 897, it is held that a workman employed in a factory, which was within the statute requiring the owner to maintain fire escapes easily accessible from the workmen\u2019s room (Laws 1892, c. 673, \u00a7 6), might, by acquiescence, waive its provisions, and assume the risk incident to the absence of such escapes. In Willy v. Mulledy, 78 N. Y. 310, 315, the same rule is recognized. Under the authority of these eases, I think the learned trial judge correctly held that, under the evidence in this case, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The order should be affirmed, with costs. All concur, except WAED, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
