Any person claiming that the real estate owned by them, or any part thereof, by any change that may be made in the grade of Genesee street by reason of cutting or lowering said grade, may, at any time within thirty days thereafter, file with the city clerk a statement of the amount of damages claimed by them. Upon the application of the corporation counsel of the city of Utica, and upon notice of not less than eight days to all persons filing such claims, the supreme court at any special term thereof held in the Fifth judicial district of the state of New jfork, shall, upon such notice, appoint three disinterested freeholders of the city of Utica, as commissioners to estimate and award damages, if any, which any owner of real estate may sustain by reason of change of grade aforesaid, and fix the time and place of their first meeting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b969-5\">\u201cSec. 5.

The report of the commissioners, or a majority of them, shall be final and shall be filed with the said city clerk within ten days thereafter. Unless an appeal shall be taken to the supreme court within thirty days from the filing of said report, the aggregate amount of such awards, if any, shall be a charge on the city of Utica, and shall be included in the next annual tax levy of said city, and the money raised thereby shall be paid to the. said claimants, according to the awards made in their cases, respectively.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b969-7\">The old bridge, which was superseded by the new one, constructed pursuant to said acts, was a fixed structure, elevated high enough above the canal to admit of the passage of boats, and approaches were constructed on the north and south sides thereof, which raised the grade of Genesee street on both sides of the old bridge above the natural level of the street. This old bridge had been in existence, or one like it, since the Erie Canal was constructed. The Devereux Block is on the south side of the Erie Canal, and on the west side of Genesee street, and opposite to the south approach to said old bridge. The Devereux Block is occupied by many tenants for stores and offices. The new bridge authorized by said acts was begun November 15, 1893, and completed May 2, 1894. The claimant, during the period of construction, was a lessee of a store, at an annual rental of $800, in the Devereux Block, known as \u201cNo. 138 Genesee Street,\u201d under a lease dated March 5, 1891, for one year, with the privilege of renting it for three years, which was extended until the 1st day of May, 1895, at which time it was further extended. January 8, 1895, the claimant filed a claim against the city, in which he asserted that the rental value of his store was greatly diminished by the blocking of the street and sidewalk during the construction of the new bridge, interrupting travel in front of his store, and greatly diminished his business as a dealer in hats, caps, and gentlemen\u2019s furnishing goods, for which purpose the store was occupied. The commissioners sustained in part his contention, and awarded $400 damages, in a report separately stating the facts found and the conclusions of law. The city filed exceptions to the award, and has appealed therefrom.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b969-8\">Argued before HARDIN, P.

The term \u201creal estate\u201d has a precise and well-settled meaning in the jurisprudence of this state, and -the interest of a tenant of realty under a lease for years is not real estate, but is a chattel real, and is not liable to sale on an execution. 1 Rev. St. p. 722, \u00a7 5; 2 Rev. St. (Banks\u2019 9th Ed.) p. 1789; Laws 1896, c. 547; Lewis v. Thompson, 3 App. Div. 329, 38 N. Y. Supp. 316; State Trust Co. v. Casino Co., 5 App. Div. 381, 387, 39 N.

The interest of a lessee under such a lease does not descend, in case of his death, to his heirs, but goes to his personal representative. \u201cThe terms \u2018real estate\u2019 and \u2018lands,\u2019 as used in this chapter, shall be construed as co-extensive in meaning with lands, tenements and hereditaments.\u201d 1 Rev. St. p. 750, \u00a7 10; 2 Rev. St. (Banks\u2019 9th Ed.) p. 1822, \u00a7 10; Laws 1896, c. 547, \u00a7 1; 5 Rev. St. (Banks\u2019 9th Ed.) p. 3544, \u00a7 1. \u201cThe term \u2018real property\u2019 includes real estate, lands, tenements and hereditaments, corporeal and incorporeal.\u201d Laws 1892, c. 677; 1 Rev. St. (Banks\u2019 9th Ed.) p. 110, \u00a7 3 (\u201cStatutory Construction Law\u201d). \u201cThis chapter \u201d * * is applicable to every statute unless its general object, or the context of the language construed, or other provisions of law, indicate that a different meaning or application was intended from that required to be given by this chapter.\u201d Laws 1892, c. 677, \u00a7 1; 1 Rev. St. (Banks\u2019 9th Ed.) p. 110, \u00a7 1. The statutory construction law was in force when chapter 560 of the Laws of 1893, under which the claim was made, was enacted. Leases for years are not real estate. Westervelt v. People, 20 Wend. 416, affirming Id., 17 Wend. 674. Such was the rule at common law. 2 BI. Comm. 16. For definitions of the term \u201creal property,\u201d as used in the statutes of this state, see 1 Rev. St. (Banks\u2019 9th Ed.) p. Ill, note to section 4. There is no language in chapter 560 of the Laws of 1893 broad enough to bring a lessee for years within the term \u201cowner of real estate,\u201d as used in that chapter. Persons having chattel interests in real estate affected by a change of grade of Genesee street are not within the terms of the act, and it seems to me that it was the clear intention of the legislature simply to authorize the owners of abutting real estate damaged by the change of grade to recover their damages of the city. Such real estate would necessarily be permanently affected by the change of grade, and the owner put to expense to adjust the property to the new grade of the street, and it was not intended to give a claim for damages to tenants occupying rooms or stores, for short periods, in the real estate affected, it is well settled, by a long line of cases, that a municipality of this state is not liable to an owner or tenant of realty abutting on a street for damages caused by changing the grade of the street, unless there is a statute imposing a liability. Radcliff\u2019s Ex\u2019rs v. City of Brooklyn, 4 N. Y. 195; Conklin v. Railway Co., 102 N. Y. 107, 6 N. E. 663; In re Grade-Crossing Com\u2019rs, 154 N. Y. 550, 49 N. E. 127; 6 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law (1st Ed.) 548, and cases cited. No matter how great the damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>sustained by the claimant may be, he is without remedy, unless he brings his case within the terms of the statute, which I think he is unable to do. In re Grade-Grossing Com\u2019rs, 154 N. Y. 550, 49 N. E. 127, does not sustain the contention of the claimant. The statute under which damages were awarded in that case is much broader than the statute under consideration. The statute provides that the \u201cowners or persons interested\u201d in property which should be injured by the change of grade might recover their damages, but no such language, or any language equivalent to it, is found in the acts relating to the Genesee street bridge. Having reached this conclusion, it is unnecessary to consider whether the claimant filed his claim within 30 days,\u2014the time limited by the fourth section of the act. The statute does not provide that costs may be awarded for the proceedings before the commissioners, or on an appeal therefrom; and though this is a special proceeding, in which the court may grant or withhold costs, I think that, under the circumstances, the claimant having suffered damages which he cannot recover, and the statute not having been construed, the award should be reversed, and the claim dismissed, without costs to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
