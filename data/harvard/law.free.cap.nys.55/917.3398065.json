This action is brought to obtain judgment that the plaintiff has the sole, only, and absolute right to use the name or address \u201cDr. David Ken<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>necly, Rondout, N. Y.,\u201d and \u201cDr. D. Kennedy, Rondout, N. Y.,\u201d as a form of address to it, and that the plaintiff has a right to first receive and open all letters and other mail matter so addressed and received at the post office at Kingston and at Rondout station, and that the defendant be enjoined from taking or receiving from such post offices any letters or other mail matter addressed or directed \u201cDr. David Kennedy, Rondout, N. Y.,\u201d or \u201cDr. D. Kennedy, Rondout, N. Y.,\u201d or from opening the same, or in any manner interfering therewith,\u2014with damages, and such further relief as may be just.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b944-4\">Second, The facts are in the main not in dispute, and the leading facts from which the action arises are as follows: The defendant, who is and was a regularly licensed physician and surgeon, engaged in the practice of his profession at Rondout, N. Y., in the year 1875, engaged in the manufacture and. sale of certain proprietary medicines, of his discovery, the chief of which was known as \u201cDr. Kennedy\u2019s Favorite Remedy,\u201d and \u201cDr. David Kennedy\u2019s Favorite Remedy.\u201d To the manufacture, advertisement, and sale of these remedies the defendant came to devote his entire attention, and such business became very extensive and profitable, and was so continued by him until, in the month of November, 1890, the plaintiff corporation was formed, for the purpose of acquiring and carrying on such business in the proprietary medicines of defendant. Thereupon the defendant, by his written agreement of sale and transfer, which forms a part of the complaint, transferred all his rights and interests in the manufacture and sale of said remedies to the plaintiff, he becoming the owner of one-third of the shares of the stock of the corporation, being 500 shares, of the par value of $100 each. The defendant became the president of the plaintiff corporation, participated actively in its management, and had a private office in and in connection with the main office room of the plaintiff corporation. The mail matter of the corporation, and much of the mail addressed to the defendant, was brought to the corporation office, and was opened by the defendant or other officers of the corporation, under his supervision and approval. On the 24-th of January, 1808, the defendant ceased to be the president of the plaintiff, and a successor was elected in his place. I-Iis relation with the principal business office of plaintiff was no longer agreeable or friendly, and he withdrew from the office, and, having been deposed from any business connection Avith the management of plaintiff, opened an office in another building, and resumed the practice of his profession as a physician and surgeon, and rented a box at the post office at Rondout, and directed the postmaster to place in it his mail matter addressed to him, whether as \u201cDr. David Kennedy, Rondout, N. Y.,\" or \u201cDr. D. Kennedy, Rondout, N. Y.\u201d A considerable amount of mail matter intended for the plaintiff came so addressed, was received by defendant, and, when it appeared to be intended for the plaintiff, was returned to it through the post office. It is this detention of mail matter of which the plaintiff complains, and for which it seeks relief in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b944-5\">Other facts undisputed are: This business Avas built up by the plaintiff by means of newspaper and circular advertising extensively throughout the United States, and it grew to large proportions. In the advertisements special attention was called to the name \u201cDr. David Kennedy,\u201d and the address \u201cRondout, N. Y.,\u201d and the public were requested to correspond with \u201cDr. David Kennedy, Rondout, N. Y.,\u201d and were cautioned to make no mistake as to the address. This name and address were also on the packages in which the bottles of medicine Avere inclosed, and on the labels pasted on the bottles. During the 15 years the defendant conducted the business personally, all mail matter connected with the business came directed \u201cDr. David Kennedy,\u201d or \u201cDr. D. Kennedy, Rondout, N. Y.\u201d At first all the mail matter of the corporation, and afterwards a large portion of it, came directed to \u201cDr. David Kennedy,\u201d or \u201cDr. D. Kennedy, Rondout, N. Y\u201d; and this state of things continued to the present time, and still continues. The letters addressed \u201cDr. David Kennedy,\u201d or \u201cDr. D. Kennedy, Rondout, N. Y.,\u201d were from the time of the incorporation, up to February 8, 1898, received by the corporation, and opened by its officers and employes, and in all respects treated as its letters, without objection from the defendant. The defendant had directed the postmaster, in May, 1895, when free delivery was established, to deliver all letters addressed to him at his residence at such residence, and to place all others in. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>the corporation box, as they belonged to the corporation. This was done, and continued up to about January 1, 1898. In January, 1898, the defendant was removed from the presidency of the plaintiff. In February, 1898, the defendant directed the superintendent of the Bondout post office thereafter to deliver all letters addressed in the style in question in a private post-office box which he hired. The defendant has since received and opened all these letters. By reason of defendant\u2019s acts, the plaintiff\u2019s mail is greatly delayed; to the prejudice of plaintiff\u2019s business.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b945-5\">Argued before PARKER, P. J., and LARDON, HERRICK, PUTNAM, and MERWIN, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b945-6\">Howard CMpp, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b945-7\">Arthur v. Briesen, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b945-8\">LANDON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay5P\">The evidence shows that much the greater part of the numerous letters addressed \u201cDr. David Kennedy, Rondout, N. Y.,\u201d or \u201cDr. D. Kennedy, Rondout, N. Y.are letters \u201cin connection with the manufacture of the proprietary medicines,\u201d which, with the entire business connected therewith and the good will, the defendant, for a valuable consideration, sold to the plaintiff. The bill of sale given by the defendant to the plaintiff in 1890 contains this clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-9\">\u201cAlso, \u2018the good will\u2019 of the business of Dr. David Kennedy now carried on by me at Rondout, N. Y., with the sole and absolute and only right to use the names of \u2018Dr. David Kennedy, of Rondout, N. Y.,\u2019 or \u2018Dr. D. Kennedy, Rondout, N. Y.,\u2019 in connection with the manufacture of the proprietary medicines hereby granted and sold by me to the said corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">The contract, in case of doubt, must be construed most favorably to the vendee. Blackman v. Striker, 142 N. Y. 560, 87 N. E. 484. The intention of the parties, as found in the contract,\u2014construed with reference to the facts present to the mind of both parties in making it,\u2014must govern. Clark v. Devoe, 124 N. Y. 120, 26 N. E. 275. If doubts still remain, then weight may be given to the practical construction given to the contract by the parties themselves during the seven years in which they worked harmoniously together under it. Such practical construction by both parties, where one party has invested his money or so managed his business in reliance upon it that to reverse or change it would be to his prejudice, may\u2014as we think it would in this case if it were needed\u2014amount to an estoppel. Trustees v. Smith, 118 N. Y. 634, 23 N. E. 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">The following clause in the contract shows that the defendant meant to sell, without reserve, everything that could be reasonably embraced in the terms of the contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-12\">\u201cAnd I do hereby agree, in consideration of such payment of $150,000, as aforesaid, to execute and deliver any other or further paper the said corporation may be advised is necessary and requisite to convey and vest more fully in the said corporation all my right, title, and interest of, in, and to all of the said property and business hereby sold to the said \u2018Dr. David Kennedy Corporation.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-13\">All we need to say is that the defendant must observe the terms of the contract in letter and spirit. He cannot in any degree pare them down. He has been paid for full observance, and he cannot retain full pay and return scant performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-14\">The evidence shows that, for seven years after such bill of sale, all letters so addressed were received by the plaintiff from the post office; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>that since February, 1898, the defendant, claiming the right to do so, notwithstanding the protest of the plaintiff and its proper demand to the \u2022 contrary, has first received the letters thus addressed, and. retained such of them as he deemed proper, and then sent the others to the plaintiff. Thus, it appears\u2014and other evidence is to the same effect\u2014that the plaintiff is hindered and restricted by the act of the defendant in the enjoyment of its \u201csole and absolute and only right to use the names of 'Dr. David Kennedy, of Rondout, N. Y.,\u2019 or \u2018Dr. D. Kennedy, Rondout, N. Y.,\u2019 in connection with the manufacture of the proprietary medicines,\u201d and also in the full enjoyment of \u201cthe good will of the business of Dr. David Kennedy,\u201d specified in the bill of sale. Among the letters thus addressed are some which in no way concern the plaintiff, and the first receipt of the letters by the plaintiff will in some degree subject the defendant to inconvenience. That results from the fact that his proper name, \u201cDavid Kennedy,\u201d and his trade-name, \u201cDr. David Kennedy, of Rondout, N. Y.,\u201d or \u201cDr. D. Kennedy, Rondout, N. Y.,\u201d have points of resemblance. His trade-name was salable property. Higgins Co. v. Higgins Soap Co., 144 N. Y. 462, 39 N. E. 490; Caswell v. Hazard, 121 N. Y. 484, 24 N. E. 707; Cement Co. v. Le Page, 147 Mass. 206, 17 N. E. 304. The defendant sold it, and thus has been paid for this inconvenience. The trade-name was valuable when the plaintiff bought it, and the plaintiff has preserved its value, and probably greatly increased it by large expenditures in advertising it in connection with its business for the seven years in which the defendant himself remained the head and practical director of that business. It is an essential part of the name and fame of the plaintiff\u2019s business. It identifies its merchandise, preserves to it its established character, and tends to secure, and, we may assume, to extend and continue, its volume of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">The suggestion that the plaintiff has abused or may abuse rights of the defendant not embraced within the bill of sale is not now pertinent. Such abuse, if it shall need judicial redress, will be considered when properly presented. Nor need we suggest to the defendant by what methods he can lessen, without prejudice to the plaintiff, the inconveniences which seem to annoy him. It is not \u00e1 ease in which an adequate remedy at law exists, and, on the plainest principles of equity, the plaintiff should have relief by injunction. Practically, there is no dispute about the material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">The judgment is reversed, and judgment directed for the plaintiff, with costs here and below; judgment to be settled by LANDON, J. All concur, except MERW\u00cdN and PUTNAM, JJ., dissenting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
