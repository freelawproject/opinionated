The defendant, at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, made a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was denied, and an exception was duly taken. She thereupon proceeded to put in her evidence, and the case was then closed. The motion to dismiss, however, was not renewed, nor was any motion made by her for the direction of a verdict in her favor; but the justice, without any objection on her part, proceeded to submit the case, upon the evidence, to the jury. This was a concession on the part of the defendant that there was evidence tending ti&gt; prove the facts alleged against her, and was a consent to the decision of the question by the jury, which precludes her from taking the position upon appeal that the verdict was without evidence, and therefore against law. Under such circumstances, the exception which was taken to the refusal of the court to dismiss the complaint at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case is of no avail. Sullivan v. Brooks, 10 Misc. Rep. 368, 31 N. Y. Supp. 36; Helmuth v. Apgar, 17 Misc. Rep. 623, 40 N. Y. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Supp. 651; Kafka v. Levensohn, 18 Misc. Rep. 202, 206, 41 N. Y. Supp. 368. The jury, therefore, having found against the defendant, the latter cannot now be heard to impeach their verdict on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">After the verdict was rendered a motion was made for a new trial, under section 999 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which was denied. The order, however, is not appealable to this court; an appeal from the decision of the court below on such a motion being authorized only where a new trial is granted. Laws 1896, c. 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">There are no other exceptions in the case which present reversible error, and the judgment must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
