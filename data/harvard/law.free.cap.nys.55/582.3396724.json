It was understood that the duty of the plaintiff was to serve wines and liquors to the customers. On July 2d, plaintiff received word from defendant not to go to Glendale, as the police objected to women serving as waitresses there. The plaintiff, however, offered her services, in accordance with the contract, but defendant refused to give her any work. \u25a0 She tried to get work elsewhere, and failed to obtain it. She brought this action to recover for the breach of contract. The pleadings are oral. The complaint is for \u201cbreach of contract, and work, labor, and services.\u201d The answer is a \u201cgeneral denial.\u201d It was admitted that plaintiff performed no work under the contract. The defendant moved at the end of the case to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the contract was unlawful at its inception. The motion was denied on the ground that this defense should have been specially pleaded. Judgment was then given for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-15\">That the contract was unlawful is clear. The statute (Laws 1897, c. 312, \u00a7 31, subd. f) declares that \u201cit shall not be lawful for any corporation, association, co-partnership or person, whether having paid such-tax or not, to permit any girl or woman, not a member of his family, to sell or serve any liquor upon the premises.\u201d It is not pretended that plaintiff was a member of defendant\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-16\">As to the question of the sufficiency of the general denial, we may say that the general rule is that a general denial in the answer in an action on a contract puts in issue simply all matters which plaintiff is bound to prove to make out his cause of action; and in order to avail himself of facts not appearing upon the face of the contract, to establish its invalidity, the defendant must plead them. See Milbank v. Jones, 127 N. Y. 370, 28 N. E. 31. But, under a general denial in an action on contract, defendant may object that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence shows that no valid contract was made. See Cary v. Telegraph Co., 20 Abb. N. C. 333, Van Brunt, P. J. The theory upon which the action proceeds is that the plaintiff has a contract valid in law, and whatever shows the invalidity of the contract shows that no such contract as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>alleged ever existed. See Oscanyan v. Arms Co., 103 U. S. 266. In the case at bar the contract was verbal. Plaintiff, however, on her cross-examination, testifies thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">\u201cQ. This particular place was a public park, where you were to serve wine? A. Yes, sir. Q. If you were called upon to bring a bottle of wine to a customer, you would do it? You were told it was for that purpose? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">It appears, therefore, from plaintiff\u2019s own version of the contract, that it called upon her to serve wines and liquors. The general denial was sufficient, and this defense of illegality was available, although not pleaded specifically. The contract, being unlawful, cannot be enforced, and plaintiff is not entitled to recover damages for its breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
