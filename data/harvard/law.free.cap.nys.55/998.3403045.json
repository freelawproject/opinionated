It alleges that the plaintiff was furnished by the defendant \u201cwith a room and board at the said Lenox Apartment House, according to the terms of the said contract.\u201d The answer also sets out the contract entered into between the parties on the 7th of August, 1897. That contract contains the following clauses, to wit: \u201cIt is understood that, if we desire, we can pay you $125 per month, in lieu of $75.00 per month and furnishing you and wife room and board. The duration of this contract is to be one year, but it is agreed that this contract may be dissolved by us at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>end of any month, after two months from this date, by paying you three hundred dollars ($300.00) in advance.\u201d It is alleged in the answer that the defendant, on the 12th day of November, 1897, broke and violated the contract, and \u201cso continued to, and until the 19th day of November, 1897, at which last-mentioned time plaintiff violated said contract, and refused further to perform the said Contract, without the consent or acquiescence of the defendant.\u201d It is further alleged that during such time plaintiff performed all' the labor and services required of him by defendant under said contract, and continued to occupy the rooms assigned him in the defendant\u2019s building; that plaintiff thereby waived the alleged breach by defendant of said contract, and ratified, confirmed, and acquiesced in said alleged wrongful acts of defendant.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1025-5\">Argued before HARDIN, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajf\">Plaintiff upon the trial gave evidence to show that the defendant committed a breach of the contract by declining and refusing to permit the plaintiff to occupy the public dining room, and requiring and insisting that he and his wife omit to take seats and their meals in the public dining room. The evidence tends to show that the price for the meals in the public dining room was at the rate of .$9 per week for each person. The evidence also tends to show that the defendant insisted upon the plaintiff and his wife taking their meals in the \u201cordinary,\u201d with the servants, nurse girls and other employ\u00e9s of the defendant. The evidence tends to show that the price for meals in the ordinary, which was a room on the side of the building, where the nurses, maids of tenants in the building, took their meals, as well as the waiters, was $3.50 to $4 per week. There was evidence that there were between 45 and 50 persons taking their meals in the public dining room, and that there were vacant places in that room which might have been occupied by the plaintiff and his wife, the evidence being that the seating capacity of the public dining room was 78. The defendant sought to place the plaintiff and Ms wife in a room that was \u201cintended to be occupied singly and alone,\u201d on the seventh floor, and that the room had a door on to the freight elevator only. It was a medium sized room, in which there was no running water, and off from it was a small closet, and one small window looking out right by the side of the house for the freight elevator, and was next to a room used by the waiters for their dressing room and lounging room. \u201cAll the garbage was taken up and down the freight elevator, and the only place for the garbage cans to be put was out on that platform, which was a very small platform, right here by the freight elevator. There was a stairway there, and all the garbage from the kitchen of the house, for the main dining room, went down <em>this </em>freight elevator.\u201d There is some evidence tending to show that the room to which the defendant sought to assign the plaintiff and his wife was so situated that a person could not get from there to the main corridors of the building, and that persons occupying it were obliged to go upstairs to the kitchen or to go downstairs to the rear apartments, and that in going downstairs to the basement they could get to the other floors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>hallways to the front of the building. We think that the evidence tended to show that the defendant had committed a breach of the contract, and that the plaintiff and his wife were not properly furnished with facilities for taking their meals in the public dining room, and that they were improperly required to take their meals in the \u201cordinary.\u201d The plaintiff requested the court to direct a verdict in his behalf for the unpaid wages and for the $300 mentioned in the contract. The court declined the request thus made, and the plaintiff took an exception. The counsel for the plaintiff asked \u201cto go to the jury on the facts in this case, upon the contract itself, upon the question of damages, upon the question of breach, upon the question of the right to recover the $300 for the dissolution of the contract on the part of the defendant.\u201d This request was declined, and an exception was taken to the refusal. Thereupon the court directed a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $47, to which direction the plaintiff excepted. We think the learned trial judge fell into an error in refusing to submit the questions of fact, presented by the evidence, to the jury. If the jury, upon the evidence before it, had found that the defendant committed a breach of the contract, as alleged, and as the evidence tended to support, then, in that event, the plaintiff was entitled to recover the unpaid services and the stipulated damages of $300 mentioned in the contract. There was sufficient evidence given upon the trial to have authorized the court to submit the question to the jury as to whether the defendant had not violated its obligations to the plaintiff, and thereby given him the right to recover the damages mentioned in the contract. We think there should be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Judgment and order reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
