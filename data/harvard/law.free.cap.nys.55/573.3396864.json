It is true that as to these allegations they have denied any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief; but, while such a plea is good in a court of record, it is unauthorized in an action brought in the municipal court. Lambert v. Hoffman, 20 Misc. Rep. 331, 45 N. Y. Supp. 806. The allegations in question must therefore stand as admitted. Under these circumstances, there vras enough evidence to support the conclusion of the justice in favor of the plaintiff. The action was brought for negligence, and not for conversion. It was therefore unnecessary to prove a demand. The fact that the interest of the plaintiff has been transferred to another after suit brought is no defense to the further prosecution of the action in the name of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>the assignor.
