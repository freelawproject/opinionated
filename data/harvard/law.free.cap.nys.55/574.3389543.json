The trial court evidently assumed it to be $60,000, and rendered judgment accordingly in favor of the plaintiff; but, as we have already stated, there was no evidence to support such assumption. The judgment must therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-16\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
