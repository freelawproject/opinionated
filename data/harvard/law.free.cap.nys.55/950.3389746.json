The relator is a foreign corporation, organized under the laws of the state of New Jersey, with a paid-up capital stock of $200,000. It carried on in the city of New York, during the years for \u2018which the tax was levied, the business of dealing in chemicals and dyestuffs. Six-sevenths of such business consisted of importing from countries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>in Europe chemicals and dyestuffs, and selling the same in the original packages as imported. One-seventh of its business consisted of the sale of broken packages of its imported goods, and also of some domestic goods of the like character.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b977-5\">Argued before PARKER, P.

If the relator\u2019s business had been wholly that of foreign or interstate commerce, it doubtless would be entitled to the exemption it seeks (People v. Wemple, 138 N. Y. 1, 33 N. E. 720), unless the fact that it conducted a strictly private business, and not a business of a quasi public character, like that of a common carrier, would exclude it from the protection accorded to the relator in the case cited,\u2014a distinction referred to in the Case of Parke, Davis &amp; Co., below cited, as fruitful of difficulty. But as this relator is engaged partly in domestic or infra-state commerce, and the power of taxation upon the latter business, and the privilege of doing it when carried on within this state by a foreign corporation, are within the competency of the state, and thus the power to prescribe the basis of its measurement is also within its competency, it follows that the statutes imposing and measuring the tax must be considered, as they may be, as not transcending the legislative power of the state. Such was the intimation of the court in the case above cited,\u2014an intimation which is supported by the more recent case of Osborne v. Florida, 164 U. S. 650, 17 Sup. Ct. 214, and, as we think, authoritatively confirmed by the recent case of People ex rel. Parke, Davis &amp; Co. v. Roberts, decided in October, 1898, by the supreme court of the United States, upon appeal from the judgment of our court of appeals. 91 Hun, 158, 36 N. Y. Supp. 368; Id., 149 N. Y. 608, 44 N. E. 1127. The supreme court of the United States says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-9\">\u201cNo tax is sought to be imposed directly upon imported articles, or on. their sale. This is a tax imposed on the business of a corporation, consisting in the storage and distribution of various kinds of goods, some products of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>own manufacture and some imported articles. From the very nature of the tax, being laid as a tax upon the franchise of doing business as a corporation, it cannot be affected in any way by the character of the property in which its capital stock is invested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Determination of the comptroller confirmed, with $50 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
