J. The defense, so far as material to this appeal, -was based upon a claim that the assured kept upon the premises benzine to an amount exceeding one quart which the policy permitted, and in violation of one of the conditions of the policy, and that, therefore, the contract of insurance was avoided. The\" sole question presented was whether the benzine which was undoubtedly kept by the plaintiff was \u201cupon the premises,\u201d within the meaning of those words used in the policy. The facts were not in dispute. The policy was written on machinery, fixed and movable machines, etc., \u201call contained in the brick building, with frame additions attached, situate on the north side of Pearl street or 15th avenue, about 125 feet east of East 18th street, Paterson, New Jersey.\u201d The business carried on in the buildings was the dyeing and finishing of silks and velvets, and in that business it was necessary to use benzine to some extent and for some purposes. To that end the policy permitted the assured to keep and use \u201con the premises\u201d one quart of benzine, and that quantity was kept in the buildings in which was the insured property. These buildings were situated upon a lot upon which was also an open shed, at some small distance from the buildings, in which it is claimed that three or five barrels of benzine were habitually kept by the plaintiff. While the facts in regard to this matter are not contradicted, yet they are not precisely clear. But it is very certain that there was not evidence which would warrant the finding by the court that this comparatively large quantity of benzine was kept or stored anywhere within the buildings in which the insured property was placed, but that it was kept in an open shed on the same lot, and eight or ten feet away from those buildings, and in no way connected with any of them. The question presented, therefore, is whether the benzine was on \u201cthe above-described premises, within the meaning of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>words as used in the policy; because, unless it can be said to be there situated, it clearly was not within the conditions. In order to learn whether it was within the conditions, it is necessary to refer to the policy to see what premises were described in it. The premises were those in which the insured property was situated, and we find that the description of the place where that property was is that above quoted in this opinion. No other place is referred to, and no other premises are mentioned. The policy speaks of \u201cthe brick building with the frame additions attached.\u201d There are no other \u201cpremises\u201d described in the policy, and the word \u201cpremises,\u201d therefore, can be construed to mean only those buildings which are mentioned as containing the insured property, and not the lot outside, upon which none of the buildings stood. This construction of these particular words is that always adopted by the courts. Allemania Fire Ins. Co. v. Pittsburg Exposition Soc. (Pa. Sup.) 11 Atl. 572; Northwestern Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. German Fire Ins. Co., 40 Wis. 446; Carlin v. Assurance Co., 57 Md. 515; Sperry v. Insurance Co., 22 Fed. 516; May, Ins. \u00a7\u00a7 228, 243. The evidence failed to show that any benzine, except perhaps the single quart which the assured was at liberty to keep, was kept within the buildings in which the insured property was. In the absence of .that proof, the defendant\u2019s case failed, and it was error, therefore, to permit it to succeed upon the evidence as it stood.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">For that reason the judgment and order must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event of the action. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
