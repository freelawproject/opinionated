Miller, for and during the term of her natural life, the sum of five thousand dollars per year. I also give, devise, and bequeath to my wife the use, during the term of her natural life, of my dwelling house in New York Gity, together with all of the furniture and other personal property in or about my said house, and also the use of my farm in Erie county, New York, including furniture, and all personal property, of every name, nature, and description, on said farm. The use of said dwelling house and farm is given to my wife free from any expenses for taxes, assessments, insurance, or repairs, which are to be paid by my executors. The foregoing provisions for her are in lieu and bar of her dower in my estate. My said farm and property thereon shall not be sold by my executors during her life, except upon her written request.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-10\">\u201cFourth. Upon the death of my wife, or upon my death in case my wife shall not survive me, I direct that my said estate bo converted into money, and that my executors sell my real and personal property at such time or times as they deem wise; and I give and bequeath the proceeds of my said estate as follows: (1) I give and bequeath to my beloved grandchild Ottilie Seibert the sum of fifty-five thousand dollars, and I give and bequeath to my beloved grandchild Elsie Seibert the sum of fifty-five thousand dollars. In ease either my said grandchild Ottilie Seibert or my said grandchild Elsie Seibert shall be under-age at the time the legacy given to her becomes payable, I direct my executors to hold the same in trust during her minority, and to apply to the use of the grandchild for whom the said sum of fifty-five thousand dollars is intended the sum of one thousand dollars per annum until such grandchild shall attain the age of twenty-one years, or sooner die, and accumulate for her the remainder of the income, and, upon such grandchild attaining the age of twenty-one years, to pay over the said sum of fifty-five thousand dollars, and any accumulation of income thereon, to such grandchild; and, in case of her death before attaining the age of twenty-one years; to pay the same to her child or children her surviving; and in case my grandchild Ottilie Seibert shall die before attaining the age of twenty-one years, leaving no child or children her surviving, then to pay, assign, transfer, and set over the said sum of fifty-five thousand dollars, one-half to the Ger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>man Evangelical Aid Society, which now has its office in Fairfax street, in the city of Brooklyn, and the remaining one-half thereof to the German Evangelical Synod of North America, located at St. Louis, Missouri, to be used for mission purposes in the East Indies; and in case my said grandchild Elsie Seibert shall die without issue, and before attaining the age of twenty-one years, to pay the said sum of fifty-five thousand dollars intended for her benefit to the Ottilie Orphan Asylum, now located at Forest avenue and Butler street, East Williamsburg, town of Newton, Queens county, New York. \u25a0(2) I also give and bequeath out of the proceeds of my residuary estate upon the death of my wife, or upon my death in case she shall die before me, to my brother, Martin Miller, of Jersey City, New Jersey, fifteen thousand dollars; to Mrs. Carrie Westrup, of New, York City, one thousand dollars; to my sister, Catherine Beyer, five thousand dollars; to Kate Herman, of Warsaw, county of Wyoming, N. Y., five thousand dollars. (3) I also give and bequeath out of the proceeds of my said residuary estate upon the death of my wife, or upon my death in case my wife shall not survive me, the sum of sixty thousand dollars to the said Ottilie Orphan Asylum, now located at Forest avenue and Butler street, East Williamsburg, Newton, Queens county, New York, for the erection of a building or buildings for said orphan asylum, .and to the Evangelical Reform Church of the Dutch Reform Denomination, vomer of Avenue B and Fifth street, in the city of New York, under whatever name it may be incorporated, the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars. It is my wish that the said sum of twenty-five thousand dollars be invested, and kept invested, upon bond and mortgage upon improved real estate in the \u25a0city of New York, by said church, and the income collected, and applied towards the payment of the salary of the present and any future minister of \u25a0&lt;aid church, so long as the said church shall remain in its present religious sect or denomination. (4) After the foregoing legacies shall have been paid in full, I give and bequeath out of the proceeds of my residuary estate upon the death of my wife, or upon my death, if she shall die before me, to the Five Point House of Industry, in the city of New York, five thousand dollars: io the Wetmore Home (formerly known as .the \u2018Home for Fallen and Friendless Girls\u2019), of New York City, under whatever name the same may be incorporated, five thousand dollars; to the German Evangelical Synod and Missionary Society of North America, of St. Louis, Missouri, the sum of ten thousand dollars, hoping that the same will be applied for missionary purposes in the East Indies. In case the proceeds of my residuary estate shall not be sufficient to pay the three last-named legacies in full, then they shall be paid pro rata. In respect to the other or prior legacies hereinbefore mentioned, it is my desire that the same be paid in full in the order in which the same are stated in this my will,- so far as the proceeds of my estate shall be sufficient for that purpose. (5) All the rest, residue, and remainder of the proceeds of my residuary estate and property, including all lapsed legacies, and property not herein effectually devised, given, or bequeathed, I give, devise, and bequeath to the said Ottilie Orphan Asylum, of East Williamsburg, New York.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-5\">The following is the opinion of LAWBEhTOE, J., in the court below:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-6\">\u201cI do not regard the question as to what the disposition should be of any accumulation of the plaintiffs\u2019 shares under the will, in case either or both of the plaintiffs should die during minority, as properly before the court at this time. It cannot be assumed from the evidence before me that any surplus will exist, or that either of the plaintiffs will die without leaving lawful issue -during her minority. As to the other branch of the case, it seems quite clear that the income which may arise after the expenses for the management of the estate, and the payment of the \u00a75,000 yearly to the widow, should go to the Ottilie Orphan Asylum, as the residuary legatee. The residuary clause provides as follows: \u2018All the rest, residue, and remainder of the proceeds of my residuary estate and property, including all lapsed legacies, and property not herein effectually devised, given, or bequeathed, I give, devise, and bequeath to the said Ottilie Orphan Asylum, of East Williamsburg, New York.\u2019 There is no qualification of the terms of the residuary clause, and the well-settled rule is that, unless a residuary bequest is circumscribed by words of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>unmistakable import, it will, to prevent intestacy, be construed so as to perform the office intended; i. e. to dispose of all the residuary estate. In re Miner\u2019s Will, 146 N. Y. 121, 40 N. E. 788; Floyd v. Carow, 88 N. Y. 560; Riker v. Cornwell, 113 N. Y. 115, 20 N. E. 602; In re Allen, 151 N. Y. 243,. 45 N. E. 554. There is no disposition of the surplus of income which may accrue during the widow\u2019s lifetime, and it cannot be assumed that the testator intended such accumulation should he for her benefit. The provisions of the will in favor of the widow are made in lieu of dower, and are so specific that it cannot be successfully contended that she should take any further benefit thereunder; nor can it be held that the plaintiffs are entitled to such surplus. Under the fourth clause of the will, the bequest in favor of each of the plaintiffs is limited to the specific sum of $55,000, which sum, with the accumulation thereon, is to be paid \"to them upon the attainment of their majority. The will is silent as to the disposition of any surplus other than that which may accrue upon the sum of $55,000. I am therefore of the opinion that, if any surplus accrues during the widow\u2019s lifetime upon the other portions of the estate, the disposition thereof will fall under the residuary clause of the will. The question of costs will be reserved until the settlement of the judgment. Draw judgment and decision accordingly, and settle on three days\u2019 notice.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b622-5\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.
