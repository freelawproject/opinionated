It. does not appear that said order in anywise prevented plaintiff from continuing the action brought by him. He is a pauper, just as all infants are paupers who have no estate real or personal given them or bequeathed or inherited by them. It was surely not the intention of the statute referred to to decl\u00e1re all infants paupers except those just referred to, but was calculated to enable infants to carry on a litigation without cost to themselves if they could not do so in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>usual way. In this instance we believe that the special term justice was right in declaring that this was not such a case. The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
