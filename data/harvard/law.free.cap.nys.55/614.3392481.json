It is claimed by the defendant that one of the pictures sought to be recovered for, and entitled \u201cA Night Scene in Printing-House Square,\u201d was not included in the order given to plaintiff; and that the other two, to wit, \u201cWall Street at Night,\u201d and \u201cBusiness Men at Luncheon at Astor House,\u201d were not executed in conformity with the agreement entered into respecting them. Such a conflict of testimony seems to have arisen upon the trial as to render unjustifiable any interference on the part of this court with the conclusions of the justice. Sufficient evidence was undoubtedly adduced to authorize the trial justice in his findings that the first-mentioned picture was ordered as claimed by the plaintiff, and executed by him in conformity with such direction, and he was likewise justified in fixing its reasonable value. With respect to the artistic value, as well as their peculiar adaptability to the purposes for which they were de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>signed, there is a divergency of opinion regarding the other two pictures; but as the trial justice was in a better situation than we to pass upon the credibility of witnesses, having seen them and observed their manner while upon the witness stand, we fail to find any reason for disturbing his determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Reversal of the judgment being sought solely upon the facts, and an examination of the record satisfying us that it is amply sustained by the evidence, we conclude that the judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
