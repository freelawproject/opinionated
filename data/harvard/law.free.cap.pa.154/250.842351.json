In the first* supplemental affidavit of defence he averred that plaintiff \u201c is not the holder and owner for value and before maturity of the notes in suit, but the same were handed over to him by W. B. Mershon &amp; Co., the payees, for the sole purpose of debarring deponent, the maker thereof, from a defence to the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-16\">In the second supplemental affidavit of .defence he averred \u201c that the merchandise furnished by plaintiff for which the notes in suit were given in part payment consisted, inter alia, of 415 pairs of inside blinds, at the price $1.90 per pair, making total of $790.75. Also, of 376 doors at $1.10 each, or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>total of $418.16. Also, 9847 lineal feet of molding (a) ninety-six cents per foot, or $94.60 total. That the said blinds, doors and molding were sold by A. W. Bacon, plaintiff, as agent for W. B. Mershon &amp; Co., to deponent, under the express warranty and agreement that the same were in size and dimension like other doors and blinds being used in a large building operation, and which were to have been used likewise therein. That said deponent had no opportunity to and did not see said blinds, etc., until after the giving of the notes in suit. That said, blinds, etc., were unsuitable for the purposes ordered and not as represented in size and kind, and deponent was compelled to sell the same at the following losses, to wit: On the 415 pairs of inside blinds deponent sold the same at a loss of $445.37; on the 376 doors deponent sold the same at a loss of $105; and on the moldings deponent sold the same at a loss of $31.52, making a total loss to deponent of $581.89. And that these prices were the best that could be obtained for the same, and were all they were worth. That deponent suffered a further loss, by reason of the same, of an amount greater than the entire amount of notes in suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-5\">Rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence was made absolute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1) in entering judgment against defendant ; and (2) in making the rule absolute.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b275-7\"><em>Henry J. Scott, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4N\">In a suit on a promissory note an affidavit that defendant believes and expects to be able to prove that plaintiff is not a bona fide holder is sufficient. The reasons for such belief need not be stated: Moeck v. Littell, 82 Pa. 356; Oberle v. Schmidt, 86 Pa. 221; Trust Co. v. Banger, 8 Pa. C. C. R. 99.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-8\">Where goods are bought for a special purpose, and are expressly warranted to be such as are suitable for the purpose, a breach of the warranty is a good defence to an action for the price: Badger v. McKay, 9 W. N. 528; Lehigh Coal Co. v. Link, 1 W. N. 102; Nagle v. Potter, 3 W. N. 26.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-9\">Even before the act of April 13,1887, P. L. 21, a stipulation that future deliveries will equal the sample may become a term of the contract and be enforced as such. It is then unneces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>sary to determine whether the stipulation is a warranty or a condition: West Republic Mining Co. v. Jones, 108 Pa. 55; Warren v. Phila. Coal Co., 83 Pa. 437; Scheppers v. Stewart, 11 W. N. 106.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-5\">A warranty and breach may be shown without offering to return the goods: Steigleman v. Jeffries, 1 S. &amp; R. 476; Borrekins v. Bevan, 3 Rawle, 23; Erringer v. Miller, 3 Phila. 344; Badger v. McKay, 9 W. N. 528; Schultz v. Wilde, 7 W. N. 212; Lee &amp; Bro. v. Baylie, 12 Cent. R. 716; Shaw v. Fleming, 11 Cent. R. 620.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-6\">Where goods are sold with a warranty of quality and are retained by the purchaser, the measure of damages for a breach of the warranty is the difference between the market value of the goods contracted for and of the goods delivered. In an action for the price of the goods, the purchaser may interpose this difference as a defence pro tanto: Ogden v. Beatty, 137 Pa. 197 ; Betz v. Shepperson, 8 Atl. R. 175; West Republic Mining Co. v. Jones, 108 Pa. 55; Kaufman v. Cooper Iron Co., 105 Pa. 537.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-7\"><em>Jas. Aylward Develin, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIUx\">Inferences and intendments should not be pressed beyond the necessary meaning of the terms employed in an affidavit of defence, because when a party swears in his own case it is to be presumed he swears as hard as he can with a good conscience : Marsh v. Marshall, 53 Pa. 399; Bardsley v. Delp, 88 Pa. 420 ; Lord v. Ocean Bank, 20 Pa. 387.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-8\">When averments are so vague that no indictment for perjury would lie they do not comply with the requirements of the affidavit of defence law: Mitchell on Motions and Rules, 67 ; Gould v. Gage, 118 Pa. 561; Erie City v. Butler, 120 Pa. 382; Stitt v. Garrett, 3 Whart. 283.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-9\">Where goods are sold with a warranty of quality, and are retained by the purchaser, the measure of damages for the breach of the warranty is the difference between the market value of the goods contracted for, and of the goods delivered: Ogden v. Beatty, 137 Pa. 197; Loucheim v. Becker, 3 W. N. 449; Hopple v. Bunting, 3 W. N. 472; Sitgreaves v. Griffith, 2 W. N. 705.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-10\">The defendant\u2019s allegation that \u201c the goods were unsuited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>to his purpose,\u201d even supposing there was a warranty that thej should be, does not necessarily imply any damage because he kept the goods and had the benefit of their market value. Nor did he return nor offer to return them to his vendor. The price for which he'sold them could not affect the vendor unless that was the market price : Loucheim v. Becker, 3 W. N. 449; Sitgreaves v. Griffith, 2 W. N. 705; Hopple v. Bunting, 3 W. N. 472.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-5\">The time and place of making the contract, or the authority of the so-called agent to make the contract, are not shown; neither is it stated why the defendant had no opportunity to examine the goods, whether it was of their physical situation at the time, or whether pleasure, inclination or other business prevented. His silence on this point is to be taken against him, under the. principle that \u201cwhen two different meanings present themselves that one should be taken which is most unfavorable to the party pleading: \u201d Manners v. Library Co., 93 Pa. 175.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-6\">Mere representations as to quality of a specific article sold do not constitute warranty : Kaufman v. Cooper Iron Co., 105 Pa. 537; Wetherill v. Neilson, 20 Pa. 448; Endlich on Aff. Def. \u00a7 389; Bank v. Bartholomew, 2 W. N. 445; Black v. Halstead, 39 Pa. 64; Gould v. Gage, 118 Pa. 559.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Al1\">April 17, 1893:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Ahf\">Mr. Justice Thompson,</author>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The appellant was permitted to file two supplemental affidavits of defence and, making the most of the opportunity thus afforded him, has, by a process of evolution, succeeded in averring facts which constitute a defence in this ease. The suit is upon two promissory notes given to Mershon &amp; Co., in part payment for doors, blinds and moldings sold to appellant by them, whose agent the appellee was in making the sale. It is averred \u201c that the appellee is not the holder or owner for value before maturity, but the same were handed by Mershon &amp; Co., the payees, to him for the purpose of debarring appellant from a defence to the same.\u201d The language here used is identical with that used in Moeck v. Littell, 82 Pa. 356, in which it was said, viz.: \u201c This is not only an express averment that the defendant in error is not a purchaser for value of the note before it matured, but in substance the further avermen t that it is still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>the property of Rowley (the payee).\u201d As against Mershon &amp; Co., the payees, who are to be treated as the owner of these notes, tbei affidavits set forth with reasonable precision facts necessary to constitute a defence. They aver that the appellee as their agent made the sale of the doors, blinds and moldings in question to the appellant, under the express warranty and agreement that they were in size and dimensions like other doors, blinds and moldings being used in a large building operation, and were to be used therein. Mershon <em>&amp; Co. </em>were engaged in business at East Saginaw, Michigan, from which place the articles sold were to be shipped. The appellant avers that he had no opportunity to examine them before he gave the notes sued upon. The averment is thus made that at the time of the sale in question the appellee, as the agent of Mershon &amp; Co., made an express warranty and agreement as to the size and kinds of articles sold to appellant. It is then averred that the articles were unsuitable for the purposes ordered and not as represented in size and kind, and* that in consequence the appellant was compelled to sell them. The specific loss on each of the articles thus sold is then set forth, and it is followed by the averment that the prices for which they were sold were the best prices that could be obtained, and that they were all they were worth. The affidavits thus aver an express warranty, its breach, and the damages resulting therefrom. They therefore state sufficient facts to send this case to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Judgment reversed and a procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
