In the caption of the amicable scire facias S. B. Harden and J. H. Harden were named as defendants and John Harden as terre tenant. The amicable scire facias was signed and sealed by plaintiff, by both of the original defendants and by John Harden, but without the words terre tenant after the latter\u2019s name. The entry on the judgment docket set out the names of all three of the defendants, one following the other, with the term and number of the ease after each of their names, with the same date of entry and the same amount for each, together with the fact that the proceeding was an amicable scire facias, but without naming any one as terre tenant.

The person searching the record would find the name of J. H. Harden, one of the original defendants, entered on the judgment docket, and John Harden not one of the original defendants entered immediately following, same number and term and same nature of case, viz.: am. sci. fa. A reference back to the. appearance docket would furnish all the facts necessary to give actual notice to the continuance of the lien. John Harden\u2019s deed was recorded, whereby notice was given that he was in fact a terre tenant of the land bound by the lien of the judgment.] [1] [An amicable action of revival had been entered which in its caption designated him as terre tenant and he had signed said am. sci. fa. True he had not added \u2018 terre tenant \u2019 or 4 T. T. \u2019 after his name, but he was in fact a terre tenant and the record of his deed, as well as the designation in the caption of the am. sci. fa. and the caption also of the appearance docket entry disclosed this fact. The judgment docket entries are for notice but they are.not the only means of acquiring notice.] [2] All the facts relating to a judgment are not and as a matter of necessity cannot be disclosed by the judgment docket. Releases, assignments, partial payments, rules and motions pending to open, strike off or satisfy judgment are not noted on the judgment docket. The entry on the judgment docket points to the appearance docket, where is found the formal entry of the judgment, with all the conditions or limitations as to the time of payment, stay of execution, etc., and all subsequent proceedings. [It seems to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>auditor idle to say that parties interested as purchasers, mortgagors or subsequent incumbrancers are to look to the judgment docket alone for all facts that may pertain to the judgment and stand arbitrarily on what that docket discloses.] [3] A judgment for $10,000, as shown by the judgment docket, may be all paid but $10.00 as shown by the appearance docket, and so with other facts relating or that might relate to any given case. [Surely the entry of the judgment No. 249, Sept. T., 1886, on the judgment docket against John Harden as well as against S. B. Harden and J. H. Harden, was constructive notice to all lien creditors of the existence of this judgment and its revival against John Harden, who in fact was a \u2018 terte tenant.\u2019 It seems to the auditor that this view is borne out by the decision in Mellon\u2019s Ap., 96 Pa. 475.] [4] [When John Holmes entered judgment No. 40, Feb. T., 1885, the judgment of C. E. White, No. 326 Sept T., 1881, against S. B. Harden and J. H. Harden appeared properly upon the records ; before any other judgments were entered against John Harden, this judgment appears properly revived against them, with John Harden\u2019s name added as a defendant therein, and was indexed in the judgment docket and noted at the entries of the original judgment. The judgment was therefore revived within five years \u2018 by agreement of the parties and terre tenant filed in writing and entered on the proper docket \u2019 as provided for by act of March 26,1827, Purdon\u2019s Digest, 946, section 5.] [5] [If now it can be maintained that there was an omission of a material nature in the revival of Mr. White\u2019s judgment, Mr. Holmes and other junior lien creditors may gain something, not by their diligence, but by the failure of John Harden to write \u2018 terre tenant\u2019 or \u2018 T. T.\u2019 after his name and to have the same so noted on the judgment docket. Until some imperative mandate of the law is disclosed commanding this to be done, the auditor would be unwilling to decree that Mr. White must lose his debt or any portion of it.] [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-4\">\u201c The auditor therefore finds as a matter of law that the judgment of C. E. White, No. 249 Sept. T., 1886, was a proper rival of judgment No. 326, Sept. T., 1891, and that said judgment was at the time of, said sheriff\u2019s sale the first lien on the land sold.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-5\">John Holmes excepted to the findings of the auditor as above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-6\">The court dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the report, in an opinion by Peck, P.

This was his duty: Wood v. Reynolds, 7 W. &amp; S. 406; Ridgway\u2019s Ap., 15 Pa. 181; Heil &amp; Lauer\u2019s Ap., 40 Pa. 453; Hutchinson\u2019s Ap., 92 Pa. 186; Kistler v.

B. Harden and J. H. Harden was preserved by the revival as against them and John Harden, terre tenant. The amicable scire facias described exactly the names of the parties, the term and number of the case, and the date and amount of the judgment as revived, and this is all that is required by the act. The entry on the judgment docket sets out the names of all three of the defendants, one following the other and all being defendants in the same judgment, No. 249, Sept. T., 1886, the same date of entry and the same amount for each, together with the fact that the proceeding was an am. sci. fa.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">One of these defendants was John Harden, the same person against whom the appellant\u2019s lien is claimed. By referring to the amicable sci. fa. upon which the judgment was revived, it appears that John Harden is there described as \u201cterre tenant\u201d in the captiop of the case which names the parties, and the amicable sci. fa., with confession of judgment contained therein, is signed and sealed by the plaintiff, by both of the original defendants and by John Harden. The necessary legal meaning of all this is that John Harden confesses judgment for $526.15, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>in favor of C. E. White in a proceeding to revive a prior judgment, against him as terre tenant, and the other two parties as original defendants. If any authority is needed to sustain the lien of a judgment thus revived, it is found both in Mellon\u2019s Appeal, 96 Pa. 475, and Dietrich\u2019s Appeal, 107 Pa. 174.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajqh\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
