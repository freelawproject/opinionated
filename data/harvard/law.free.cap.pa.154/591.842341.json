R. Bryan in payment of a large lot of lumber purchased by the defendant; that at the time said lumber was purchased it was thrown together in a large pile, and owing to. the manner in which the lumber was piled it was impossible for the defendant to make a measurement of it to ascertain its quantity or quality,' and he was therefore obliged to depend almost entirely upon the representations of the said Bryan, as to both the quantity and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>quality of the same. The settlement was made and the note in controversy given, before the lumber was moved by the defendant ; that after defendant moved the lamber and measured the same, he found it was lacking several hundred feet of the amount of feet which the said Bryan represented it to contain. The defendant also found on investigation that the quality of the lumber was not as represented by the said Bryan; that much of it was greatly damaged by knots and sap so that it was totally unfit for the purposes for which it was intended ; that at the time the note was given the said Bryan agreed with the defendant that unless the lumber proved to be as he represented it, he would make a reduction in the note at maturity, in such an amount as would compensate the defendant in the loss he had sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-5\">\u201c The affiant further alleges that he has abundant reason to believe that the note in controversy was not passed over to the plaintiffs in this action for value received, but that they simply hold the same for the purposes of collection, and in order to prevent him from defending against it in the hands of th'e payee, who is the true and lawful owner of the same. All of which matters and things the defendant expects to be able to prove on the trial of this cause.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-6\">The court below filed the following opinion by Hemphill, J. :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIzU\">\u201cWe do not think we can make the rule to strike off the judgment absolute, at this time.

L. 270, was necessarily repealed by the procedure act of 1887. They embrace the same subject, the filing of affidavits of defence and entering judgment for default thereof, and their provisions can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>not stand together without establishing two methods of practice for reaching precisely the same result, or making a mongrel method which is not the one prescribed by either statute. A single instance of the incongruity of the two acts will suffice. Under the act of 1887 the plaintiff must file not only a copy of the writing, if there be one, on which his case is founded, but also a concise statement of his demand, which must include every ingredient of a good cause of action, Byrne v. Hayden, 124 Pa. 170, averred with the same completeness, accuracy and precision that were required in a declaration at common law: Fritz v. Hathaway, <em>135 </em>Pa. 274. To the cause of action of which he is thus explicitly informed, the defendant is entitled to and must have, under any circumstances, not less than fifteen days to make affidavit of his defence. On the other hand under the second section of the act of 1862 the plaintiff by merely filing a copy of the instrument of writing five days before the return day, may have judgment at any time after that day unless defendant has filed his affidavit. Thus with less information as to what case he is called upon to meet, the. defendant is cut down to one third of his time to meet it. Such a result is not only repugnant to the plain letter of the act of 1887, but is destructive of its general intent as declared in Marlin v. Waters, 127 Pa. 177, and other cases, to produce uniformity of practice. As the two acts cannot stand together, the result is that section two of the act of 1862 comes under the operation of the repeal in section 9 of the act of 1887, P. L. 272, and such seems to have been the correct view of the learned court below, in framing its rule upon this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The judgment in the present case therefore cannot be sustained by the act of 1862, and we have next to consider whether it is regular under the act of 1887. The summons and a copy of the statement were served on Aug. 24th, the return day was Sept. 4th, and the judgment was entered on Sept. 12th. There were therefore more than fifteen days between the service of the copy of the statement and the entry of judgment, and the return day had intervened. This was the exact state of facts in Weigley v. Teal, 125 Pa. 498, in which the judgment was held to be regular. The act specifies a service of a copy of the statement on defendant at least fifteen days before the return day, and in the next section a filing of the statement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>with notice to defendant, on or any time after the return day, \u25a0but is silent as to either service or filing less than fifteen days before the return day. In Weigley v. Teal however it was held that the act did not mean to leave a hiatus of fourteen days before the return day, during which plaintiff\u2019s progress was suspended, but that its true intent and substantial requirement were the allowance of fifteen days time to the defendant in which to make his affidavit, with service of copy before the return day, or notice of filing after it, as held in Marlin v. Waters, 127 Pa. 177. The present ease is on all fours with Weigley v. Teal, and the judgment is unquestionably regular .under that authority, unless a different result is produced by the rule of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">This rule was apparently framed to meet the requirements of the act of 1887, and like that act it makes no express provision for judgment where the service of the statement is less than fifteen days before the return day. The court however seems to have construed its rule in the same way that this court construed the act of 1887 in Weigley v. Teal, and we cannot say that that was error, especially in view of the fact that the learned judge took ample care that the defendant should not suffer through surprise, by allowing him ten days in which to file a supplemental affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">It is further argued for appellant that the statement is insufficient. It certainly lacks precision. The averment that the note \u201c was delivered to the said E. R. Bryan who then and there for a valuable consideration indorsed the same to the plaintiff,\u201d does not distinctly set up an indorsement and delivery before maturity, and in fact is less specific than a common law declaration, and might therefore have been demurrable. But the defect was not inherently fatal, and the defendant did not demur but set up a defence on the merits. His affidavit for that purpose was insufficient. The facts set out do not make a case of fraudulent circulation of the note, so as to put .plaintiff on proof of bona fide holding, but at most amount to partial failure of consideration which was not a defence against the plaintiff unless he was not the bona fide holder. Such defence must be specifically set up by the affidavit, and the established and approved form in which this should be done, is either to set forth the facts themselves affirmatively for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>court to judge of, or if the affiant cannot state them of his own knowledge, that he is informed, <em>believes and expects to be able to prove </em>them. The defendant, or his counsel, who departs from this approved form, and substitutes another which he may think a full equivalent, does so at his own risk. In the present case the phrase that affiant \u201c has abundant reason to believe \u201d is not an equivalent. What a suspicious defendant may consider abundant reason to question plaintiff\u2019s title, may fall far short of the legal requirements for the court. As this defect was pointed out by the learned judge below in his opinion, and the defendant allowed ten days in which to strengthen his affidavit, but failed to do so, we may fairly conclude that he could not.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
