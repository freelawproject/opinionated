The notes were indorsed by the Penn Bank, but shortly after they were given the bank closed its doors, and accountants proceeded to collect the collateral notes and pay the notes made by them, and have realized from these collections more than enough to pay all of said notes. Amongst the notes made by accountants for said bank were four promissory notes, which were discounted by the Germania Savings Bank a few days before the failure of the Penn Bank, but whose proceeds were never paid over to the Penn Bank by said Germania Bank, it having on the last business day prior to the Penn Bank failure given its cheek on other banks of that city to the order of the Penn Bank of said proceeds, but on the day of the failure, May 26th, stopped payment of said checks. The accountants were directors of the Penn Bank; had negotiated the discount of said notes by the Germania Bank, and knew the facts with respect to the nonpayment of said proceeds and the giving and stoppage of payment of said checks, and they also knew that the exceptant (the assignee of the Penn Bank) denied the liability of either the Penn Bank or the accountants upon said notes held by the Germania Savings Bank, and maintained that accountants had no right to and should not pay said notes out of .the proceeds of said collateral.

The latter check was on that day deposited with the Farmers Deposit National Bank and a deposit account opened. The Penn Bank cleared through the Farmers.

An analysis of the testimony of these witnesses is as follows: Seibert: Discounted notes. Personally did not conduct negotiations. Only knew.what I heard and saw. J. O. Brown: On committee to go to banks and get proceeds of discount of $289,000 of \"paper. Did not go to Germania. It was not on the list. When the committee returned to the Penn Bank they asked W. N. Riddle about the Germania, and received for a reply, that is another matter. We could get no money from that bank. Laughlin\u2019s testimony is of the same 'import.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-5\">\u201c Mr. Meyran, the president of the Germania Bank, and the man who carried on the negotiations, testifies that the discount was made on condition that the Penn Bank would pay the $88,000 check. \u2018 We were to hand over $40,000 and they were to pay the $88,000 check.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-6\">\u201c The utmost that can be claimed, under the testimony, is that the Germania Savings Bank agreed to discount these four notes on condition that the $88,000 cashier\u2019s check of the Penn Bank should be paid. The testimony of Brown and Laughlin amounts to notliiug as to the alleged agreement of discount, except as some evidence in corroboration of Mr. Meyran, that the discount was on condition that the $88,000 check should be paid. Mr. Meyran does not say that the proceeds of the discount were to be credited on the note of $88,000, or applied to its part payment. \u2018 Q. In what way did you arrange to carry out the bargain that your check of $88,000 of the Penn Bank was to be paid, and, at the same time, the Penn Bank was to open and get the proceeds of these four notes ? A. Why, we just simply handed over our $40,000, the proceeds of these notes, and they would pay us our check of $88,000.\u2019 When questioned by counsel, he says this was to be carried out through the clearing house. His bank depositing its $88,000 check in the Farmers Bank, through which the Penn Bank cleared, and giving two cheeks for the proceeds to the Penn Bank. Now, Mr. Meyran knew that there would be other checks of the Penn Bank that would meet in the clearinghouse, and the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>ceeds of the discount of the four notes would be as available to pay these as to pay the #88,000 check. That is the operation of the clearing house as explained by him,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-5\">\u201cOf course, if the Penn Bank had sufficient credits to meet the debits or supplied the cash to make up the deficiency, on Monda}\u00bb-, May 26, 1884, all the checks on it, including the #88,000 cashier\u2019s check belonging to the Germania Bank, would have been paid. But such operation of the clearing house is certainly not an application, express or implied, of one particular check to another.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-6\">\u201c The Germania Bank refused to receive back from the Farmers Bank the #88,000 check, and at No. 254 Sept, term, 1885, brought suit against the Farmers Bank for the amount of the deposit in the pass book received by it, when it deposited the #88,000 check. Mr. Meyran makes the affidavit of claim and counter affidavit, in which he claims for the whole amount. This is certainly inconsistent with a theory that the proceeds of the discount of the four notes were to be applied on this #88,000, for then there was a credit due on the check of #42,500 as the Germania Bank had not paid out one dollar on notes discounted. At that time, i. e., 1884, the Germania Bank claimed by its actions that it had not deposited the #88,000 check for collection, because it refused to receive back the check, objected to the Farmers Bank charging it back to it, brought suit against the Farmers Bank for the full amount of the check, and drew on it for the sum of #2,400. Such a course of action seems to the master to be inconsistent with an application of the proceeds of the discount to the #88,000 check, but it does seem consistent with Mr. Meyran\u2019s testimony: \u2018We were just to hand over our cash and they were to pay the #88,000 check.\u2019 If that be not correct, why did they have Eeiber, cashier, sign a proceeds cheek, and then give him two other checks to get cashed? If the discount was not a cash one, why did the Germania Bank not at once credit the Penn Bank.with the proceeds of the four notes as against the #88,000 check it then had in its possession? The Penn Bank opened Friday, May 28,1884, about 2 o\u2019clock p. M., and remained open all day Saturday; during all this time the #88,000 check could have been presented at the counter of the Penn Bank and the balance above the proceeds of the discount of the four notes would have been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>\u201c The Germania Bank itself, as shown by its books, did not act on the theory that the proceeds were to be applied to the payment of the $88,000 check. It was not until December 5, 1889, that it made any application thereto on its own books.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-5\">\u201c The master, therefore, finds the facts :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-6\">\u201c (1) [That the discount of the four joint and several promissory notes of Thomas Hare et al. to the order of the Penn Bank for $10,625, each, at thirty, sixty, ninety days, and four months, was a cash discount,'on condition that the cashier\u2019s check of the Penn Bank for $88,000, then in its possession, would be paid,] [2] but there was no express or implied agreement to apply the proceeds of the discount to the $88,000 check; that the Penn Bank did not pay said check for $88,000, and, thereupon, the Germania Savings Bank refused to pay the proceeds of the discount and stopped payment of the checks given therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-7\">\u201c (2) [That this agreement of discount was made by a committee of the directors of the Penn Bank, representing the Penn Bank and the makers of the notes, and that the makers of the notes were parties to the agreement.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-8\">\u201c It is contended on the part of exceptant that the failure of the Penn Bank to pay the $88,000 check, and the stoppage of payment by the Germania Savings Bank of the checks given, was a rescission of the contract of discount, and there could be no recovery on the notes, either against,the Penn Bank or the makers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-9\">\u201c In Dougherty v. Central Bank, 98 Pa. 227, it was held upon analogy of the vendor\u2019s right of stoppage in transitu that where a lender before he pays over money on a borrower\u2019s note discovers that the borrower is insolvent, he may tender back the discounted note and refuse payment to the borrower, and the latter\u2019s assignee has no superior rights to him in the matter. \u2018 The consideration so failed that the defendant was warranted in tendering it (the note) back, and an equity arises against the legal plaintiffs which prevents their enforcement of the contract.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-10\">\u201cThe same principle is decided in Lancaster National Bank v. Huver, Assignee, 114 Pa. 216. In the latter case a voluntary assignment had occurred between the discount and before the withdrawal of the money. The assignee, however, had no higher standing than the assignor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>\u201c Were there nothing more in this case than that Thomas Hare et al. were accommodation makers, and the proceeds of the discount had not been paid to the Penn Bank, the payee, the master would have no hesitation in holding that the action of the Germania Savings Bank was a rescission of the whole contract, and it should not only return the notes, but, also, charge off the discount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-5\">\u201c But [the makers of the notes were not only accommodation makers of the notes, but were also parties to the contract \u2018 We will discount your paper if you pay our check.\u2019 The Germania Savings Bank might well say: \u2018 We will stop our monejr going into the coffers of an insolvent bank, and hold the makers of the notes to see to the payment of the $88,000 check.\u2019] [4] The $88,000 check had not been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-6\">\u201c Again: The party now claiming that the contract of discount was rescinded is the assignee of the Penn Bank. He claimed that the banks upon which the Germania Savings Bank had given checks were liable to him for the amounts thereof, and compelled the Farmers Deposit National Bank to bring suits thereon. If he, as representative of the Penn Bank, had attempted to rescind, he would have had to tender back the two checks within a reasonable time. He was not in position to do so. It is not until after an adverse decision of the Supreme Court in January, 1888, that there is any suggestion that the contract was rescinded. The master is, therefore, of the opinion that the nonpayment of the proceeds of discount was not a rescission of the contract of discount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-7\">\u201c We come now to the consideration of the questions: (1) Did the failure to pay over the proceeds of discount give the Penn Bank, the payee, a defence to the payment of the notes? (2) Was such defence available to the makers? (3) Independently of the above, had the makers a defence?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-8\">\u201cThe Penn Bank claims a defence in that it did not receive the proceeds of discount. The proceeds were carried on the books of the Germania Bank to the credit of G. L. Reiber, cashier.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-9\">The accountant\u2019s claim: (1) That the discount made the Germania Bank complete purchasers of the notes and the party for whom the discount is made the owner of the proceeds. This proposition is sustained by the cases of Heil v. Girard Bank, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>80 Pa. 186 ; Carstairs v. Bates, 3 Campbell, 301; St. Louis, etc., Co. v. Johnston, 27 Fed. R. 243, but these were cases between the bank and its customer. The proceeds are credited to the account of the customer. He gets a new credit and can check on the same. In those cases, although the bank became insolvent, as in St. Louis, etc., Co., v. Johnston, before any of the proceeds were drawn, yet the maker could not get back his paper and be charged with the proceeds. The principle of those cases does not seem to the master to apply to this case because this was a special discount for a special purpose, and was for cash; the giving of checks for the proceeds shows that fact. The mere entry in the books of a charge does not vary the transaction. \u2018 There is no magic in bookkeeping \u2019 \u2014 especially bank bookkeeping, as illustrated by the Penn Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-5\">\u201c (2) That in a suit by the Penn Bank against the Ger-mania Bank for the proceeds of discount the latter could have set off or defalcated the $88,000 check. That is, no doubt, true, if the Germania Bank had the check, but it did not, and at that time disclaimed ownership of it. At the time the notes were paid by the makers, the $88,000 check had already been set off against the Penn Bank deposit for $23,318.29, and a certificate for the balance in favor of the Farmers Deposit National Bank. The $88,000 check could not be set off again : Simes v. Zane, 24 Pa. 242.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-6\">\u201c Thus far the Penn Bank, the pa}ree, had a defence to the notes, therefore the accommodation makers could avail themselves of such defence. They are treated as sureties. As a general rule, at least, a surety is allowed to stand upon the rights of his principal, and set up any defence that the principal could: Gunnis v. Weigley, 114 Pa. 191.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-7\">\u201c So far the master has considered the case independent of the condition attached to the discount, to wit, \u2018 we will discount your paper if jmu pay our $88,000 check.\u2019 [As was said before, this was not an ordinary discount; it was coupled with a condition, and that condition had sufficient consideration to support it; that, even on the failure to pay over the cash proceeds of the discount, the Penn Bank could not have recovered either of the notes in an action of replevin, or their value in trover, without fulfilling the conditions of the contract.] [6] Thei\u2019efore the Penn Bank had not a complete defence to the notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>\u201cAssume, however, that the master is wrong in this, we come to the question, had the makers of the notes any defence thereto independently of the Penn Bank defences ? ; The mak-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-5\">er of an accommodation note cannot set up the want of consideration as a defence against it in the hands of a third person, though it be there as collateral security merely. He who chooses to put himself in the front .of a negotiable instrument for the benefit of his friend must abide the consequences, and has no more right to complain if his friend accommodates himself by pledging it for an old debt than if he had used it in any other way.\u2019 Accommodation paper is a loan of the maker\u2019s credit without restriction as to the manner of its use: Lord v. Ocean Bank, 20 Pa. 384. As between the maker and the payee there is an available defence, but the maker cahnot complain of a subsequent holder when called upon to perform all that he has promised: Moore v. Baird, 30 Pa. 138.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-6\">\u201c That, in the opinion of the master, is the decisive point in this case. While it may be doubtful whether or not the Ger-mania Savings Bank is a third party within the ruling of Lord v. Ocean Bank, and that line of cases; but assume that it is not, then the accommodation makers could have set up the failure to pay over the proceeds of discount; [but how could they defend against the other consideration, to wit: To pay the $88,000 check ? They were parties to this agreement, and until the $88,000 check was paid could not defend against payment of the notes.] [11] For this reason the master is of the opinion that the credit should be allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-7\">In answer to an exception by appellant, the master further found \u201c that the Germania Savings Bank knew at and after the time it agreed to discount the four notes in question that the makers of said notes were accommodation makers.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-8\">Exceptions, among others, to the findings as above in brackets, were dismissed, and a decree entered in accordance with the recommendation of the master.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-9\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were dismissing exceptions, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-10\"><em>H.
