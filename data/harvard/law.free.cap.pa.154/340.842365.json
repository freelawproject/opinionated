Gerhard et ah, executors of George S. Pepper, deceased. [Reported below, 1 Dist. R. 148.] The adjudication was as follows, by Ferguson, J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-12\">\u201c The testator gave: \u2018 To the Academy of the Pennsylvania Fine Arts, $50,000, inclusive of the note of the academy.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-13\">\u201c It appeared that the testator, at the time of his death, held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>the note of the academy for the sum of eight thousand dollars for money loaned to it. The executors, therefore, when paying the above legacy deducted the amount of said note and only paid to the legatee the sum of forty-two thousand dollars. It is now claimed on behalf of the legatee that the testator meant to give it $50,000, in addition to the note. The whole question then is one of etymology, as to the meaning of the word \u2018 inclusive \u2019 in the clause of the will; whether it means that the note is included in the legacy of $50,000, or, that the legacy is given exclusive of the note. The auditing judge must give to the word its generally accepted meaning, in which sense it must be presumed that the testator used it. Webster defines \u2018 inclusive \u2019 to mean 4 inclosing, encircling, comprehending the stated limit or extremes, as from Monday to Saturday inclusive, that is taking in both Monday and Saturday.\u2019 Giving to the word this meaning, this clause must be interpreted as meaning that the note was to be included in the legaejr. This claim for an additional allowance of $8,000 is, therefore, not allowed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-3\">Exceptions to adjudication were dismissed by the court, in an opinion (adopting the opinion of the auditing judge) by Hanna, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-4\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were dismissal of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-5\"><em>Charles Henry </em>Hart, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao4\">Testator used the word :inclusive \u201d the same as, or synonymous with,44 and \u201d or44 with,\u201d and this is its correct etymological significance.

In other words, he meant to give the appellant its note for $8,000 and $42,000 in cash, which together make up the legacy of $50,000. Giving to the word \u201c inclusive \u201d its accepted meaning, the note was to be included in the legacy, and form a part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The decree is affirmed and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
