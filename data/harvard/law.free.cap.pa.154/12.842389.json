The ground in question, between Park avenue and Thirteenth street was originally a part of the whole lot between Twelfth street and Park avenue, and between Lehigh avenue and Somerset street, as shown by plan No. 2. That Thirteenth street was put upon the city plan of the present width in' 1832, but was not opened until July 15, 1890, by ordinance. That Thirteenth street has since been graded and paved and curbed. That Park avenue, Lehigh avenue, and Twelfth street are all opened and paved. That the whole property was inclosed previous to the opening in 1890 under one inclosure, and was used for the general purposes of the society, and that the lot against which the claim is filed has since the opening of Thirteenth street been used on anniversary occasions, which are largely attended, and from which a large part of the income of the institution is derived, as a place to hitch horses and carriages, and has been put to no other use. That the buildings of the defendant are all upon the lot to the east of Thirteenth street, and are practically .as shown upon the city plan in evidence, and there are no buildings of any kind on the lot in question. The whole of the ground was purchased in 1866, and the institution was founded and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>maintained as a charity. That the work which the plaintiff did was done under ordinance of November 12, 1890. The jury find that the plaintiff did the work for which the claim is filed and that he has not received anything on account.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AW7\">Judgment for plaintiff on special verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was (1) above entry of judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-6\"><em>M.

School District, 90 Pa. 21; Donohugh\u2019s Ap., 86 Pa. 306; Episcopal Academy v. City, 150 Pa. 565.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-7\">The opening of Thirteenth street through the grounds of defendant does not divide the plant into two separate and distinct pieces of property: Northampton Co. v. Lehigh Coal &amp; Nav. Co., 75 Pa. 461; Gas Co. v. Chester Co., 97 Pa. 476; Erie Co. v. Erie City, 113 Pa. 360; Olive Cemetery Co. v. City, 93 Pa. 129; Orphan Asylum Ap., 111 Pa. 144; Erie City v.

The fact that the ground has been used and is still used to any extent is conclusive that it is necessary. The actual use determines the necessity, as the greater always includes the less: Mullen v. Erie Co. Com., 85 Pa. 288; Pa. R. R. v.

The verdict finds, inter alia, that the whole of the ground belonging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>to the appellant was purchased in 1866 and the institution was founded and is maintained as a charity. Section 1, article 9, of the constitution declares that the \u201c general assembly may by general laws exempt from taxation public property used for public purposes, actual places of religious worship, places of burial not used or held for private or corporate profit, and institutions of purely public charity.\u201d The special verdict finds that this institution is maintained as a charity. It does not find, however, that it is a public, much less a purely public charity. Aside from this, the lot charged with this street improvement is separated from that of the institution by an intervening street. It may be regarded, therefore, as a mere vacant lot upon an adjoining street with nothing to show that it is necessary to the use of the charity.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-14\">Cf.
