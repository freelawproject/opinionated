That, upon the contrary, the agreement shows that the plaintiffs agreed to establish a millwork department, to be operated upon joint account between plaintiff and defendant; that at the time of the making \u2022 of the agreement attached to plaintiff\u2019s statement marked \u2018 exhibit B \u2019 it Was expressly stipulated and agreed that the plaintiff should contribute twenty thousand dollars towards the establishment of the millwork department of the business mentioned in said agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-6\">\u201c That instead of contributing said sum in cash it was to be contributed in stock as mentioned i!n \u2018 exhibit B \u2019 at the prices mentioned in said \u2018 exhibit B,\u2019 that through accident or mistake the said amount was omitted from the agreement and defendant was not aware qf its omission until within a short time before suit was brought, when defendant\u2019s attention was called to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-7\">\u201c That said amount had been recognized and treated by plaintiff as capital to be operated upon joint account, and at the end of each year defendants rendered statements and paid plaintiffs their share of profits of said business ; that accordingly defendants are advised, informed and believe that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>said agreement constitutes a partnership in law and in fact, and is therefore not the subject for which an action in law can be maintained in the present action. That defendant has been winding up said millwork business and cannot tell at this time whether anything or how much will be due to plaintiffs. That the matters alleged in plaintiff\u2019s statement and included in the invoices attached thereto were the very materials furnished for said business so operated upon joint account, and the excess of amount over twenty thousand dollars were purchases made by defendants, and for which settlements had been made by defendants to plaintiffs, and that said amount has remained and was operated upon the joint account of plaintiffs and defendants until the death of Mr. Benjamin F. Taylor, and owing to the condition of his individual estate and the settlement of the outstanding accounts, defendant is and has been unable to tell how said joint account stands.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-4\">The court discharged a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was discharge of above rule.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-6\"><em>Ezekiel Sunn, Jr., Richard B.

The plaintiff claimed some twenty thousand dollars for goods sold and delivered to the defendants. The affidavit of defence admitted the receipt of the goods and alleged that they were furnished to the defendants, not as purchasers, but as managers of a business entered upon for the benefit of both parties, and as the contribution to the stock of that business which the plaintiffs had undertaken to make. It further alleged that this stipulation had been omitted from the written contract, entered into by the parties, by mistake. If these allegations are sustained upon the trial by'the sort of evidence necessary to reform a written contract they will make a complete answer to the action. The learned judge of the court below was therefore clearly right in refusing to enter judgment in this case for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, and the judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
