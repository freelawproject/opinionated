Averring that James Rogers was of sound and disposing mind; was not unduly influenced and that no application had been made to the register to revoke probate and letters testamentary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-13\">The opinion of the court below was as follows, by Schuyler, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-14\">\u201c This controversy comes before us on an appeal from the decision of the register admitting to probate as the last will and testament of the decedent a certain paper writing of which the following is a copy: \u2018Pen Argyl, August 14, 1887. High James Rogers do give to John Jackson Sr. my property known as the Pen argyl Hotel and the land ajoining in Pen argyl Northampton Co. P. A. (Signed) James Rogers.\u2019 We are now asked to direct a precept for an issue to the common pleas to try two questions, first, whether at the time said paper was executed by the decedent he was of a sound and disposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>mind, and, second, whether said paper is the last will of the decedent. As to the first question we think the evidence is not up to the required standard to entitle the appellant to an issue. <em>We </em>so hold on the authority of Keating\u2019s Appeal, 2 Mona. 4, a case in many of its features wonderfully like the present.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-5\">\u201c Whether or not the probated paper is the last will of the decedent is a more serious question. On its face it certainly presents none of the characteristics of a will. \u2018 It is true that no formal words are necessary in order to make a valid will; the form of the instrument is immaterial if its substance is testamentary:\u2019 Patterson v. English, 71 Pa. 458. But here the substance is not testamentary. \u2018 A gift or bequest after death is of the very essence of a will, and determines a writing, whatever its form, to be testamentary: \u2019 lb. Here we have no gift or bequest after death, but a present gift. It is claimed by the appellee, however, that the surrounding circumstances show that the gift was not to take effect until after the death of the decedent. We are by no means clear that the paper can be helped in this way, but, conceding that it may be, the inference from these surrounding circumstances, although the facts may be undisputed, must unquestionably be drawn by a jury. In questions of negligence certain facts when established amount to negligence per se, that is, where the precise duty is determinate and the same under all circumstances, and in such cases the court must determine the question; but intent is always a question for the jury, except where it is to be gathered from the terms of an unambiguous writing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-6\">\u201c In Patterson v. English, supra, an issue was granted to try the question whether a paper, not testamentary on its face, was a last will and testament; so in Murry v. Murry, 6 Watts. 353. We think it best to follow these precedents, although when the time comes it may be the duty of the court to direct the verdict, on the theory that the question whether the writing in controversy is the last will of the decedent must be decided on the contents of the writing alone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-7\">\u201c A point was made at the hearing that the appellant had not proved himself to be a party in interest. There is nothing in this point. The evidence shows that the decedent introduced the appellant to a number of different persons as his son. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>There is no evidence that he is an illegitimate son, and in the absence of such evidence we will not presume it. The presumption is in favor of innocence, which carries with it the presumption of legitimacy. That this preliminary question is for the court is clearly indicated in Taylor v. Com., 108 Pa. 101, if authority is needed for so plain a proposition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-5\">[\u201cAnd now, June 13,1892, the court directs a precept for an issue to the court of common pleas to try the question whether the paper in controversy is or is not the last will and testament of James Rogers, the decedent, in which issue the appellees shall be the plaintiffs and the appellant the defendant.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-6\">John Jackson, Sr., thereupon took this appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-7\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1) in directing a precept for an issue to the common pleas to determine whether the paper in controversy was the last will and testament of James Rogers, upon petition of John Tozer, before awarding an issue upon demand of respondent to determine whether said John Tozer was a person interested and not a mere volunteer; (2) in refusing to award an issue preliminary upon the request of appellee to determine the question whether John Tozer, the petitioner, was an heir at law of said James Rogers and a person interested under the act of assembly; (8) in assuming jurisdiction and awarding an issue, before the register had been petitioned to revoke the probate of said alleged will and testament of James Rogers, and letters of administration c. t. a. to Richard Jackson; quoting the decree, etc.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b244-8\"><em>Henry W.

No doubt, if relationship is undisputed or admitted, whether a petitioner is a \u201c person interested \u201d under the act, is a question of law for the court: Simmon\u2019s Est., 4 Clark, 204; Taylor v.

A mere naked allegation without evidence or against evidence cannot create a dispute within the meaning of the law: Knight\u2019s Ap., 19 Pa. 494; Cozzen\u2019s Will, 61 Pa. 196.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-3\">The orphans\u2019 court having acquired jurisdiction of this controversy, the whole matter was before that tribunal de novo. Its proceedings are analogous to those of the old register\u2019s court in the preliminary stages of the inquiry. Where any question of kindred, or disputable and difficult matter comes into controversy before any register he shall, at the request of any person interested, appoint a register\u2019s court for the decision thereof,\u201d etc: 2 Rhone O. C. Pr. 437. Now the orphans\u2019 court decides, first, whether the contestant is a party interested. If it decides that he is not, then there is an end of the controversy so far as he is concerned. If it decides that he is, then the issue is framed, under the direction of the court.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A-J\">April 3, 1893:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"ACp\">Mr. Justice Williams,</author>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The question raised in this case is one of practice. It appears from the petition and answer that James Rogers, a resident and property owner in Pen Argyl, Northampton county, committed suicide in his own house on the sixth day. of September, 1887. At the time his body was discovered an envelope was found in the same room directed to John Jackson, Sr. Inclosed in this envelope was a paper in the handwriting of Rogers which was presented by Mr. Jackson to the register for probate as the will of the decedent. Letters of administration cum testamento annexo were issued to Richard Jackson, who proceeded to settle the estate and file his administration account. John Jackson claimed to be the owner of the property of which Rogers died seized, as the sole devisee named in the paper' which had been probated. A little less than five-years after the death of Rogers, one John Tozer came from his home in England to Northampton county and appealed from the decree of probate. He presented his petition in the orphans\u2019 court, in which he alleged that the true name of James Rogers was James Tozer; that he came from England some years before, leaving his fami- ^ ly behind him; that the petitioner was a son and heir of James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Tozer, known in Pen Argyl as James Rogers; that the paper under which John Jackson claimed was not the will of his father, as its execution had been procured by undug and improper influence; and asked that an issue devisavit vel non be directed to determine the validity of the alleged will. Jackson replied in an answer denying the facts set out in the petition, and putting them fairly in issue. He then asked the court to direct an issue to determine the question so raised, \u2019viz.: the identity of James Rogers with James Tozer, and the relationship of the petitioner to the deceased. The learned judge refused to direct this issue but at once directed the issue devisavit vel non. This is the ground of the present appeal. We have no doubt that the proper practice requires an issue to determine the relationship or interest of the proposed contestant, in the first instance, where the relationship or interest is denied, and where as in this case the prima facies are- against the petitioner. If John Tozer was the legitimate son and heir of James Rogers he had a right to be heard on the validity of the paper that had been admitted to probate, and operated to disinherit him. If he was not, then he had no standing, and his petition for an issue should have been dismissed as an impertinent attempt to interfere in what was no concern of his. It was proper therefore for Jackson to insist upon a determination of this question in limine. Both issues might have been directed, but that which was to determine the contestant\u2019s right to be heard should have been tried first, and if the result was adverse to the contestant the other should have been dismissed. This question was determined in Cullen\u2019s Estate, 12 W. N. 34, affirmed by this court in Taylor v. The Commonwealth, 13 W. N. 378.</p>\n<p id=\"AL5\">There was evidence given on the trial of this issue in the court below that would have been proper upon the trial of the issue asked by Jackson. It is before us. After an examination of it we are persuaded that it sustains the allegations made in the petition and. would justify if not require a jury to find in favor of the contestant\u2019s right to be heard as the son and heir at law of the decedent, known in Pen Argyl as James Rogers. It would tend therefore to protract litigation for no useful purpose, if we should reverse the learned judge for his refusal to award the issue asked for by the appellant. We have often held that we would not reverse for an error which did no real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>harm to the party complaining. We recognize however the rule contended for by the appellant as the correct one, and have no doubt that he was entitled to the preliminary issue he asked for. The reason why we do not reverse is that which w\u00e9 have already stated. It would be of no service to the appellant in view of the evidence before us, and would involve delay and expense to the parties to no real purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The appeal is dismissed, but without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">See also the next case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
