An application for the right of way over the roads of Foster township was presented by Harry E. Sweeney, president of the Union Street Railway Company, and also read to the supervisors. After discussing the matter, Patrick McFadden, one of the supervisors, moved that the right of way be granted to the Union Street Railway Company.

He stated that the agreement was signed by the supervisors at different times, and that he did not meet them together, but separately. It is not claimed that the supervisors acted in- pursuance of any resolution, adopted at a meeting of the board, but it is alleged that no deception or fraud was practiced in obtaining their signatures to the agreement, and that both supervisors fully understood its import and effect. And these allegations are sustained by the affidavits presented by the defendants, although denied by counter affidavits of the plaintiffs. The defendants claim that, by virtue of the agreement of January 5,1893, they are legally in possession of the right of way claimed by the plaintiff under the resolution of the supervisors, adopted more than a month later, on February 13, 1898.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-10\">\u201c Assuming that the agreement obtained by the defendants from the supervisors, on January 5,1893, is not invalid because of any fraud or misrepresentation, and, also, that the meeting of the supervisors on February 13,1893, was properly held, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>that the proceedings granting the right of way to the plaintiffs were had as certified to by township clerk, it then remains to inquire as to the legal force and effect of a contract entered into by township supervisors, separately, and without a meeting at which all were present for conference and consultation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-4\">\u201c The doctrine of the common law is, that when a power, authority or duty is confided by law to a number of persons, or' whenever a number of persons as officers are authorized or required by law to perform any act, such act may be done, and such power, authority or duty may be exercised and performed by a majority of such persons or officers, upon a meeting of all the persons or officers so entrusted or empowered, unless special provision is otherwise made: Keeler v. Frost &amp; Worden, 22 Barb. 400. In this case an assessment of a school tax was made by two trustees, in the absence of a third. The two made out and signed the warrant for the collection of the tax, which was then carried by one of them to the third trustee, who also signed it. It was held that the assessment was'void, and that the trustees were trespassers in issuing the warrant, and seizing and selling property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-5\">\u201c And the rule of the law on this subject is stated by Judge Dillon (Dillon on M. C., vol. 1, p. 360), as follows: \u2018 An act of a public nature, which is to be performed by a committee, may, where purely ministerial, be performed by members of the committee acting separately, and by a majority of the members. But, as a general rule, where the act requires the exercise of judgment, the members of the committee must convene, or be notified to convene, and confer on the subject, and a majority thus convened will constitute a quorum,\u2019 etc. See Martin v. Lemon, 26 Conn. 192. And in Gallup v. Tracy, 25 Conn. 16, while, for special reasons existing in the case, the rule thus stated was held not to apply, Ellsworth, J., said: \u2018We make no question that the general principle of the law is, that public agents may act by majorities where all are present, or where all have notice to be present; and generally not otherwise.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-6\">\u201c In the case of the turnpike road, decided by our own Supreme Court in 1813, and reported in 5 Binney, 484, Tilg-hman, C. J., said: \u2018 When several persons are authorized to do an act of a public nature, which requires deliberation, they all should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>be convened, because the advice and opinions of all may he useful, though all do not unite in opinion.\u2019' In this case a clear distinction is recognized between matters purely ministerial and those of a deliberative nature. See also Cooper v. Lampeter Township, 8 Watts, 128.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-4\">\u201c In Union Tpwnship v. Gibboney, 94 Pa. 537, Trun key, J., said: \u2018 One supervisor cannot bind the township for performance of a contract, the propriety of entering into which is the subject of deliberation and the exercise of judgment; but he may in matters purely ministerial. When the business requires deliberation, consultation and judgment all should be convened, because the advice and opinion of all may be useful. Before constructing a new bridge, they must meet and act as a hoard, for this can only be done on deliberation and consultation, and with the asse\u00f1t of both, or a majority. But the ordinary repairs of roads and bridges, and opening roads authorized by the court, are classed with ministerial duties, and may be performed by one.\u2019 See also Hopewell Township v. Putt, 2 W. N. 46.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-5\">\u201c In view of the rule thus established it would seem to follow that the contract entered into between the supervisors of Foster township and the Hazleton and North Side Electric Railway Company, on January 5,1893, was invalid and without force. It was not the joint act of the supervisors, authorized at a formal meeting of the board properly convened, after deliberate consideration, but the separate act of the two supervisors in their personal and individual capacities, and at different times. The only valid and lawful grant of the right of way over the road in question was that conferred upon the Union Street Railway Company by the resolution adopted at the meeting of the supervisors on January 13,1893, and for this reason the motion to continue the injunction must be granted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in continuing the injunction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-7\"><em>Geo. E. </em>Troutman, <em>G. R. Bedford </em>with him, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5i\">Deliberation and concurrence of both supervisors was all that was necessary. The authorities cited in the opinion of the court below go no further, as an examination of them will show. Martin v. Lemon, 26 Conn. 192, was a case where one member of a committee of three selectmen to abate nuisances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>acted independently and without the concurrence of either of the other two. Gallup v. Tracy, 25 Conn. 10, was the case of license to stake off an oyster bed, granted by two members of a committee of four, one of such committee being the licensee himself, and the fourth member not even being consulted. Yet the grant was sustained, on the ground, among others, that vested rights would be prejudiced. In Keeler v. Frost, 22 Barb. 400, a tax was assessed by two out of three trustees, the third member afterward signing the warrant. A plaintiff, whose property was seized and sold for the tax assessed, was allowed to recover, but on the strength of a statute requiring the joint consultation of all the trustees. Cooper v. Lampeter Township, 8 Watts, 128, decided that one supervisor could not bind the township in a contract to build the wing walls of a bridge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-4\">On the other hand, in support of our contention on this point, is Jefferson Co. v. Slagle, 66 Pa. 202, where it was held that two out of three commissioners not at the commissioner\u2019s office could make a valid contract binding on the county. And we refer to Hopewell Township v. Putt, 2 W. N. 46, 1 Dillon, Mun. Corp., 4th ed., 360 and notes. Committee of public corporations have sometimes been held to be governed by different rules from a board necessarily to be assembled or convened : Gallup v. Tracy, 25 Conn. 10; Shea v. Milford, 145 Mass. 528; Haven v. Lowell, 5 Metc. 35.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-5\">The papers of Jan. 5, 1893, having been signed by all the township authorities, was their official action as far as the plaintiff was concerned, and remained such until revoked by the authority which had made the grant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-6\">This was no case for a preliminary injunction: Gross v. Wieand, 151 Pa. 639; Audenried v. R. R., 68 Pa. 370; Lockhart v. Railway, 139 Pa. 419.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-7\">Defendants were in possession and their rights were vested: Farmers R. R. v. Reno R. R., 53 Pa. 224; Leininger\u2019s Ap., 15 W. N. 81.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-8\">An attempt to balance the equities in the case at bar, so far from showing any clear equity on part of plaintiff, would result in inclining the scale towards defendant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b452-9\"><em>J. B. Woodward </em>of Wheaton, <em>Barling &amp; </em>Woodward, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQA\">One supervisor cannot bind the township for the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>formance of a contract, the propriety of entering into which is the subject of deliberation and the exercise of judgment, but he may in matters purely ministerial. When the business requires deliberation, consultation and judgment all should be convened, because the advice and opinion of all may be useful.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-3\">The consent given to appellant by the supervisors was a contract between the township and appellant. The paper by which the consent was given is in the form, of a contract; after the recitals it commences with the words, \u201c This agreement witnessed,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-4\">It is a contract, the propriety of entering into which is eminently a subject for deliberation, and the exercise of judgment on the part of the supervisor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-5\">When a private injury results from a breach of public law, the public wrong may be redressed by a private remedy, because the private remedy prevents a wrongdoer: Sparhawk v. Union Pass. Ry. Co., 54 Pa. 401.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-6\">The rule that a chancellor will refuse to enjoin an act, when a greater injury will result from granting than from refusing an injunction, has no application where the act complained of is in itself as well as in its incidents tortious: Walters v.

This case cannot be regarded as an exception to the rule. '</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">The only question now presented for our consideration is, whether the preliminary injunction complained of should have been continued. Upon due consideration of the injunction affidavits and proofs on which the learned court appears to have acted in making the decree, we think there was error in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">Decree reversed and preliminary injunction dissolved, at ap pellee\u2019s cost.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
