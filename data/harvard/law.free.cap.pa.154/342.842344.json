The train was left upon the track, and the cars were uninjured, but owing to the destruction of the tra'ck ahead it could not resume its journey. While the train was waiting for the track to be repaired, thieves, in open daylight and in presence of the train men who made no resistance, broke open the cars and seized some of the whisky. A volunteer guard of citizens interfered and protected the train during the - night and part of the following day, and then destroyed the remainder of the whisky to prevent it from falling into the hands of the dangerous element in the community. The train men made no efforts to protect the train, but as soon as the thieves began to break open the ear with axes, they turned their backs and left the neighborhood. <em>Held, </em>that the negligence of the company was for the jury.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b366-10\">In such a case the flood was not the cause of the loss, but merely the occasion or opportunity for plunder.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b366-11\">\n<em>Measure of damage.</em>\n</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b366-12\">The measure of damage in such case is not limited to the valuation in the bill of lading.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b366-13\">Argued March 24, 1893.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AnH\">Appeal, No. 258, Jan.

Owing to heavy rains the train was detained by a washout. At four o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the same day the dam above Conemaugh broke, resulting in the Johnstown flood. About half of the cars of the train bearing the whisky were swept away, but the car containing the whisky was left uninjured standing upon the track. About six o\u2019clock in the evening the waters subsided, and the crew of the train returned. What then occurred is described by the conductor as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-3\">\u201cWe came back to the train, and when we got there, there was men wading in back and forward; there were two or three axes; there was a kind, of clasp on some of these cars; these fellows didn\u2019t understand how to open it; there was a talk about opening the door. They were there with some axes, hammering away. I said, \u2018 Hello, boys, what is the trouble ? \u2019 He said, \u2018Look here, young fellow, by God, there are five hundred people starving, and with nothing to eat, and if there is anything in the train they will have it.\u2019 I said, \u2018 I have no use for you.\u2019 I walked about my business. In the meantime they had bursted open the car, loaded with hams and flour. I don\u2019t know whether they had just this particular car bursted open or not; I think probably they had; we left and walked to Johnstown, and we could not do anything better; everything was washed out; we started to walk to Johnstown; that was in the neighborhood of 6 o\u2019clock when we left there.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-4\">A guard of volunteer citizens of Conemaugh took charge of the train about eleven o\u2019clock in the evening.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-5\">Howard Davis, a citizen engaged in organizing a committee of protection, testified : \u201c When it began to get daylight the people off of Prospect came there \u2014 quite a lot of them \u2014 and they wanted provisions and stuff, and of course we didn\u2019t allow them to break open any of the cars or anything. There was a few had been'broken open, but we got them away. They kept on coming thicker and thicker, and we could not protect it; we nailed the cars shut. They found this whisky, and we nailed the ears, I think, three or four times, where the whisky was in. Two cars had whisky in. There was the one car had about two or three barrels in it, probably more. They broke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>that open first. We nailed it shut, but they broke it open the second time. I told them to stay out, and I got in the car myself, me and another party. I ordered them out. They swore they would not go. I throwed one fellow out, and he turned and drew a revolver on me. The rest pushed him away from the car on one side of the car. We closed it again. That is about the third time. Then by that time they had broken open this other car of whisky in front. The first car they had broken open on the right hand, as you go in this direction, and the other car they broke open on the left, on the north side. When we came round on that side they mashed this one open, and were going for it red hot. There was a good many come over from Conemaugh town, and they consulted most of them that come down, and we did not believe we could do anything any longer; they were getting too many. There was about a hundred people there. Q. What sort of people were they ? A. People I never saw who came there. I don\u2019t know how they got there or where they came from; they were the toughest class of people I ever saw. I never knew them and I have been raised in that neighborhood, but I don\u2019t know where they came from. They swore they would have the whisky. We told them they could not have the whisky, that we would empty it first; but we would not leave them have it, for we could not protect it in any other way. Q. Why did you tell them that ? A. They were raising a fuss then. We were in danger at that time. We had enough to look after in the way of dead people lying around, and relieving the suffering of those left. We had no time to lose with the whisky, and they began to get so bad on our hands at the time we could not control them any longer, and we came to the conclusion, I and about a dozen of the citizens, the best thing to do would be to destroy the whisky. We done so as quick as we could destroy it. In an hour\u2019s time it was quite a different place. It was all quiet.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-4\">Another witness, David D. Gogenaugh, testified that the committee, after consultation, came to the conclusion that the best thing to do was to destroy the whisky, \u201c in order to save property and life, because it looked very much as if there was going to be a riot there.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-5\">The bill of lading, contained the following stipulation: \u201c The carrier shall not be liable for loss or damage by causes beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>its reasonable control, by fire, explosion from any cause, and wheresoever occurring; by riots, strikes, or stoppage of labor, or for any of the causes incident to transportation, such as chafing, heating, freezing, leakage, rust, or any other reason not directly traceable to the negligence of the carrier\u2019s servants.\u201d The valuation in the bill of lading was $20.00 per barrel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-3\">Defendant\u2019s points were among others as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-4\">\u201c 2. The destruction of the plaintiff\u2019s goods is affirmatively shown to have been produced by causes wholly beyond the defendant\u2019s control, viz.: First, an unexpected flood, which interrupted the means of transportation ; and, second, the action of the persons who destroyed the goods as one of the necessary means of preserving the public peace and safety. Under such circumstances the verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d Refused. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-5\">\u201c 3. It is affirmatively shown by uncontradicted testimony that the plaintiff\u2019s goods were destroyed while in transit, without any fraud or gross negligence on the part of the defendant or its servants. Hence under the terms of the bill of lading the verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d Refused. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-6\">4.

[4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-8\">The court left to the jury the question of negligence by defendant the day of the flood and the day after, saying, inter alia: \u201c Could they have protected it on June 1st, either from the mob or from this committee ? That is, could they have shown at that time such acts of protection as would have satisfied reasonable people that there was no danger of the mob-getting it? Could they have kept it from the mob at that time ? If they could it was their duty to have done so; if they could not, then the railroad company is not responsible.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-9\">Verdict for plaintiff for $926.47.

It is proper care under the circumstances. It is diligent and honest efforts to protect that property until all efforts are useless. The defendants are common carriers. When, therefore, the property which is delivered to them is lost or destroyed, they are responsible for that loss, unless they bring themselves within the exceptions of the special contract they have entered into with the shipper, or the exceptions of the common law. If they contend that they were not negligent, they must show by evidence that they were not negligent. If they contend that the goods were lost by violence, they must show that the property was lost; that the loss was occasioned by irresistible force; and what means they used to prevent the loss; and it is for the jury to determine the questions that may arise under that evidence.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A85U\">April 24, 1893:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A6f\">Mr. Justice Williams,</author>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">The defendant is sued as a common carrier for its failure to deliver a quantity of whisky shipped over its line of road. The defence set up is that the whisky was lost in the Johnstown flood. The train was overtaken by the flood but it was not swept away. After the avalanche of water caused by the breaking of the South Fork dam had passed, the train was left upon the track, and the cars were uninjured. The track above and below it was injured so that the train could not resume its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>journey at once, but remained in the same place until the necessary repairs were made. The whisky claimed for in this action was not destroyed by a flood. Part of it was stolen by thieves after the flood subsided, and the rest of it was destroyed by a volunteer guard of citizens who had watched and protected the train during the night following the flood and part of the next day, as the easiest way of keeping it from falling into the hands of the same dangerous class of men who had gotten a taste of it on the previous afternoon. The flood was therefore not the cause of the loss, but the occasion, the opportunity for its plunder by bad men. The thieves came in the wake of the flood to pick up and appropriate what the more merciful waters had spared. They came to this train and began to force open the doors of some of the cars. The conductor and part, if not all, of his crew came upon the ground at about the same time. They saw an ax being used to open one or more of the cars but they made no effort to defend the train or drive away the thieves. They did not so much as remonstrate with them, or order them away; but turning their backs they surrendered the train and its freight to the tender mercies of the vagabonds who had attacked it, .and went away from the neighborhood. Private citizens came soon after, drove the thieves out of, and away from, the train and stood guard over it all night and until the middle of the next day; but the train men seem to have had neither part nor lot in the effort to save the property of their employer. The reason was given by one of them while on the witness stand with a cool, deliberate heartlessness not often met with in the most hardened criminals. He said he did not try to help the citizens save the cars and their contents because he \u201c had no orders to do so.\u201d He stood and looked on. He saw the peril of his employer\u2019s property. He saw citizens, with no personal interest involved, trying to save it, but he did not help because he \u201c had no orders.\u201d Whether he and others like him were cowards shivering with fear in the presence of a few thieves whom unarmed citizens drove away, or were thieves at heart and in full sympathy with those who were trying to loot the cars that they should have defended, is a matter of no consequence. In either case they neglected \u2022their obvious duty. The railroad company was represented in the carriage and safe-keeping of the freight on the train by the men to whom the train had been committed. If they desert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>ed their posts and left the goods uncared for, and they were stolen or destroyed, their employer must suffer for their inefficiency. Under the facts of this case the loss sued for did not arise from inevitable accident, or the act of God. It did not result from insurrection or the public enemy. It was not the work of a mob. It was due in part to plain stealing, done in daylight, in the presence of the train men and without the slightest resistance or remonstrance on their part. For the rest, it was due to the action of citizens who, after having guarded what remained for nearly twenty-four hours, destroyed it, when they could no longer keep up their watch over it, rather than see it consumed by the human brutes to whom it had been abandoned by the train men.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The court below disposed of this same case properly and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
