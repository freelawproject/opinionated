On Oct. 3, 1891, plaintiff received from defendant two promissory notes for $500 each of the T. C. Knauff Co., and $425 iij cash, and gave a.reeeipt for $1,405, the notes being taken at a discount of two per cent from their face. The receipt did not show that the notes were taken as an absolute payment of so much of the debt, bu.t merely acknowledged the amount of $1,405 received \u201c on account of contract for plastering.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-15\">When Harry Weekey, defendant\u2019s agent, was on the stand, he was asked by plaintiff on cross-examination: \u201c Q. Didn\u2019t you give the same kind of notes to other people on the same operation? Objected to. Mr.'Chase: I propose to show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>they gave them to n\u00e9arly all the material-men on the operation. Objected to. Objection overruled and exception. Q. How many other people on the operation did you give the same kind of notes to? A. Well, in one or two cases I was asked and I gave them.\u201d [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-5\">The court charged in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-6\">\u201c Now, consider all the circumstances in this case, the re- . ceipt and the papers, and all that was said. Did Mr. Shepherd receive these notes in payment of his debt ? If he did, that is the end of it; your verdict should be for the defendant. [But if he did not receive them in payment of his debt \u2014 in payment of what Mr. Busch owed him \u2014 or, rather, in payment of $1,000 of the debt \u2014 why, then, your verdict should be for the plaintiff for the amount of his indebtedness.] [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-7\">\u201c There is a receipt here. That you are to consider. If you believe that that receipt shows that Mr. Shepherd intended to receive those in payment of his debt, why, you can take it as evidence of that; but, on the other hand, the fact that he gave a receipt in the words' that he did does not bar him from explaining the receipt or of satisfying you that it did not mean the words that were therein stated. In other words, the receipt is not a bar to his showing you that the facts were different from what the face of the receipt might seem to indicate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-8\">\u201c As I have said again and again, and as counsel have said to you in the case, [the only thing in it is, was it given as payment or as collateral security ?

But that brings us right back to where we were before \u2014 the original proposition ; [were they taken as a payment to wipe out that much of the debt which Mr. Busch owed to Mr. Shepherd, or were they only taken as collateral security ? ] \u201d [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-10\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $1,069.

It was, of course, for the exclusive determination of the jury. The learned court below very correctly instructed them as to their duty and as to the character of the question they were to decide. The whole subject was left entirely to them and they found that the notes were not taken as payment, and an examination of the testimony convinces .us that they could not have done otherwise. The only written evidence . submitted by the defendant in support of his contention was the receipt for $1,405 on account. It is conceded that only $425 was paid in cash and the remainder was made up by the amount of the notes, as is a very common practice in the business world, when notes or other obligations are delivered in making a payment. But it by no means follows from the mere fact of a receipt having been given for the gross sum represented by the cash and paper, that the paper is accepted as absolute payment. That depends upon actual agreement. In determining that question the receipt is some evidence and is to be considered, just as the court below instructed the jury in this case. But when the receipt is intended to be proof of an agreement to receive the paper of third persons as absolute payment of that much in money it ought to say so. This receipt says nothing upon that subject and therefore is very fee-b.le proof in support of such a contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>The testimony of the plaintiff on the trial is a complete answer to it, if believed by the jury, and the verdict in his favor is conclusive that his testimony was believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">As to the mere acceptance of the notes, and its effect upon the main question, a single citation from one of our recent decisions is sufficient. In the case of Holmes v. Briggs, 131 Pa. 233, the present Chief Justice said, \u201cNothing is better settled than, that in the absence of any special agreement to the contrary the mere acceptance by a creditor from his debtor of the note or check of a third person, to the creditor\u2019s order, for a pre-existing indebtedness, is not absolute, but merely conditional payment, defeasible on the dishonor or nonpayment of the note or check, and in that event the debtor remains liable for his original debt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">In League v. Waring &amp; Co., 85 Pa. 244, we held that where the draft of a third party is received by a creditor from his debtor for a pre-existing debt, the presumption is that it was received as a conditional payment, unless there was an agreement that it was to be an absolute payment, and the burthen of proving such an agreement is upon the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">There is no merit in the fourth assignment of error, and if there were it is of too trifling effect to justify a reversal on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
