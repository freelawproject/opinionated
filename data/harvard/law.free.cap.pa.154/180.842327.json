Thorn $28 per week, for the board of himself and family. That said board was paid weekly as it fell due. That the writ of attachment was issued herein on July 14, 1891, and that the sheriff served the said writ on this garnishee by leaving a copy of the same with the defendant, M. L. Thorn, on the 14th day of July, 1891. That this garnishee had no knowledge of an attachment being issued herein or that he was made a garnishee therein until September 3, 1891, when the defendant made that fa'ct known to him, she up to that time having withheld the writ and all knowledge there-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>of from him. That when this garnishee first heard of the attachment herein he was not and never since has been in any wajr indebted to the defendant M. L. Thorn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-4\">\u201c That he and his family boarded with the defendant from June 20; 1891, to September 7, 1891, and that at the time this writ was served he was not indebted to the defendant, neither was she indebted to him, and that there was not at that time nor has there been since a balance in his hands in favor of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-5\">\u201cThat from June 20, 1891, to Sept. 7, 1891, this garnishee and his family were boarding with the defendant, and paid $28 per week therefor.

He may suffer some hardship in this case, but it is such that he cannot be relieved from it, and is the result of the universality of the law as to the service which must be made in such cases. You will render a verdict for $196, being the amount he owed the landladjr from the time of the service until he left.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-9\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff.

The return of service is sufficient on its face. If for any reason it should have been set aside the application should have been made before or concurrently with the liling of answers to the interrogatories. None was made. The case was heard on its merits, and the judgment is now affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
