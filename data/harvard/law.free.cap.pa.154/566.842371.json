(See report of former writ, in 150 Pa. 50.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-7\">At the trial, before Krebs, P. J., it appeared that plaintiff was injured by falling over an unguarded wing wall of an overhead bridge constructed by defendant company. The bridge carried the railroad over a public highway. Plaintiff, who was a carpenter employed on bridge work by defendant, described the accident as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-8\">\u201cOn Dec. 21, 1889, I was directed to go to Granville,.and knowing that I had to take the Altoona accommodation \u2014 at that time it came along there about half past five, as near as I can remember; all that time \u2014 I got up pretty early and ate my breakfast by lamp light, and after I got done eating I looked' at my watch and I had five or six minutes time yet. I lit my pipe and started, took my dinner bucket and as I got out in the public road I thought I heard the train whistling; thinking that perhaps may be my watch might be slow or something, I started and ran till I got up to where I turned off to go on to the bridge and slacked up; the road, that is the road I came up on to turn off is descending down and then rising up. Q. This is shown on this map of Africa\u2019s. A. Yes, sir. Q. Is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>this where we represent? A. Yes, sir; I slacked up and after I got about down on to where the ground begins to rise to go on to the approach of the bridge I could see a mile and a half fully up the railroad ; I saw no headlight in view and I walked on rapidly, thinking I would strike the bridge near about its centre, in the middle, and ran against something on the left side, and falling at the same time, was the last that I knew till I was carried into the station. Q. Did you ever make any complaint to the township officers or to the railroad company that this place was unsafe ? A. No, sir, I never paid any attention to it; I didn\u2019t know that there was any complaint to be laid in; I didn\u2019t pay any attention that there was no railing there; passing back and forward I was always in a hurry to get home and always in a hurry to get away to make the train to go to work.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-4\">The court reserved the question whether plaintiff\u2019s remedy did not lie against the township, as the accident occurred within the lands of the public highway. The question of plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was left to the jury, the court charging in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-5\">\u201cIf, however, you find it was not reasonably safe in the manner indicated, then the inquiry is, did Mr. Gates contribute to the injury he received by a want of ordinary care and prudence on his part, a want of such care and prudence as an ordinarily careful and prudent man would exercise in passing over a common bridge ? And, as bearing on that question, you have a right to consider his knowledge of the bridge, the locality in which he lived with reference to the bridge, and whether or not he was acquainted with the situation of the bridge and with the approaches thereto; he would be required to exercise a greater decree of care than a person who was not acquainted with it. And what would be ordinary care in one instance would not be ordinary care in another.\u201d [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-6\">Defendant\u2019s points were among others as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-7\">\u201c 1. That under the evidence in the ease the verdict must be for defendant.\u201d Not answered otherwise than as in the general charge. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-8\">\u201c 3. That, if the jury believe that the weight of the evidence shows that the plaintiff was running when he fell, the verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>That point is pertinent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>on the question to which we have already called your attention. That is the second question involved in this inquiry, if you find the bridge, in the first instance, was unsafe and was not in that condition for reasonably safe use by the public which the act of assembly seems to require. \u25a0 The second proposition was whether or not the plaintiff contributed to this accident; and in that respect this point is pertinent. Our answer is that if the jury find that he was acquainted with the unsafe and dangerous condition, and he ran up there recklessly, he contributed to this accident thereby, and he would not be entitled to recover ; but whether he was running or walking at that point is a question of fact for the jury.\u201d [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-3\">Verdict for plaintiff for $3,506.25. Subsequently the court entered judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto on the question of law reserved. An appeal was taken by plaintiff and the judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court and judgment entered for plaintiff: 150 Pa. 50. Defendant then took this appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-4\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1-3) instructions, quoting them.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-5\">Plaintiff moved to quash the appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b593-6\"><em>J.

We are of opinion that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">On the trial in the court below, the defence was twofold: (\u00ab) that defendant was not liable, because the accident oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>curred within the lines of the public highway, and plaintiff\u2019s remedy, if he had any, was against the township, and not against defendant company, and (5) that plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was a bar to his recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\">The court having refused to withdraw the case from the jury on the ground of contributory negligence, submitted that question to them, and they found in plaintiff\u2019s favor, and assessed his damages, subject to the opinion of the court on the reserved question, raised by the first mentioned ground of de-. fence. Afterwards the question of law thus reserved was decided in favor of defendant, and thereupon judgment was entered against the plaintiff non obstante veredicto. From that he appealed, and the only question that was dr could be before us then was the validity of that judgment. In an opinion by our brother Mitchele, reported in 150 Pa. 50, we held that it was erroneous and entered judgment on the verdict, in favor of plaintiff, for the amount found by the jury. The record was remitted, and the effect of our reversal, etc., was to place the parties just where they would have been, if-the court below had, in the first place, entered the proper judgment. It therefore follows that defendant was entitled to appeal from the rulings of the court below on its second ground of defence, viz.: plaintiff\u2019s alleged contributory negligence. On those rulings, defendant had not theretofore had a hearing in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Appellant\u2019s right to have errors, assigned to rulings of the court below on the subject of contributory negligence, reviewed by this court is well established. \u201c A judgment upon a writ of error sued out by one of the parties, is no bar to a subsequent writ of error at the suit of the other party, in which different errors are assigned: \u201d Ormsby v. Ihmsen, 34 Pa. 462. In Rand v. King, 134 Pa. 641, it was held that the modes of reviewing cases in this court by writ of error, certiorari and appeal which were in use prior to the act to May 9,1889, P. L. 158, still remain applicable to same kinds of cases, within same limits and with same effect as before; the only change made by that act is that now they are all called by the same name. As was well said in that case, \u201c the act does not profess to extend the right of review, to change its extent in cases already provided for, or to modify in any manner its exercise. It simply provides that dissimilar proceedings shall be called by the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>name. An appeal, in name, may therefore be a writ of error or certiorari in legal effect, and it is necessary, in every case, to look into the record and determine at the outset of our examination whether what is \u2018 called an appeal \u2019 is such in fact, or is a writ of error or a certiorari. The practical effect of calling proceedings so essentially unlike by the same name, is to obscure and divert attention from the peculiar characteristics of each. This increases the sense of uncertainty on the part of the practitioner, and the labor on the part of the appellate court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">It follows from what has been said that the motion to quash should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The burden of defendant\u2019s complaint, in the first and second specifications of error, is the refusal of the court to hold, as matter of law, that, under the evidence, plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, and the submission of that question to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">An examination of the evidence convinces us that the action of the court was not erroneous. While there is some testimony tending to show that plaintiff was perhaps not as careful as he might have been, it is not of such a character as would have warranted the court in saying, as matter of law, that he was guilty of contributory negligence, and hence there was no error in submitting it, under proper instructions, to the constitutional triers of fact. Comprehensively defined, \u201c negligence is the absence of care according to the circumstances ; \u201d and it is always a question for the jury where there is a reasonable doubt, either as to the facts, or inferences of fact to be drawn from the testimony. When the measure of duty is ordinary and reasonable care, and when the degree of care varies according to the circumstances, the question of negligence is always for the jury; but, when facts constituting negligence are either admitted or conclusively established by undisputed evidence, it is of course the duty of the court to declare the law applicable thereto. These well settled principle\u2019s are recognized in a long line of cases, among the later of which are the following : Railroad Co. v. White, 88 Pa. 327; Corbalis v. Newberry Twp., 132 Pa. 9 ; Dalton v. Tyrone Twp., 137 Pa. 18 ; Bradwell v. Railway Co., 139 Pa. 404; Baker v. Borough of North East, 151 Pa. 234; McGill v. Pittsburgh &amp; Western Ry Co., 152 Pa. 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>In the ease at bar there are no admitted or uncontroverted facts that would have justified the court in holding as requested by defendant\u2019s first point.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">For reasons already suggested, it would have been error to have affirmed defendant\u2019s third point. Conceding, for argument sake merely, that plaintiff was running when he fell, it would by no means follow that he was guilty of contributory negligence. The learned judge\u2019s answer to that point was quite as favorable to defendant as it should have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The case depended on questions of fact which were exclusively for the jury. They were fairly submitted, with instructions which appear to be adequate and free from any error that . would justify a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
