Freedley and Hart that there are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>outstanding claims by New York creditors, amounting to from $35,000 to $50,000, but that the real estate held subject to the power of sale given to the executors was ample to meet them, and no part of the estate embraced in the account need therefore be withheld from present disposition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-3\">\u201c Two assignments have been made by Charles L. Thudichum: one to Nicholas Lennig et al., for $3,500, and, subject to this, one for $2,000 to Aaron I. Sansom, the latter without interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-4\">\u201c Mrs. Williamina L. Lennig, the widow of testator, has elected to take against the will. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-5\">\u201c Mr. Townsend, on behalf of Mrs. Thudichum and the Misses Fullerton, and Mr. Mellors, on behalf of Alexander Arnoys, contended that the accumulation directed by the will is in violation of the act of 1853 ; and that the gifts to the charities and the lineal descendants are invalid, because they infringe the rule against perpetuities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-6\">\u201c 1. The primary purpose of the accumulation resulting from the addition of one third of the surplus income in each year to the residuary estate was the creation of a fund large enough to secure payment of the $700,000, given to the University of Pennsylvania; and the limitation to the descendants of the testator then living is only of the excess, if any, beyond that amount. The act of 1853 expressly excludes from its operation \u2018 any donation, bequest, or devise for any literary, scientific, charitable, or religious purpose; \u2019 and it provides also that an accumulation shall be void [only] \u2018 so far as it shall exceed the limits of \u2019 the act. In this respect there is a wide difference between the gift infringing the rule against perpetuities, which is void in toto, and a trust for accumulation, which is good to the extent that it does not transgress the statute: Brown v. Williamson, 12 Casey, 338. Hence, so long as the accumulation does not swell the residue to an amount larger than the sum required for the charity, it is not forbidden: the act will only apply to a continuance of the accumulation after this purpose has been accomplished; and such excess will then go \u2018 to and be received by such person or persons as would be entitled thereto if such accumulations had not been directed.\u2019 It is not alleged that the limit has yet been reached.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-7\">\u201c It is true that adult children of the testator will participate in the income accruing from the accumulations of the residue; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>but tbe language of the act excluding from its operation gifts to charities is most general and comprehensive. \u2018 Any, \u2019 donation, etc., for \u2018 any \u2019 religious or charitable purpose shall \u2018 not \u2019 come within the prohibition. As was said by Judge Agnew in Turnpike Co. v. McNamara, 22 Smith, 280, \u2018language could not be broader, and no exception or qualification is to be found in the act.\u2019 What authority is there, therefore, for saying that a donation to a charity which permits the intermediate participation by individuals in a merely temporary incident of the accumulation does come within the prohibition in spite of these words of exclusion ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-4\">\u201c If, however, the act is thus contravened, it affects only the interest of the accumulations so far as it is given to individuals, giving it instead to the children and issue of deceased children of the testator under the intestate laws; but as no such interest has yet been accrued the question with regard to it is not now before the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-5\">\u201c 2. It is quite clear that the gift of the income of the residuary estate to the Academy of Natural Sciences, until it shall have received $20,000, does not infringe the rule against perpetuities, whatever may be said of the ultimate limitations to the University of Pennsylvania, etc. It takes effect immediatety at the expiration of lives in being at the death of testator; and an interest which thus begins is not obnoxious to the rule, though it may end at a very remote time. Gray on Perp., sec. 232; Lawrence\u2019s Estate, 21 Crum. 365-6.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ANT\">\u201c As this would require the estate to remain in the hands of the trustee, the consideration of the gifts to the University is perhaps unnecessary; but as the question of their validity has been raised and the necessary parties are before us, it is proper now to dispose of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-7\">\u201c It is said that as these gifts are not to take effect until the accomplishment of the intervening provision for the Academy of Natural Sciences, they may thus be deferred for more than twenty-one years, etc., after the termination of lives in being, and therefore the gift is void. The fallacy of this lies both in the premises and in the conclusion. The residuary personal estate, after all deductions have been made, will amount to not less than $275,000, and as this, at even one per cent, would yield $2,700 per annum, not more than eight years would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>required for the payment of the $20,000. But there is also real estate valued at $350,000; so that in all probability not more than two or three years would be required. It can at least be said with judicial certainty (unless the court has no right to take notice of the income-yielding quality of a fund brought before it for administration) that the specified sum will be raised and the ultimate gift thus become payable long before the expiration of the term permitted by the rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-4\">\u201cIf, however, the court is not permitted to see what cannot help being seen, and if (assuming what is scarcely assumable, that the legacies to the university are not vested with simply a deferring of possession \u2014 though they are dependent upon no contingency whatever) the limitations following the gift for the Academy of Natural Sciences would be invalid if in favor of an individual, it is by no means to be admitted that the gifts to the charity would be similarly affected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-5\">\u201c The gifts to the charity and the gift to the descendants of the testator, as already remarked, are entirely separable \u2014 the latter not taking effect at all until the charitable legacies have been paid in full; and hence there is no difficulty in upholding one, although the other fails. See Gray on Perp., sec. 341, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-6\">\u201c It was decided in Christ\u2019s Hospital v. Grainger, 16 Sim. 83, that a charitable trust taking effect on a remote contingency in derogation of another charity, even though it involved a change of trustee, was valid. The decision, which has been approved in Odell v. Odell, 10 Allen, 1, and Jones v. Haber-sham, 107 U. S. 174, 175, has been accepted by the text-books as settling the law, and, as Mr. Gray says, it4 has stood so long unquestioned that it is likely to be followed: \u2019 Perp., sec. 599, et seq. It is true that he criticises it and suggests that in a, jurisdiction not bound by decision the question should receive careful <em>consideration; </em>but this is said especially with reference to the decision that the change of trustee did not affect the question of legality, and he admits (sec. 597) that the case is much stronger in favor of the ultimate charity, where, as here, there is no change of trustee, and, therefore, no change in the legal estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-7\">44 But whatever may be thought of Christ\u2019s Hospital v. Grainger, or of the soundness of the reasoning of Lord Cottenham, by whom the opinion was delivered, the question it would seem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>is no longer an open one in Pennsylvania, where the legislature has come to the relief of the judiciary by passing the act of May 9, 1889, P. L. 178, Purd. 2450, which in the most unequivocal terms declares that a gift to charity shall not fail because transgressive of the rule against perpetuities: \u2018 No disposition of property made for any religious or charitable use shall fail .... by reason of ... . being given in perpetuity,\u2019 etc.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-4\">The entire balance of the principal account, after directing the one third in kind to the widow, and the legacies present\u00ed}' payable, together with collateral inheritance tax and other expenses, was awarded to the Pennsylvania Company for Insurance on Lives and Granting Annuities in trust for the purposes set forth in the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-5\">Exceptions to the adjudication by appellants were dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were in dismissing exceptions, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-7\"><em>Chas.
