Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, Inc., </em>this Court held that an employer may be vicariously liable, in accordance with principles of agency law, for sexual harassment committed by a supervisor that results in a hostile work environment. 132 <em>N.J. </em>587, 592, 626 A.2d 445 (1993). Citing <em>Restatement (Second) of Agency </em>\u00a7 219(2) [hereinafter <em>Restatement </em>], the Court held that when a supervisor acts beyond \u201cthe scope of his or her employment, the employer will be vicariously liable if the employer contributed to the harm through its negligence, intent, or apparent authorization of the harassing conduct, or if the supervisor was aided in the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>sion of the harassment by the agency relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 624, 626 A.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In this case, plaintiff Ilda Aguas (Aguas), a corrections officer, alleges that two of her supervisors subjected her to sexual harassment in the workplace. Aguas asserted negligence and vicarious liability claims premised on the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to -49 (LAD). She appeals from the Appellate Division\u2019s decision affirming the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment dismissing her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Aguas\u2019s appeal requires that we determine two issues that were generally addressed, but not expressly decided, in <em>Lehmann </em>and subsequent decisions by this Court. First, we address the impact of an employer\u2019s anti-harassment policy on an employee\u2019s negligence or recklessness claim under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(b), and on a vicarious liability claim under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d). We reaffirm that an employer\u2019s implementation and enforcement of an effective anti-harassment policy, or its failure to maintain such a policy, is a critical factor in determining negligence and recklessness claims under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">For claims alleging vicarious liability for supervisory sexual harassment under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d), we adopt as the governing standard the test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Burlington Industries v. Ellerth, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>742, 765, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>2257, 2270, 141 L.Ed.2d 633, 655 (1998) and <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>775, 807-08, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>2275, 2292-93, 141 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d 662, 689 (1998). Under the <em>Ellerth/Fa,ragher </em>analysis, the employer in a hostile work environment sexual harassment case may assert as an affirmative defense to vicarious liability that it \u201cexercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior,\u201d and \u201cthe plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise,\u201d provided that the employer has not taken an adverse tangible employment action against the plaintiff employee. <em>Ellerth, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 765,118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2270, 141 L.Ed.2d at 655; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number><em>Faragher, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 807-08, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2292-93, 141 <em>L.Ed.2 </em>d at 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>affirmative defense derives from agency principles adopted by this Court in <em>Lehmann. </em>It furthers the LAD\u2019s purpose of eliminating sexual harassment in the workplace by motivating employers to maintain effective anti-harassment policies, and by encouraging employees to take prompt action against harassing supervisors in accordance with those policies. <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 626, 626 A.2d 445. The affirmative defense is consonant with this Court\u2019s prior jurisprudence and advances the legislative goal of the LAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Second, we consider the factors that trial courts should apply when determining whether an employee, accused of sexually harassing another employee, is that individual\u2019s supervisor\u2014a term undefined in the LAD and our prior case law\u2014for purposes of a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim. We hold that an allegedly harassing employee is the complainant\u2019s supervisor if that employee had the authority to take or recommend tangible employment actions affecting the complaining employee, or to direct the complainant\u2019s day-to-day activities in the workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">So that the trial court may decide this ease in accordance with these standards, we reverse the Appellate Division\u2019s affirmance of summary judgment dismissing Aguas\u2019s claims and remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Effective on December 16,1999, the New Jersey Department of Corrections (DOC) instituted a written policy prohibiting discrimination in the workplace and mandated that all employees be trained with respect to it. The policy states a commitment \u201cto providing every State employee and prospective employee with a work environment free from discrimination or harassment.\u201d It proscribes \u201csexual (or gender-based) harassment of any kind[.]\u201d Among other prohibited behaviors, the policy bars \u201c[ujnwanted physical contact such as intentional touching, grabbing, pinching, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>brushing against another\u2019s body or impeding or blocking movement,\u201d as well as \u201c[vjerbal, written, or electronic sexually suggestive or obscene comments, jokes or propositions[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The DOC policy imposes special responsibilities on supervisors. It charges supervisors to ensure \u201ca work environment that is free from any form of discrimination/harassment\u201d and subjects supervisors who fail to meet its requirements with sanctions that may include termination of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The DOC policy incorporates \u201cthe State of New Jersey Model Procedures with regard to reporting, investigating, and where appropriate, remediating claims of discrimination/harassment,\u201d pursuant to <em>N.J.AC. 4A;7-3.2.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It requires the designation of a responsible individual or individuals to handle employee discrimination and harassment complaints. The policy \u201cencourages\u201d employees subjected to harassment to \u201cpromptly report the incidentes) to either a supervisor, or directly to the [DOC\u2019s] Equal Employment Division/Affirmative Action Officer,\u201d without specifying that the employee must report the incident in waiting. The policy mandates that the DOC conduct investigations of such complaints \u201cin a prompt, thorough and impartial manner\u201d that respects \u201cthe privacy of all persons involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The DOC Commissioner is charged with making a final determination as to whether a policy violation has occurred. If a complaint is substantiated, the DOC is required to \u201ctake prompt and appropriate remedial action to stop the behavior and deter its reoccurrence,\u201d including interim separation of the alleged harasser from the complainant employee pending a final determination. The DOC policy bars retaliation against a complaining employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>In 2004, Aguas was hired by the DOC as a Corrections Officer Recruit. The following year, she became a Senior Corrections Officer, assigned to the third shift, 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., at the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women (Edna Mahan). Aguas acknowledged that she received a copy of the DOC anti-discrimination and harassment policy, but denied receiving training with respect to that policy. However, Aguas twice instituted written complaints pursuant to the DOC\u2019s antidiscrimination policy, the first a discrimination complaint filed in 2005 against a female co-worker, and the second a workplace violence complaint filed in 2007 against a different female co-worker. The DOC found both complaints to be unsubstantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Aguas was supervised by Darryl McClish (McClish), an Area Lieutenant who has worked for the DOC since 1989 and at Edna Mahan since 2009. During the third shift, McClish was the highest-ranking supervisor at the correctional facility, overseeing the work of sixty employees. He was assisted in that role by two male officers, Sergeant Robin Hill (Hill) and Sergeant Eric Sands (Sands).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Aguas alleges that McClish sexually harassed her on several occasions, beginning in October 2009. She asserts that on one evening that month, as she completed her shift and left the facility, McClish stood next to her very closely and asked \u201care we going to a telly,\u201d which she interpreted as a reference to a motel. Aguas contends that McClish then made a comment about another officer, Lieutenant Rudolph Walz (Walz), suggesting that Aguas had a romantic relationship with Walz. McClish denies this allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Later the same evening, Aguas took her handcuffs home in contravention of the DOC policy, and McClish called and demanded her immediate return to the correctional facility. Aguas alleges that when she returned with the handcuffs, McClish sniffed the handcuffs and asked, \u201c[w]here you been? If you just want to borrow them, let me know.\u201d She contends that McClish then \u201csat in [her] lap face-to-face while blowing his whistle and gave her a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>\u2018lap dance\u2019 by grinding his pelvis into [her] and shaking his face close to her face.\u201d Aguas alleges that McClish persisted in this behavior despite her warning to stop, and that another corrections officer and a lieutenant on the scene purposely looked in the other direction while the conduct was occurring. McClish agrees that he ordered Aguas to return to the facility with the handcuffs, but otherwise denies Aguas\u2019s allegations regarding this incident, and denies that he touched Aguas with his waist, hip or groin on any occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Aguas next alleges that later in the same month, McClish massaged her shoulders, out of view of any other employees, when he and Aguas were conducting nightly rounds of the corrections facility. She asserts that he then \u201cstuck out his buttocks toward [Aguas], flexed his arms and said, \u2018[djo me a favor and take my radio off my hip. I worked out and I\u2019m sore,\u2019 \u201d a direction that she declined to follow. McClish denies both allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Aguas contends that a few days after that incident, McClish commented twice, in her presence, about her alleged relationship with Walz. She asserts that immediately after she complained to McClish about the comments, McClish approached her from behind, \u201cput her in a hold with her hands behind her back and pulled up to her shoulder blades.\u201d According to Aguas, McClish then \u201cbent [Aguas] over the table with his genital area touching [her] buttocks and repeatedly said, \u2018[w]hat are you going to do?\u2019 \u201d Aguas asserts that she immediately kicked and head-butted McClish repeatedly and that the two fell to the floor, prompting McClish to release her. She alleges that McClish then \u201cstarted bobbing like a boxer\u201d and repeated his question, \u201c[w]hat are you going to do?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">According to Aguas, when she returned from a trip to the bathroom a few minutes later, \u201cMcClish got very close behind [her] and start[ed] dancing, whooping, waving his arms, and blowing his whistle while repeatedly saying \u2018[w]oohoo!\u2019 as if [she] was a stripper.\u201d Aguas claims that McClish then made a derogatory comment about Walz. She asserts that when she confronted McClish about this behavior days later, telling McClish that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>alleged actions made her feel uncomfortable and \u201clike a whore, like a slut,\u201d he responded that he was not sorry. McClish denies these allegations in their entirety, and maintains that the conversations recounted by Aguas did not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Aguas contends that on January 23, 2010, she set off the alarm in the metal detector at Edna Mahan. According to Aguas, Hill asked her whether she had \u201cpiercings in [her] breasts because I know you don\u2019t need an underwire bra,\u201d and directed a female officer to repeatedly pat-frisk Aguas. Hill testified that, in compliance with the DOC policy, he ordered a female officer to pat-frisk Aguas after she failed to clear the metal detector.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hill denied making the remark alleged by Aguas.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Finally, Aguas contends that Sands subjected her to \u201chyper-scrutiny,\u201d selectively reprimanding her for uniform violations committed by several officers, for smoking outside on her break with a sweater around her shoulders, and for not carrying a red pen.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The parties dispute the timing of Aguas\u2019s reporting of her sexual harassment allegations. Aguas contends that she reported McClish\u2019s harassment to Walz on several occasions beginning in October 2009. Walz testified, however, that Aguas reported to him only the conversation with Hill involving the metal detector, and the excessive scrutiny of her uniform, and that she did not complain to him at any time about alleged sexual harassment by McClish.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Aguas reported her allegations that McClish sexually harassed her to Captain and Acting Chief Robert Ryan (Ryan), the highest officer in command, and Ryan advised her to meet with Assistant Administrator Helen Adams (Adams). Aguas asserts that she rejected Adams\u2019s advice to report the harassment in writing because she feared retaliation. She declined the DOC\u2019s alterna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>tive suggestion that she participate in a group meeting with the DOC officials, McClish, Sands and Hill. Aguas contends that Adams gave her forms to prepare a written report and a referral to the facility\u2019s psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">According to Aguas, she became distraught at the meeting with Adams and was subsequently hospitalized for a migraine and placed on medical leave. A few days later, Aguas received two text messages from a fellow Edna Mahan officer, which she interpreted as a warning not to file a written complaint. Aguas did not file a written complaint with the DOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">On March 8, 2010, the DOC\u2019s Equal Employment Division (EED) advised Aguas in writing that it had initiated an investigation of her verbal complaint of sexual harassment. Over the next several weeks, an EED investigator interviewed Aguas, McClish, Walz and seventeen other witnesses, and obtained statements from others. The EED investigator summarized her findings in a report dated April 21, 2010. The investigator concluded that Aguas\u2019s allegations were unsubstantiated, and advised Aguas of that conclusion in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">On March 10, 2010, two days after the EED commenced its investigation of her complaints, Aguas filed this action. She named the State as the sole defendant and asserted claims under the LAD for compensatory and punitive damages and other relief. Aguas alleged that the sexual harassment by McClish and Hill subjected her to a hostile work environment based on her gender, and that the State retaliated against her because of her objections to that harassment, in violation of the LAD. Aguas did not allege that the DOC took any tangible employment action against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">In its answer, the State pled, as affirmative defenses, its \u201cprompt and remedial action\u201d in response to Aguas\u2019s claim, its policy against discrimination, harassment and retaliation, and its \u201cthorough investigation\u201d of Aguas\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Following discovery, the trial court granted the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court held that Aguas had presented a prima facie showing that she had been subjected to severe and pervasive sexual harassment, and that the conduct created a hostile or abusive work environment for her. It concluded, however, that the State had established an affirmative defense. The court noted that the DOC had a written policy against discrimination, harassment and retaliation that included a procedure for reporting through the EED, a procedure that Aguas had used in the past. The trial court construed the policy to require the filing of a written complaint by an employee. It held that Aguas had failed to take steps required by the policy. The trial court therefore dismissed Aguas\u2019s LAD sexual harassment claims, based on theories of negligence and recklessness, as well as vicarious liability. Due to its rejection of Aguas\u2019s claims for compensatory damages, the trial court also granted summary judgment dismissing Aguas\u2019s claim for punitive damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Aguas appealed, and an Appellate Division panel affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. The panel concluded that the State exercised due care in its investigation of Aguas\u2019s claim and concurred with the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Aguas\u2019s negligence and recklessness claim. It also agreed with the trial court that the State had established an affirmative defense, by indisputable proof, based upon the DOC\u2019s adoption and implementation of a policy against discrimination and sexual harassment, a policy that Aguas admittedly received in writing annually. The panel rejected Aguas\u2019s claim that the State was liable under the agency principles of <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d), holding that Aguas had failed to show that McClish used his authority to control her day-to-day working environment to aid his sexual harassment of her. It also affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Aguas\u2019s claim for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>We granted Aguas\u2019s petition for certification. <em>Aguas v. State, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>86, 77 A.3d 489 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Aguas argues that the Appellate Division created a novel test, in contravention of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lehmann </em>and public policy, which requires an employee to file a formal report under the employer\u2019s policy before pursuing legal remedies. She concedes that an employer may present evidence of its implementation and enforcement of an explicit policy against sexual harassment and its provision of an effective investigatory and remedial procedure in defense of a negligence claim. She denies that a plaintiff in a sexual harassment case has the burden of proof, and instead contends that the employer\u2019s policy gives rise to an affirmative defense as to which the defendant has the burden of proof. Aguas argues that in any event, the State cannot establish such a defense based on the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Aguas contends that the Appellate Division misapplied <em>Lehmann </em>by declining to find the State vicariously liable based on principles of agency. She argues that under <em>Lehmann, </em>when a supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate, the employer is presumed liable whether or not the subordinate reports the harassment, and that the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>analysis does not govern cases involving supervisors under the LAD. Finally, Aguas contends that the Appellate Division improperly affirmed the dismissal of her claim for punitive damages because she established an underlying violation of the LAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The State counters that the DOC implemented an effective anti-sexual harassment policy, enforced that policy and took immediate remedial action in response to Aguas\u2019s complaint, and that it was Aguas\u2019s duty to utilize the grievance procedure. It argues that sexual harassment by a supervisor is not a per se violation of the LAD except where a tangible employment action is taken against the employee who has alleged harassment. The State asserts that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>applies to cases involving supervisors, and that unless the supervisor\u2019s harassment prompts a tangible employment action and the plaintiff seeks equitable relief, the employer may assert an affirmative defense under that analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Amicus curiae National Employment Lawyers Association of New Jersey (NELA) argues that the Appellate Division contravened <em>Lehmann </em>and other authority by holding that McClish, the highest-level manager on his shift at Edna Mahan, lacked sufficient authority to be considered a supervisor for purposes of vicarious liability. NELA asserts that the Appellate Division improperly focused on McClish\u2019s authority to discipline Aguas and affect her economic status, rather than on his capacity to oversee her day-to-day work. NELA argues that New Jersey law does not require an employee who is a victim of sexual harassment to formally report the harassment in writing in order to trigger an investigation and remediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Amicus curiae Employers Association of New Jersey (EANJ) urges the Court to hold that an employer cannot, as a matter of law, be liable for a hostile work environment under the LAD if it took prompt remedial action in response to an employee\u2019s complaint of sexual harassment. EANJ argues that the DOC satisfied its duty of care by implementing and enforcing a detailed procedure. It asserts that Aguas should be barred from recovering under the LAD because she unreasonably failed to take advantage of preventive and corrective measures that were available to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">TV.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">We first consider the impact of the DOC\u2019s anti-harassment policy on Aguas\u2019s two claims for sexual harassment giving rise to a hostile work environment: her direct claim for negligence and recklessness against the State based on <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(b), and her claim that the State is vicariously liable for sexual harassment committed by McClish and Hill under <em>Restatement </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\u00a7 219(2)(d). The decisions that defined these claims provide the setting for our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>this Court recognized sexual harassment in the workplace as a form of discrimination that is prohibited by the LAD. 132 <em>N.J. </em>at 601, 626 A.2d 445 (citing <em>Meritor Sav. Bank v. Vinson, FSB, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>57, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2399, 91 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>49 (1986); <em>Erickson v. Marsh &amp; McLennan Co., </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>539, 555-56, 569 A.2d 793 (1990)). The Court recognized two forms of sexual harassment that are actionable under the LAD. The first is \u201cquid pro quo sexual harassment,\u201d in which \u201can employer attempts to make an employee\u2019s submission to sexual demands a condition of his or her employment.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Aguas does not assert a quid pro quo harassment claim in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The second cause of action for sexual harassment, at issue here, is a claim for \u201chostile work environment sexual harassment.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>To prove this claim, a plaintiff must show that the harassment \u201c(1) would not have occurred but for the employee\u2019s gender; and it was (2) severe or pervasive enough to make a (3) reasonable woman believe that (4) the conditions of employment are altered and the working environment is hostile or abusive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603-04, 626 A.2d 445 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">As the Court identified the elements of a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim in <em>Lehmann, </em>it also addressed the issue of employer liability for sexual harassment by a supervisor or co-employee. <em>Id. </em>at 615-24, 626 A.2d 445. It held that \u201cthe employer is directly and strictly liable for all equitable damages and relief\u2019 to the extent that an employee subjected to discrimination or sexual harassment seeks equitable remedies, that is, restoration \u201cto the terms, conditions, and privileges of employment the employee would have enjoyed but for the workplace discrimination or harassment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617, 626 A.2d 445. With respect to claims for damages, however, the Court declined to hold an employer strictly liable for sexual harassment committed by its employee. <em>Ibid. </em>Instead of strict liability, the Court adopted as the measure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>of employer liability a fact-sensitive standard derived from the law of agency. <em>Id. </em>at 620, 626 A.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In its rejection of strict liability, the Court relied on <em>Meritor, </em>then the United States Supreme Court\u2019s sole authority on hostile work environment sexual harassment cases. <em>Id. </em>at 618-19, 626 A.2d 445 (citing <em>Meritor Sav.

In a concurring opinion, Justice Marshall urged the adoption of a strict liability standard in both quid pro quo and hostile work environment cases. <em>Id. </em>at 74-78,106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2409-11, 91 L.Ed.2d at 64-66 (Marshall, J., concurring). Justice Stevens joined both opinions because he shared the majority\u2019s rejection of strict liability and the concurring opinion\u2019s construction of Title VII. <em>Id. </em>at 73, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2409, 91 L.Ed.2d at 64 (Stevens, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Contrary to the argument of our dissenting colleagues, who contend that in <em>Lehmann </em>the Court \u201cdeclined to follow\u201d the <em>Meritor </em>majority in favor of Justice Marshall\u2019s strict liability approach, <em>post </em>at 536-37, 107 A.3d at 1277-78, the Court actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>embraced the agency analysis of the majority in <em>Meritor. </em>It concurred \u201cwith Justice Stevens that there is no inherent contradiction between the majority\u2019s adoption of agency principles and Justice Marshall\u2019s observation that a supervisor\u2019s delegated authority often goes beyond the power to hire and fire.\u201d <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 619, 626 A.2d 445. The Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">We recognize that although we have declined to hold employers strictly liable for hostile work environment sexual harassment by supervisors, we have created a standard that may often result in employers being held vicariously liable for such harassment. We note that there is an important difference between strict liability and vicarious liability under agency law. Under a strict liability standard, an employer would <em>always </em>be liable for supervisory hostile work environment sexual harassment, regardless of the specific facts of the case. We think that in some cases strict liability would be unjust\u2014for example, \u201cwhere a supervisor rapes one of his subordinates in the workplace.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 628-24, 626 A.2d 445 (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>T.L. v.

A master is subject to liability for the torts of his servants committed while acting in the scope of their employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-10\">2. A master is not subject to liability for the torts of his servants acting outside the scope of their employment, unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-11\">(a) the master intended the conduct or the consequences, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-12\">(b) the master was negligent or reckless, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-13\">(c) the conduct violated a non-delegable duty of the master, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-14\">(d) the servant purported to act or to speak on behalf of the principal and there</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-15\">was reliance upon apparent authority, or he was aided in accomplishing the tort</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-16\">by the existence of the agency relation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-17\"><em>[Restatement </em>\u00a7 219.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-18\">As the Court noted in <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>the agency principles of <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219 \u201care sufficiently well-established to provide employers with notice of their potential liability, and also sufficiently flexible to provide just results in the great variety of factual circumstances presented by sexual harassment cases and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>to accomplish the purposes of the LAD.\u201d 132 <em>N.J. </em>at 619, 626 A.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Since this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lehmann, </em>our courts have recognized two primary categories of claims against employers for sexual harassment committed by their employees under Restatement \u00a7 219. The first is a direct cause of action against the employer for negligence or recklessness under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(b). <em>See, e.g., Gaines v. Bellino, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>301, 312-14, 801 A.2d 322 (2002). The second is a claim for vicarious liability under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d). <em>See ibid. </em>Although direct claims for negligence or recklessness under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(b) and claims for vicarious liability under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d) are often discussed in tandem, they are analytically distinct from and independent of one another. When both are pled in a sexual harassment action, as they are in this case, the two claims must be addressed separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Guided by our jurisprudence and agency principles adopted as the benchmark for employer liability, we consider in turn the relevance of the DOC\u2019s anti-harassment policy to Aguas\u2019s negligence and recklessness claim based on <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(b), and the role of that policy in Aguas\u2019s vicarious liability claim premised upon <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">As the parties agree, the DOC\u2019s anti-harassment policy is central to the determination of Aguas\u2019s claim for negligence and recklessness under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(b). The negligence standard imposes on Aguas the burden to prove that the State failed to exercise due care with respect to sexual harassment in the workplace, that its breach of the duty of due care caused the plaintiffs harm, and that she sustained damages. <em>See generally, Komlodi v. Picciano, </em>217 <em>N.J. </em>387, 409, 89 A.3d 1234 (2014); <em>Robinson v. Vivirito, </em>217 <em>N.J. </em>199, 208, 86 A.3d 119 (2014) (citing <em>Jersey Cent. Power &amp; Light Co. v. Melcar Util. Co., </em>212 <em>N.J. </em>576, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>594, 59 A.3d 561 (2013); <em>Weinberg v. Dinger, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>469, 484, 524 A.2d 366 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In <em>Gaines, supra, </em>the Court identified five factors that are relevant to a negligence claim against an employer in a sexual harassment case. 173 <em>N.J. </em>at 313, 801 A.2d 322.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">Those factors inelude[ ] the existence of: (1) formal policies prohibiting harassment in the workplace; (2) complaint structures for employees\u2019 use, both formal and informal in nature; (3) anti-harassment training, which must be mandatory for supervisors and managers, and must be available to all employees of the organization; (4) the existence of effective sensing or monitoring mechanisms to check the trustworthiness of the policies and complaint structures; and (5) an unequivocal commitment from the highest levels of the employer that harassment would not be tolerated, and demonstration of that policy commitment by consistent practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAq\"><em>[Ibid. </em>(citing <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 620, 626 A.2d 445).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Applying that standard to the <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(b) negligence claim before it, the Court found that because of the deficiencies in the employer\u2019s policy, a genuine issue of material fact barred summary judgment with respect to two of the factors relevant to a negligence claim against an employer under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(b). <em>Id. </em>at 315-17, 319, 801 A.2d 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">The Court further noted that <em>Lehmann </em>had recognized that \u201cthe existence of effective preventative mechanisms may provide evidence of due care on the part of the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314, 801 A.2d 322 (citing <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 621-22, 626 A.2d 445). It observed that in <em>Lehmann, </em>the Court declined \u201cto hold that the absence of such mechanisms, or any part of them, automatically constituted negligence, and [ ] similarly rejected the converse proposition that the presence of such mechanisms categorically demonstrated the absence of negligence.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 621-22, 626 A.2d 445). As the Court stated in <em>Gaines, </em>however, \u201c[t]he efficacy of an employer\u2019s remedial program is highly pertinent to an employer\u2019s defense.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">Under the <em>Gaines </em>analysis, the DOC\u2019s anti-harassment policy is relevant to the elements of Aguas\u2019s <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(b) cause of action. If Aguas\u2019s negligence and recklessness claim under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(b) is challenged in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>dispositive motion on remand, or is tried before a jury, evidence of the State\u2019s anti-harassment policy should be considered in accordance with the factors identified in <em>Gaines.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d), an employee may assert that the employer is vicariously hable for sexual harassment committed by its employee because the sexual harasser purported to act on the employer\u2019s behalf and \u201cthere was reliance upon [his or her] apparent authority,\u201d or because the harasser \u201cwas aided in [his or her misconduct] by the existence of an agency relationship]\u201d with his or her employer. <em>See Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 619, 626 A.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">In <em>Lehmann, </em>the Court held that a vicarious liability claim under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d) \u201crequires a detailed fact-specific analysis\u201d and stated a four-part test for the factfinder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">1. Did the employer delegate the authority to the supervisor to control the situation of which the plaintiff complains ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-10\">2. Did the supervisor exercise that authority?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-11\">3. Did the exercise of authority result in a violation of [the LAD]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-12\">4. Did the authority delegated by the employer to the supervisor aid the supervisor in injuring the plaintiff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-14\"><em>[Id. </em>at 620, 626 A.2d 445 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-15\">If each of these questions are answered in the affirmative, \u201cthen the employer is vicariously liable for the supervisor\u2019s harassment under <em>[Restatement] </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d).\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-16\">This Court\u2019s prior jurisprudence does not address in detail the analytical framework under which an employer\u2019s anti-harassment policy may be considered in a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim involving a supervisor. Nonetheless, that jurisprudence strongly supports the availability of an affirmative defense, based on the employer\u2019s creation and enforcement of an effective policy against sexual harassment, in a vicarious liability claim based on <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>First, the <em>Restatement </em>provision at the heart of the Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Lehmann </em>sets forth agency principles that directly implicate an employer\u2019s policy, or its lack of a policy, against sexual harassment in the workplace. <em>See id. </em>at 619, 626 A.2d 445 (citing <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d)). The existence and enforcement of a policy charging supervisors with ensuring a harassment-free workplace is central to the questions raised by <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d): whether a harassing supervisor \u201cpurport[s] to act or to speak on behalf of the principal,\u201d whether \u201cthere was reliance upon [that supervisor\u2019s] apparent authority,\u201d and whether a harasser was \u201caided in accomplishing\u201d the harassment by \u201cthe existence of the agency relation.\u201d <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Second, in rejecting strict liability, the Court in <em>Lehmann, swpra, </em>clearly envisioned that an employer would be permitted to argue that vicarious liability should not be imposed in the circumstances of the individual case. <em>See </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 624, 626 A.2d 445 (explaining that \u201c[u]nder agency law, an employer\u2019s liability for a supervisor\u2019s sexual harassment will depend on the facts of the case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Third, the Court held that any legal test governing vicarious liability claims should motivate employers to create and enforce a policy against harassment. <em>Id. </em>at 626, 626 A.2d 445. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>observed that an effective legal test allows employees \u201cto know their rights in a given set of circumstances,\u201d and permits \u201cemployers to set policies and procedures that comply with that test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603, 626 A.2d 445. Noting that \u201c[e]ourtrooms are not the best place to prevent or remedy a hostile work environment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 625, 626 A.2d 445, the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">The most important tool in the prevention of sexual harassment is the education of both employees and employers. Consensus among employees and employers should be the goal. We think that providing employers with the incentive not only to provide voluntary compliance programs but also to insist on the effective enforcement of their programs will do much to ensure that hostile work environment discrimination claims disappear from the workplace and the courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 626, 626 A.2d 445.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The Court\u2019s intention that its legal test motivate employers to implement and enforce \u201cvoluntary compliance programs\u201d strongly signals that such compliance programs, if effective and enforced, may give rise to an affirmative defense to an LAD claim. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Thus, although the Court did not delineate in <em>Lehmann </em>the precise role that an anti-sexual harassment policy should play in a vicarious liability sexual harassment ease brought under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d), it foresaw a fact-specific inquiry in which the employer\u2019s implementation of a meaningful anti-harassment policy, or its failure to do so, would be, in many cases, an important factor. <em>See id. </em>at 620, 622-24, 626 A.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">The Court\u2019s subsequent authority affirms this principle. In <em>Cavuoti v. New Jersey Transit Corp., </em>a case involving the standard for an award of punitive damages against an employer in supervisor sexual harassment litigation, the Court reiterated that an employer\u2019s anti-harassment policy is a significant factor in such cases. 161 <em>N.J. </em>107,113,120-21, 735 A.2d 548 (1999). This Court commented that \u201clike the [United States] Supreme Court we have afforded a form of a safe haven for employers who promulgate and support an active, anti-harassment policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120-21, 735 A.2d 548. The Court further observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-10\">A company that develops policies reflecting a lack of tolerance for harassment will have less concern about hostile work environment or punitive damages claims if its good-faith attempts include periodic publication to workers of the employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>anti-harassment policy; an effective and practical grievance process; and training sessions for workers, supervisors, and managers about how to recognize and eradicate unlawful harassment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 121, 785 <em>A.2d </em>548.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Finally, in <em>Gaines, supra, </em>the Court expressly confirmed the availability of an affirmative defense to vicarious liability based on an effective policy against sexual harassment. It held that \u201c[a] defendant is entitled to assert the existence of an effective anti-sexual harassment workplace policy as an affirmative defense to vicarious liability; however, material issues of disputed fact in the context of a motion record can deny a defendant summary dismissal based on that defense.\u201d 173 <em>N.J. </em>at 320, 801 A.2d 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Notwithstanding that clear language, our dissenting colleagues inexplicably assert that the Court \u201cnever hint[ed] that an affirmative defense applied to supervisory liability under the <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d) approach.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 535, 107 A.3d at 1276. The dissent also asserts that in <em>Gaines, </em>the Court stated only that an affirmative defense is available to an employer in a negligence case under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(b). <em>Post </em>at 535-36, 107 A.3d at 1276-77. In fact, the Court expressly recognized in <em>Gaines </em>an affirmative defense to a <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d) claim for vicarious liability. <em>See Gaines, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 320, 801 A.2d 322; <em>see also Godfrey v. Princeton Theological Seminary, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>178, 200, 952 A.2d 1034 (2008) (stating that \u201c[t]he means employed by an institution to deter harassment, and the enforcement of those means, may be considered when assessing that institution\u2019s vicarious liability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Thus, the Court\u2019s prior case law provides important guidance with respect to this issue. In <em>Lehmann, Cavuoti </em>and <em>Gaines, </em>the Court acknowledged the value of effective anti-harassment policies in combatting sexual harassment in the workplace, and recognized that employers will be motivated to implement and enforce such policies if their policies provide a defense to a claim of vicarious liability. <em>See Gaines, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 320, 801 A.2d 322; <em>Cavuoti, supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 120-21, 735 A.2d 548; <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 619, 626, 626 A.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>As in other settings involving the LAD, we consider federal law construing Title VII with respect to this issue. In <em>Ellerth </em>and <em>Faragher, </em>the United States Supreme Court addressed Title VII vicarious liability claims premised on principles of agency. These cases, which had not been decided when this Court decided <em>Lehmann, </em>represent part of the evolution in federal law that has occurred as employer anti-harassment policies have become more prevalent in the workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\"><em>Ellerth </em>and <em>Faragher </em>arose from a supervisor\u2019s alleged sexual harassment of a subordinate, which gave rise to a hostile work environment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Supreme Court confirmed that <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d) provides the analytical framework for supervisory sexual harassment cases because \u201c[t]he agency relationship affords contact with an employee subjected to a supervisor\u2019s sexual harassment, and the victim may well be reluctant to accept the risks of blowing the whistle on a superior.\u201d <em>Faragher, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 803,118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2291,141 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The Supreme Court noted, however, that the proper analysis \u201ccalls not for a mechanical application of indefinite and malleable factors set forth in the <em>Restatement ... </em>but rather an inquiry into the reasons that would support a conclusion that harassing behavior ought to be held within the scope of a supervisor\u2019s employment, and the reasons for the opposite view.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 797,118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2288,141 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d at 682. The Supreme Court further observed that the agency principles it espoused must be consonant with <em>Mentor, </em>in which it had declined to impose strict liability on employers in supervisor sexual harassment cases. <em>Id. </em>at 804, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2291, 141 L.Ed.2d at 686 (footnote omitted); <em>see also Ellerth, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 755, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2266, 141 L.Ed.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>649. In <em>Faragher, supra, </em>the Court explained that \u201cthere is obviously some tension between [Meritor\u2019s] holding and the position that a supervisor\u2019s misconduct aided by supervisory authority subjects the employer to liability vicariously; if the \u2018aid\u2019 may be the unspoken suggestion of retaliation by misuse of supervisory authority, the risk of automatic liability is high.\u201d <em>Faragher, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 804, 118 <em>S.Ct </em>at 2291, 141 L.Ed.2d at 686 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The Supreme Court identified two \u201cbasic alternatives\u201d by which Meritor\u2019s rejection of strict liability could be reconciled with the Restatement\u2019s analysis: a requirement that a plaintiff provide proof that the supervisor affirmatively invoked his or her authority, or the recognition of \u201can affirmative defense to liability in some circumstances, even when a supervisor has created the actionable environment.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court rejected the first alternative, noting the vagueness and impracticality of such a test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">Application of the standard is made difficult by its malleable terminology, which can be read to either expand or limit liability in the context of supervisor harassment. On the one hand, a supervisor\u2019s power and authority invests his or her harassing conduct with a particular threatening character, and in this sense, a supervisor always is aided by the agency relation. <em>See Meritor, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>at 77,106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2410, 91 <em>L.Ed,.2d </em>at 66 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cIt is precisely because the supervisor is understood to be clothed with the employer\u2019s authority that he is able to impose unwelcome sexual conduct on subordinates\u201d). On the other hand, there are acts of harassment a supervisor might commit which might be the same acts a co-employee would commit, and there may be some circumstances where the supervisor\u2019s status makes little difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\"><em>[Ellerth, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 763,118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2269,141 L.Ed.2d at 654.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">In reconciling the test of <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d) with <em>Meritor </em>\u2019s rejection of strict liability, the Supreme Court embraced the second alternative: the recognition of an affirmative defense. <em>Id. </em>at 765,118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2270,141 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 655; <em>Faragher, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 805-06, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2290, 141 L.Ed.2d at 686. In so doing, the Supreme Court emphasized the legislative goal of deterring sexual harassment by promoting responsible efforts by employers to detect, address, and punish it. <em>Ellerth, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 764, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2270, 141 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 654; <em>Faragher, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 805-06, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2290, 141 L.Ed.2d at 686. As this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>construed the LAD in <em>Lehmann, </em>the Supreme Court held that the \u201c \u2018primary objective\u2019 \u201d of Title VII was \u201cnot to provide redress but to avoid harm.\u201d <em>Faragher, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 805-06,118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2292.141 L.Ed.2d at 688 (quoting <em>Albemarle Paper Co. v.

The Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">It would therefore implement clear statutory policy and complement the Government\u2019s Title VII enforcement efforts to recognize the employer\u2019s affirmative obligation to prevent violations and give credit here to employers who make reasonable efforts to discharge their duty.

Invoking \u201cthe general theory of damages,\u201d the Supreme Court observed that a complainant in a sexual harassment case \u201chas a duty \u2018to use such means as are reasonable under the circumstances to avoid or minimize the damages\u2019 that result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>from violations of [Title VII].\u201d <em>Faragher, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 806, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2292, 141 L.Ed.2d at 688 (quoting <em>Ford Motor Co. v.

It held that \u201c[i]f the plaintiff unreasonably failed to avail herself of the employer\u2019s preventive or remedial apparatus, she should not recover damages that could have been avoided if she had done so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 806-07,118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2292, 141 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 688; <em>see also Ellerth, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 765, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2270,141 L.Ed.2d at 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In <em>Ellerth </em>and <em>Famgher, </em>the Supreme Court thus integrated the agency principles of <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d) with the legislative objective of deterring sexual harassment by promoting effective anti-harassment policies. It adopted the following standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2O\">An employer is subject, to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee. When no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. </em>8(c). The defense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\"><em>[Faragher, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 807, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2292-93, 141 L.Ed.2d at 689; <em>see also Ellerth, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 765, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2270, 141 L.Ed.2d at 655.1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">The Supreme Court further commented that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">[wlhile proof that an employer had promulgated an anti-harassment policy with complaint procedure is not necessary in every instance as a matter of law, the need for a stated policy suitable to the employment circumstances may appropriately be addressed in any ease when litigating the first element of the defense,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1W\"><em>[Faragher, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 807, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2293, 141 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 689; <em>Ellerth, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 765,118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2270,141 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 655.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">We concur with the Supreme Court that the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>analysis provides a fair and practical framework for supervisor sexual harassment cases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>focus of <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d) on the nexus between the employer\u2019s delegation of authority and the harassment, the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>affirmative defense may not be asserted \u201cwhen the supervisor\u2019s harassment culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion or undesirable reassignment.\u201d <em>Faragher, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 808, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2293, 141 L.Ed.2d at 689; <em>Ellerth, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 765, 118 <em>S.Ct. at </em>2270, 141 L.Ed.2d at 655. No affirmative defense is available in such cases because \u201c[w]hen a supervisor makes a tangible employment decision, there is assurance the injury could not have been inflicted absent the agency relation____Tangible employment actions are the means by which the supervisor brings the official power of the enterprise to bear on subordinates.\u201d <em>Ellerth, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 761-62,118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2269,141 L.Ed.2d at 653-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">In addition, the defense provides no protection to an employer whose sexual harassment policy fails to provide \u201cmeaningful and effective policies and procedures for employees to use in response to harassment.\u201d <em>Gaines, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 317, 801 A.2d 322; <em>see also Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 626, 626 A.2d 445 (stating that the LAD requires an \u201cunequivocal commitment from the top that [the employer\u2019s opposition to sexual harassment] is not just words[,] but backed up by consistent practice\u201d); <em>accord Faragher, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 806-07, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2292, 141 L.Ed.2d at 688; <em>Ellerth, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 765, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2270, 141 L.Ed.2d at 655. In short, the affirmative defense provides no benefit to employers who empower sexually harassing employees who take tangible employment actions against their victims, em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>ployers who fail to implement effective anti-harassment policies, and employers whose policies exist in name only.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Conversely, the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>framework motivates employers and employees to accomplish the paramount objective identified by this Court in <em>Lehmann: </em>the prevention of sexual harassment. <em>See Lehmann, supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>at 625-26, 626 A.2d 445. The prospect of an affirmative defense in litigation is a powerful incentive for an employer to unequivocally warn its workforce that sexual harassment will not be tolerated, to provide consistent training, and to strictly enforce its policy. <em>See ibid.; accord Faragher, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 806-07, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2292, 141 L.Ed.2d at 688; <em>Ellerth, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 764-65, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2270, 141 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 655. The <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>defense similarly motivates a complainant in a sexual harassment case to report the offense internally, and thereby enable his or her employer to take immediate action against a harassing supervisor or coworker.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">In contending that we authorize employers to \u201chide behind a paper anti-discrimination policy,\u201d <em>post </em>at 581, 107 A.3d at 1274, and permit defendants to \u201cseek cover behind an ineffective anti-discrimination policy,\u201d <em>post </em>at 533,107 A.3d at 1274, our dissenting colleagues\u2019 rhetoric fundamentally mischaracterizes our decision. So that the dissent\u2019s description of our opinion does not confuse employers, employees, counsel or trial courts with respect to this pivotal issue, we restate: an employer that implements an ineffective anti-harassment policy, or fails to enforce its policy, may not assert the affirmative defense. <em>See Faragher, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 806-07, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2292, 141 L.Ed.2d at 688; <em>Ellerth, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 764-65,118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2270,141 L.Ed.2d at 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Accordingly, we expressly adopt the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>analysis for supervisor sexual harassment cases in which a hostile work environment is claimed pursuant to the LAD, and no tangible employment action is taken. <em>See Entrot v. BASF Corp., </em>359 <em>N.J.Super. </em>162, 187, 819 A.2d 447 (App.Div.2003) (anticipating adoption of <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>affirmative defense, and holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>\u201cthere is no barrier to the application of a Title VII defense [based on <em>Ellerth/Faragher] </em>to an LAD action\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In a hostile work environment sexual harassment case under the LAD in which the plaintiff alleges employer vicarious liability under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d), the plaintiff has the initial burden of presenting a prima facie hostile work environment claim. If no tangible <em>employment action has been </em>taken against the plaintiff, the defendant employer may assert the two-pronged affirmative defense of <em>Ellerth </em>and <em>Faragher. </em>To establish that defense, the defendant employer has the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, both prongs of the affirmative defense: first, that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and to correct promptly sexually harassing behavior; and second, that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to otherwise avoid harm. <em>See Faragher, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 807, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2293, 141 L.Ed.2d at 689; <em>Ellerth, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 746, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2262, 141 L.Ed.2d at 644. The employee may rebut the elements of the affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Thus, in further proceedings in this case, including any summary judgment proceedings that may follow remand, the State may avoid vicarious liability under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d) by demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that the DOC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and that Aguas unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the DOC, or to avoid harm otherwise. <em>See Faragher, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 807, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2292, 141 L.Ed.2d at 688; <em>Ellerth, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 765, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2270, 141 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The second issue raised in this case, the definition of a supervisor for purposes of claims based on sexual harassment giving rise to a hostile work environment, is a pivotal factor in the application of the agency principles set forth in <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d). Liability under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d) predicated on a supervisor\u2019s misconduct raises a critical question of fact\u2014the parameters of the authority conferred on the alleged harasser and whether he or she is properly considered a supervisor. <em>See Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The Court in <em>Lehmann </em>did not expressly define \u201csupervisor\u201d for purposes of deciding vicarious liability sexual harassment cases under agency law. It alluded, however, to the \u201cpower delegated to [a supervisor] to control the day-to-day working environment.\u201d <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 620, 626 A.2d 445. Further, in the context of its discussion of punitive damages, the Court distinguished between a \u201csupervisor\u201d and the employer\u2019s \u201cupper management.\u201d <em>let. </em>at 622-23, 626 A.2d 445. The Court thus suggested that its concept of a supervisor, for purposes of the agency analysis that it proposed, included a broader range of managers than the senior executives who set policy for an employer. <em>Id. </em>at 623, 626 A.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Similarly, in <em>Cavuoti, supra, </em>in which the definition of \u201cupper management\u201d for purposes of a claim for punitive damages was the primary issue, the Court cited federal authority for the principle that it is an alleged harasser\u2019s functional authority in the workplace, not simply his or her power to hire and terminate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>subordinate, that defines his or her status as a \u201csupervisor.\u201d 161 <em>N.J. at </em>124-25, 735 A.2d 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In its role as the agency charged with the enforcement of Title VII, the EEOC provided guidance to employers regarding the meaning of the term \u201csupervisor\u201d for purposes of sexual harassment eases. <em>U.S. Equal Emp\u2019t Opportunity Comm\u2019n, </em>No. 915.002 <em>Enforcement Guidance on Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors </em>3-5 (June 18, 1999) [hereinafter \u201cEEOC Guidance\u201d], <em>available at </em>http://www.eeoe.gov/policy/docs/ harassmentpdf.' Applying the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>analysis, the EEOC cautioned that the determination of whether an alleged harasser is a \u201csupervisor\u201d turns on job function, not job title, that it \u201cmust be based on the specific facts,\u201d and that a supervisor\u2019s authority \u201cmust be of sufficient magnitude so as to assist the harasser explicitly or implicitly in carrying out the harassment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The first of the two definitions of \u201csupervisor\u201d promulgated by the EEOC focuses on the supervisor\u2019s capacity to undertake the adverse employment decisions that, if made, bar an employer from invoking the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>affirmative defense. Under that definition, \u201c[a]n individual qualifies as an employee\u2019s \u2018supervisor\u2019 if he or she is authorized to undertake tangible employment decisions affecting the employee.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The EEOC Guidance defines \u201ctangible employment decisions\u201d to include, but not to be limited to, \u201chiring and firing, promotion and failure to promote, demotion, undesirable reassignment, a decision causing a significant change in benefits, compensation decisions and work assignment,\u201d and \u201csuspension\u201d or other \u201cprogressive discipline.\u201d Id. at 4, 6-7 n. 31. The EEOC explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">An individual whose job responsibilities include the authority to recommend tangible job decisions affecting an employee qualifies as his or her supervisor even if the individual does not have the final say. As the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Ellerth, </em>a tangible employment decision \u201cmay be subject to review by higher level supervisors.\u201d As long as the individual\u2019s recommendation is given substantial weight by the final decision maker(s), that individual meets the definition of supervisor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">[/d at 4 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>The EEOC\u2019s second definition of \u201csupervisor\u201d reflects the language of the second clause in <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d), which requires that the sexual harasser be \u201caided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.\u201d <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d). Citing the lifeguard supervisor setting of <em>Faragher, </em>the EEOC deems \u201c[a]n individual who is authorized to direct another employee\u2019s day-to-day work activities\u201d as a supervisor, \u201ceven if that individual does not have the authority to undertake or recommend tangible job decisions.\u201d <em>EEOC Guidance, supra, </em>at 4. The EEOC stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">An individual who is temporarily authorized to direct another employee\u2019s daily-work activities qualifies as his or her \u201csupervisor\u201d during that time period. Accordingly, the employer would be subject to vicarious liability if that individual commits unlawful harassment of a subordinate while serving as his or her supervisor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">On the other hand, someone who merely relays other officials\u2019 instructions regarding work assignments and reports back to those officials does not have true supervisory authority. Furthermore, someone who directs only a limited number of tasks or assignments would not qualify as a \u201csupervisor.\u201d For example, an individual whose delegated authority is confined to coordinating a work project of limited scope is not a supervisor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 5.J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">In <em>Vance v. Ball State University, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>2434, 2443,186 L.Ed.2d 565 (2013), a closely divided United States Supreme Court adopted a substantially narrower definition of \u201csupervisor\u201d than that of the EEOC for purposes of employer vicarious liability in supervisor sexual harassment cases. There, the majority construed <em>Ellerth </em>and <em>Faragher </em>to envision not two definitions of the term \u201csupervisor,\u201d but \u201ca unitary category of supervisors, <em>i.e., </em>those employees with the authority to make tangible employment decisions.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-10\">[A]n employer may be vicariously liable for an employee\u2019s unlawful harassment only when the employer has empowered that employee to take tangible employment actions against the victim, i.e., to effect a \u201csignificant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-11\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Ellerth, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 7(11, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2257, 141 <em>L.E.2d </em>at 633).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>We decline to adopt the restrictive definition of \u201csupervisor\u201d prescribed by the Supreme Court majority in <em>Vance. </em>In light of our fact-specific approach to sexual harassment cases, we respectfully disagree with the Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of the EEOC\u2019s definition of supervisor on the grounds that it relies \u201con a highly case-specific evaluation of numerous factors.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We agree with the EEOC that the term \u201csupervisor,\u201d defined more expansively to include not only employees granted the authority to make tangible employment decisions, but also those placed in charge of the complainant\u2019s daily work activities, accurately reflects the two different settings envisioned by <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Moreover, this broader definition comports with this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Lehmann, </em>in which the Court recognized the importance, in <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d) sexual harassment cases, of a supervisor\u2019s authority to control the day-to-day working environment. <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 620, 626 A.2d 445. It is also consistent with the holding in <em>Cavuoti </em>in which the Court rejected the notion that only the power to hire and terminate a subordinate distinguishes a supervisor from a co-employee. <em>Cavuoti supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 124-25, 735 A.2d 548. The EEOC definition takes into account the broad range of employer structures and factual settings in which sexual harassment occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Most importantly, the more expansive definition of \u201csupervisor\u201d furthers the paramount goal of the LAD: the eradication of sexual harassment in the workplace. It prompts employers to focus attention not only on an elite group of decision-makers at the pinnacle of the organization, but on all employees granted the authority to direct the day-to-day responsibilities of subordinates, and to ensure that those employees are carefully selected and thoroughly trained.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">In any additional proceedings in this ease following remand, the question of whether McClish or Hill served as Aguas\u2019s \u201csupervisor\u201d should be determined in accordance with the two definitions set forth by the EEOC. Under that standard, the allegedly harassing employee should be considered a supervisor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>for purposes of Aguas\u2019s hostile work environment claim if either: (1) he was authorized to undertake tangible employment decisions affecting Aguas; or (2) he was authorized by the DOC to direct her day-to-day work activities at Edna Mahan.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Finally, we consider Aguas\u2019s claim for punitive damages. The trial court premised its dismissal of Aguas\u2019s punitive damages claim on its determination that the record supported no claim for compensatory damages in this case and accordingly did not undertake a detailed analysis of the punitive damages claim. We briefly review the standard that governs such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">A plaintiff asserting a punitive damages claim in a LAD case against a public entity such as the DOC must meet a high standard. A public sector employer \u201cwhose egregious conduct violates the LAD may be held \u2018liable for punitive damages ... only in the event of actual participation by upper management or willful indifference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lockley v.

The plaintiff must prove egregious conduct on the part of the defendant by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 432, 828 A.2d 869 (citing <em>L. </em>1995, c. 142, \u00a7 11); <em>see also Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 624-25, 626 A.2d 445 (quoting <em>Leimgruber v.

Following <em>Lehmann, </em>this Court has never addressed the jury charge that should be given in a supervisory sexual harassment case. If, as the dissent suggests, the Model Jury Charge endorses a strict liability test in cases such as this, then the charge is inconsistent with <em>I^ehmann, Cavuoti </em>and <em>Gaines.

In fact, the jury charge cited by the dissent derives from the <em>I^ehmann </em>Court\u2019s adoption of the inquiry set forth in <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d): whether the supervisor \u201cpurported to act or to speak on behalf of the principal and there was reliance upon apparent authority, or was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.\u201d <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d).

Today\u2019s decision tears down the central pillar of our landmark decision in <em>Lehmann v. Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>587, 626 A.2d 445 (1993), which announced that an employer would be vicariously liable for sexual harassment committed by one of its supervisors. <em>Lehmann </em>allowed no quarter for supervisory sexual harassment and provided for no affirmative defense for the employer. We said so in clear, unmistakable terms, leaving no doubt that under New Jersey\u2019s Law Against Discrimination (LAD), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to -49, this State\u2019s workers had safeguards not present under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">The Appellate Division, the United States District Court of New Jersey, and the New Jersey Supreme Court Committee on Civil Jury Charges all recognized that under <em>Lehmann, </em>when the supervisor is the sexual harasser, the employer has no affirmative defense and cannot hide behind a paper anti-discrimination policy. Civil Jury Charge 2.25 reaffirmed in 2013 what we said twenty years earlier in Lehmann\u2014that an employer is vicariously liable if a supervisor creates a hostile work environment through sexual harassment. Model Jury Charge (Civil) 2.25 \u201cHostile Work Environment Claims Under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>tion (Sexual and Other Harassment)\u201d (February 2013). Trial courts have been guided by that charge for eighteen years. The majority now says it was all a mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">I cannot pretend that the majority\u2019s retreat from <em>Lehmann </em>will not have real-life negative consequences for the targets of workplace discrimination. Going forward, sexually harassed employees\u2014mostly women\u2014will be less likely to find relief in our courts, and therefore will be less likely to take their grievances there.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And employers will have less incentive to use greater care in selecting supervisors who will enforce rather than violate anti-discrimination policies. This is not a sky-is-falling prediction but a stark reality for anyone who understands what our jurisprudence was and what it has now become.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The Law Against Discrimination is one of New Jersey\u2019s most progressive legislative schemes. Under the LAD, vicarious supervisory liability was a critical remedy both in making discriminated employees whole and in deterring workplace harassment. Because the majority has abandoned that remedy without any compensating benefit, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">In our landmark decision in <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 615-25, 626 A.2d 445, we set forth the different pathways for employer liability under our LAD when an employee is subjected to a hostile work environment through sexual harassment. In cases involving a hostile work environment persisting through an employer\u2019s alleged negligence, we allowed for an employer to show that it exercised due care by effectuating an antidiscrimination policy accessible to employees. <em>Id. </em>at 621-22, 626 A.2d 445 (relying on <em>Restatement (Second) of Agency </em>\u00a7 219(2)(b) (1958)). However, we took a different approach when the supervisor was the perpe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>trator of sexual harassment. In that circumstance, we clearly stated that an employer would be vicariously liable for the supervisor\u2019s sexual harassment of a subordinate because the employer delegated to the supervisor the authority to control the workplace. <em>Id. </em>at 620, 626 A.2d 445 (relying on <em>Restatement (Second) of Agency, supra, </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d)). The employer could not seek cover behind an ineffective anti-discrimination policy that did not deter a supervisor from misusing the power delegated to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">In <em>Lehmann, </em>we stated that whether an employer is liable for the hostile work environment created by a supervisor controlling the day-to-day activities of an employee depends on how a factfinder decides four questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">1. Did the employer delegate the authority to the supervisor to control the situation of which the plaintiff complains?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">2. Did the supervisor exercise that authority?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">3. Did the exercise of authority result in a violation of the LAD?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-10\">4. Did the authority delegated by the employer to the supervisor aid the supervisor in injuring the plaintiff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-12\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-13\">We further stated that \u201c[w]hen the answer to each of those questions is yes, then the employer is vicariously liable for the supervisor\u2019s harassment under \u00a7 219(2)(d).\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In supervisory liability cases, <em>Lehmann </em>posed no fifth question asking whether an employer should be excused because of a purportedly effective anti-discrimination policy available to its harassed employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-14\">Lehmann\u2019s simple formulation of employer supervisory liability was understood by our courts and by various Supreme Court Committees given the task of preparing a jury charge consistent with our holding in <em>Lehmann.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">Writing for the Appellate Division in <em>Schmidt v. Smith, </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>569, 578, 684 A.2d 66 (App.Div.1996), <em>aff'd, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>44, 713 A.2d 1014 (1998), Judge Keefe noted that the <em>\u201cLehmann </em>Court provided a check list for the determination of whether a supervisor who creates a hostile work environment was aided in accomplishing that tort by the power delegated to him or her to control the day-to-day working environment.\u201d Judge Keefe quot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>ed the above four-question test in <em>Lehmann </em>and stated: \u201cWhen the answer to each of these questions is yes, then the employer is vicariously liable for the supervisor\u2019s harassment under \u00a7 219(2)(d).\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 619, 626 A.2d 445). Judge Keefe pointed out that unlike supervisory liability, the standard governing sexual harassment negligence claims allows an employer to present evidence of due care, such as \u201csome effective preventative mechanisms such as anti-harassment policies, formal and informal complaint structures and monitoring mechanisms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579, 684 A.2d 66 (citing <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 621, 626 A.2d 445).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The Supreme Court Model Civil Jury Charge Committee, comprised of preeminent judges and lawyers, has formulated and revised a supervisory-liability charge four times since 1997, each time asserting that an employer has no defense to a supervisor\u2019s sexual harassment if the factfinder answers the four <em>Lehmann </em>questions in the affirmative. As recently as February 2013, the Model Civil Jury Charge Committee issued instructions on employer liability when a supervisor or non-supervisor creates the hostile work environment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Civil Jury Charge 2.25 provides that an employer is liable \u201cif it delegated to [the harassing supervisor] the authority to control the working environment and [the harassing supervisor] abused that authority to create a hostile work environment.\u201d Model Jury Charge (Civil) 2.25(4)(b). The jury is (and has been) provided with the following instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>To prove that defendant [employer\u2019s name] is liable to plaintiff based on its delegation of authority to [name(s) of alleged harassing supervisor(s) ], plaintiff must prove each of the following elements by a preponderance of the evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">(1) That defendant I employer\u2019s name] delegated authority to [name(s) of alleged harassing supervisor(s) ] to control the situation of which plaintiff complains; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">(2) Lname(s) of alleged harassing supervisor(s) ] exercised that authority; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">(3) [name(s) of alleged harassing supervisor(s) 1 exercise of authority resulted in unlawful harassment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">(4) the authority delegated by defendant [employer name] to [name(s) of alleged harassing supervisor(s) ] aided [name(s) of alleged harassing supervisor(s) ] in harassing plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">If you find that the plaintiff has proved each of these elements, then defendant [employer\u2019s name] is liable for the alleged unlawful harassment. If any one of these elements is not proved, then defendant [employer\u2019s name] cannot be held liable based on its delegation of authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">That charge has been given to juries for eighteen years. In <em>Gaines v. Bellino, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>301, 313, 801 A.2d 322 (2002), we reaffirmed the basic formula found in this jury charge derived from <em>Lehmann, </em>never hinting that an affirmative defense applied to supervisory liability under the <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(d) approach. We did so even though <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>775, 807, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>2275, 2293, 141 L.Ed.2d 662, 689 (1998) and <em>Burlington Indus. v. Ellerth, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>742, 764-65, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>2257, 2270, 141 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>633, 655 (1998), which provide an affirmative defense to supervisory liability, were both on the books. In <em>Gaines, supra, </em>we only stated that when an employee alleges employer negligence in causing a hostile work environment, under <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 219(2)(b), the employer can assert the affirmative defense that it had an anti-discrimination policy in place. 173 <em>N.J. </em>at 313-14, 801 A.2d 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">Moreover, that <em>Cavuoti v. New Jersey Transit Corp., </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>107, 120-21, 735 A.2d 548 (1999), permits an affirmative defense to a punitive-damage claim against a company in a LAD case, in no way contradicts Lehmann\u2019s no-affirmative defense to a compensatory-damage claim involving supervisory liability, as the majority suggests. Nowhere in <em>Cavuoti </em>does the Court contravene the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>supervisory-liability test for compensatory damages crafted in <em>Lehmann.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Last, if <em>Cavuoti </em>and <em>Gaines </em>stood for the proposition that an affirmative defense applies to vicarious supervisory liability\u2014as the majority asserts\u2014then it stands to reason that this Court in 1999 and 2002 would have directed the Model Civil Jury Charge Committee to amend the Model Charge to conform to that view. But that never happened. Only now does the majority give the directive to the Committee to amend the Charge to include an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">In <em>Lehmann, swpra, </em>we understood that we were pursuing our own path, a different path in construing the LAD as providing greater protection against workplace discrimination than that afforded by federal courts construing Title VII. 132 <em>N.J. </em>at 600-01, 603, 618-20, 626 A.2d 445. Indeed, we eschewed the standard set forth by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit for hostile work environment sexual harassment. <em>Id. </em>at 603, 626 A.2d 445. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">[W]e announce a new test in the hope of creating a standard that both employees and employers will be able to understand and one that employers can realistically enforce. We cannot overstate the importance we place on a test that allows employees to know their rights in a given set of circumstances and that allows employers to set policies and procedures that comply with that test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-9\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Importantly, in <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>we declined to follow the United States Supreme Court majority\u2019s decision in <em>Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>57,106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2399, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986). 132 <em>N.J. </em>at 618-21, 626 A.2d 445. <em>Meritor, supra, </em>refused to accept the notion that \u201can employer is strictly liable for a hostile environment created by a supervisor\u2019s sexual advances, even though the employer neither knew nor reasonably could have known of the alleged misconduct.\u201d 477 <em>U.S. </em>at 69-70,106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2407, 91 L.Ed.2d at 61. Rather than follow <em>Meritor, </em>in <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>we cited approvingly Justice Marshall\u2019s concurrence (joined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>by Justices Brennan, Blaekmun, and Stevens) on supervisory liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">[A] supervisor\u2019s responsibilities do not begin and end with the power to hire, fire, and discipline employees, or with the power to recommend such actions. Rather, a supervisor is charged with the day-to-day supervision of the work environment and with ensuring a safe, productive workplace. There is no reason why abuse of the latter authority should have different consequences than abuse of the former. In both cases it is the authority vested in the supervisor by the employer that enables him to commit the wrong: it is precisely because the supervisor is understood to be clothed with the employer\u2019s authority that he is able to impose unwelcome sexual conduct on subordinates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">[132 <em>N.J. </em>at 618-19, 626 A.2d 445 (quoting <em>Meritor, supra, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>at 76-77, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2410, 91 L.Ed.2d at 65-66 (Marshall, J., concurring)).!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Faragher, supra, </em>declared that it was bound to follow the majority decision in <em>Meritor. </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 792, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2286, 141 L.Ed.2d at 679. However, as pointed out, in <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>we did not adopt the reasoning in <em>Meritor. </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 618-21, 626 A.2d 445. Therefore, we are not bound to follow <em>Faragher </em>in lock-step.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\"><em>Faragher, supra, </em>held that an employer is subject to strict \u201cvicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee\u201d when a tangible employment action is taken, \u201csuch as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment.\u201d 524 <em>U.S. </em>at 807-08, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2293, 141 L.Ed.2d at 689. On the other hand, \u201c[w]hen no tangible employment action is taken\u201d\u2014for example, when the harassing conduct causes an employee to suffer a nervous breakdown or a severe psychiatric <em>disorder\u2014Faragher </em>allows an affirmative defense. <em>See id. </em>at 807, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2293, 141 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 689. The affirmative defense comes into play if the employer can show \u201c(a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court came to the same holding in <em>Ellerth, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at 764-65,118 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2270,141 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d at 655, which was decided on the same day as <em>Faragher. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Until today, the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>affirmative defense standard was foreign to our LAD jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\"><em>Lehmann </em>makes no such distinction between tangible employment actions and sexual harassment that may cause physical or psychological harm to the employee. Under <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>so long as the \u201cemployer grants the supervisor the authority to control the working environment and the supervisor abuses that authority to create a hostile work environment,\u201d the employer is liable for compensatory damages, whatever they may be. 132 <em>N.J. </em>at 624, 626 A.2d 445. Thus, a supervisor who sexually harasses and psychologically breaks an employee will be liable for compensatory damages. <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>cannot be squared with <em>Lehmann.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The United States District Court of New Jersey knew that our approach in <em>Lehmann </em>was incompatible with <em>Ellerih/Faragher. </em>In <em>Newsome v. Administrative Office of the Courts, </em>103 F.Supp.2d 807 (D.N.J.2000), the plaintiff asserted violations of Title VII and the LAD, alleging that she was sexually harassed by her supervisor at the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC). Even in the wake of <em>Ellerih/Faragher, </em>Judge Greenaway stated that \u201c[a]l-though the New Jersey Supreme Court frequently looks to Title VII jurisprudence in interpreting the LAD, it has adopted a slightly broader test than that of the Third Circuit for hostile environment harassment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817 (citation omitted). Like Judge Keefe and the Supreme Court Model Civil Jury Charge Committee, Judge Greenaway read <em>Lehmann </em>as not providing an affirmative defense to supervisory liability for sexual harassment. <em>Id. </em>at 822. In a case in which an employer delegates to a supervisor the power to control the work environment, thus facilitating the harassing conduct, Judge Greenaway held that, under the LAD, \u201c[t]he reasonableness of the AOC\u2019s actions in implementing anti-harassment policies is no defense to harassment committed because of the agency relationship.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Judge Greenaway stated that if a jury answered affirmatively that the supervisor\u2019s actions \u201cwere sufficiently severe or pervasive to ere-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>ate a hostile work environment\u201d and that the supervisor \u201cwas able to commit those acts because of the authority delegated him by the AOC,\u201d then \u201cthe AOC will be vicariously liable, irrespective of its anti-harassment policies.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Judge Greenaway understood Lehmann\u2019s distinction between the LAD and Title VII\u2019s approach to supervisory liability. It is that important distinction that the majority paves over today.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Today\u2019s decision is at complete odds with the widely held view that the LAD, under <em>Lehmann, </em>provided greater protection than federal law in hostile work environment cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe LAD is remedial social legislation whose overarching goal is to eradicate the \u2018cancer of discrimination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nini v. Mercer Cnty. Cmty. Coll., </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>98, 108-09, 995 A.2d 1094 (2010). Before today, we heralded this state\u2019s progressive anti-discrimination laws and jurisprudence. For example, in <em>Alexander v. Seton Hall University, </em>204 <em>N.J. </em>219, 222, 234-35, 8 A.3d 198 (2010), we refused to follow the United States Supreme Court\u2019s crabbed \u201cframework for analyzing accrual and timeliness in Title VII wage discrimination claims\u201d in <em>Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>550 <em>U.S. </em>618, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>127 <em>S.Ct. </em>2162, 167 L.Ed.2d 982 (2007), because that framework disadvantaged employees who suffered discrimination. We rejected \u201cthe sea change that would be effected were we to adopt the <em>Ledbetter </em>majority approach to wage discrimination claims under our LAD\u201d in light of our settled case law. <em>Alexander, supra, </em>204 <em>N.J. </em>at 234, 8 A.3d 198. We therefore allowed for a more expansive statute of limitations under the LAD for the filing of wage discrimination claims. <em>Ibid. </em>Yet, the majority in this case invites a \u201csea change\u201d that will disadvantage sexually harassed employees in the workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">If the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Title VII was not the gold standard in <em>Alexander, </em>then why here? First, the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>standard is not in keeping with our liberal construction of our LAD. <em>See Nini, supra, </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>at 108-09, 995 A.2d 1094 (noting that LAD \u201cshould be liberally construed\u201d because it \u201cis remedial social legislation\u201d). Second, the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>standard has received substantial criticism. One commentator has stated the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>standard creates a \u201crisk that internal programs will be merely \u2018symbolic responses\u2014responses designed to create a visible commitment to law, which may, but do not necessarily, reduce employment discrimination.\u2019\u201d Melissa Hart, <em>The Possibility of Avoiding Discrimination: Considering Compliance and Liability, </em>39 <em>Conn. L.Rev. </em>1623, 1646 (2007) (quoting Lauren B. Edelman, <em>Legal Ambiguity and Symbolic Structures: Organizational Mediation of Civil Rights Law, </em>97 <em>Am. J. Soc. </em>1531, 1542 (1992)). Another commentator has expressed concern that \u201cfirms may utilize compliance systems simply as window-dressing to reduce the probability of legal liability without addressing the underlying behavior.\u201d Timothy P. Glynn, <em>Taking Self-Regulation Seriously: High-Ranking Officer Sanctions for Work-Law Violations, </em>32 <em>Berkeley J. Emp. &amp; Lab. L. </em>279, 312 (2011); <em>see also </em>Anne Lawton, <em>Operating in an Empirical Vacuum: The Ellerth and Faragher Affirmative Defense, </em>13 <em>Colum. J. Gender &amp; L. </em>197, 199 (2004) (noting that United States Supreme Court\u2019s approach \u201cpaved the way for the lower federal courts to interpret the affirmative defense in ways that further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>undermine, rather than facilitate, the goal of deterring sexual harassment in the workplace\u201d); John H. Marks, <em>Smoke, Mirrors, and the Disappearance of \u201cVicarious\u201d Liability: The Emergence of a Dubious Summary-Judgment Safe Harbor for Employers Whose Supervisory Personnel Commit Hostile Environment Workplace Harassment, </em>38 <em>Hous. L.Rev. </em>1401, 1405 (2002) (stating that <em>post-Ellerth </em>courts are \u201cmanufacturing a dubious summary judgment safe harbor for employers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>standard, moreover, is not the optimal method for discouraging sexual harassment in the workplace. <em>See, e.g., </em>Susan Bisom-Rapp, <em>Bulletproofing the Workplace: Symbol and Substance in Employment Discrimination Law Practice, </em>26 <em>Fla. St. U.L.Rev. </em>959, 972 (1999) (\u201c[T]he implementation of symbolic policies and procedures in no way guarantees substantive change for members of the groups that EEO law is designed to protect. In fact, symbolic policies and procedures may provide unjustified optimism that an organization is governed fairly.\u201d); Joanna L. Grossman, <em>The Culture of Compliance: The Final Triumph of Form, over Substance in Sexual Harassment Law, </em>26 <em>Harv. Women\u2019s L.J. </em>3, 71 (2003) (\u201cResearch suggests that the affirmative defense rewards compliance without ensuring success.\u201d); Kimberly D. Krawiec, <em>Organizational Misconduct: Beyond the Principal-Agent Model, </em>32 <em>Fla. St. U.L.Rev. </em>571, 574 (2005) (\u201c[Sjome organizations may employ internal compliance structures primarily as a window-dressing mechanism that provides both market legitimacy and reduced organizational liability for agent misconduct.\u201d); Lawton, <em>supra, </em>13 <em>Colum,. J. Gender &amp; L. </em>at 198 (expressing concern that courts should not \u201creward employers for \u2018file cabinet compliance.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Clearly, <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>is not offering a better way than <em>Lehmann </em>for the victims of hostile work harassment, whether those victims are targeted because of their gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or nationality. If our civil jury charge on supervisory liability was so wrong because it gave victims of discrimination an unfair litigation advantage, one must wonder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>why it took our Court eighteen years to say so. Moreover, had the Legislature wanted to include an affirmative defense to supervisory liability in the wake of <em>Ellerth/Faragher, </em>it could have amended the LAD. But it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">In short, neither precedent, nor experience, nor logic requires us to adopt a standard that is inferior to our own standard in <em>Lehmann </em>for supervisory liability in LAD hostile work environment cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Here are Aguas\u2019s assertions, which we must accept as true for summary-judgment purposes. The highest-ranking officer on the third shift at the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility repeatedly sexually harassed Corrections Officer Ilda Aguas. On one occasion, the shift commander solicited Aguas to go with him to a motel; on another, he sat on her lap and blew his whistle while grinding his pelvis into her in the presence of two of Aguas\u2019s supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">In another incident, the shift commander pulled Aguas\u2019s hands behind her back up to her shoulder blades, bent her over a table with his genital area touching her buttocks, stating \u2018What are you going to do?\u201d In yet another incident, the shift commander danced around Aguas and blew his whistle as though she were a stripper. Two superior officers were present but did not intercede. Other unwanted encounters included the shift commander massaging Aguas\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Aguas reported those egregious episodes of sexual harassment to a supervising lieutenant numerous times, and his response was that she should handle the matter herself. The supervising lieutenant took the position that he was \u201cnot going to lose [his] job by getting involved in this.\u201d If Aguas\u2019s account is true, the State is liable under Lehmann\u2019s supervisory-liability standard, regardless of whether Aguas made a formal complaint pursuant to the Department of Correction\u2019s anti-discrimination policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Based on Aguas\u2019s account, one fair inference is that a climate of fear discouraged the reporting of sexual harassment against a high-ranking officer. Common sense tells us that when the supervisor is the sexual harasser and other superior officers look the other way, as alleged here, the antidiscrimination policy touted by the employer has failed. The additional hoops that the majority requires Aguas to jump through under the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>standard do not advance the goals of the LAD, which is to rid the workplace of discriminatory harassment. This case exemplifies, if the allegations are true, how supervisory harassment can beat down and belittle an employee, who may understandably believe that she has nowhere to turn but to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In the end, this is a case about statutory interpretation, and our mission is to construe the LAD consistent with the Legislature\u2019s salutary goal of eradicating sexual harassment in the workplace. By imposing vicarious liability on the employer for a supervisor\u2019s sexual harassment, the <em>Lehmann </em>Court gave effect to its understanding of the Legislature\u2019s intent in passing the LAD. If the majority\u2019s interpretation of the LAD is wrong, as I believe it is, the Legislature can still speak to the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\"><em>For reversal and </em>remandment\u2014Justices LaVECCHIA, PATTERSON, FERNANDEZ-VINA, SOLOMON and Judge CUFF (temporarily assigned)'\u20145.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\"><em>For </em>affirmance\u2014Chief Justice RABNER and Justice ALBIN\u2014 2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-9\"> <em>Lehmann </em>\u2019s basic assumption is that women are the most frequent victims of sexual harassment in the workplace. <em>See Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 615, 626 A.2d 445.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b572-6\"> Model Jury Charge (Civil) 8.49, which instructs the jury on supervisory sexual harassment, was approved by the Supreme Court Model Civil Jury Charge Committee in October 1997.
