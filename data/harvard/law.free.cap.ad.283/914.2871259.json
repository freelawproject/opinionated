Memorandum: The action of the warden in charging prisoner with the loss of so-called punishment and unearned time is tentative only (Correction Law, \u00a7 230, subd. 4) and does not become effective until such time as the prison board may determine the allowance or disallowance thereof. (Correction Law, \u00a7\u00a7 235, 236.) In this respect the prison board is vested with sole authority, and its determination, being a judicial function, is not subject to review if done according to law. (Correction Law, \u00a7 236; <em>People ex rel. 8carola </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>276 App. Div. 939; cf. <em>Matter of O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Parole, </em>270 App. Div. 93; and <em>Matter of Hines </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Parole, </em>293 N. V. 254.) All concur. (Appeal from an order denying the petition and dismissing the proceeding to compel respondents to credit petitioner with 468 days of \u201c good time \u201d claimed to have been wrongfully charged against him.) Present \u2014 McCurn, P. J., Vaughan, Kimball, Piper and Wheeler, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
