The fact that she made efforts thereafter to make him perform does not constitute acquiescence in the fraud. Thereafter, however, at the subsequent disclosure, she was for the first time convinced of his intention to violate his obligations; she then left him and brought this action. Defendant defaulted in pleading and appearance. On all the facts and circumstances disclosed, plaintiff did not with \u201c full knowledge of the facts \u201d condone defendant\u2019s fraud; and plaintiff should not be penalized for her attempt to preserve the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-14\">The order appealed from denying plaintiff\u2019s motion to disaffirm the Official Referee\u2019s report should be reversed, the motion granted and interlocutory judgment granted in plaintiff\u2019s favor. Findings and conclusions at variance herewith should be reversed and contrary findings made. Settle order.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b746-15\">Callahan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS4r\">(dissenting). I would hesitate to label the story told by plaintiff as frank and honest. To me it hardly measures up to the test of being probable. However, it was for the experienced Referee who saw the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>witnesses to decide questions of credibility. In any event, there was a clear admission of voluntary cohabitation after knowledge of the \u201cfraud.\u201d Accordingly, I dissent from the reversal of the order confirming the Referee\u2019s decision. The determination below should be reassuring to any one concerned with the mounting list of fantastic claims on which annulments are being sought and procured.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Dore, J. P., Breitel, Botein and Bergan, JJ., concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion; Callahan, J., dissents in opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Order reversed and interlocutory judgment granted in plaintiff\u2019s favor.
