Cunningham, appeals from a defendant\u2019s verdict in this personal injury action. The main issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>on appeal is whether the Superior Court <em>(Groff ', </em>J.) erred in finding that the jury was unanimous. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">In the underlying suit, the plaintiff claimed that he suffered a back injury when struck by a row of shopping carts being pushed by an employee of the defendant supermarket, Vista Foods. At trial, the defendant introduced evidence showing that the plaintiff had a long prior history of back trouble. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant, but upon polling of the jury, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">THE COURT: Juror No. 11, if you would stand up, please, do you find for the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afx\">JUROR NO. 11: What can I say, yes or no? ... If I say no, your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ady\">THE COURT: Well if you say no, we\u2019ll go back in and deliberate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aro\">JUROR NO. 11: Yes. No \u2014 yes, I go with the majority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">The trial judge then conducted several minutes of <em>voir dire </em>of the juror, outside of the presence of the other jurors. At the end of <em>voir dire, </em>the trial judge found that this juror\u2019s \u201cverdict for the defendant was her free and voluntary verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\"> A civil jury verdict in New Hampshire must be unanimous. <em>See Bunnell v. Lucas, </em>126 N.H. 663, 666, 495 A.2d 1282, 1283 (1985). This means that each juror must freely and voluntarily assent to reach a verdict. <em>Cf People v. Superior Court of Orange County, </em>434 P.2d 623, 625 (Cal. 1967). This is a finding of fact that the trial court must make when the issue is raised, and one which we will not disturb unless it is clearly erroneous. The finding should be made by the trial court, considering all of the circumstances, without giving dispositive effect to any single answer by the juror. Thus, where, as here, \u201ca juror\u2019s equivocal, ambiguous, inconsistent, or evasive answers leave doubt as to whether [s]he has assented to the verdict, but [her] answers are not such as to indicate involuntariness or coercion, it is generally held that a subsequent answer which indicates clear and unequivocal assent . . . will cure the defect.\u201d 75B Am. Jur. 2D, <em>Trial </em>\u00a7 1770, at 536 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">The record reveals that Juror No. 11 expressed some equivocation about her vote, but never retracted her vote in response to questioning by the court or either attorney. Juror No. 11 stated that prior to the supplemental jury instruction she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>inclined to vote for the plaintiff out of sympathy and had misunderstood the jury instructions so as to give the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt. After the instruction, she understood the burden of proof and concluded that the plaintiff had not met his burden. At the end of the <em>voir dire </em>the court again asked the juror for a final response:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">THE COURT: Before I let you go, you should feel no pressure on you or not. This is a difficult job for anybody to have to do and you\u2019re a citizen who is coming in to do your duty and we just need to know whether or not that is your verdict or not and that\u2019s what it amounts to. And you shouldn\u2019t feel that \u2014 any pressure at all one way or another. As you were instructed and as you swore, that you would consider all the evidence in the case and to the best of your ability render a verdict on the evidence in accordance with the law, and that\u2019s all I\u2019m asking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA_\">JUROR NO. 11: Fine, what response do you want; for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3y\">THE COURT: For or against, is that your verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_4\">JUROR NO. 11: Yes, for will be fine. You did a good job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABK\">THE COURT: For the defendant? For the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARU\">JUROR NO. 11: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">We hold that the trial court properly could have found that any prior equivocation by Juror No. 11 was overcome by her clear expressions of assent during the <em>voir dire.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">We have considered the plaintiff\u2019s other arguments and find them unpersuasive. <em>See Vogel v. Vogel, </em>137 N.H. 321, 322, 627 A.2d 595, 596 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b240-15\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
