(Paragon). They argue that the structure Paragon seeks to build will exceed the height limitation in the Town of Richmond\u2019s (town) Zoning Ordinance. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-16\">The plaintiffs are abutters to Paragon\u2019s site for the construction of a 90- to 100-foot high \u201ctower to support antennas\u201d for its proposed cable television receiving facility. Because the structure would involve a commercial use in a residential district, Paragon applied to the ZBA for a special exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The ZBA granted the special exception, and the plaintiffs appealed to the superior court. <em>See </em>RSA 677:4 (1986). The court remanded to the ZBA to determine whether the zoning ordinance\u2019s thirty-five-foot height limitation, which does not apply to \u201cchimneys or antennas,\u201d applied to the Paragon project. <em>See </em>TOWN of Richmond Zoning Ordinance, art. 3, \u00a7 309 (as amended through March 13, 1990). The ZBA determined that the structure was an \u201cantenna\u201d and, accordingly, was exempt from the zoning ordinance\u2019s height limitation. The superior court affirmed the ZBA\u2019s decision, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\"><em>Cohen v. Town of Henniker, </em>134 N.H. 425, 426, 593 A.2d 1145, 1146 (1991), governs our review. We will uphold the trial court\u2019s decision unless it is unsupported by the evidence or legally erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The issue before us is whether Paragon\u2019s proposed structure is an \u201cantenna\u201d within the terms of the zoning ordinance. The town and Paragon contend that the entire structure is an \u201cantenna\u201d and, therefore, that it falls within the exemption for \u201cchimneys and antennas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">The term \u201cantenna\u201d is not defined in the zoning ordinance. Consequently, \u201cthe appropriate meaning as defined in a current dictionary of the American language shall apply.\u201d TOWN OF Richmond Zoning Ordinance, art. 15, \u00a7 1501.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">\u201cAntenna\u201d is defined as \u201ca usu[ally] metallic device (as a rod, wire, or arrangement of wires) for radiating or receiving radio waves.\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 91 (unabridged ed. 1961). Although the town and Paragon argue that the entire structure is encompassed in the definition, common sense dictates that it is not.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">[M]ost telecommunications towers consist of a relatively slender metal structure ranging anywhere from about twenty-five feet to over one thousand feet in height. <em>The tower portion of the telecommunications facility is just that: a structure with no other function than to support or hold the electronic devices necessary for telecommunications. . . . </em>Affixed to a tower, then, will be one or more antennae [sic], which are responsible for the actual broadcasting and receiving of telecommunication signals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">T. Ragonetti, <em>A Towering Problem? Land Use Regulation of Commercial Broadcasting </em>Towers, 15 ZONING &amp; PLAN. L. REP. 9, 10 (1992) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel points out that the 2120-foot guyed Warszawa radio mast at Konstantynow, sixty miles northwest of the capital of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Poland, is the world\u2019s tallest-ever structure. N. McWHIRTER, The Guinness Book of Records 100 (P. Matthews ed. 1994). \u201cThe mast was so high that anyone falling off the top would reach terminal velocity and hence cease to be accelerating before hitting the ground.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Were we to accept the town and Paragon\u2019s proffered definition of \u201cantenna,\u201d this structure would not violate the height limitation. We cannot envision that such a result was contemplated by the town residents when they adopted the zoning ordinance. Rather, it is more likely that what was contemplated by the term \u201cantenna\u201d was the ordinary, pre-cable television receiving antenna, albeit with a short supporting mast, mounted and affixed to many residences.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The town and Paragon also contend that fire safety alone is the rationale for the height restriction and, because the structure does not pose a fire hazard, it should be exempt from the limitation. RSA 674:17 (1986), however, does not restrict zoning ordinances to be designed only for fire safety. Consequently, that the structure may not be a fire hazard does not exempt it from the height limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The trial court found that \u201cit is commonly understood that virtually all antennas of whatever size include a supporting mast or structure and that the entire structure is encompassed within the meaning of \u2018antenna.\u2019 \u201d Although we agree that an antenna must have a supporting mast, we disagree that the meaning of \u201cantenna\u201d in the exception to the town\u2019s height restriction encompassed a structure of this size. The trial court\u2019s determination, based upon our analysis, was legally erroneous. <em>See Cohen v. Town of Henniker, </em>134 N.H. at 426, 593 A.2d at 1146. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b51-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
