We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">On October 24, 1990, a flatbed trailer separated from the pickup truck towing it and collided with the plaintiffs\u2019 vehicle. Patrick J. Maimone, employed by the defendant as a maintenance mechanic, was the driver as well as the owner of both the truck and the trailer. One of his tasks was to hay the fields at the defendant\u2019s facilities in Hudson and Litchfield. Maimone provided most of the haying equipment, most of which he towed to the defendant\u2019s premises with his truck and trailer. The defendant did not compensate Maimone for the use of the equipment or the time spent transporting it, but did pay him his normal wages while haying the fields and permitted him to keep any hay he removed. Prior to the day of the accident, Maimone had completed haying the fields at the defendant\u2019s Litchfield facility, but had not removed his trailer or all of the farming equipment. After work on October 24, 1990, but before leaving the defendant\u2019s premises, Maimone hitched his trailer to his truck for use in transporting hay from his farm to the Agway store to sell that evening. He planned to return the trailer to remove the remaining farm machinery. The trailer separated from the truck during the drive from the defendant\u2019s Litchfield facility to Maimone\u2019s farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The plaintiffs sued the defendant under theories of <em>respondeat superior </em>and negligent supervision. They argued that Maimone was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident. Alternatively, they argued that while on the defendant\u2019s property and under the defendant\u2019s supervision and control, Maimone negligently attached his trailer and used inadequate safety chains in violation of the common law and RSA 266:63 (1993). The defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that no disputed issues of material fact existed and that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted because Maimone was not acting within the scope of his employment. The plaintiffs also moved for partial summary judgment on the ground that, as a matter of law, Maimone\u2019s actions were within the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The trial court ruled as a matter of law that Maimone acted outside the scope of his employment. Treating the defendant\u2019s motion as a motion to dismiss, the court concluded that \u201ceven taking the facts and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to them, the plaintiffs have failed to state a claim that would permit them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>to recover.\u201d The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ruling that even if \u201cthe plaintiffs stated valid causes of action based in respondeat superior and negligent supervision, no issues of material fact exist, and therefore the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment, premised upon a finding that Maimone acted within the scope of his employment, was denied. The plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">We begin by reviewing the trial court\u2019s order under the standard for motions to dismiss because the court treated the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment as such.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">On an appeal from an order granting a motion to dismiss, the only issue raised is whether the allegations are reasonably susceptible of a construction that would permit recovery. We will assume the truth of both the facts alleged in the plaintiffs pleadings and all reasonable inferences therefrom as construed most favorably to the plaintiff. If the facts as alleged would constitute a basis for legal relief, the motion to dismiss should be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-7\"><em>Collectramatic, Inc. v. Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp., </em>127 N.H. 318, 320, 499 A.2d 999, 1000 (1985) (quotation omitted). Applying this standard to the plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings, we hold that a motion to dismiss should not have been granted. If proven, the facts alleged in the plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings, together with the reasonable inferences derived therefrom, would constitute a basis for relief under the plaintiffs\u2019 <em>respondeat superior </em>and negligent supervision claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\"> Under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, </em>an employer may be held vicariously responsible for the tortious acts of an employee committed incidental to or during the scope of employment. <em>See Richard v. Company, </em>79 N.H. 380, 383-84, 109 A. 88, 91 (1920). Here, the plaintiff has alleged that the movement of Maimone\u2019s trailer for temporary personal use was understood to be part of the agreement between Maimone and the defendant regarding Maimone\u2019s provision of the farming equipment and removal of the hay, and therefore incidental to Maimone\u2019s employment. This allegation could lead to a finding that would support recovery based on the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>if found to be true by a jury. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\"> An employer may be directly liable for damages resulting from the negligent supervision of its employee\u2019s activities. <em>See Cutter v. Town of Farmington, </em>126 N.H. 836, 840, 498 A.2d 316, 320 (1985); Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 213 (1958). The employer\u2019s duty to exercise reasonable care to control its employee may extend to activities performed outside the scope of employment. RESTATEMENT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>(SECOND) of Torts \u00a7 317 (1965). The plaintiffs alleged that although Maimone was involved in several accidents involving vehicles and equipment while in the defendant\u2019s employ, his activities were not closely supervised, and his equipment and vehicles were not regularly inspected. This allegation and the reasonable inferences therefrom raise a jury issue as to whether the defendant negligently supervised Maimone. <em>See </em>RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF AGENCY \u00a7 213; RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF Torts \u00a7 317. We therefore hold that it was error to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. <em>See Collectramatic, </em>127 N.H at 320, 499 A.2d at 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We next review the trial court\u2019s ruling on the parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment, considering the affidavits and any other evidence, as well as all inferences properly drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. If there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, then summary judgment is properly entered. <em>See Gould v. George Brox, Inc., </em>137 N.H. 85, 88, 623 A.2d 1325, 1327 (1993). A review of the record, including the depositions, reveals evidence from which conflicting inferences could be drawn both as to whether Maimone was acting incidental to or within the scope of his employment when he moved his trailer for temporary personal use and whether the defendant was independently negligent in supervising Maimone and in inspecting his truck and his trailer. We conclude that neither party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on either the plaintiffs <em>respondeat superior </em>or negligent supervision claims. <em>See id. </em>We reverse the trial court\u2019s granting of the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b514-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
