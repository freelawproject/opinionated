Bragdon </em>and <em>Katharine Lord Klein </em>on the brief, and <em>Mr. Bragdon </em>orally), for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b83-16\"><em>Fernald, Taft, Falby &amp; Little, P.A., </em>of Peterborough <em>(Silas Little </em>on the brief and orally), for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b83-17\">Memorandum Opinion</p>\n<author id=\"b83-18\">BATCHELDER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao\">The plaintiffs, David and Sally Belluscio, appeal the decision of the Superior Court <em>(Brennan, </em>J.) upholding the defendant Town of Westmoreland Zoning Board of Adjustment\u2019s (ZBA) denial of their request to build a single-family residence on their seven-acre lot. They argue that the trial court erred in ruling that RSA 674:41 (1986 &amp; Supp. 1993) barred their request. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-19\">The plaintiffs sought a building permit from the town in 1990. When the application was denied, they appealed to the ZBA. Following several hearings, the ZBA determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>request was governed by RSA 674:41, which requires that \u201cno building shall be erected on any lot . . . unless the street <em>giving access to </em>the lot upon which such building is proposed to be placed\u201d is a class V or better highway. RSA 674:41, I (emphasis added). Because the plaintiffs\u2019 lot does not have frontage on Estes Road, a class V highway, but rather must be reached from Estes Road by virtue of a deeded right-of-way across an abutter\u2019s property, the ZBA denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\">The plaintiffs appealed to the superior court, <em>see </em>RSA 677:4 (1986), which ruled that the ZBA reasonably found that the plaintiffs \u201cdid not meet the standards for relief under the Statute.\u201d The plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><em>Cohen v. Town of Henniker, </em>134 N.H. 425, 426, 593 A.2d 1145, 1146 (1991), provides the review standard in cases such as this. The trial court\u2019s decision is upheld unless it is unsupported by the evidence or is legally erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">RSA 674:41, I, prohibits the construction of a building on a lot that does not have \u201caccess\u201d to a class V or better highway. The plaintiffs argue that their deeded right-of-way to Estes Road provides the required access. The town counters that the statute requires frontage on a class V or better highway, and because the plaintiffs\u2019 lot does not have frontage on Estes Road, the statutory mandate has not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\u201c[T]he words in the statute itself are the touchstone of the legislature\u2019s intention.\u201d <em>Greenhalge v. Town of Dunbarton, </em>122 N.H. 1038, 1040, 453 A.2d 1295, 1296 (1982). We first consider the statute\u2019s plain meaning. RSA 21:2 (1988); <em>Town of Gilsum v. Monadnock Reg. School District, </em>136 N.H. 32, 36, 611 A.2d 625, 626 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The word \u201caccess\u201d is defined as \u201ca landowner\u2019s legal right to pass from his land to a highway and to return without being obstructed.\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 11 (unabridged ed. 1961). The trial court found that the plaintiffs\u2019 1100-foot deeded right-of-way is \u201cgood and passable.\u201d Consequently, it provides proper \u201caccess\u201d under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">We dismiss the town\u2019s contention that \u201caccess\u201d is synonymous with \u201cfrontage.\u201d See <em>Poulos v. Planning Bd. of Braintree, </em>597 N.E.2d 417, 419 (Mass. 1992); <em>Turner v. Galgi, </em>176 N.Y.S.2d 680, 682 (App. Div. 1958). Had the legislature intended to require frontage on a cl\u00e1ss V or better highway, it could have drafted the statute to include that condition. We will not insert into a statute words that the legislature has not chosen to include. <em>Appeal of Pritchard, </em>137 N.H. 291, 293, 627 A.2d 102,103 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>The trial court\u2019s ruling that the plaintiffs had failed to meet the requirements of RSA 674:41 was legally erroneous. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b85-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
