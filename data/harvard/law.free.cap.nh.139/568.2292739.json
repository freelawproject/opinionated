Prior to trial, the Superior Court <em>(Mohl, </em>J.) granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges. The State appeals only the dismissal of the driving under the influence charge. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">The facts alleged by the State are uncontroverted. A police officer approached a vehicle in a parking lot. The vehicle\u2019s engine was idling, and the defendant was asleep in the driver\u2019s seat. The officer woke the defendant, determined that he was intoxicated and arrested him for driving while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-15\">The superior court relied upon <em>State v. O\u2019Malley, </em>120 N.H. 507, 416 A.2d 1387 (1980), in dismissing the charges. The State argues that <em>O\u2019Malley </em>is not controlling, as the relevant statutory language has changed. In matters of statutory interpretation, \u201cthis court is the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>134 N.H. 570, 575, 595 A.2d 498, 502 (1991) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-16\">In <em>O\u2019Malley, </em>the defendant, who was found sleeping at the wheel of a running automobile, was convicted of violating former RSA 262-A:62 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>(1977), which prohibited \u201coperating\u201d a motor vehicle, while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and former RSA 262:27-b (1977), which prohibited \u201coperating\u201d a motor vehicle after a license had been revoked. <em>O\u2019Malley, </em>120 N.H. at 508, 416 A.2d at 1388. We overturned those convictions, noting that \u201c[t]his court is reluctant to conclude that a defendant has <em>operated </em>a vehicle when, in fact, the officer has not seen the <em>operator </em>behind the wheel moving the car.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509, 416 A.2d at 1388 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Since our decision in <em>O\u2019Malley, </em>however, the legislature has recodified the motor vehicle statutes, replacing \u201coperate\u201d with \u201cdrive.\u201d Laws 1981, 146.T. The defendant in the instant case was charged with violating RSA 265:82. The <em>actus reus </em>contemplated in RSA 265:82 is \u201cdiiv[ing]\u201d a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. The legislature has defined \u201cdrive\u201d thus: \u201cto operate <em>or </em>be in actual physical control\u201d of a motor vehicle. RSA 259:24 (1993) (emphasis added). Therefore, the question before us is whether, under the agreed facts and the reasonable inferences therefrom, a rational trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was in actual physical control of the vehicle. <em>Cf. O\u2019Malley, </em>120 N.H. at 509,416 A.2d at 1388.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The defendant\u2019s contention that we have previously equated \u201cdrive\u201d with \u201coperate\u201d is incorrect. A fair reading of our memorandum opinion in <em>State v. Martel, </em>124 N.H. 544, 474 A.2d 998 (1984), relied on by the defendant, shows that the question in that case was whether \u201cdrive\u201d encompasses \u201coperate\u201d: \u201cIn essence, the defendant contends that <em>operating </em>a motor vehicle (the language of the former statute) is different from <em>driving </em>a motor vehicle (the language of the [revised] statute).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545,474 A.2d at 999. Because part of the statutory definition of \u201cdrive\u201d is \u201cto operate,\u201d <em>see </em>RSA 259:24, we concluded that the change in wording did not support the defendant\u2019s position. <em>Martel, </em>124 N.H. at 545, 474 A.2d at 999. The \u201cactual physical control\u201d language of RSA 259:24 was not at issue in that case and was not considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">In interpreting the meaning of statutory provisions, \u201cwe presume that the legislature does not enact unnecessary and duplicative provisions.\u201d <em>State v. Powell, </em>132 N.H. 562, 568, 567 A.2d 568, 572 (1989) (quotation omitted). \u201c[A]ctual physical control,\u201d therefore, is presumed to be something distinct from operation. <em>See State v. Osgood, </em>135 N.H. 436, 438, 605 A.2d 1071, 1072 (1992). To determine the meaning of \u201cactual physical control,\u201d we consider the plain meaning of those words according to their common and approved usage. <em>Johnson, </em>134 N.H. at 575\u201476, 595 A.2d at 502. In this statutory phrase, \u201cactual\u201d and \u201cphysical\u201d modify \u201ccontrol,\u201d which is defined in WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 496 (unabridged ed. 1961) as \u201cpower or authority to guide or manage.\u201d The plain meaning of \u201ccontrol,\u201d then, does not require guidance in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>of the motor vehicle; the capacity to guide the vehicle establishes control. \u201cPhysical\u201d denotes \u201cof or relating to the body . . . often opposed to <em>mental\u201d Id. </em>at 1706. The definition of \u201cactual\u201d is \u201cexisting in fact or reality\u201d or \u201cin existence or taking place at the time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\"> To have \u201cactual physical control\u201d of a motor vehicle, one must have the capacity bodily to guide or exercise dominion over the vehicle <em>at the present time. </em>A person who is soundly asleep cannot have such a capacity. <em>See Garcia v. Schwendiman, </em>645 P.2d 651, 654 &amp; n.3 (Utah 1982). We have held, however, that \u201c[c]ircumstantial evidence which excludes any other rational conclusion is sufficient. . . to establish beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d the <em>actus reus </em>set out in a motor vehicle statute. <em>O\u2019Malley, </em>120 N.H. at 509, 416 A.2d at 1388.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In <em>O\u2019Malley, </em>the defendant\u2019s uncontroverted testimony, that while awaiting a ride from a friend, he had started the friend\u2019s car and then fallen asleep, overcame any such circumstantial evidence establishing <em>operation. Id. </em>By contrast, if circumstantial evidence were to prove that defendant Willard started his car before falling asleep, he would have been in <em>actual physical control </em>of it while awake and in the driver\u2019s seat. <em>See Atkinson v. State, </em>627 A.2d 1019, 1028 (Md. 1993) (\u201cIndeed, once an individual has started the vehicle, he or she has come as close as possible to actually [operating it] without doing so and will generally be in \u2018actual physical control\u2019 of the vehicle.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\"> We agree with the Maryland Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of the legislative intent underlying the phrase \u201cactual physical control\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">When the occupant is totally passive, has not in any way attempted to actively control the vehicle, and there is no reason to believe that the inebriated person is imminently going to control the vehicle in his or her condition, we do not believe that the legislature intended for criminal sanctions to apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 1027. The circumstantial evidence of actual physical control, however, is for the jury to weigh. Under the facts alleged and the reasonable inferences therefrom, a rational trier of fact could find that the defendant was in actual physical control of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b599-11\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
