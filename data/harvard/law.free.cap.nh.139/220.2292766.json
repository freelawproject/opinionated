A New Hampshire Department of Labor hearing officer answered in the affirmative, finding the drivers to be employees of City Cab, not independent contractors. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:5 (Supp. 1993). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-17\">We are treating City Cab\u2019s appeal as a petition for writ of certiorari. <em>See Petition of Donovan d/b/a Donovan Group Home, </em>137 N.H. 78, 80, 623 A.2d 1322, 1324 (1993). Accordingly, we overturn the hearing officer\u2019s decision only if it is \u201cunreasonable or unlawful.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>\u201c[W]e determine the existence of an employee-employer relationship for the purposes of workers\u2019 compensation through reference to the factors set forth in the New Hampshire Department of Labor regulations.\u201d <em>Appeal of Longchamps Electric, </em>137 N.H. 731, 733, 634 A.2d 994, 996 (1993). Labor Rule 101.05 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">\u201cEmployee-employer relationship\u201d shall be defined using the following criteria:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">(a) The employee is permitted, suffered, required or directed by the employer in consideration of direct or indirect gain or profit to engage in the employment of the employer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">(b) The employer provides the employee with instructions, training or orientation as to when, where and how the work is to be performed to the employer[\u2019]s specifications;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">(c) The employer supervises the work of the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">(d) The employee may submit oral or written reports to the employer regarding work activities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-11\">(e) The work performed by the employe[e] is part of the regular business of the employer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-12\">(f) The employer supplies the employee with the instrumentalities, tools and the place of work without a significant investment by the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-13\">(g) The employer pays the employee by the hour, week, month, piece or commission and may pay business and travel expenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-14\">(h) The employee is prevented from hiring, supervising and paying assistants to complete a specific goal in the manner of a subcontractor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-15\">(i) The employer can discharge the employee with a right to no more than wages already earned or the employee can end the relationship without incurring any liability as in a breach of contract;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-16\">(j) The employee[s] shall not present themselves as being a business entity; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-17\">(k) Any other factor which contributes to the nature of the relationship that the parties believe they are creating.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-18\">N.H. Admin. Rules, Lab 101.05 (1991); <em>see also </em>RSA 281-A:2, VI, VIII (Supp. 1993). This test is essentially the same as the one found in expired Labor Rule 104.02 and the RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF AGENCY \u00a7 220, at 485-86 (1958). <em>See LaVallie v. Simplex Wire &amp; Cable Co., </em>135 N.H. 692, 695-96, 609 A.2d 1216, 1218 (1992). Under this standard, the determination of whether an employee-employer relationship exists depends on the facts of the case. <em>See Merchants Ins. Group v. Warchol, </em>132 N.H. 23, 27, 560 A.2d 1162, 1165 (1989); <em>Burnham v. Downing, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>125 N.H. 293, 296, 480 A.2d 128, 130 (1984). Because the hearing officer\u2019s fact findings are supported by the record, we ask only whether her application of the rule to these facts is unlawful or unreasonable. <em>See Petition of Donovan, </em>137 N.H. at 80, 623 A.2d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The hearing officer\u2019s decision states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">During [the] hearing it was pointed out that City Cab ... is in the business of leasing cars to drivers. The drivers are able to keep whatever they earn over the course of their lease period. The company provides a dispatch service which the drivers may use or choose to ignore. There is no control over the drivers in regard to dress code, work activities, or any other area of their work. It was pointed out that the company has one driver [who] owns [her] own taxi for which [she] only leasefs] the company\u2019s dispatch service and that the difference between the drivers [who] lease cabs and those who own their cabs is \u201cthe financial ability to bankroll a cab.\u201d A written lease agreement between the company and the driver was submitted. In regard to new drivers, it was stated that an experienced driver would take them out on a voluntary basis as they were not forced to give any training. No written, oral or income reports are required by the company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">... A review of Section 14-209 of Article IX of the Manchester City Ordinances shows that it is required for any person, or other entity, to secure a business license in order to operate a taxi cab in the City of Manchester, and to meet other requirements of the ordinance. It would appear that to . truly be independent contractors, the drivers are required to have a business license, their own dispatch service not a centralized dispatch service, as well as a taxi cab driver[\u2019]s license as required by Section 14-220, in order to present themselves as a business entity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">These findings adequately support the hearing officer\u2019s decision. Although City Cab \u201cis in the business of leasing cars to drivers,\u201d it is also in the business of taking calls from customers for taxi service and dispatching drivers to these customers. There is, consequently, a continuous, essential connection between City Cab\u2019s work and that of the drivers, <em>see Timberlake v. Frigon &amp; Frigon, </em>438 A.2d 1294, 1297-98 (Me. 1982), making the drivers\u2019 labor a critical \u201cpart of the regular business of the employer.\u201d N.H. Admin. Rules, Lab 101.05(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Moreover, as the hearing officer pointed out, the drivers do \u201cnot present themselves as being a business entity.\u201d N.H. ADMIN. RULES, Lab 101.05(j). For example, they lack the proper business licenses for running a taxicab enterprise and obtain customers through City Cab\u2019s dispatch service. As City Cab admits, the taxicabs bear its \u201cTown &amp; Country Taxi\u201d logo. A customer would have no reason to suspect that a driver was a business entity distinct from City Cab.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\">City Cab argues that certain facts found by the hearing officer, as well as facts appearing in the record, could support a decision in its favor under some of the other criteria listed in Labor Rule 101.05. The hearing officer\u2019s determination to afford more weight to the criteria discussed above, however, is neither unlawful nor unreasonable. <em>See Petition of Donovan, </em>137 N.H. at 80, 623 A.2d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b251-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
