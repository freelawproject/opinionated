The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in its answer to a jury question. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-16\">At the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s trial, the trial court gave the jury the usual instructions including the <em>Wentworth </em>instruction on reasonable doubt and burden of proof. <em>See State v. Wentworth, </em>118 N.H. 832, 838-39, 395 A.2d 858, 862-63 (1978). The jury deliberated for approximately two hours that day but was unable to reach a verdict. The jury returned the next day to continue deliberations and after ten minutes submitted to the court the following question: \u201cWhat should you do if you feel the defendant is guilty, but do not believe the State adequately proved it?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The trial court proposed the following answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">The Court is not clear in its mind about your use of the phrase \u201cadequately proved it.\u201d That being the case, the Court has attached the portion of its instruction that defines the State\u2019s burden of proof in criminal cases [the <em>Wentworth </em>instruction]. After review of the attached instruction, if you have any further questions, please advise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The defendant objected and offered the following answer: \u201cIf you have a reasonable doubt as to whether the State has proved any one or more of the elements of the crime charged, you must find the defendant not guilty.\u201d The court rejected the defendant\u2019s proposed answer but granted the defendant\u2019s request to redact all comments, including those regarding the court\u2019s confusion as to the phrase \u201cadequately proved it,\u201d and answer the question solely with the <em>Wentworth </em>instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The court gave the following written answer to the jury\u2019s question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">Under our constitutions, all defendants in criminal cases are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The burden of proving guilt is entirely on the State. The defendant does not have to prove his innocence. The defendant enters this courtroom as an innocent person, and you must consider him to be an innocent person until the State convinces you beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty of every element of the alleged offense. <em>If, after all the evidence and arguments, you have a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s having committed any one or more of the elements of the offense, then you must find him not guilty.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-10\">A \u201creasonable doubt\u201d is just what the words imply. The use of the word \u201creasonable\u201d means simply that the doubt must be reasonable rather than unreasonable; it must be a doubt based on reason. It is not a frivolous or fanciful doubt, nor is it one that can easily be explained away. Rather, it is such a doubt based upon reason as remains after consideration of all of the evidence that the State has offered against it. The test you must use is this: <em>If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether the State has proved any one or more of the elements of the crime charged, you must find the defendant not guilty. </em>However, if you find that the State has proved all of the elements of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt, you should find the defendant guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The response to a jury question is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. McLellen, </em>139 N.H. 132, 137, 649 A.2d. 843, 846 (1994). \u201cA claim that the trial court erroneously instructed or refused to instruct the jury, or refused to answer a jury question in language requested by the defendant, must be evaluated in the context of the entire charge and all of the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Dedrick, </em>135 N.H. 502, 505, 607 A.2d 127, 129 (1992). A court is not required to use the specific language the defendant requests. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen a jury\u2019s question is susceptible of several interpretations, the court may engage in further dialogue to ascertain its specific meaning . . . [or] refer the jury to the complete and adequate instructions previously given.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">As the trial court made clear, the jury\u2019s question was susceptible of two different interpretations: that the jury was confused on reasonable doubt or that the jury was confused as to what they should do if they found that the State had not met its burden of proof. Within its discretion, the trial court chose to give the jury the instruction that would answer sufficiently both questions. <em>See id. </em>Referring the jury to the previously given instruction was particularly appropriate in this case given our advice in <em>Wentworth </em>to avoid straying from the approved definition of reasonable doubt set forth in that opinion, <em>Wentworth, </em>118 N.H. at 839, 395 A.2d at 863, and our recent reiteration of the importance of using the language in <em>Wentworth </em>\u201cin order to avoid needless litigation,\u201d <em>State v. Bonacorsi, </em>139 N.H. 28, 30-31, 648 A.2d 469, 470 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The <em>Wentworth </em>instruction answered both possible interpretations of the jury question. It answered the question about the reasonable doubt standard with the language urged by this court, and responded to the defendant\u2019s concerns with firm instructions to acquit if the State has not met its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In fact, language strikingly similar to the answer requested by the defendant appears twice in the instruction. The trial court properly answered the jury\u2019s question.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b434-8\">BATCHELDER, J., dissented; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b434-9\">BATCHELDER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1x\">dissenting: It is difficult for me to escape the forthrightness and simplicity of the jury\u2019s question \u2014 the statement was made in the question that the jury entertained a reasonable doubt as to some element or elements of the offense. The jury should have been instructed to return a verdict of not guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
