Walsh, appeals the Superior Court <em>(Morrill, </em>J.) dismissal of her petition to impose a constructive trust over funds from certain bank accounts that were once held jointly by the defendant, Marjorie I. Young, and Andrew Young, who is deceased. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-17\">The plaintiff is the daughter of Andrew Young and Marian Young, his first wife. The plaintiff is also the executrix of her father\u2019s estate. The defendant was the second wife, and is the widow, of Andrew Young. Prior to the defendant\u2019s marriage to Young, they executed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>antenuptial agreement. The agreement, substantially identical to the form antenuptial agreements contained in 3A C. DOUGLAS &amp; C. Douglas, New Hampshire Practice, Family Law Appendix III, at 395-98 (2d ed. 1992) and 7 C. DEGRANDPRE, New HAMPSHIRE Practice, Wills, Trusts and Gifts Appendix, at 537-39 (2d ed. 1992), contains the following two provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">3. <em>Property of Andrew Young. </em>Andrew Young shall at all times have, hold, use and invest in his own name and for his sole use and benefit, all the property, real and personal, which he now has or may hereafter acquire, . . . the same to be at all times under his sole and separate control, with full right to part with the same by sale, gift, devise or in any other manner during his lifetime, and by will or by intestacy or otherwise at his death, and all such rights shall be as full and complete in all respects as though no marriage existed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">4. <em>Release of Property Rights. </em>A. The parties hereby release, convey and quitclaim to the other any and all interest either may acquire in and to the property now in the possession of, or that may hereafter be acquired by the other, and each hereby renounces and releases to the other forever all claims in law and equity each may have against the other, including claims for curtesy, dower, homestead, survivorship, inheritance, statutory distributive share, taking against the will, or otherwise acquired by virtue of a marriage between them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-7\"><em>Cf. </em>3 C. Douglas, New Hampshire Practice, Family Law Appendix III, at 553-58 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Before his death, Andrew Young transferred the balances of several bank accounts in his name alone into joint accounts with the defendant, with a right of survivorship. When he died, the defendant closed these joint accounts and transferred the funds into an <em>inter vivos </em>revocable trust naming herself as the beneficiary. The plaintiff was the primary devisee under Andrew Young\u2019s will; the only other devisee was the defendant, who received a life estate in the residence that Young and the defendant shared.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">The plaintiff filed a petition for constructive trust in the superior court alleging that the defendant had wrongfully retained monies which rightfully should have passed through Andrew Young\u2019s estate. Both the plaintiff and defendant moved for summary judgment. The Superior Court <em>(Fauver, </em>J.) denied both motions, finding that a genuine issue of material fact remained; namely, whether the word \u201csurvivorship\u201d in paragraph 4A of the agreement was intended to include the right of survivorship that arises upon the death of one owner in a joint tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>After a hearing on the merits, the trial court found that the use of the word \u201csurvivorship\u201d in the antenuptial agreement was not ambiguous, but considered extrinsic evidence to determine the parties\u2019 intent. The trial court concluded that the antenuptial agreement was not intended to disclaim or waive the defendant\u2019s statutory right of survivorship in the joint accounts, and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s petition for imposition of a constructive trust over the proceeds. The plaintiff appeals, arguing that the contract term was not ambiguous and that the defendant had effectively disclaimed her rights of survivorship by signing the antenuptial agreement. The defendant filed a cross-appeal, asserting that the superior court erred when it denied her motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">In order to support a claim for a constructive trust, the plaintiff must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that such action is warranted. <em>Clooney v. Clooney, </em>118 N.H. 754, 758, 394 A.2d 313, 316 (1978). She must prove that the defendant possesses the property in question, that there was a confidential relationship between the defendant and Young, and that the defendant would be unjustly enriched were she allowed to retain the property. <em>See Cornwell v. Cornwell, </em>116 N.H. 205, 208-09, 356 A.2d 683, 686 (1976); <em>Kachanian v. Kachanian, </em>100 N.H. 135, 137, 121 A.2d 566, 568 (1956). Because the superior court ruled that the defendant did not waive her right of survivorship in the joint accounts by signing the antenuptial agreement, no finding of unjust enrichment was warranted. Accordingly, our analysis on appeal turns on an interpretation of the antenuptial agreement itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">We construe antenuptial agreements in the same way that we construe other contracts, \u201cand accordingly, the proper interpretation of an antenuptial agreement is one that speaks to the intention of the parties at the time they enter the contract.\u201d <em>MacFarlane v. Rich (MacFarlane), </em>132 N.H. 608, 612, 567 A.2d 585, 588 (1989). We determine the intent of the parties \u201cfrom the entire instrument, together with its general scope and purpose, the language used, the conditions and circumstances surrounding the parties at the time the agreement was made, . . . [and] the legal rights of the parties, as they existed before, and would have existed after the marriage.\u201d 41 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Husband and Wife </em>\u00a7 288, at 237 (1968); <em>see Gamble v. University of New Hampshire, </em>136 N.H. 9, 13, 610 A.2d 357, 360 (1992). \u201c[A]bsent fraud, duress, mutual mistake, or ambiguity, we must restrict our search for the parties\u2019 intent to the words of the contract.\u201d <em>Parkhurst v. Gibson (Parkhurst), </em>133 N.H. 57, 62, 573 A.2d 454, 457 (1990). \u201c[T]he meaning of a contract is ultimately a matter of law for this court to decide,\u201d including the determination whether a contract term is ambiguous. <em>Restaurant Operators, Inc. v. Jenney, </em>128 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>N.H. 708, 710, 519 A.2d 256, 258 (1986); <em>see Holden Eng\u2019g and Surveying v. Pembroke Rd. Realty Trust, </em>137 N.H. 393, 395, 628 A.2d 260, 262 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Paragraph 4A of the agreement, titled \u201cRelease of Property Rights,\u201d is comprised of a single, eighty-three-word sentence. It states that each party to the agreement relinquishes all claims against each other, <em>\u201cincluding claims for </em>curtesy, dower, homestead, <em>survivorship, </em>inheritance, statutory distributive share, taking against the will, <em>or otherwise acquired by virtue of a marriage between them.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The plaintiff asserts that the claims listed in the subordinate clause beginning with \u201cincluding claims\u201d were not intended to constitute an exclusive list. The defendant contends that the \u201cotherwise acquired\u201d language at the end of the sentence serves to limit the types of claims that the parties disclaim to those that arise \u201cby virtue of marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\"> Looking to the entire document for guidance, <em>see Parkhurst, </em>133 N.H. at 62, 573 A.2d at 458, we note that in paragraph three of the agreement, Andrew Young reserved a \u201cfull right to part\u201d with his individual property \u201cby sale, <em>gift, </em>devise or <em>in any other manner during his lifetime, </em>and by will or by intestacy or <em>otherwise at his death.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Pursuant to this provision, Young devised a life estate in the couple\u2019s home to the defendant and transferred to her in her name alone the balance of at least one bank account without offending the antenuptial agreement. This is consistent with decisions in other jurisdictions construing similar provisions: in general, when a spouse, after signing an antenuptial agreement, executes a will or takes some other action that confers more benefits upon the other spouse than is otherwise provided for in the agreement, \u201cthe inference is great that [the spouse] intended these benefits to be above and beyond that which is given by the agreement.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Klein, </em>239 A.2d 464, 468 (Pa. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Viewing the document as a whole, we conclude that the parties to the antenuptial agreement intended the waivers encompassed in paragraph 4A to affect only those rights that arose by virtue of the marriage between them. <em>Cf. Parkhurst, </em>133 N.H. at 62, 573 A.2d at 458 (finding a clause in an antenuptial agreement waiving specific rights and \u201call other marital rights\u201d to be not ambiguous, but a broad and general waiver of rights that arise by virtue of the marital relationship). Absent such a conclusion, their retained rights to dispose of their property \u201cby sale, gift, devise or in any other manner during [their] lifetime[s], and by will or by intestacy or otherwise at [their] death[s],\u201d would be severely diminished. Specific provisions in contracts \u201cshould be so interpreted as not to be in conflict with what clearly appears to be the dominant purpose of the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>573 A.2d at 458 (quotations omitted). We agree with the superior court\u2019s finding that the purpose of the antenuptial agreement was \u201cto permit either party to dispose of his or her property free of the otherwise lawful claims which the other would have as <em>his or her spouse.\u201d </em>The retained rights to transfer property, to each other or to others, is fully consistent with this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Survivorship rights in a joint bank account do not arise by virtue of a relationship between the joint owners; rather, they are acquired by virtue of an agreement or contract between the owners and the banking institution. <em>See </em>RSA 384:28 (1983). When he transferred the balances of the bank accounts into joint accounts with the defendant with a right of survivorship, Young \u201cdisposed\u201d of those balances, as he was authorized to do in the agreement, so that the balances became the defendant\u2019s if she survived him. <em>See id.; In re Wszolek Estate, </em>112 N.H. 310, 314, 295 A.2d 444, 446 (1972) (RSA 384:28 \u201cestablishes property rights in the survivor authorizing the payment of the balance to him without a showing of a donative intent on the part of the party furnishing the funds\u201d); DEGRANDPRE, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 33.09, at 378 (transfer into a joint account with right of survivorship \u201cresults in a valid gift to the survivor\u201d). She did not waive her full right of ownership in the accounts when she signed the antenuptial agreement. <em>Cf. Boucher v. Johnson, </em>117 N.H. 343, 346, 373 A.2d 349, 351 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The trial court erred in considering extrinsic evidence to reach the same result we reach today. <em>Parkhurst, </em>133 N.H. at 62, 573 A.2d at 457. However, \u201c[w]hen a trial court reaches the correct result, but on mistaken grounds, [we] will sustain the decision if there are valid alternative grounds to support it.\u201d <em>Quinlan v. City of Dover, </em>136 N.H. 226, 230, 614 A.2d 1057, 1059 (1992). Because the defendant was the sole owner of the bank accounts at the time of Young\u2019s death, and because she did not waive her rights to such ownership by signing the antenuptial agreement, there is no basis for the imposition of a constructive trust. In light of this holding, we need not decide the issues raised in the defendant\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b725-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
