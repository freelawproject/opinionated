On appeal he argues: (1) two of the three informations charged the same offense, requiring dismissal of one; (2) the informations should have been dismissed because the relevant statutory provisions are vague; (3) a prior decision of this court should have been admitted to rebut the State\u2019s introduction of prior bad acts evidence; and (4) his sentences should be vacated due to the inclusion of improper material in the presentence report. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-16\">In June 1992, Lenard Birke was renovating an old house and barn on his property in Tilton. Although he originally contracted with another company for removal and disposal of the demolition debris, he switched to a disposal site owned by Ronald Martin when Martin, who was working on the renovation project, told Birke that he could give him a better price. Martin\u2019s salvage yard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>located in Alton, did not have a permit, as required by RSA chapter 149-M, for the disposal or processing of solid waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The defendant operates R &amp; R Leasing, owned by his wife. R &amp; R Leasing leases and transports dumpster-like containers called \u201croll-off boxes.\u201d The boxes are transported on a special \u201croll-off\u2019 truck owned by R &amp; R Leasing. George Rowell was employed by R &amp; R Leasing to deliver empty roll-off boxes to rental sites, pick them up when full, and deposit the contents at disposal sites. The defendant told Rowell to take one of the boxes to Ronald Martin\u2019s garage and to get instructions from Martin as to his delivery site in Tilton. The destination was Lenard Birke\u2019s renovation property, and Rowell delivered an empty box there. Later, the defendant told Rowell that the box was full and instructed him to pick it up and take it to Martin\u2019s salvage yard. He also instructed him on how to gain access to the yard in order to dump the load. Rowell did as instructed, dumped the contents of the roll-off box on the ground, and returned with the empty box to the defendant\u2019s property in Bradford. The load contained items such as wood, paper, shingles and metal; Rowell apprised the defendant of the contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Several weeks later the defendant told Rowell that the roll-off box at the Birke renovation site was again full and instructed him to return to the site, remove the box, and dump it at Martin\u2019s yard. Rowell went to the site and retrieved the box, which was filled with material consistent with the first load, and drove to Martin\u2019s yard. He was unable to enter the yard to dump the load, however, because a backhoe obstructed the entrance. He then drove the roll-off truck to the defendant\u2019s home, because it was closer than Bradford, and left the full roll-off box on the defendant\u2019s property. Rowell told the defendant of his inability to dump the load, and the defendant replied that he would have Martin leave the key in the backhoe and that Rowell should return to dump the load at Martin\u2019s yard. Rowell did return to Martin\u2019s yard with the load, but he was unable to find the backhoe key. An Alton police officer arrived and noticed wood protruding from under the tarp covering the load on the truck. On further examination of the load, the officer observed trash, fixtures, wood, tile, and other demolition debris. Officials from the waste management division of the State Department of Environmental Services (DES) were contacted and examined the contents on the truck and the load Rowell had previously dumped. They determined that the material consisted of construction and demolition debris, defined as solid waste under RSA 149-M: 1, XVII-a and XIX (1990 &amp; Supp. 1993). Disposal of solid waste, pursuant to RSA 149-M: 1, V, includes the placement of solid waste onto the ground. Previously, the waste management <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>division had issued an administrative order against the defendant, charging him with disposal of demolition <em>debris </em>at an unpermitted facility in Bradford and ordering him to cease and desist. When he failed to comply, a civil enforcement action was brought against him. In 1989, the Merrimack County Superior Court issued an order permanently enjoining the defendant from operating the solid waste facility in Bradford.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The two loads from the Birke property spawned three misdemeanor informations against the defendant. The first information, concerning the first load, charged the defendant as an accomplice to unpermitted disposal of solid waste. The second information, concerning the second load, charged the defendant as an accomplice to unpermitted transport of solid waste in that he \u201csolicited George Rowell to transport solid waste\u201d to Martin\u2019s yard. The third information, also concerning the second load, charged the defendant as an accomplice to attempting to dispose of solid waste in that he \u201csolicited George Rowell to transport and dispose of solid waste\u201d at Martin\u2019s yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">We turn first to the defendant\u2019s argument that the second information should have been dismissed as it charged the same offense as that comprising the third information. Although on appeal he argues that this violates his protections against double jeopardy, he made no constitutional challenge in the trial court. Rather, his argument below was that the transportation and attempted disposal of the second load was one continuous transaction involving one load of waste, constituting one offense. Because his double jeopardy claim was not raised below, we do not consider it, <em>see State v. Smart, </em>136 N.H. 639, 661, 622 A.2d 1197, 1212, <em>cert. denied, </em>114 S. Ct. 309 (1993), but address the issue as raising a common law claim of merger. <em>See </em>21 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 21 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Although the same load of debris was the subject of both informations, the focus of the solid waste management statute is not upon units of waste. Rather, the statute makes unlawful specified <em>activity </em>with respect to that waste; namely, \u201cto transport [it] to, or to dispose of [it] at, any facility other than an approved facility.\u201d RSA 149-M:10, I-a (Supp. 1993). The legislature thus plainly intended that a single transaction could give rise to multiple, distinct offenses, <em>cf. State v. Paris, </em>137 N.H. 322, 335, 627 A.2d 582, 590 (1993), and the evidence here supported guilty verdicts on both. <em>See </em>21 Am. JUR. 2d <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 21 (doctrine of merger of offenses applies only where identical criminal act constitutes both offenses, not where offenses are separate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>distinct). The trial court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss the second information.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Next the defendant argues that all three informations should have been dismissed because the material transported, while unpermitted \u201csolid waste\u201d under RSA 149-M:1, was also permitted \u201cjunk\u201d under RSA 236:91, II (1993), and that the statutes read together are vague. He argues that the purported similarity between \u201cjunk\u201d and \u201csolid waste\u201d was \u201cperplexing\u201d to him when dealing with the Birke demolition debris. Although the defendant moved to dismiss below, he did so on the ground of insufficient evidence, not on the ground of vagueness that he asserts in this court. The argument is therefore not properly before us. <em>See State v. Demand, </em>136 N.H. 233, 234, 614 A.2d 1342, 1343 (1992). To the extent that the argument he presents here embraces a sufficiency claim, it too fails: The evidence showed that what was hauled away from the Birke renovation site to Martin\u2019s yard was demolition debris, defined by statute to be solid waste, and that the defendant, having previously been cited civilly by the State Bureau of Solid Waste Management for disposal of demolition debris, knew it was solid waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow him to introduce evidence of a 1978 decision of this court, <em>New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission v. Naughton, </em>118 N.H. 750, 394 A.2d 311 (1978), and underlying materials that, according to the defendant, show that we had previously held to be lawful certain of his acts that were consistent with those charged in the instant informations. According to the defendant, this evidence was critical to rebutting the State\u2019s evidence of the 1983 administrative order and the 1989 court order finding him in violation of RSA chapter 149-M for operating an unpermitted solid waste facility. The trial court found the defendant\u2019s proffered evidence to be irrelevant because it concerned a different statute and that, even if relevant, its probative value was outweighed by possible confusion of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">A trial court\u2019s decision not to admit evidence on the ground that it is irrelevant will not be set aside absent an abuse of discretion. <em>See State v. Smith, </em>135 N.H. 524, 525, 607 A.2d 611, 612 (1992). The earlier <em>Naughton </em>case involved the provisions of RSA chapter 375-B (1977) and whether the defendant\u2019s operation as a trash collector brought him within the purview of that statute as a common or contract carrier. That statute and our decision in <em>Naughton </em>had nothing to do with the provisions of RSA chapter 149-M or the activities alleged in this case. Moreover, as the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>court suggested, the defendant\u2019s state of mind in 1978 with respect to the lawfulness of his activity is of questionable probative worth in rebutting evidence that he was on notice in 1983 and again in 1989 of the unlawfulness of that activity. There was no abuse of discretion in excluding the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Finally, the defendant contends that his sentences should be set aside because of the inclusion in the presentence report of a six-page letter solicited by the probation department from the prosecuting attorney, which recommended to the probation department that the maximum sentence be recommended to the judge due to the years of noncompliance by the defendant. While not contesting any of the factual allegations contained in the letter, the defendant complains that the letter was \u201cseverely prejudicial\u201d and \u201cpoisoned the mind[s]\u201d of both the probation officer preparing the presentence report and the sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Sentencing courts have \u201cwide discretion in choosing the sources and types of evidence on which to rely in imposing sentence.\u201d <em>State v. Tufts, </em>136 N.H. 517, 519, 618 A.2d 818, 819 (1992) (quotation omitted). Our review in this area concerns \u201cthe quality and veracity of the information used in the process, of judging [what sentence is to be imposed] and the ability of the defendant to have a meaningful opportunity to point to its deficiencies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520, 618 A.2d at 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Underlying the defendant\u2019s argument is the claim that a presentence report ought to be an impartial document. This is not the law. <em>See State v. Cote, </em>129 N.H. 358, 371\u201472, 530 A.2d 775, 782-83 (1987). The defendant does not dispute the accuracy of the contents of the prosecutor\u2019s letter but complains that he had no opportunity to rebut the letter prior to the probation department\u2019s preparation of the presentence report. A defendant is not entitled to review the material forming the basis of a presentence report. <em>See Tufts, </em>136 N.H. at 521, 618 A.2d at 820-21; <em>Cote, </em>129 N.H. at 372, 530 A.2d at 783. The defendant in fact had the opportunity to review the prosecutor\u2019s letter prior to the sentencing hearing. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in considering the prosecutor\u2019s submission to the probation department.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b106-9\">THAYER, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
