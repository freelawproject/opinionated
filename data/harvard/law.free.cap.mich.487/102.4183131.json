After conducting an independent review of the record, we conclude there exists clear and convincing evidence that Stanek and Barrows acted with \u201cactual malice,\u201d but that plaintiff has failed to meet her evidentiary burden as to Flohe.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the result reached by the Court of Appeals as to Flohe, but reverse the result it reached as to Stanek and Barrows. We remand this matter to the Court of Appeals for consideration of defendants\u2019 other issues, including whether the handwritten caption on the mailed report constitutes a non-defamatory statement of opinion when considered in its context within the report as a whole, whether the caption is provable as false, and whether defendants are entitled to the protection afforded by Michigan\u2019s statutory fair reporting privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">This defamation action arises from the mass mailing of a personnel report written about plaintiff, Derith Smith. Plaintiff worked for the village of Suttons Bay (the Village) in Leelanau County. Plaintiffs supervisor, Suttons Bay Village Manager Charles Stewart, composed the personnel report (the Stewart report), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>includes allegations that plaintiff was an independent contractor but had been compensating herself as an employee. The Stewart report also includes allegations that plaintiff had never been issued a W-2 form, received benefits to which she was not entitled, paid herself at a higher rate than the rate for which she was approved, and was not a \u201cteam player.\u201d Stewart presented his report to the Village\u2019s personnel committee, and the committee voted to terminate plaintiffs employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Plaintiff filed a claim for unemployment compensation benefits. The Village opposed plaintiffs claim, arguing that plaintiff was not an employee but rather an independent contractor and, therefore, not entitled to benefits. A subsequent investigation and review revealed that various allegations against plaintiff in the report were false. Accordingly, the Village withdrew its opposition to plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Plaintiff believed that she was wrongfully terminated, but did not institute a lawsuit against the Village because she had secured employment as the Elmwood Township Supervisor in the November 2004 election. On May 17, 2005, while serving as Elmwood Township Supervisor, plaintiff received an anonymous mailing. The mailing included a copy of the Stewart report, with an additional handwritten caption stating, \u201cAttention: Suttons Bay Villagers Alledged [sic] Misuse of Village Taxpayer Funds?\u201d and \u201cDerrick [sic] Smith.\u201d Plaintiff later learned that copies of the Stewart report, including the caption, had been mailed to hundreds of citizens in Leelanau County.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">At the time of the mass mailing, defendants Stanek, Barrows, and Flohe were involved in an informal group of concerned Leelanau County citizens. The group met fairly regularly to discuss various issues, including local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>politics and elections. It is undisputed that Stanek, Barrows, and Flohe were displeased with plaintiffs performance as township supervisor and were responsible for the mass-mailing of the Stewart report.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The record establishes that Barrows contacted Suttons Bay Village Treasurer Jerry VanHuystee on several occasions in 2004, asking whether VanHuystee had any information about plaintiff. VanHuystee testified that he told Barrows that he did not know of anything illegal done by plaintiff. After several requests for information from Barrows, VanHuystee retrieved the Stewart report from the Village\u2019s records and made a copy of it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> VanHuystee put the copy of the Stewart report in an envelope and marked it with Barrows\u2019s name. VanHuystee then dropped off the envelope at his sister-in-law\u2019s home, where Barrows was to pick it up. The copy of the Stewart report contained no handwritten caption at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Barrows testified that he picked up the envelope containing the Stewart report and brought a copy of the report to a citizens\u2019 meeting held at Stanek\u2019s office during the first week of May 2005. Stanek, Barrows, and Flohe were all present at this meeting, although the trial testimony indicated that Flohe arrived late. At this particular meeting, copies of the Stewart report were available for attendees to view, and there was discussion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>regarding whether the Stewart report should be mailed to other citizens. The trial testimony establishes that some attendees favored mailing the report, while others did not. George Preston was also present at this meeting, and he testified that he had expressed hesitation about mailing the Stewart report. Preston told the other attendees at the meeting that he would contact Stewart to verify the report\u2019s accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Preston and Stewart testified that Preston had contacted Stewart and informed him of the concerned citizens\u2019 intent to mail the Stewart report. Stewart confirmed with Preston that plaintiff had done nothing illegal and that the report should not be distributed. Preston and Stanek both testified that Preston relayed this information to Stanek; however, the trial testimony is somewhat conflicting with regard to exactly when he did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Barrows testified that he nonetheless took a copy of the Stewart report to a copy shop and paid to have approximately 500 copies made. Approximately 420 of those copies were placed into envelopes and sealed by the store\u2019s staff. The envelopes were placed in boxes along with the remaining 80 copies of the Stewart report. Barrows testified that on May 16, 2005, he took the boxes to Stanek\u2019s office where he, Stanek, and Flohe worked together to stamp and label the stuffed envelopes. The envelopes were then taken to the post office and mailed to citizens in Leelanau County. Citizens within the county began receiving the mailings by May 17, 2005, while the remaining copies of the Stewart report were displayed at citizen and township meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Plaintiff subsequently brought a defamation claim against Stanek, Barrows, and Flohe.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>moved for summary disposition, arguing that their actions were covered by the fair reporting privilege, MCL 600.2911(3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court denied summary disposition, ruling that plaintiff had alleged sufficient evidence that if believed by a jury, would show that defendants mailed the Stewart report with actual knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard for the truth of the report.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>The trial court additionally concluded that \u201cif a jury finds that the publication was false and not made in good faith and with an honest belief that the report was true, the qualified privilege is defeated and damages may be awarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">A jury trial was held, and a verdict was reached in favor of plaintiff. The jury awarded plaintiff monetary damages and a public apology in the form of a legal notice. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for entry of a judgment of no cause of action, concluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>that defamation could not be established as a matter of law because defendants\u2019 failure to investigate the contents of the report did not constitute the \u201creckless disregard\u201d required for a finding of actual malice<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and defendants could not be held liable for relying on a report that they did not prepare.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals noted that Stewart prepared the report, and it contained his \u201cerroneous view of the status of plaintiffs employment.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> With respect to the handwritten caption added to the report, the Court of Appeals concluded that it was merely an expression of opinion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">This Court granted plaintiffs application for leave to appeal to address whether the Court of Appeals erred in determining that plaintiff did not present sufficient evidence to support a finding of actual malice.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">II. STANDARD of review</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The inquiry into whether evidence in a defamation case is sufficient to support a finding of actual malice presents a question of law. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To determine whether the constitutional standard for defamation of a public figure<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> has been satisfied, a reviewing court must con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>sider the factual record in full.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The reason for this \u201cindependent review\u201d of the record is \u201c[o]ur profound national commitment to the free exchange of ideas, as enshrined in the First Amendment... .\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, we must analyze the alleged defamatory statements at issue and their surrounding circumstances to determine whether those statements are protected under the First Amendment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The importance of protecting First Amendment liberties through an application of the \u201cindependent review\u201d standard is well established.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While this Court generally reviews questions of law de novo, \u201cthe independent review function is not equivalent to a <em>\u2018de novo\u2019 </em>review of the ultimate judgment itself, in which a reviewing court makes an original appraisal of all the evidence to decide whether or not it believes that judgment should be entered for plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> If the reviewing Court determines that actual malice has been established with convincing clarity, the judgment of the trial court may only be reversed on the ground of some other error of law or clearly erroneous finding of fact.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Likewise, an appellate court should not conduct an independent review of credibility determinations, disregard findings of fact, or create new findings of fact.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Instead, \u201cthe court should exercise independent judgment regarding whether, as a matter of constitutional law, the evidence in the record supports the verdict,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> while giving \u201cdue regard\u201d to the trial court\u2019s \u201copportunity to observe the demeanor, of the witnesses ... .\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Credibility determinations made by the finder of fact must be examined to ascertain whether they are clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AD2\">A. LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\u201c \u2018A communication is defamatory if it tends so to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Generally, to sustain a claim of defamation, the following elements must be established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">(1) a false and defamatory statement concerning the plaintiff, (2) an unprivileged communication to a third party, (3) fault amounting at least to negligence on the part of the publisher, and (4) either actionability of the statement irrespective of special harm (defamation per se) or the existence of special harm caused by publication.<footnotemark>[24]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>In the seminal case of <em>New York Times Co v Sullivan, </em>the United States Supreme Court recognized the \u201cprofound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Court concluded that a plaintiff who is a public official may only prevail in a defamation action if he or she establishes that the alleged defamatory statements were made with \u201cactual malice.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> \u201cActual malice\u201d exists when the defendant knowingly makes a false statement or makes a false statement in reckless disregard of the truth.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The high threshold established by the \u201cactual malice\u201d standard was codified by our Legislature in MCL 600.2911(6), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">An action for libel or slander shall not be brought based upon a communication involving public officials or public figures unless the claim is sustained by clear and convincing proof that the defamatory falsehood was published with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether or not it was false.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Pursuant to this statute, a plaintiff who is a public official or public figure bears the burden of sustaining a defamation claim by clear and convincing proof that the alleged defamatory statement was made with actual malice, specifically, either knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard of whether or not the statement was false. Clear and convincing proof is that which produces in the mind of the trier of fact a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the precise facts in issue.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Evidence may be uncontroverted and yet not be clear and convincing.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Conversely, evidence may be clear and convincing despite the fact that it has been contradicted.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">After <em>New York Times, </em>the United States Supreme Court clarified the scope of the actual malice standard. In <em>St Amant v Thompson, </em>the Court explained that \u201cactual malice\u201d is a subjective concept.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> However, a defendant in a defamation case cannot \u201cautomatically insure a favorable verdict by testifying that he published with a belief that the statements were true.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Instead, \u201c[t]he finder of fact must determine whether the publication was indeed made in good faith.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The Court further held in <em>Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc v Connaughton </em>that \u201conly through the course of case-by-case adjudication can [a court] give content to [the actual malice] constitutional standard[].\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The term \u201cmalice\u201d in the actual malice standard does not equate to a showing of ill will.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Rather, the standard requires a showing that, at minimum, the allegedly defamatory statements were made with a \u201creckless disregard for the truth.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The manner in which a plaintiff may establish \u201creckless disregard for the truth\u201d for purposes of the actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>malice standard cannot necessarily be expressed in a singular definition.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> A plaintiff must prove something \u201cmore than a departure from reasonably prudent conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Likewise, a plaintiff must present sufficient evidence to justify a conclusion that the defendant made the allegedly defamatory publication with a \u201chigh degree of awareness\u201d of the publication\u2019s probable falsity,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> or that the defendant \u201centertained serious doubts as to the truth\u201d of the publication made.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> And while \u201ccourts must be careful not to place too much reliance on such factors, a plaintiff is entitled to prove the defendant\u2019s state of mind through circumstantial evidence, and it cannot be <em>said </em>that evidence concerning motive or care never bears any relation to the actual malice inquiry.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Finally, it is well settled that the failure to investigate the accuracy of a communication before publishing it, even when a reasonably prudent person may have done so, is not sufficient to establish that the defendant acted with reckless disregard for the truth.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> However, a \u201cpurposeful avoidance of the truth\u201d is dissimilar from the mere \u201cfailure to investigate,\u201d and \u201ca deliberate decision not to acquire knowledge of facts that might confirm the probable falsity\u201d of a publication is sufficient to find reckless disregard.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Furthermore, when a defendant has reported a third party\u2019s allegations, reckless disregard for the truth of the allegations \u201cmay be found where there are obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of the informant or the accuracy of his reports.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">B. APPLICATION OF ACTUAL MALICE STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"A0M\">1. STANEK</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Plaintiff first relies on evidence that, during a meeting at which all three defendants were present, Preston expressed hesitation about mailing the Stewart report and stated that he would speak to Stewart to verify the accuracy of the report\u2019s contents. Specifically, Preston testified that in response to a discussion about mailing the Stewart report, he informed others that it \u201cprobably wouldn\u2019t be a good idea\u201d because \u201cno one had any real knowledge if in fact [the] document was true or not.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>With regard to Stanek\u2019s liability, both Preston and Stanek testified that, at a monthly Elmwood Township meeting, Preston informed Stanek that he had spoken with Stewart and that Stewart confirmed that plaintiff had not done anything illegal. There were two monthly meetings at which this conversation could have occurred \u2014 either that of May 9, 2005, or that of June 13, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Preston testified that his conversation with Stanek occurred sometime in the spring, and that while he could not be certain of the month, he did not believe it was in June. In contrast, Stanek testified that he recalled that the conversation took place on June 13. In any event, Stanek did not deny that Preston informed him of Stewart\u2019s confirmation that plaintiff had not done anything illegal. If the jury believed that the conversation between Preston and Stanek did not take place before June 13, as Stanek asserts, plaintiff would not be able to establish that Stanek knew the allegations in the Stewart report were false <em>before </em>the mass-mailing. However, if the jury believed that the conversation between Preston and Stanek occurred at the May 9 meeting, then plaintiff would be able to establish that Stanek mailed the Stewart report despite the knowledge that it contained false information.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">On this record, it is apparent that the jury did not believe that Preston waited until June 13 to tell Stanek about the Stewart report when citizens already started receiving the report by mail almost a month earlier on May 17 and expressed their concerns with its contents shortly thereafter. The testimony reveals that Preston <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>already knew by May 2 or 4 that defendants were considering mailing the Stewart report, and that he had contacted Stewart about this at some point before May 17. Thus, the jury apparently did not believe Stanek\u2019s testimony that Preston did not report back to him until June 13, almost a month <em>after </em>the Stewart report had been distributed. Instead, the jury apparently chose to believe Preston\u2019s testimony that he told Stanek about the Stewart report in the spring, but that he did not think it was as late as June.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Here, the illogical timeline of events presented by Stanek, coupled with Preston\u2019s testimony that Stanek initially denied responsibility for the mailing and evidence that Stanek refused to make a retraction after admitting he knew that the contents of the Stewart report were false, lead us to conclude that the jury\u2019s finding that Stanek knew that the Stewart report contained false information or was aware of the report\u2019s probable falsity when he mailed copies of it was not clearly erroneous. We will not disturb the jury\u2019s credibility determinations in this regard.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Moreover, we are satisfied that this evidence constitutes clear and convincing evidence that Stanek acted with actual malice. Although it is contradicted by Stanek\u2019s own testimony that he did not have knowledge of the Stewart report\u2019s falsity, his denial of such knowledge is not, in and of itself, sufficient to defeat plaintiffs claim that Stanek had the requisite knowledge to support a defamation claim.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The jury was undoubtedly presented with conflicting testimony here. Similarly, in <em>Harte-Hanks, </em>evidence was presented that, if believed, could effectively refute the claim of actual malice. However, as the United States Supreme Court explained in <em>Harte-Hanks, </em>we should not substitute for the judgment of the jury our own judgment of which testimony was most credible.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Accordingly, we do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>find the jury\u2019s credibility determinations clearly erroneous and, therefore, we agree with the jury\u2019s finding with regard to Stanek\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">2. BARROWS</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Barrows testified that following plaintiffs election as township supervisor, he repeatedly asked VanHuystee, at least five times,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> for information about plaintiff. Specifically, Barrows inquired whether plaintiff had been involved in any criminal activity. VanHuystee testified that he told Barrows on each of the five occasions that he did not know of any illegal conduct by plaintiff. Furthermore, VanHuystee testified that the occasions on which he told Barrows that plaintiff had not been involved in illegal activity were <em>prior </em>to May 16, 2005, the date on which Stanek, Barrows, and Flohe mailed the Stewart report.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Barrows denied knowing that the statements in the Stewart report regarding plaintiff were false. Yet Barrows\u2019s denial of such knowledge is not, in and of itself, sufficient to defeat plaintiffs claim that he had the requisite knowledge to support a defamation claim.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Not only was Barrows aware of Preston\u2019s initial hesitation to mail the Stewart report, but VanHuystee repeatedly told Barrows that he did not know of any illegal activity by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Indeed, Barrows\u2019s testimony provides a sound basis for the jury\u2019s finding of actual malice. The following exchange between plaintiffs counsel and Barrows is illustrative of Barrows\u2019s purposeful avoidance of the truth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\"><em>Q. </em>Did you hear Mr. Preston say that the group when he said don\u2019t send it, Pm going to go investigate, some of the group at least some members he didn\u2019t know how many, agreed that he should do that, did you hear him testify to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\"><em>A. </em>Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\"><em>Q. </em>And, did you agree, were you one of those people that Mr. Stewart agreed Mr. Stewart should go check \u2014 Mr. Preston should go check with Mr. Stewart, or didn\u2019t you agree with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">' <em>A. </em>I think it was neutral, I didn\u2019t care whether he went or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\"><em>Q. </em>You didn\u2019t disagree with him going?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-11\"><em>A. </em>I didn\u2019t care. I said he was going to do it, it wasn\u2019t anything of real interest to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-12\"><em>Q. </em>What I\u2019m asking about the meeting, didn\u2019t [Preston] tell you at the meeting, you knew at the meeting he said don\u2019t send it I\u2019m going to go investigate, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-13\"><em>A. </em>That could very well be, I mean, that\u2019s something that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-14\"><em>Q. </em>And, that you know that those statements were made by Mr. Preston before the mailing went out, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-15\"><em>A. </em>Oh, yes, sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-16\"><em>Q. </em>And, we know the mailing occurred on May 15 or 16, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-17\"><em>A. </em>Eight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-18\"><em>Q. </em>No doubt about that because we have the envelope, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>A. </em>That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-4\">Q. So to wrap all those little beads together, you knew before you sent that mailing at least one person looked at it, said don\u2019t send it, I\u2019m going to investigate, I\u2019m going to go to the guy that wrote this memo, you knew that, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">After considering the evidence presented, including this testimony, the jury apparently found that Barrows acted with actual malice. This conclusion is eminently reasonable given that Barrows conceded that Preston had recommended that he not send the report because he wanted to verify its accuracy. Thus, there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that Barrows acted with reckless disregard for the truth of the statements in the Stewart report. Although the evidence was controverted, we conclude that plaintiff sustained her burden of presenting the jury with clear and convincing proof that Barrows acted with actual malice when mailing the Stewart report.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">We find further support for this conclusion in <em>Harte-Hanks. </em>In that case, the plaintiff, a candidate for an elective judicial office occupied by an incumbent, brought a defamation action against the defendant newspaper, which had published an article that damaged his personal and professional reputation. Shortly before the election, the plaintiff discovered evidence of a bribery scheme involving a member of the incumbent judge\u2019s staff. The plaintiff located a witness to that bribery, Patsy Stephens, and tape-recorded a four-hour interview of her during which she provided details of the bribery scheme. Eight people were present during that interview, including Stephens\u2019s sister, Alice Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">The defendant endorsed the incumbent in the election and arranged a meeting with Thompson to discuss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>the alleged bribery scheme. Thompson asserted that the plaintiff had promised her and Stephens gifts and other consideration in exchange for Stephens\u2019s statements implicating the incumbent\u2019s staff in the bribery scheme. Before printing an article concerning Thompson\u2019s allegations against the plaintiff, the defendant interviewed the plaintiff. The plaintiff categorically denied Thompson\u2019s assertion that he had offered an improper quid pro quo for Stephens\u2019 information, and provided the defendant with access to the tape recording of his interview with Stephens. The defendant did not listen to the recording. It nevertheless published a story alleging that the plaintiff had offered Thompson and Stephens jobs in exchange for their cooperation in building a bribery case against the incumbent\u2019s staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">A jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to consider whether the lower courts had properly applied the <em>New York Times </em>actual malice standard and whether the plaintiff had presented clear and convincing evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The Court initially noted that the jury\u2019s verdict was largely premised on credibility determinations. In concluding that the plaintiff had satisfied his burden of proving his case by clear and convincing evidence, the Court relied heavily on circumstantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s actual malice. Notably, the Court cited the defendant\u2019s failure to review the tape recording of the plaintiffs interview with Stephens that would have confirmed or refuted portions of its article. The Court reasoned that \u201cone might reasonably infer .. . that the decision not to listen to the tapes was motivated by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>concern that they would raise additional doubts concerning Thompson\u2019s veracity.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The Court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">It is also undisputed that [the plaintiff] made the tapes of the Stephens interview available to the [defendant] and that no one at the newspaper took the time to listen to them. Similarly, there is no question that the [defendant] was aware that... Stephens was a key witness and that they failed to make any effort to interview her. Accepting the jury\u2019s determination that [the defendant\u2019s] explanations for these omissions were not credible, it is likely that the newspaper\u2019s inaction was a product of a deliberate decision not to acquire knowledge of facts that might confirm the prohable falsity of Thompson\u2019s charges. Although failure to investigate will not alone support a finding of actual malice, the purposeful avoidance of the truth is in a different category.<footnotemark>[54]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">In this case, as in <em>Harte-Hanks, </em>Barrows could have readily confirmed the accuracy of the Stewart report by doing exactly what Preston had done \u2014 contact Stewart directly. It appears the jury found that Barrows made a conscious decision not to hear from the person most capable of confirming the truth or falsity of the report. This is significant in light of the fact that at a meeting, Preston impressed on Barrows (and others, including Stanek) that the report should not be distributed because its accuracy had not been verified. And given the fact that Barrows repeatedly sought out VanHuystee and VanHuystee told Barrows on at least five separate occasions that he did not know of anything illegal done by plaintiff, the jury had ample evidence from which it could conclude that Barrows acted in purposeful avoidance of the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The Stewart report contained relatively specific allegations of wrongdoing by plaintiff, including allegations of acts that would clearly constitute a misuse of taxpayer funds. Barrows knew that VanHuystee did not know of anything illegal done by plaintiff and that members of the group of concerned citizens that Barrows belonged to expressed concern about mailing the Stewart report and a desire to verify its accuracy. Thus, the jury was presented with relevant evidence aside from a mere allegation that Barrows obtained the Stewart report and mailed it without any investigation. As in <em>Harte-Hanks, </em>on the basis of the evidence presented and the testimony apparently believed by the jury, the jury in this case most certainly could have inferred that Barrows\u2019s decision not to confirm the accuracy of the report was motivated by a concern that doing so would raise additional doubts concerning its veracity. Therefore, we do not find the jury\u2019s credibility determinations clearly erroneous, and we agree with the jury\u2019s finding with regard to Barrows\u2019s liability.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>3. FLOHE</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">In contrast to the evidence against Stanek and Barrows, the evidence presented against Flohe is less Convincing. Unlike for Stanek, there is no evidence indicating that Flohe was <em>ever </em>told that Stewart himself, as author of the report, confirmed that the report contained false information. In addition, unlike for Barrows, there is no evidence that VanHuystee had repeatedly informed Flohe that he had no knowledge of any illegal activity by plaintiff. Moreover, the evidence indicates that Flohe was not even present at the beginning of the meeting at which Preston expressed his reluctance to mail the report and indicated that he would verify its accuracy with Stewart. Thus, the record contains little, if any, evidence to counter Flohe\u2019s contention that he was unaware that the report contained false information. Accordingly, we conclude that while the jury apparently did not find Flohe\u2019s testimony to be credible, there was not clear and convincing evidence remaining to support its finding that Flohe acted with actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">For these reasons, we reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that plaintiff presented insufficient evidence of actual malice as to Stanek and Barrows, but affirm its conclusion that plaintiff presented insufficient evidence of actual malice as to Flohe.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">C. DEFAMATORY MEANING OF THE HANDWRITTEN CAPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Defendants additionally argue that they are not liable for the added handwritten caption because the caption is not defamatory.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The caption added to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Stewart report states, \u201cAttention: Suttons Bay Villagers Alledged [sic] Misuse of Village Taxpayer Funds?\u201d and \u201cDerrick [sic] Smith\u201d written next to the line stating, \u201cSubject: Personnel meeting scheduled for August 10, 2004.\u201d The Court of Appeals conclusively determined that the caption alone is incapable of defamatory meaning as a matter of law because the term \u201calleged\u201d was used and a question mark was included, indicating that the caption was nothing more than an expression of opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">However, we note that a statement of \u201copinion\u201d is not automatically shielded from an action for defamation because \u201cexpressions of \u2018opinion\u2019 may often imply an assertion of objective fact.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> As explained by the United States Supreme Court, the statement \u201cIn my opinion Jones is a liar\u201d may cause just as much damage to a person\u2019s reputation as the statement \u201cJones is a liar.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> If a statement of opinion is about a matter of public concern, it is protected speech under the First Amendment, unless it can be objectively proven to be false.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Thus, a statement of opinion that can be proven to be false may be defamatory because it may harm the subject\u2019s reputation or deter others from associating with the subject. The dispositive question with regard to the handwritten caption is whether a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that the statement implies a defamatory meaning.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The handwritten caption \u201cAttention: Suttons Bay Villagers Alledged [sic] Misuse of Village Taxpayer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Funds?\u201d and \u201cDerrick [sic] Smith\u201d may he defamatory if it implies that defendants have information that would indicate a misuse of taxpayer funds by plaintiff. The Court of Appeals noted that the caption is phrased in a manner that asserts that any misuse of funds is only alleged, and it is punctuated with a question mark, indicating that defendants are not conclusively stating that plaintiff misused taxpayer funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\">Nevertheless, even a statement of opinion may be defamatory when it implies assertions of objective facts. Noting that context matters in analyzing an allegedly defamatory statement, the United State Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has held that a statement must be examined \u201cin its totality in the context in which it was uttered or published.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> In addition, the First Circuit has explained that a court must consider all the words used in allegedly defamatory material, \u201cnot merely a particular phrase or sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> This Court has similarly supported the notion that \u201ccontext\u201d must be considered when an alleged defamatory statement is reviewed for a determination of whether it implies a defamatory meaning.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">We agree that allegedly defamatory statements must be analyzed in their proper context. To hold otherwise could potentially elevate form over substance. Thus, on remand, the handwritten caption in this case should be viewed in context with the Stewart report as a whole, instead of relying merely on the use of a question mark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>as punctuation and use of the word \u201cAlledged [sic]\u201d to determine whether it is capable of defamatory meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Finally, we note that the Court of Appeals failed to address the issue of the falsity of the handwritten caption. Such an inquiry is required for plaintiff to sustain her defamation claim, and must be addressed by the Court of Appeals on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\"><em>m </em>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Plaintiff presented clear and convincing evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that both Stanek and Barrows acted with actual malice. We reach this conclusion after conducting an independent review of the record and giving due regard to the ability of the finder of fact \u2014 the jury \u2014 to view the witnesses\u2019 demeanor and to make appropriate credibility judgments. The concurrence/dissent\u2019s approach to the independent review function is mistaken and reaches out to conduct essentially a de novo review in order to replace, with the concurrence/dissent\u2019s own, <em>all </em>of the jury\u2019s findings as to the defendants\u2019 liability.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Therefore, we reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that Stanek and Barrows are not liable for defam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>ing plaintiff. However, we also conclude that the record does <em>not </em>contain sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that Flohe acted with actual malice. Therefore, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that Flohe is not liable for defaming plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Accordingly, we remand this matter to the Court of Appeals for consideration of defendants\u2019 additional arguments, including whether the added handwritten caption on the Stewart report constitutes a non-defamatory statement of opinion when considered in its context within the Stewart report as a whole, whether the caption is provable as false, and whether defendants are entitled to the protection afforded by Michigan\u2019s statutory fair reporting privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b171-6\">Kelly, C.J., and Cavanagh and Hathaway, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-7\"> The trial testimony revealed apparent political discourse between plaintiff and defendants.

I concur with the majority that plaintiff did not satisfy her evidentiary burden regarding defendant Noel Flohe. I dissent, however, from the majority\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff presented clear and convincing evidence that defendants John Stanek and Donald Barrows acted with actual malice when they mailed copies of a public record \u2014 a report critical of plaintiffs job performance written by her former supervisor, Suttons Bay Village Manager Charles Stewart (the Stewart report). I would affirm the result reached by the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>of Appeals concerning each of the three individual defendants because my independent review of the record reveals that plaintiff failed to present clear and convincing evidence that Stanek and Barrows acted with actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">I. ACTUAL MALICE STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">As the majority explains, to prevail in a defamation action, a plaintiff who is a public official must establish that a defendant made a false and defamatory statement with \u201cactual malice.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018Actual malice\u2019 exists when the defendant knowingly makes a false statement or makes a false statement in reckless disregard of the truth.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Legislature codified the heightened actual malice standard in MCL 600.2911(6), which mandates that a plaintiff who is a public official sustain a defamation claim \u201cby clear and convincing proof that the defamatory falsehood was published with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether or not it was false.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Clear and convincing proof is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">evidence that \u201cproduce [s] in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established, evidence so clear, direct, and weighty and convincing as to enable [the factfinder] to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>come to a clear conviction, without hesitancy, of the truth of the precise facts in issue. \u201d<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Application of the heightened actual malice standard in cases involving political speech reflects our \u201cprofound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This Court has distinguished between regulation of political speech and commercial speech, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">Political speech is \u201c \u2018at the core of our electoral process and of the First Amendment freedoms\u2019 ... an area of public policy where protection of robust discussion is at its zenith.\u201d Because the central purpose of the First Amendment speech clause is to protect core political speech, we determined that political speech may not be regulated in the same manner that commercial speech is regulated.<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u201cThere is little doubt that \u2018public discussion of the qualifications of a candidate for elective office presents what is probably the strongest possible case for application of the <em>New York Times </em>rule/ and the strongest possible case for independent review\u201d of the actual malice determination.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">When determining whether a public official plaintiff has satisfied the heightened actual malice stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>dard, \u201cthe reviewing court must consider the factual record in full.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The requirement of independent review \u201cassigns to judges a constitutional responsibility that cannot be delegated to the trier of fact, whether the factfinding function be performed in the particular case by a jury or by a trial judge.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Locricchio v Evening News Ass\u2019n, </em>this Court observed that the independent review requirement \u201creflects an inherent distrust of allocating unlimited decisional power to juries in the First Amendment context.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> One year after <em>Locricchio, </em>this Court expanded its discussion about the importance of independent review, stating that \u201c[w]e perceive an additional need for independent review grounded on the fear that juries may give short shrift to important First Amendment rights.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">In <em>New York Times Co v Sullivan, </em>the United States Supreme Court recognized that \u201cerroneous statement^] [are] inevitable in free debate, and that [these statements] must be protected if the freedoms of expression are to have the \u2018breathing space\u2019 that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>\u2018need... to survive.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Absent such protection, \u201cwould-be critics of official conduct may be deterred from voicing their criticism, even though it is believed to be true and even though it is in fact true, because of doubt whether it can be proved in court or fear of the expense of having to do so.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That is, not protecting false defamatory statements would \u201cdampenG the vigor and limit[] the variety of public debate.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because such an outcome cannot be tolerated under the First Amendment, \u201cneither factual error nor defamatory content suffices to remove the constitutional shield from criticism of official conduct. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Instead, a plaintiff who is a public official must establish actual malice before recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\">The matters at issue here lie at the heart of our political discourse and are subject to the expansive protections enshrined in the First Amendment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the majority imposes liability on two of the three individual defendants because they failed to personally investigate information criticizing a political opponent contained in a public record. In so doing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>majority punishes defendants\u2019 exercise of their First Amendment rights to engage in political speech and to distribute a public record, contrary to well-established United States Supreme Court precedent.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Moreover, the majority shirks its \u201cconstitutional responsibility\u201d to independently review the whole factual record,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the majority also wrongly defers to the jury\u2019s verdict when such deference is not owed.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">II. ACTUAL MALICE STANDARD AS APPLIED</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">In this case, all three individual defendants were politically active residents of Elmwood Township. Stanek, a township trustee from 1998 to 2004, survived a 2003 recall campaign in which plaintiff was involved. He lost his bid for reelection in 2004, and his slate was replaced by a group of candidates that included plaintiff. Flohe was the township supervisor until plaintiff was elected to replace him in 2004. Barrows, another political opponent of plaintiffs, expressed his concern that plaintiffs job performance in Elmwood Township would be similar to her previous tenure as clerk in the village of Suttons Bay. He sought information about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>plaintiffs track record in the village from Jerry VanHuystee, Suttons Bay\u2019s appointed treasurer. VanHuystee furnished Barrows with the publicly available Stewart report, which criticized plaintiffs job performance in the village. Indeed, the Stewart report caused plaintiffs termination from her position in the village. Defendants subsequently mailed approximately 450 copies of the Stewart report to local residents, local government officials, and plaintiff. Before defendants mailed the Stewart report, someone had modified it with a handwritten caption stating \u201cAttention: Suttons Bay Villagers Alledged [sic] Misuse of Village Taxpayer Funds?\u201d and \u201cDerrick [sic] Smith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">Plaintiff received a copy of the Stewart report on May 17, 2005, and filed suit in July 2005. Plaintiffs suit proceeded to trial, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff. The jury ordered that Stanek pay plaintiff $40,000 in noneconomic damages and $4,000 in campaign expenses and that Barrows pay plaintiff $45,000 in noneconomic damages and $4,000 in campaign expenses. By contrast, the jury only assessed $10,000 in noneconomic damages and $4,000 in campaign expenses against Flohe. However, the jury also mandated that each individual defendant publish a public apology to plaintiff in the form of a legal notice to appear in two local newspapers: the <em>Traverse City Record-Eagle </em>and the <em>Leelanau Enterprise.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Although I generally agree with the majority\u2019s explication of the actual malice standard, I disagree with the majority\u2019s application of that standard to defendants Stanek and Barrows on this record. The record does not show \u201cwith convincing clarity\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> that defendants acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>with actual malice when they mailed the Stewart report. The \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidentiary standard requires that plaintiff satisfy \u201cthe most demanding standard applied in civil cases.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> After performing an independent review of the record, I cannot conclude that plaintiff satisfied this exacting standard. While plaintiff proffered some evidence of actual malice, that evidence is not \u201cso clear, direct. . . weighty and convincing\u201d that I can unhesitatingly state that either Stanek or Barrows acted with actual malice when they disseminated the Stewart report.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Suttons Bay Village Manager Charles Stewart, plaintiffs former supervisor, drafted the report about plaintiffs tenure with the village. Stewart addressed the report to the village\u2019s personnel committee, which voted to terminate plaintiff after reviewing it. The Stewart report remained on file thereafter. In the report, Stewart stated that (a) the village hired plaintiff as an independent contractor, but plaintiff received benefits available to full-time employees although she had not received W-2 forms; (b) when the village council declined to reappoint plaintiff as clerk, she delayed responding to the village\u2019s part-time job offer until Stewart was away from the office, at which time plaintiff directly contacted the council president without Stewart\u2019s knowledge to authorize a higher pay rate; (c) plaintiff did not exert more than the minimum effort necessary to perform her job; and (d) plaintiff was not a \u201cteam player.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">At trial, Stewart acknowledged that the report contained misinformation. For example, Stewart eventually located plaintiffs W-2 forms, which confirmed her status as an employee, rather than an independent contractor. However, Stewart testified that other aspects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>of the report were true, including his belief that plaintiff took purposeful steps to avoid a reduction in pay by directly contacting the council president in Stewart\u2019s absence. Plaintiff did not dispute the basic facts involving her pay rate as described in the Stewart report. Nor did she dispute the specific facts surrounding the statements in the Stewart report that Stewart continued to maintain were true. Rather, plaintiff testified that she did not intend to circumvent efforts to lower her pay rate by directly contacting the council president in Stewart\u2019s absence. In its decision regarding defendants\u2019 motions for summary disposition, the trial court held that \u201c[t]he Stewart report was not a disciplinary report, was not required to be destroyed, and was subject to disclosure under FOIA [the Freedom of Information Act].\u201d Plaintiff never appealed this adverse ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\">A. DEFENDANT JOHN STANEK</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Plaintiff did not present clear and convincing evidence that defendant Stanek acted with actual malice. The testimony of retired police officer George Preston does not establish with convincing clarity that Stanek knew that the Stewart report contained defamatory falsities when he mailed it. Nor does Preston\u2019s testimony show that Stanek recklessly disregarded its truth or falsity, i.e., that he \u201centertained serious doubts as to the truth\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> of the Stewart report or mailed the Stewart report despite having a \u201chigh degree of awareness of [its] probable falsity.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Preston testified that he attended an informal gathering of 10 or 12 people at Stanek\u2019s shop in early May 2005 \u201cwhere some neighbors got together and were talking about current issues going on in Elmwood Township.\u201d At this gathering, copies of the Stewart report were distributed, and the attendees began discussing it. When Preston saw a copy of the Stewart report, he \u201cbecame kind of interested, being a [retired] police officer.\u201d Preston volunteered to contact Suttons Bay Village Manager Charles Stewart and ask Stewart about \u201cthe contents of this information.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Preston wanted \u201cto ensure that [Stewart] did type this and the information inside is what [Stewart] had put in.\u201d Preston testified that he waited a \u201c[m]inimum [of] two weeks before I even talked to [Stewart] on the telephone.\u201d He also testified that Stewart never told him that the report contained falsities. As a result, Preston never told anyone else, including Stanek, that the Stewart report contained falsities.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Instead, Preston told Stanek that the Stewart report had \u201cno substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>to it as far as the criminal aspect.\u201d Preston also informed Stanek that because there had been no criminal investigation, he personally \u201cfelt that it wasn\u2019t right to send that [report] out.\u201d Preston testified that he conveyed this message to Stanek at a monthly Elmwood Township meeting that occurred in \u201clate spring, so that\u2019s May, June,\u201d but Preston did not recall the exact date of this conversation.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Preston\u2019s testimony certainly does not establish with convincing clarity that Stanek acted with actual malice in disseminating the Stewart report. Although Preston told Stanek that the Stewart report had no substance \u201cas far as the criminal aspect,\u201d Preston unambiguously testified that he never told Stanek or anyone else that the Stewart report contained falsities.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Stewart con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>firmed that he \u201cdid not specify\u201d to Preston what misinformation appeared in the report. Stewart also testified that he never spoke with Stanek about the report and that he never attempted to inform Stanek that the report contained falsities. The majority emphasizes Preston\u2019s concern with the \u201ccriminal aspect\u201d of the Stewart report. However, the Stewart report does not address whether plaintiff engaged in criminal activity or should be criminally prosecuted. The five-page Stewart report does not contain the words \u201ccrime\u201d or \u201ccriminal.\u201d Stewart testified that the report discussed perceived ethical violations by plaintiff. When asked whether he asserted that plaintiff had engaged in illegal conduct in the report, Stewart testified, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s even in the memo.\u201d In any event, Preston never told Stanek that the Stewart report contained falsities or that the veracity of the Stewart report had been called into question. Instead, Preston informed Stanek of his personal opinion about the \u201ccriminal aspect\u201d of the Stewart report. Preston\u2019s act of volunteering to contact Stewart and later sharing his personal opinion about the Stewart report with Stanek does not supply clear and convincing evidence that Stanek mailed the Stewart report with actual malice, i.e., either knowing the report contained defamatory falsities or recklessly disregarding its falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Moreover, the testimony concerning the timeline of events is anything but clear and convincing. The majority deduces that the conversation between Preston and Stanek occurred at the monthly Elmwood Township meeting on May 9, 2005, and not the monthly Elmwood Township meeting on June 13, 2005. The majority reasons that because Preston spoke to Stanek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>on May 9, or before he mailed the Stewart report, Stanek mailed the Stewart report knowing that it contained defamatory falsities. Yet, Stanek testified with a firm recollection that this conversation occurred on June 13. Preston had no clear recollection of the date. But neither Preston nor Stanek testified in a manner that comports with the majority\u2019s dubious conclusion that the two men spoke on May 9 \u2014 before the Stewart report was mailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">It is undisputed that the informal gathering at Stanek\u2019s shop occurred during the first week of May 2005 and that plaintiff received the Stewart report in the mail on May 17, 2005. Several witnesses testified that the informal gathering at Stanek\u2019s shop occurred on May 2 or May 4. Preston testified that he waited a minimum of two weeks after the gathering before contacting Stewart. Preston further testified that after his telephone conversation with Stewart, he approached Stanek some time in \u201clate spring, so that\u2019s May, June.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Thus, the earliest week in which Preston could have telephoned Stewart is the third week of May 2005 \u2014 one week after the Elmwood Township meeting on May 9, 2005. That is, under Preston\u2019s timeline of events, Preston telephoned Stewart no earlier than May 16 or May 18, 2005, and Preston shared his personal opinion with Stanek some time thereafter. Consequently, Preston\u2019s testimony actually corroborates Stanek\u2019s recollection that the conversation took place on June 13, 2005. If the conversation between Preston and Stanek occurred on June 13, Preston did not speak to Stanek until after defendants disseminated the Stewart report, and there is no basis to conclude, as the majority summarily does, that Stanek knew that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Stewart report contained defamatory falsities when he mailed it. The actual testimony on the record, and not the majority\u2019s distortion of it, provides yet another basis to conclude that plaintiff did not present clear and convincing evidence that Stanek acted with actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The majority also accords great weight to Preston\u2019s testimony that Stanek initially denied responsibility for the anonymous mailing. The majority\u2019s misplaced reliance on Preston\u2019s testimony about Stanek\u2019s initial denial of responsibility ignores the United States Supreme Court\u2019s observation that a defendant\u2019s repeated attempts to maintain that the inaccurate was accurate \u201cdoes not establish that he realized the inaccuracy at the time of publication.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Stanek\u2019s after-the-fact denial of responsibility for the mailing is irrelevant in determining whether plaintiff presented clear and convincing evidence that Stanek acted with actual malice when he mailed the Stewart report.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">B. DEFENDANT DONALD BARROWS</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">I also reject the majority\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff presented clear and convincing evidence that defendant Barrows acted with actual malice. The majority concedes that Barrows did not know that the Stewart report contained defamatory falsities at the time of its dissemination.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Therefore, the salient issue is whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to support a finding that Barrows recklessly disregarded the truth or falsity of the Stewart report. My independent review of the record reveals that plaintiff did not establish with convincing clarity that Barrows mailed the Stewart report \u201cwith reckless disregard of whether or not it was false.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">The majority relies on the testimony of Suttons Bay Village Treasurer Jerry VanHuystee to conclude that Barrows acted with actual malice. VanHuystee furnished the Stewart report to Barrows. However, VanHuystee\u2019s testimony does not establish with convincing clarity that Barrows acted with reckless disregard in disseminating the Stewart report. VanHuystee testified that as the appointed village treasurer, he never supervised plaintiff; moreover, he was not in contact with anyone who did supervise plaintiff. As the majority notes, Barrows asked VanHuystee at least five times whether plaintiff had engaged in illegal conduct during her tenure with the village. VanHuystee repeatedly responded that \u201cas far as I know [plaintiff] hadn\u2019t done anything illegal,\u201d but VanHuystee also specifically told Barrows that he had no idea.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> VanHuystee also testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>that he did not even know that the Stewart report existed when he responded to Barrows\u2019s questions about plaintiff. Significantly, VanHuystee never testified that he told Barrows that the Stewart report contained falsities or that it merited further investigation based on VanHuystee\u2019s review of the document. To the contrary, VanHuystee testified that he only procured a copy of the Stewart report \u201cto stop [Barrows] from asking me\u201d about plaintiff. Additionally, no evidence explains why VanHuystee, a disinterested party, would furnish the Stewart report to Barrows if VanHuystee doubted its veracity. Consequently, I cannot conclude that VanHuystee\u2019s testimony clearly established that Barrows mailed the Stewart report with reckless disregard of its falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The majority\u2019s reliance on Preston\u2019s testimony to establish that Barrows mailed the Stewart report with actual malice is similarly misplaced. Barrows testified that he heard Preston say that he wanted to talk to Stewart during the informal gathering at Stanek\u2019s shop, but Barrows also testified that he did not think he heard Preston say \u201cdon\u2019t send the memo.\u201d Preston further testified that the only defendant with whom he spoke after his conversation with Stewart was Stanek. He never spoke to Barrows. Moreover, Preston testified that he had no knowledge of any falsities in the Stewart report, and as a result, he never told anyone else, including Barrows, that the Stewart report contained falsities. Stewart confirmed that he, too, had no contact with Barrows about the report before the mailing. The majority\u2019s reliance on Preston\u2019s testimony is misplaced because nothing in Preston\u2019s testimony demonstrates that Barrows \u201cin fact entertained serious doubts as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>the truth of his publication\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> or that Barrows mailed the Stewart report with the requisite \u201chigh degree of awareness of [its] probable falsity.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s perplexing assertion that Barrows\u2019s testimony reveals his \u201cpurposeful avoidance of the truth\u201d consistent with <em>Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc v Connaughton, </em>491 US 657; 109 S Ct 2678; 105 L Ed 2d 562 (1989). In <em>Harte-Hanks, </em>the United States Supreme Court concluded that \u201c[although failure to investigate will not alone support a finding of actual malice, the purposeful avoidance of the truth is in a different category.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The majority suggests that Barrows purposefully avoided the truth because he did not contact Stewart directly. In so doing, the majority conflates Barrows\u2019s failure to investigate with the \u201cpurposeful avoidance of the truth\u201d illustrated by the unique facts in <em>Harte-Hanks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In <em>Harte-Hanks, </em>the defendant newspaper gathered the facts that were ultimately reported; drafted the offending statements; actually heard from the plaintiff himself and five other witnesses that the offending statements were untrue; failed to examine evidence in the defendant\u2019s possession corroborating plaintiffs story; and opted not to contact the key witness in the story it was creating, although it contacted the other parties involved. As the Supreme Court explained, \u201c[i]t is utterly bewildering in light of the fact that the Journal News committed substantial resources to investigating Thompson\u2019s claims, yet chose not to interview the one witness who was most likely to confirm Thompson\u2019s account of the events.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> \u201cBy the time the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>November 1 story appeared, six witnesses had consistently and categorically denied Thompson\u2019s allegations, yet the newspaper chose not to interview the one witness that both Thompson and Connaughton claimed would verify their conflicting accounts of the relevant events.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In addition, the defendant newspaper had in its possession tapes that would have either verified or disproved its story and yet did not listen to these tapes before publishing its story.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">In stark contrast to the defendants in <em>Harte-Hanks, </em>defendants here distributed a public record prepared by a government official in the course of his duties and available to the public under FOIA; defendants were never told by anyone that the contents of the report were untrue; they were not given any reason to believe that the contents of the report were untrue; and they did not fail to view evidence in their possession that indicated that the contents of the report were untrue. No evidence whatsoever reflects that Barrows entertained serious doubts about the veracity of the Stewart report before its publication or that he mailed the Stewart report with a high degree of awareness of its probable falsity. In fact, Barrows testified that he had no reason to investigate the Stewart report because he recognized that it came from a reliable source. When asked whether he would have treated the Stewart report differently if its origins appeared dubious, Barrows responded, \u201cCertainly. You couldn\u2019t pay any credence to it.\u201d In this case, however, Barrows reiterated that \u201c[t]he copy came to me through a reliable source, Mr. VanHuystee\u201d and that \u201cI had no doubt it was reliable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Finally, it is axiomatic that the mere failure to investigate before publication will not support a finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>of reckless disregard.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In the same fashion, the mere fact that Preston expressed his hesitance about mailing the Stewart report and chose to contact Stewart does not impose a similar requirement on Barrows because reckless disregard is \u201cnot measured by whether a reasonably prudent man would have published, or would have investigated before publishing.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Under these facts, plaintiff did not present clear and convincing evidence that Barrows either attempted to purposefully avoid the truth or that Barrows mailed the Stewart report in reckless disregard for its falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">After independently reviewing the record, I cannot conclude that plaintiff presented clear and convincing evidence that either Stanek or Barrows acted with actual malice in disseminating the Stewart report. There is no evidence that either defendant knew about the misinformation contained in the Stewart report regarding plaintiffs status as an employee, her W-2 forms, and her right to employee benefits when they mailed this public record. Accepting that Stanek and Barrows were political opponents who bore ill will toward plaintiff and knew that she had not been criminally prosecuted for any improprieties during her tenure in the village of Suttons Bay the record contains no evidence that either defendant entertained serious doubts about the truth of the Stewart report. Accordingly, I would affirm the result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>reached by the Court of Appeals concerning each of the three individual defendants.</p>\n<judges id=\"b190-5\">YOUNG and MArKMAN, JJ., concurred with CORRIGAN, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-7\"> <em>New York Times Co v Sullivan, </em>376 US 254, 279-280; 84 S Ct 710; 11 L Ed 2d 686 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b172-8\"> <em>J &amp; J Constr Co v Bricklayers &amp; Allied Craftsmen, Local 1, </em>468 Mich 722, 731; 664 NW2d 728 (2003), citing New <em>York Times, </em>376 US at 280.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b172-9\"> MCL 600.2911(6) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-10\">An action for libel or slander shall not be brought based upon a communication involving public officials or public figures unless the claim is sustained by clear and convincing proof that the defamatory falsehood was published with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether or not it was false.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[4]\">\n<p id=\"b173-8\">4 <em>In re Chmura (After Remand), </em>464 Mich 58, 72; 626 NW2d 876 (2001), quoting <em>In re Martin, </em>450 Mich 204, 227; 538 NW2d 399 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b173-10\"> <em>New York Times, </em>376 US at 270.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[6]\">\n<p id=\"b173-11\">6 <em>In re Chmura (After Remand), </em>464 Mich at 65, quoting <em>Meyer v Grant, </em>486 US 414, 425; 108 S Ct 1886; 100 L Ed 2d 425 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b173-12\"> <em>Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc v Connaughton, </em>491 US 657, 686-687; 109 S Ct 2678; 105 L Ed 2d 562 (1989), quoting <em>Ocala Star-Banner Co v Damron, </em>401 US 295, 300; 91 S Ct 628; 28 L Ed 2d 57 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\"> <em>Harte-Hanks, </em>491 US at 688; see also <em>Locricchio v Evening News Ass\u2019n, </em>438 Mich 84, 110; 476 NW2d 112 (1991), quoting <em>New York Times, </em>376 US at 285 <em>(\u201c[New York Times\\ </em>mandate[s] that reviewing courts ... \u2018examine for [themselves] the statements in issue and the circumstances under which they were made to see ... whether they are of a character which the principles of the First Amendment. .. protect.\u2019 \u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b174-7\"> <em>Bose Corp v Consumers Union of United States, Inc, </em>466 US 485, 501; 104 S Ct 1949; 80 L Ed 2d 502 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\"> <em>Locricchio, </em>438 Mich at 114 n 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b174-9\"> <em>Rouch v Enquirer &amp; News of Battle Creek (After Remand), </em>440 Mich 238, 258; 487 NW2d 205 (1992). <em>Rouch </em>further observed that \u201c[e]ven Justice Rehnquist, who dissented in <em>Bose, supra, </em>conceded that the doctrine of independent review of facts \u2018exists... so that perceived shortcomings of the trier of fact by way of bias or some other factor may be compensated for.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Bose, </em>466 US at 518.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b175-4\"> <em>New York Times, </em>376 US at 271-272, quoting <em>NAACP v Button, </em>371 US 415, 433; 83 S Ct 328; 9 L Ed 2d 405 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b175-5\"> <em>New York Times, </em>376 US at 279.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b175-6\"> <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\"> <em>Id. </em>at 273.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at 279-280.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b175-9\"> The constitutional right guaranteeing the freedom of speech is embodied explicitly in both the United States Constitution and the Michigan Constitution.
