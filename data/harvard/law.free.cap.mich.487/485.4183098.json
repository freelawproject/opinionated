At issue is whether the Court of Appeals properly reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of summary disposition. The trial court ruled that plaintiff had established a question of fact on the issue of proximate causation sufficient to withstand a motion for summary disposition. The Court of Appeals reversed. It treated plaintiffs claim as a loss-of-opportunity claim instead of a traditional medical malpractice claim and held that plaintiff did not raise a genuine issue of fact, as required by <em>Fulton v William Beaumont Hosp, </em>253 Mich App 70; 655 NW2d 569 (2002), because plaintiff could not prove that receiving the alleged appropriate treatment would have decreased his risk of stroke by greater than 50 percentage points. We disagree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis and conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">We hold that the Court of Appeals erred by relying on <em>Fulton </em>and determining that this is a loss-of-opportunity case controlled by both the first and second sentences of MCL 600.2912a(2), and instead hold that this case presents a claim for traditional medical malpractice controlled only by the first sentence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>\u00a7 2912a(2). Further, we conclude that plaintiff established a question of fact on the issue of proximate causation because plaintiffs experts opined that defendants\u2019 negligence more probably than not was the proximate cause of plaintiffs injuries. Finally, we hold that <em>Fulton </em>did not correctly set forth the burden of proof necessary to establish proximate causation for traditional medical malpractice cases as set forth in \u00a7 2912a(2). Therefore, we overrule <em>Fulton </em>to the extent that it has led courts to improperly designate what should be traditional medical malpractice claims as loss-of-opportunity claims and has improperly transformed the burden of proof in a traditional malpractice case from <em>a </em>proximate cause to <em>the </em>proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this matter to the Court of Appeals for consideration of the issue not decided on appeal in that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">This case involves allegations of negligence in medical care. Plaintiff had an illness known as sickle cell anemia. Plaintiff developed acute chest syndrome (ACS), which is a known complication of sickle cell anemia. Plaintiff claims that his ACS was misdiagnosed as pneumonia and as a consequence he did not receive the correct treatment. Plaintiffs experts opined that ACS requires treatment with an aggressive blood transfusion or an exchange transfusion, either of which needs to be given on a timely basis. While plaintiff ultimately received a transfusion, his experts opined that it was given too late and, as a consequence, plaintiff suffered a disabling stroke. Plaintiff alleged that defendants\u2019 failure to provide a timely transfusion violated the standard of care and that defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>negligence was a proximate cause of his disabling stroke. Plaintiffs complaint pled a traditional malpractice claim and did not plead a claim for lost opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">In support of his position, plaintiff offered two expert hematologists who testified that defendants\u2019 violations of the standard of care more probably than not caused plaintiffs injuries. Plaintiffs third hematology expert explained his opinion in statistical terms and testified that a patient with ACS has a 10 to 20 percent chance of developing a stroke. He further testified that with a timely exchange transfusion, the risk of stroke is reduced to less than 5 to 10 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Defendants brought a motion for summary disposition challenging the sufficiency of plaintiffs expert testimony on the issue of proximate causation. Even though plaintiffs complaint pled only traditional malpractice, defendants\u2019 motion made no distinction between the proof required for proximate causation in a traditional malpractice claim and the burden required for a claim based on loss of opportunity. Instead, defendants argued that plaintiffs case was controlled by both the first and second sentences of MCL 600.2912a(2), which require that the plaintiff prove \u201cthat he or she suffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or defendants\u201d and that \u201cthe plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Defendants argued that a reduction in the risk of stroke from 10 to 20 percent to less than 5 to 10 percent amounted to at best a 20 <em>percentage point </em>differential,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>which would be insufficient to meet the burden of proof on proximate causation. Defendants relied on <em>Fulton </em>to support their position that plaintiff must comply with this <em>percentage point differential </em>theory. Plaintiff countered that defendants\u2019 statistical portrayal of these numbers was mathematically inaccurate because his experts\u2019 testimony supported a finding that his injuries were more probably than not proximately caused by defendants\u2019 negligence. The trial court agreed with plaintiff. The trial court denied defendants\u2019 motion, ruling that plaintiff had presented sufficient testimony to establish a question of fact on proximate causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The Court of Appeals based its decision entirely on <em>Fulton </em>and reversed the trial court in an unpublished opinion per curiam, holding that this case presented a claim for a loss of opportunity and that plaintiff had not met his burden of proof under MCL 600.2912a(2). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reasoned that plaintiff was bound by the <em>Fulton </em>analysis and that a percentage point differential applied to this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">In asserting that defendants\u2019 negligence resulted in a stroke, plaintiff essentially argues that had defendants ordered a transfusion sooner, plaintiff would have avoided a stroke. Thus, to say defendants\u2019 failure to apply proper treatment caused the stroke is to say that this failure deprived plaintiff a greater opportunity to avoid the stroke. Consequently, plaintiffs claim amounts to one of lost opportunity to achieve a better result, and \u00a7 2912a(2) is applicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">In <em>Fulton, </em>this Court set forth the formula by which to calculate whether the opportunity to achieve a better result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>was greater than 50 percent \u2014 specifically, the Court must \u201csubtract!] the plaintiffs opportunity to survive after the defendant\u2019s alleged malpractice from the initial opportunity to survive without the malpractice.\u201d <em>Ensink [v Mecosta Co Gen Hosp, </em>262 Mich App 518, 531; 687 NW2d 143 (2004)].<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">We granted leave to review this matter, asking the parties to brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">(1) whether the requirements set forth in the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) apply in this case; (2) if not, whether the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact with regard to whether the defendants\u2019 conduct proximately caused his injury or (3) if so, whether <em>Fulton v William Beaumont Hosp, </em>253 Mich App 70 (2002), was correctly decided, or whether a different approach is required to correctly implement the second sentence of \u00a7 2912a(2).<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">This case involves review of a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary disposition, which this Court reviews de novo.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The issue also involves questions of statutory interpretation. Statutory interpretation is a question of law, which this Court also reviews de novo.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">At issue is whether the Court of Appeals properly reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of summary disposition on the issue of proximate causation. In order to answer this question we must review MCL 600.2912a.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>MCL 600.2912a provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-4\">(1) Subject to subsection (2), in an action alleging malpractice, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that in light of the state of the art existing at the time of the alleged malpractice:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">(a) The defendant, if a general practitioner, failed to provide the plaintiff the recognized standard of acceptable professional practice or care in the community in which the defendant practices or in a similar community, and that as a proximate result of the defendant failing to provide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">(b) The defendant, if a specialist, failed to provide the recognized standard of practice or care within that specialty as reasonably applied in light of the facilities available in the community or other facilities reasonably available under the circumstances, and as a proximate result of the defendant failing to provide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an injury</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">(2) In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that he or she suffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or defendants. In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">This statute, which governs the burden of proof in medical malpractice cases, was originally added to the Revised Judicature Act in 1977. It has been amended on several occasions, with the most recent amendment in 1993 adding subsection (2), which is at issue in this case. Subsection (2) contains two sentences. It is undisputed that the first sentence, which repeats the burden of proof as articulated in subsections (l)(a) and (b), merely reiterates the longstanding rule requiring a plaintiff to prove \u201cthat he or she suffered an injury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>more probably than not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or defendants.\u201d MCL 600.2912a(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The second sentence of \u00a7 2912a(2) addresses a subcategory of injuries in medical malpractice litigation governed by the loss-of-opportunity doctrine. The Legislature did not define the phrase \u201closs of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result.\u201d However, while not defined in the statute, the doctrine was initially recognized and defined in Michigan in <em>Falcon v Mem Hosp, </em>436 Mich 443; 462 NW2d 44 (1990).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">It is generally accepted that the 1993 amendment to \u00a7 2912a was adopted in a direct reaction to <em>Falcon, </em>meaning that it repudiated <em>Falcon\u2019s </em>reduced proximate causation theory.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, it is generally accepted that in adopting this amendment, the Legislature intended to limit medical malpractice claims to the <em>pre-Falcon </em>state of the law: if it was more probable than not that the plaintiff would have died even with the best of treatment, a claim for medical malpractice is precluded.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">We next turn to the correct interpretation of both sentences of \u00a7 2912a(2) and their applicability to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>case before us. In examining the first line of \u00a7 2912a(2), we are guided by the principle that <em>nothing </em>in \u00a7 2912a(2) has changed the burden of proof for traditional medical malpractice claims. The language of the first line of subsection (2) is clear: <em>\u201cin an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that he or she suffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or defendants. </em>\u201d This language reiterates the language of the previous subsections and merely restates the well-accepted, well-established historical rule for proximate causation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As the meaning of this sentence is well-established, no further statutory construction is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The proper interpretation of proximate causation in a negligence action is well-settled in Michigan. In order to be a proximate cause, the negligent conduct must have been a cause of the plaintiffs injury and the plaintiffs injury must have been a natural and probable result of the negligent conduct. These two prongs are respectively described as \u201ccause-in-fact\u201d and \u201clegal causation.\u201d See <em>Skinner v Square D Co, </em>445 Mich 153, 162-163; 516 NW2d 475 (1994); <em>Sutter v Biggs, </em>377 Mich 80; 139 NW2d 684 (1966); <em>Glinski v Szylling, </em>358 Mich 182; 99 NW2d 637 (1959). While legal causation relates to the foreseeability of the consequences of the defendant\u2019s conduct, the cause-in-fact prong \u201cgenerally requires showing that \u2018but for\u2019 the defendant\u2019s actions, the plaintiffs injury would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Skinner, </em>455 Mich at 163. It is equally well-settled that proximate causation in a malpractice claim is treated no differently than in an ordinary negligence claim, and it is well-established that there can be more than one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>proximate cause contributing to an injury. <em>Brisboy v Fibreboard Corp, </em>429 Mich 540; 418 NW2d 650 (1988); <em>Barringer v Arnold, </em>358 Mich 594; 101 NW2d 365 (1960); <em>Gleason v Hanafin, </em>308 Mich 31; 13 NW2d 196 (1944). Finally, it is well-established that the proper standard for proximate causation in a negligence action is that the negligence must be \u201ca proximate cause\u201d not \u201cthe proximate cause.\u201d <em>Kirby v Larson, </em>400 Mich 585; 256 NW2d 400 (1977). Thus, the burden of proof for proximate causation in traditional medical malpractice cases is analyzed according to its historical common-law definitions and the analysis is the same as in any other ordinary negligence claim. Nothing in this opinion changes or alters these well-settled principles.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">We next consider whether the Court of Appeals erred by relying on <em>Fulton </em>and applying the second sentence of \u00a7 2912a(2) to the present case. The second sentence of \u00a7 2912a(2) provides: \u201cIn an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%. \u201d Since the statute was amended in 1993, litigants and the courts have debated the meaning of this second sentence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While the debate over the meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>second sentence demonstrates that significant questions surround loss-of-opportunity cases, it is clear from the plain language of the statute that the second sentence is intended to apply to loss-of-opportunity cases. Today we address whether the second sentence of \u00a7 2912a(2) also applies to traditional malpractice cases and we unequivocally hold that it does not. Because the Court of Appeals in this case relied on <em>Fulton, </em>which erroneously applied the second sentence to a traditional malpractice case, we review <em>Fulton </em>and determine what, if any, continuing validity it has.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\"><em>Fulton </em>involved a claim for the failure to timely diagnose cervical cancer. The plaintiff, the personal representative of the decedent\u2019s estate, alleged that if decedent\u2019s cancer had been diagnosed during her pregnancy, she would have had treatment options available that could have saved her life. The theory was that the decedent was not diagnosed until her cancer was untreatable and, as a consequence, she died. The plaintiffs expert\u2019s testimony on proximate causation was described by the Court of Appeals as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">Defendants moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(0(10), arguing that plaintiff could not show that their negligence was the cause of Fulton\u2019s death. In response, plaintiff submitted an affidavit from Dr. Taylor, opining that if Fulton\u2019s cancer had been diagnosed while she was pregnant and if she had been treated after her child was delivered, she would have had an eighty-five percent chance to survive. Dr. Taylor opined that when Fulton was actually diagnosed with cancer, her opportunity to survive had decreased to sixty to sixty-five percent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Therefore, according to Dr. Taylor, Fulton\u2019s opportunity to survive the cancer decreased by twenty to twenty-five percent because of defendants\u2019 malpractice. In reply, defendants argued that Dr. Taylor\u2019s affidavit was improper because it contradicted his deposition testimony and that, in any event, this affidavit was not enough to create a question of fact under MCL 600.2912a(2).<footnotemark>[14]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-5\"><em>Fulton </em>opined that because the decedent went from an 85 percent pre-malpractice chance of survival to a 60-65 percent post-malpractice chance of survival, she \u201csuffered a loss of a twenty to twenty-five percent chance of survival.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Fulton determined that a <em>percentage point differential subtraction </em>analysis was required by the statute. As demonstrated by the <em>Fulton </em>analysis, the conclusion is reached by a simplistic subtraction formula. <em>Fulton </em>subtracted the statistical likelihood of a better outcome without treatment from the statistical likelihood of a better outcome with treatment to determine if the resulting number is greater than 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\"><em>Fulton\u2019s </em>simplistic subtraction formula is not an accurate way to determine whether a defendant\u2019s malpractice is a proximate cause of the injury. <em>Fulton\u2019s </em>analysis was erroneous because it misconstrued proximate causation as it applies to a traditional malpractice case. Under the <em>Fulton </em>subtraction formula it is mathematically impossible for there to be more than one proximate cause. Thus, in creating and applying this simplistic formula, <em>Fulton </em>fundamentally altered a plaintiffs burden of proof. <em>Fulton </em>transformed the burden of proof in traditional malpractice cases from <em>a </em>proximate cause to <em>the </em>proximate cause because it allows for only one proximate cause in any case. This proposition is in error because it has no basis in statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>or common law and it is inconsistent with the clear and unambiguous language of the first sentence of \u00a7 2912a(2). Moreover, as the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in this case illustrates, Fulton\u2019s analysis is being applied to all malpractice cases, even when they are pled only as traditional malpractice cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The Court of Appeals, analysis in the present case perpetuates the <em>Fulton </em>doctrine and the confusion surrounding proximate causation in medical malpractice claims. Much of the confusion stems from the inherent nature of medical malpractice: the plaintiff is generally seeking treatment for a preexisting medical condition that is causing a problem of some sort on its own, whereas in an ordinary negligence claim the plaintiff is generally an otherwise uninjured person who is claiming that the entire injury was caused by the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">In the present case, plaintiff was prepared to offer three expert witnesses to testify on his behalf on the issue of proximate causation at the time of trial. Two of plaintiffs experts unequivocally opined, in a discovery deposition, that had the necessary treatment been given, it was more probable than not that plaintiff would not have had a stroke.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Plaintiffs first expert, Dr. Richard Stein, opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\"><em>Q. </em>I just have one question. Doctor, based on the extrapolation of the peds data that you\u2019ve described for us, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, and by that I mean with a greater than 50 percent likelihood, if Dr. Tapazoglou had met the standard of care as you defined it today, would the stroke have been avoided?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\"><em>A. </em>To a reasonable degree of medical certainty, my opinion is yes, and I have already stated the basis for that opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>After opining that an exchange transfusion was necessary to reduce plaintiffs hemoglobin S concentration to less than 30 percent, Dr. John Luce, plaintiffs second expert, opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\"><em>Q. </em>With respect to Mr. O\u2019Neal, if the hemoglobin S had been reduced to less than 30 percent, do you have an opinion as to whether or not he would have had the stroke anyhow?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\"><em>A. </em>I think it is probable that he would not have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\"><em>Q. </em>When you say \u201cprobable,\u201d are you prepared to say more probably than not had Mr. O\u2019Neal had his hemoglobin S reduced to less than 30 percent he would not have had a stroke?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\"><em>A. </em>Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">The testimony of the third expert, Dr. Griffin Rodgers, was more specific in expressing the statistics. The trial court summarized his testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-10\">Dr. Griffin Rodgers, a hematologist, testified that a patient in sickle cell crisis of acute chest syndrome has in the order of 10 or 20 percent chance of developing a stroke. With a timely exchange transfusion, it reduces the risk of stroke to less than 5 or 10 percent. Dr. Griffin\u2019s testimony demonstrates that Plaintiff had more than a 50 percent chance to avoid a stroke.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">As this case demonstrates, the way causation is analyzed is important, especially when reviewing statistical data. In this instance, do these facts represent at best a 20 percent chance to avoid an injury, as the Court of Appeals concluded, or do they establish proximate causation, as found by the trial court? To answer this question we must determine whether we use a <em>percentage point differential subtraction analysis </em>(as used by the Court of Appeals in applying the <em>Fulton </em>formula) or whether we follow the approach taken by the trial court. In doing so we must follow the analysis that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>most consistent with our historical rules governing proximate causation and the plain language of \u00a7 2912a(2), which requires that a plaintiff prove <em>that he or she suffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or </em>defendants, in the context of this case. While the use of mathematical statistics is not required by the statute, and we do not impose such a requirement, we conclude that the analysis used by plaintiffs experts and the trial court represents the correct approach <em>in this instance </em>because it accurately represents the historical view of proximate causation as expressed in the first sentence of \u00a7 2912a(2) <em>based on its application to these facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">In this case, it is undisputed that with or without treatment plaintiff was more probably than not going to avoid the stroke. In other words, even without treatment it was more probable that plaintiff would <em>not </em>have a stroke. However, plaintiff did have a stroke. If the <em>Fulton </em>50 percentage point differential subtraction analysis is used, plaintiff cannot proceed with a traditional claim because the failure to provide treatment was not the cause of the injury expressed in percentage point differential terms. As previously indicated, however, the problem is that a 50 percentage point differential subtraction analysis necessarily means that there can only be <em>one cause of an injury. </em>This analysis is not consistent with the historical test for proximate causation, which has always been that the malpractice be <em>a </em>proximate cause rather than <em>the </em>proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Applying a 50 percentage point differential subtraction analysis requires that we change the traditional analysis of causation in medical malpractice cases to the <em>one </em>most immediate, efficient, and direct cause of the injury. This, however, is the standard for determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>the </em>proximate cause rather than <em>a </em>proximate cause. This approach is simply not in keeping with our historical view of causation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The <em>Fulton </em>approach is incorrect because it requires a reliance on probabilities and possibilities of things that have not yet occurred, rather than reliance on what has actually occurred. Plaintiff in this case <em>did </em>have a stroke and was injured; his claim is for an existing injury, not just the possibility of one. Plaintiffs injury is no longer a statistical probability, it is a reality. The focus, once he was injured, is on the connection between defendants\u2019 conduct and the injury. The relevant inquiry for proximate causation is whether the negligent conduct was a cause of plaintiffs injury and whether plaintiffs injury was a natural and probable result of the negligent conduct. If so, defendants\u2019 conduct was <em>a </em>proximate cause, even though there may have been other causes. The analysis for proximate causation is the same whether we are discussing medical malpractice or ordinary negligence. Defendants\u2019 conduct in this case meets this standard when the defendants\u2019 actual conduct, rather than plaintiffs statistical probability of achieving a better outcome, is the focus of the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In this instance, plaintiff suffered an injury that was more probably than not proximately caused by the negligence of defendants. As the trial court properly found, defendants\u2019 negligent conduct increased plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>tiffs risk of stroke from less than 5 to 10 percent to 10 to 20 percent. When viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the change is from less than 5 percent to 20 percent. As the trial court analyzed, this represents a change that is greater than 50 percent in this instance. The trial court\u2019s approach is in keeping with the historical analysis of proximate causation because it involves a comparative analysis, not a simplistic subtraction formula. Determining what is \u201cmore probable than not\u201d is inherently a comparative analysis. The proper method of determining whether the defendant\u2019s conduct more probably than not proximately caused the injury involves a comparative analysis, which is dependent upon the facts and circumstances and expert opinion in a given case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">We conclude that Fulton\u2019s simple subtraction analysis is wrong and unsupportable. While \u00a7 2912a(2) does not mandate the use of statistics or require any particular mathematical formula, the historical analysis of proximate cause must be followed to wit: the analysis or formulation used cannot require that the cause must be <em>the </em>proximate cause rather than <em>a </em>proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">No single formula can be dispositive for all cases. In this case if we were to use a standard percentage decrease calculation (meaning that defendants were responsible for 15 percentage points out of the 20 total percentage points of plaintiffs risk of the bad result, so that there is a 15/2o chance or 75 percent chance) defendants\u2019 malpractice was a proximate cause of the injury.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Similarly, if the evidence is viewed as a stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>dard percentage increase calculation (meaning that defendants were responsible for 15 percentage points of increase over the 5 percentage points to begin with, thus causing a 300% [15/s] increase in plaintiffs risk of harm) defendants\u2019 malpractice was a proximate cause of the injury.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">It is also important to emphasize that not all traditional medical malpractice cases can or will be expressed in statistical or percentage terms, nor is a plaintiff required to express proximate causation in percentage terms. The plain language of the statute requires that proximate causation in traditional malpractice cases be expressed by showing that the defendant\u2019s conduct was <em>more probably than not </em>a cause of the injury, not by statistical or percentage terms.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Given that <em>Fulton </em>used an incorrect mathematical formula and is being used to transform the burden of proof in traditional malpractice cases, we must next decide if it has any continuing validity. We find that it has none in the context of traditional medical malpractice cases. In <em>Stone, </em>all <em>seven </em>justices of this Court recognized that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number><em>Fulton\u2019s </em>analysis was incorrect or should be found to no longer be good law, though their reasons for doing so varied.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> While I was not a member of this Court when <em>Stone </em>was decided, I also conclude that <em>Fulton </em>did not correctly set forth the burden of proof necessary to establish proximate causation as set forth in \u00a7 2912a(2). As all justices of this Court have concluded that <em>Fulton\u2019s </em>analysis of \u00a7 2912a(2) is wrong, it is illogical to fail to overrule <em>Fulton, </em>because by failing to do so, this Court fosters unnecessary confusion for litigants and the lower courts. Accordingly, we overrule <em>Fulton </em>to the extent that it has led courts to improperly designate what should be traditional medical malpractice claims as loss-of-opportunity claims and has improperly transformed the burden of proof in a traditional malpractice case from <em>a </em>proximate cause to <em>the </em>proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">We emphasize that we hold that the second sentence of \u00a7 2912a(2) applies only to medical malpractice cases that plead loss of opportunity and not to those that plead traditional medical malpractice; we do not address the scope, extent, or nature of loss-of-opportunity claims as that issue is not before us. Significant questions surround such claims.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> However, we decline to decide issues that are not necessary to the resolution of the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">For all the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Court of Appeals erred in the present case by reversing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>the trial court\u2019s denial of summary disposition. The case before us presents a traditional malpractice claim. It does not present a claim for loss of opportunity. In traditional malpractice cases, the plaintiff is required to prove that the defendant\u2019s negligence more probably than not caused the plaintiffs injury. In this case, the testimony of plaintiffs expert witnesses supports plaintiffs position on proximate causation. While that testimony is not dispositive, it is sufficient to raise a question of fact to defeat a motion for summary disposition, allowing the issue to be adjudicated on the merits by the trier of fact. Finally, we overrule <em>Fulton </em>to the extent that it has led courts to improperly designate what should be traditional medical malpractice claims as loss-of-opportunity claims and has improperly transformed the burden of proof in a traditional malpractice case from <em>a </em>proximate cause to <em>the </em>proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this matter to the Court of Appeals for consideration of the issue not decided on appeal in that court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b547-5\">WEAVER, J., concurred with HATHAWAY, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-7\"> The Court of Appeals reasoned: \u201cThis number is the difference between the highest chance plaintiff had of developing a stroke without proper treatment (i.e., 20 percent) and the lowest chance of developing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>stroke with proper treatment (i.e., less than five percent, or in the light most favorable to plaintiff, zero percent).\u201d <em>O\u2019Neal v St John Hosp &amp; Med Ctr, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued November 4, 2008 (Docket Nos. 277317 and 277318), p 5 n 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b532-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b532-9\"> <em>Id. </em>at 4-5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[4]\">\n<p id=\"b533-11\">4 <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[5]\">\n<p id=\"b533-12\">5 <em>O\u2019Neal v St John Hosp &amp; Med Ctr, </em>485 Mich 901 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b533-13\"> <em>Herald Co v Bay City, </em>463 Mich 111, 117; 614 NW2d 873 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b533-14\"> <em>In re Investigation of March 1999 Riots in East Lansing, </em>463 Mich 378, 383; 617 NW2d 310 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b535-8\"> <em>Falcon </em>held that in a wrongful death case a plaintiff could bring a claim for a decedent\u2019s loss of opportunity to survive even if he or she did not meet the traditional proximate causation standard. <em>Falcon </em>reasoned that when the decedent suffered a substantial reduction in the loss of opportunity to survive \u2014 in that case 37.5 percent \u2014 even though the plaintiff could not maintain a traditional malpractice claim for the death itself because the plaintiff could not establish causation, she could bring a claim for loss of opportunity to survive. <em>Falcon </em>also stated that the doctrine applied to wrongful death claims and left the question of whether the doctrine applied to lesser injuries to another day. <em>Falcon </em>436 Mich at 460-462, 469-470 (opinion by Levin, J.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b535-9\"> <em>Stone v Williamson, </em>482 Mich 144, 169; 753 NW2d 106 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b535-10\"> Nothing in our opinion today alters or changes that premise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b536-6\"> <em>Kirby v Larson, </em>400 Mich 585, 600-607; 256 NW2d 400 (1977) (opinion by Williams, J.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b537-6\"> This is true despite the contrary statements in Justice Young\u2019s dissent.

I concur in the result. I agree with the majority that the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment in this case should be reversed because the Court erred by treating this case as a loss-of-opportunity case instead of a traditional medical malpractice case and, as a result, erred by requiring plaintiff to meet the requirements in the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2). I further agree that <em>Fulton v William Beaumont Hosp, </em>253 Mich App 70; 655 NW2d 569 (2002), should be overruled to the extent that courts have relied on it to improperly transform what could be traditional medical malpractice claims into loss-of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>opportunity claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I write separately to express my views on the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">This case raises the issue of what the proper burden of proof for proximate causation is in medical malpractice cases in which the plaintiff had a preexisting risk of the bad result that occurred, even absent the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence. I agree with the lead opinion that the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) is inapplicable to this case because it only applies to loss-of-opportunity claims and this case does not involve a loss-of-opportunity claim. Instead, the key issue in this case is the proper interpretation of the first sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The first sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) clearly provides that a plaintiff in any medical malpractice case, including a traditional medical malpractice case, bears the burden of showing that it is more probable than not that the plaintiffs injury was proximately caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence. Under traditional malpractice law in Michigan, proximate cause includes two prongs: (1) cause in fact and (2) legal, or \u201cproximate,\u201d cause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Skinner v Square D Co, </em>445 Mich 153, 162-163; 516 NW2d 475 (1994). While legal causation relates to the foreseeability of the consequences of the defendant\u2019s conduct, the cause-in-fact prong \u201cgenerally requires showing that \u2018but for\u2019 the defendant\u2019s actions, the plaintiffs injury would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163. The cause-in-fact prong is sometimes also stated as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>requiring that \u201cit is more likely than not that the conduct of the defendant was a cause in fact of the result.\u201d <em>Weymers </em>v <em>Khera, </em>454 Mich 639, 648; 563 NW2d 647 (1997) (quotation marks and citations omitted). Thus, even in cases in which there is statistical evidence that the plaintiff had a risk of the bad result occurring absent negligence,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a plaintiff may still meet the cause-in-fact prong of the proximate causation analysis if the plaintiff can show that it is more probable than not that the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence was a cause in fact of the bad result occurring. I would hold that this threshold is met if the plaintiff can show that the alleged negligence was responsible for a majority, or \u201cmore than fifty percent,\u201d of the risk of the bad result occurring. See MCL 600.2912a(2) and <em>Falcon v Mem Hosp, </em>436 Mich 443, 450; 462 NW2d 44 (1990).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Under this approach, a court should consider the total risk of the bad result that the plaintiff faced, including the risk caused by the alleged negligence. Then, the court should consider how much of that risk was created by the negligence. If the negligence was responsible for more than half of the total risk of the bad result and the plaintiff suffered that bad result, then the cause-in-fact prong of the proximate cause analysis is met because it is more probable than not that the defendant\u2019s negligence was a cause in fact of the bad result.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This approach is consis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>tent with the statutory language \u201cmore probable than not\u201d and with the historical approach to proximate causation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>In adopting this approach, I reject the view that a plaintiff must show that the defendant\u2019s negligence increased the plaintiffs risk by more than 50 <em>percentage points, </em>e.g., from 25 percent to 76 percent, or from 10 percent to 61 percent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As noted by the lead opinion, this approach is inconsistent with the historical approach to proximate causation. It is also inconsistent with the first sentence in MCL 600.2912a(2) because it would preclude traditional medical malpractice claims in many cases in which the defendant\u2019s negligence was more probably than not a cause in fact of the bad result, such as in a case in which the negligence increased the risk of a bad result from 5 percent to 45 percent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> I also reject the lead opinion\u2019s \u201cpercent-increase\u201d test because it is similarly inconsistent with a more-probable-than-not standard. The fact that a negligent act caused a 50 percent increase in the risk of a bad result does not demonstrate that it is more probable than not that the negligence was a cause in fact of the bad result.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>In this case, plaintiff presented sufficient facts to establish the cause-in-fact prong of the proximate cause analysis in a traditional medical malpractice claim. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, plaintiffs expert testified that defendants\u2019 alleged negligence increased plaintiffs risk of the bad result, the stroke, from 5 percent to 20 percent. Defendants were thus responsible for 15 percentage points out of the total 20 percentage points of plaintiffs risk of the bad result, meaning that there is a 15/ao chance, or 75 percent chance, that defendants\u2019 alleged negligence was a cause in fact of the bad result.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, plaintiff has presented evidence sufficient to support his allegation that it is \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that defendants\u2019 negligence was a cause in fact of the stroke occurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I concur with the lead opinion that the judgment of the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>should be reversed.

Now my chances of rolling a number one are 3 out of 6 (or <em>lli). </em>If I actually roll a number one, there is a <em>2/s </em>(approximately 67 percent) chance that I rolled a number one that was created by the defendant\u2019s negligence. Therefore, there is a more than 50 percent chance that I rolled a number one because of the defendant\u2019s negligence, i.e., it is more probable than not that the defendant\u2019s negligence was a cause in fact of the result. Notably, this analysis will differ somewhat if the plaintiffs increased risk of the bad result is alleged to have been caused by multiple negligent actors, depending on the timing and the interaction of the various causes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b550-7\"> Justice Young haphazardly concludes that \u201cthe majority\u201d is extending the exception to the cause-in-fact prong created in <em>Falcon </em>to all medical malpractice claims. I agree that <em>Falcon </em>created what was essentially an exception to this rule, but I fail to see, and Justice Young utterly fails to explain, how my approach in this case is an extension of that rule to all traditional medical malpractice cases. Justice Young himself explains that \u201c[i]n cases in which the plaintiff alleges that the defendant\u2019s negligence more probably than not caused the injury, the claim is one of simple medical malpractice [as opposed to Ioss-of-opportunity].\u201d (Quotation marks and citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Setting aside the numerous pages of Justice Young\u2019s opinion that consist only of irrelevant, hyperbolic, or unsubstantiated commentary, he appears to raise only two substantive concerns with my approach, and neither provides support for his conclusion that it does not satisfy the cause-in-fact prong. First, he irrelevantly notes that, as I concede in footnote 7, this approach is inconsistent with an example I used in <em>Stone. </em>Second, he alleges that I should not have compared the <em>low </em>end of the possible range of plaintiffs risk of the bad result absent negligence to the <em>high </em>end of the range of plaintiffs risk with negligence. I think that my approach is perfectly consistent with our charge to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, given that even Justice Young explains that the experts testified that plaintiffs risk was somewhere <em>between </em>the ranges the experts provided. But regardless, this criticism only challenges which numbers to use and not the merits of the approach itself, and it would be possible, as Justice Young prefers, to instead compare the low ends of the ranges, or the high ends, only to each other. For example, if the alleged negligence increased a plaintiffs risk of the bad result from 5 to 10 percent to 30 to 40 percent, then, regardless of which numbers are compared, the negligence would have been responsible for a majority of the plaintiffs risk of the bad result, and, given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>that the bad result occurred, it would be more probable than not that the negligence was a cause in fact of the bad result occurring. Justice Young fails to address why this logic is incorrect or levy a criticism that actually supports his conclusion that my approach eviscerates the cause-in-fact requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\"> To the extent that I endorsed the percentage point approach by way of an example in my opinion in <em>Stone, </em>I repudiate that position. See <em>Stone, </em>482 Mich at 177 (opinion by Cavanagh, J.), stating that a plaintiff whose chance of survival decreased from 80 to 40 percent could not bring a traditional malpractice claim because it would not amount to a 50 percent change.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b551-9\"> In this example, the defendant was responsible for 40 percentage points of the plaintiffs risk, out of a total of 45 percentage points, meaning that there is a 40 out of 45 chance, or 4%5 (approximately 89 percent) chance, that the defendant\u2019s negligence was a cause in fact of the bad outcome. In contrast, under the percentage-point approach, the plaintiffs burden would not have been met because the increase in risk was 40 percentage <em>points.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b551-10\"> For example, if a defendant\u2019s negligence caused an increase in a plaintiffs risk of a bad result from 10 percent to 15 percent, this would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>be a 50 percent increase in risk. But it is not more probable than not that the defendant\u2019s negligence was a cause in fact because the defendant would only have been responsible for five out of the total 15 percentage points of the plaintiffs risk of the bad result, meaning that there is only a 5/15 chance, or an approximately 33 percent chance, that the negligence was a cause in fact of the bad result. As I explain in footnote 4, however, the plaintiff could still pursue a loss-of-opportunity claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\"> Although this formulation is mathematically identical to Justice Markman\u2019s approach, there are very important differences in how we view its utility. I favor adopting it because it is consistent with the more-probable-than-not standard in the <em>first </em>sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) as applied to traditional medical malpractice claims in which the plaintiff had a risk of the bad result even absent negligence. In contrast, Justice Makkman believes it is required by the <em>second </em>sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) and, unlike myself, believes that all medical malpractice claims in which there was a risk of the bad result occurring even absent negligence should be treated as loss-of-opportunity claims, regardless of whether the plaintiff can meet the burden of proof for a traditional medical malpractice claim. As explained in my concurring opinion in <em>Stone, </em>I continue to think that Justice Markman\u2019s interpretation is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s text and Michigan law, including <em>Falcon.

Therefore, I agree with the majority that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed and this case should be remanded to the Court of Appeals for it to consider defendants\u2019 remaining issue on appeal, i.e., the admissibility of the expert testimony proffered by plaintiff. However, I strongly disagree with the analysis of the majority and believe that it will lead to confusion and unnecessary litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">I.

That is, the difference between the plaintiffs premalpractice chance to achieve a better result and the plaintiffs postmalpractice chance to achieve a better result must be greater than 50 percentage points. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In <em>Stone v Williamson, </em>482 Mich 144; 753 NW2d 106 (2008), although all seven justices concluded that <em>Fulton </em>was wrongly decided, this Court could not overrule <em>Fulton </em>because, while four justices concluded that <em>Fulton </em>was a lost-opportunity case, six justices concluded that <em>Stone </em>was not a lost-opportunity case. See <em>id. </em>at 164 n 14 (opinion by TAYLOR, C.J.) (\u201c[BJecause a majority of justices hold that this is not a lost-opportunity case, the issue of the correctness of <em>Fulton </em>cannot be reached, and <em>Fulton\u2019s </em>approach remains undisturbed as the method of analyzing lost-opportunity cases.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number><em>Stone, </em>Chief Justice TAYLOR and Justices CORRIGAN and YOUNG concluded that the loss-of-an-opportunity provision is \u201cunenforceable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147 (opinion by Taylor, C.J.). They concluded that if the plaintiff\u2019s premalpractice opportunity to achieve a better result was greater than 50 percent, the plaintiff could bring a traditional medical-malpractice action. However, if the plaintiff\u2019s premalpractice opportunity to achieve a better result was 50 percent or less, the plaintiff could not bring a traditional medical-malpractice action or a lost-opportunity action because lost-opportunity actions are no longer allowed under the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Justices CAVANAGH, KELLY, and WEAVER concluded in <em>Stone </em>that if the percentage point difference between the plaintiff\u2019s premalpractice opportunity to achieve a better result and his postmalpractice opportunity to achieve a better result was greater than 50 percentage points, the plaintiff could bring a traditional medical-malpractice action. However, if the percentage point difference was 50 points or less, the plaintiff could only bring a lost-opportunity action and would have to prove that his premalpractice opportunity to achieve a better result was greater than 50 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Finally, in <em>Stone, </em>I concluded that a lost-opportunity case is \u201cone in which it is at least possible that the bad outcome would have occurred even if the patient had received proper treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186 (opinion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>MARKMAN, J.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I further concluded that in order for a lost-opportunity plaintiff to prevail, he must prove that his lost opportunity was greater than 50 percent.

PROBLEMS WITH <em>FULTON</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">As I observed in <em>Stone, </em>the first problem with <em>Fulton </em>is that it requires a loss of more than 50 <em>percentage points, </em>while MCL 600.2912a(2) requires a loss of more than 50 <em>percent.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Fulton . .. </em>concluded that because the plaintiffs premalpractice chance of survival was 85 percent and her postmalpractice chance of survival was 60 percent to 65 percent, her \u201clost opportunity\u201d was 20 percent to 25 percent and, thus, because the plaintiffs \u201clost opportunity\u201d was not greater than 50 percent, she could not recover under MCL 600.2912a(2). However, <em>Fulton </em>did not offer any explanation as to why it merely subtracted the postmalpractice chance from the premalpractice chance to determine the \u201clost opportunity.\u201d This might have been the correct method of determining the \u201clost opportunity\u201d if MCL 600.2912a(2) required that such a loss be \u201cgreater than 50 percentage points.\u201d However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>MCL 600.2912a(2) requires that the \u201clost opportunity\u201d be \u201cgreater than 50%.\u201d There is a significant distinction between 50 percentage points and 50 percent. As Dr. Roy Waddell, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon in Grand Rapids, has explained: \u201cA decrease in survival rate from 50 percent to 10 percent is a <em>40-percentage-point </em>decrease, but it is an 80 <em>percent </em>decrease.\u201d Waddell, <em>A doctor\u2019s view of \u201copportunity to survive\u2019\u2019: Fulton\u2019s assumptions and math are wrong, </em>86 Mich B J 32, 33 (March 2007) (emphasis in original). Similarly, a reduction in wages from $5 an hour to $1 an hour is not a 4 percent reduction in wages; rather, it is an 80 percent reduction in wages. <em>[Id. </em>at 196 (emphasis in the original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">As I also observed in my opinion in <em>Stone, </em>Justice CAVANAGH made this same mistake in his opinion in <em>Stone:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">Like the Court of Appeals in <em>Fulton, </em>Justice CAVANAGH offers no explanation as to why he repeatedly calculates the \u201clost opportunity\u201d in terms of the percentage points lost rather than the actual percentage lost when MCL 600.2912a(2) clearly states that the \u201clost opportunity\u201d must be \u201cgreater than 50%,\u201d not greater than 50 percentage points. These statistical concepts are utterly distinct. <em>[Id. </em>at 196 n 11.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">I am pleased that Justice CAVANAGH and the other justices who signed his opinion in <em>Stone </em>(Chief Justice KELLY and Justice WEAVER) now apparently recognize this analytical error, and that they now \u201crepudiate\u201d that position. Thus, a majority of the justices of this Court now agree that MCL 600.2912a(2) requires us to determine whether the lost opportunity is \u201cgreater than 50%, \u201d not whether the lost opportunity is greater than 50 percentage points.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The other problem with <em>Fulton, </em>which Justice CAVANAGH and his colleagues in the majority also now apparently recognize, is that \u201cit does not differentiate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>between those patients who would have survived regardless of whether they received proper or improper treatment and those patients who needed the proper treatment in order to survive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As I observed in <em>Stone:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">Such a differentiation is necessary because only those in the latter group have truly suffered a \u201clost opportunity\u201d as a result of the improper treatment. That is, if a patient would have survived regardless of whether he received proper or improper treatment, the improper treatment cannot be said to have caused him to lose an opportunity to survive. On the other hand, if the patient would have survived only if he had received the proper treatment, the improper treatment <em>can </em>be said to have caused him to lose an opportunity to survive. MCL 600.2912a(2) requires us to determine whether the patient more likely than not fell into the latter category rather than the former category, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>because the statute only allows a plaintiff to recover for a \u201closs of an opportunity\u201d that was \u201cgreater than 50%\u201d and that was \u201ccaused by the negligence of the defendant.. ..\u201d Dr. Waddell\u2019s calculation does just that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">(Premalpractice chance) - (Postmalpractice chance)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">100 - (Postmalpractice chance)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The quotient resulting from this numerator and denominator is then multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage. This number must be \u201cgreater than 50%\u201d in order to satisfy the requirement of the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2). For instance, if the patient\u2019s premalpractice chance to achieve abetter result was 80 percent and, as a result of the defendant\u2019s malpractice, the patient\u2019s postmalpractice chance is reduced to 20 percent, the patient has suffered a 75 percent loss of an opportunity to survive.<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">What the Waddell formula essentially does is test the sufficiency of the expert testimony, which is typically presented in the form of two statistics: the likelihood that a patient would have had a good outcome with proper treatment (the \u201c[premalpractice chance]\u201d) and the likelihood that a patient would have had a good outcome with negligent treatment (the \u201c[postmalpractice chance]\u201d). The Waddell formula allows a court analyzing this data to determine whether the plaintiff, when the patient has experienced a bad outcome, has created a question of material fact concerning whether proper treatment more likely them not would have made a difference. The formula does this by identifying the universe of patients who would have had a bad outcome (the denominator) and the subset of those patients who could have been favorably treated (the numerator).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">It is easiest to start with the formula\u2019s denominator. This denominator consists of the universe of all patients who would have had a bad outcome, for whatever reason. This group includes two subsets of patients: those who would have had a bad outcome because they received negligent treatment, and those who would have had a bad outcome despite receiving proper treatment. The formula <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>identifies this group by subtracting from 100 the percentage of patients who would have had a good outcome even without proper treatment; in other words, it subtracts the \u201c[postmalpractice chance]\u201d from 100. In this way, a court can take the expert\u2019s statistics and identify those patients who were not treated properly and who experienced a bad outcome. A patient who is the subject of a medical-malpractice action is a member of this group. But we cannot determine whether the patient is a member of this group because he or she was denied the proper treatment or because he or she would have suffered a bad outcome even with proper treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">One more calculation must then be made in order to answer the dispositive question posed by the statute: whether it is more likely than not that the patient would have benefited from proper treatment or, put another way, whether the \u201copportunity to survive or. .. to achieve a better result\u201d was \u201cgreater than 50%.\u201d MCL 600.2912a(2). A court has to determine what percentage of those patients with a bad outcome (those patients in the denominator) would have benefited from treatment. This brings us to the Waddell formula\u2019s numerator. The numerator consists of those patients who would have had a bad outcome only if they had been negligently treated. It is calculated by subtracting the \u201c[postmalpractice chance]\u201d from the \u201c[premalpractice chance],\u201d thus identifying those patients who required treatment to avoid a bad outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Once the numerator and denominator have been calculated, comparison of these two numbers by their quotient allows a court to reasonably determine whether improper treatment more likely than not made a difference in the patient\u2019s outcome. If the number of patients who would have had a bad outcome only if they had been negligently treated (the numerator) comprises more than half of the number of patients who would have had a bad outcome overall (the denominator), then the plaintiff has established that proper treatment more likely than not would have made a difference. In other words, when this has been shown, the plaintiff has created a question of material fact concerning whether the \u201copportunity\u201d \u2014 the benefit that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>would have been realized by a group of patients from the treatment that was not given to this specific patient \u2014 was greater than 50 percent. Such a plaintiff has presented adequate expert testimony to establish a \u201clost opportunity\u201d cause of action within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">As Dr. Waddell has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">\u201c[T]he intent of the law is to disallow damages unless it can be shown that <em>proper treatment creates a better than even </em>(\u201cgreater than 50%\u201d) <em>chance of survival of the patients who would have died without treatment. </em>In other words, if appropriate treatment <em>cannot </em>save at least half of the patients who otherwise would have died, then you do not have sufficient evidence to show that the negligence made the difference in the adverse outcome (death). Conversely, if good treatment <em>can </em>save more than half of the patients who otherwise would have died, then you have adequate evidence that the poor treatment or negligence was likely to blame for the bad outcome. This is exactly what this definition of opportunity measures.\u201d [Waddell, 86 Mich B J at 33 (emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">MCL 600.2912a(2) only allows a plaintiff to recover for a \u201closs of an opportunity\u201d that was \u201cgreater than 50%\u201d and that was \u201ccaused by the negligence of the defendant . . . .\u201d Use of Dr. Waddell\u2019s formula, which generates the actual percentage lost rather than the number of percentage points lost, and excludes those who would have achieved a good result regardless of the malpractice, best ensures, in my judgment, that these statutory requirements are satisfied. That is, this calculation would impose liability, in accordance with MCL 600.2912a(2), in those instances in which the medical care received more likely than not affected whether the patient survived. <em>[Id. </em>at 197-202.]</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">III. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">In the instant case, plaintiff alleged that defendants failed to timely and properly treat his acute chest syndrome, a serious complication of sickle-cell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>disease, and that, as a result, he suffered a stroke. More specifically, plaintiff alleged that defendants should have performed an exchange blood transfusion in which the patient\u2019s abnormal blood is taken out and replaced with normal blood, rather than a simple blood transfusion in which normal blood is simply added to the patient\u2019s abnormal blood.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Plaintiffs expert witness testified that there was a 10 to 20 percent chance of stroke without proper treatment, but that with proper treatment there would have been only a 5 to 10 percent chance of stroke. In other words, with proper treatment plaintiff had a 90 to 95 or more percent chance of not suffering a stroke, and without proper treatment he had an 80 to 90 percent chance of not suffering a stroke. That is, plaintiffs premalpractice chance to achieve a better result was, at best, 95 percent, and his postmalpractice chance was, at worst, 80 percent. Pursuant to the Waddell calculation, plaintiff lost a 75 percent opportunity to achieve a better result:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Therefore, plaintiff has raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether he suffered a greater than 50 percent loss of an opportunity under MCL 600.2912a(2). For these reasons, I agree with the majority that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed and this case should be remanded to the Court of Appeals for it to consider defendants\u2019 remaining issue on appeal, i.e., the admissibility of the expert witness testimony proffered by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>IV MAJORITY\u2019S ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Although I agree with the majority that the Court of Appeals should be reversed, I strongly disagree with its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">A. LOST OPPORTUNITY VS. TRADITIONAL MEDICAL MALPRACTICE</p>\n<p id=\"Aot\">1. GREATER-THAN-50-PERCENT REQUIREMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">On the one hand, the majority concludes that whether the plaintiffs lost opportunity is greater than 50 percent determines whether the plaintiffs action is a lost-opportunity action or a traditional medical-malpractice action. I find this conclusion to be completely illogical. Either the defendant\u2019s negligence has caused the plaintiff to suffer the injury, or it has caused the plaintiff to suffer a loss of an opportunity to achieve a better result\u2014 the better result being not to suffer the injury. How substantial the plaintiffs lost opportunity is determines whether he satisfies the \u201cgreater than 50%\u201d requirement of MCL 600.2912a(2), not whether the plaintiffs action constitutes a lost-opportunity action in the first place. As I stated in <em>Stone:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">In order to satisfy traditional medical-malpractice action requirements, there must be no question that the proper treatment would have resulted in a good outcome (at least with regard to the specific injury suffered by the patient), because if there is any chance that a patient who received proper treatment might nevertheless have suffered the specific bad outcome ultimately suffered by the patient, it cannot be proved that the improper treatment caused the bad outcome. If there is any chance that the proper treatment could have resulted in the bad outcome, the chances of a good outcome with proper treatment and the chances of a good outcome with improper treatment must be compared. That is, under those circumstances, although the plaintiff cannot prove that the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>malpractice caused the bad outcome because the bad outcome might have occurred even with proper treatment, the plaintiff may be able to prove that the defendant\u2019s malpractice increased the patient\u2019s chances of obtaining a bad outcome and, thus, caused him or her to suffer a \u201clost opportunity\u201d to achieve a better result. This is the only coherent concept of a \u201clost opportunity\u201d cause of action under MCL 600.2912a(2). <em>[Stone, </em>482 Mich at 271 (opinion by Markman, J.).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Because it is possible that the bad outcome in this case, i.e., suffering a stroke, might have occurred <em>even if </em>plaintiff had received proper treatment, the instant case constitutes a lost-opportunity action.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">2. PLAINTIFF\u2019S PLEADINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">On the other hand, the lead opinion concludes that \u201cthe second sentence of \u00a7 2912a(2) applies only to medical malpractice cases that plead loss of opportunity and not to those that plead traditional medical malpractice . . . . \u201d That is, the lead opinion concludes that whether the plaintiffs action constitutes a lost-opportunity action or a traditional medical-malpractice action is a function of whether the plaintiff has used the magic words \u201clost opportunity\u201d in his pleading. If he did not, the action is a traditional medical-malpractice action and the plaintiff need not concern himself with satisfying the greater-than-50percent requirement of MCL 600.2912a(2). However, if the plaintiff <em>did </em>use the words \u201clost opportunity\u201d in his pleading, the action <em>is </em>a lost-opportunity action and the plaintiff must satisfy the greater-than-50percent requirement of MCL 600.2912a(2). Besides being utterly inconsistent with the majority\u2019s own conclusion that a lost opportunity greater than 50 percent determines whether the plaintiff\u2019s action constitutes a lost-opportunity action or a traditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>medical-malpractice action, it is also inconsistent with the well-established principle that Michigan courts are \u201cnot bound by a party\u2019s choice of label for its action [because this would] put form over substance . ...\u201d <em>St Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins Co v Littky, </em>60 Mich App 375, 378-379; 230 NW2d 440 (1975). Instead, as we explained in <em>Maiden v Rozwood, </em>461 Mich 109, 135; 597 NW2d 817 (1999), \u201cthe gravamen of plaintiff\u2019s action is determined by considering the <em>entire </em>claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Thus, just as whether a plaintiff labels an action as an ordinary negligence action does not control whether that action is, in fact, an ordinary negligence action or a medical-malpractice action, see <em>Bryant v Oakpointe Villa Nursing Ctr, Inc, </em>471 Mich 411; 684 NW2d 864 (2004), whether a plaintiff labels an action as a traditional medical-malpractice action or a lost-opportunity action cannot control whether the plaintiffs action is, in fact, a traditional medical-malpractice action or a lost-opportunity action. This established principle ensures that the governing <em>law, </em>and not the label the parties attach to that law, controls the outcome of an action. As the United States Supreme Court' has observed, any other approach would allow a party to avoid the requirements of a legislative mandate simply by artful pleading. See <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp v Lueck, </em>471 US 202, 211; 105 S Ct 1904; 85 L Ed 2d 206 (1985). Yet this is exactly what the lead opinion would allow a plaintiff to do in relation to the requirements of MCL 600.2912a(2). Apparently, according to the justices joining the lead opinion, all a plaintiff need do to avoid the \u201cgreater than 50%\u201d requirement in MCL 600.2912a(2) is to omit the words \u201clost opportunity\u201d in his complaint. Thus, no artfulness is even required to nullify this particular statute under their theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Indeed, in light of the lead opinion, the discussions in the various opinions in this case concerning appropriate formulas for determining loss of opportunity seem pointless. For what plaintiff, and what competent plaintiffs attorney, would ever plead a lost-opportunity claim if it could be so easily avoided? Simply put, under the lead opinion\u2019s rule, would the lost-opportunity doctrine enacted by the Legislature even continue to exist as a viable legal doctrine in this state? Would a court have any power to apply the actual law, or would it be required to participate in a charade of the plaintiffs (and the lead opinion\u2019s) making? As an example, could a public official plaintiff avoid having to prove actual malice in a defamation case by simply leaving the words \u201cpublic official\u201d out of his pleading? Could a plaintiff suing a public entity entitled to governmental immunity avoid such immunity by simply omitting that the defendant is a public entity from his pleading? Could an independent contractor transmute himself into an employee by simply asserting such in his pleading?</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">B. WHICHEVER FORMULA BEST SERVES THE PLAINTIFF</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The lead opinion offers no explanation, and I can think of none, to support its alternative \u201cstandard percentage increase calculation\u201d formula, other than the fact the justices signing the lead opinion believe that it somehow indicates that plaintiff has suffered a <em>300 percent </em>loss of an opportunity! However, none of this really seems to matter to the justices signing the lead opinion because in the end they conclude that MCL 600.2912a(2) does not require \u201cany particular mathematical formula,\u201d and that if \u201ceither calculation,\u201d or, indeed, some other yet-to-be-discovered calculation, demonstrates a greater than 50 percent lost opportunity, the plaintiffs case may proceed, because \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>results must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d This is simply nonsensical. Although it is true that <em>evidence </em>is to be viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, <em>Dressel v Ameribank, </em>468 Mich 557, 561; 664 NW2d 151 (2003), which, as in this case, will almost invariably be the plaintiff, this is the first I have heard of a judicially created rule that we are to construe an unambiguous <em>law </em>in a light most favorable to one side or the other. Needless to say, and for reasons that are apparent, the lead opinion does not bother to cite any authority in support of such a rule. Is there some logical reason for this rule other than an apparent desire by the lead justices to place a finger on the scales of justice on behalf of the plaintiff class? Is this rule limited to lost-opportunity cases or is it equally applicable to all medical-malpractice actions? Why is such a rule appropriate in a lost-opportunity case, but not in other realms of the civil law? When is such a default interpretation of the law warranted, and when is it not? If the law does not require \u201cany particular formula,\u201d why does the lead opinion devote such attention to identifying the two formulas that it does identify? Why not just devise a third formula under which the plaintiff will <em>always </em>prevail? Could it possibly be that the lead justices may be confusing their own personal political philosophies with the dictates of the actual law that they pledged to uphold?<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>v CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">As I summarized in <em>Stone:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">A \u201clost opportunity\u201d action is one in which it is possible that the bad outcome would have occurred even if the patient had received proper treatment. On the other hand, if there is no question that the proper treatment would have resulted in a good outcome and the patient has suffered a bad outcome, the plaintiff possesses a traditional medical-malpractice action. In order for a traditional medical-malpractice plaintiff to prevail, the plaintiff must prove that the bad outcome was more probably than not caused by the defendant\u2019s malpractice. In order for a \u201clost opportunity\u201d plaintiff to prevail, the plaintiff must prove that the \u201clost opportunity\u201d to achieve a better result was more probably than not caused by the defendant\u2019s malpractice and that the \u201clost opportunity\u201d was greater than 50 percent. In order to determine whether the \u201clost opportunity\u201d was greater than 50 percent, the postmalpractice chance of obtaining a better result must be subtracted from the premalpractice chance; the postmalpractice chance must then be subtracted from 100; the former number must be divided by the latter number; and then this quotient must be multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage. The calculation can be summarized as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">(Premalpractice chance) - (Postmalpractice chance)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">100 - (Postmalpractice chance)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">If this percentage is greater than 50, the plaintiff may be able to prevail; if this percentage is 50 or less, then the plaintiff cannot prevail. <em>[Stone, </em>482 Mich at 218-219 (opinion by Markman, J.).]<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>As discussed earlier, because it is possible that the bad outcome in this case, i.e., suffering a stroke, would have occurred even if plaintiff had received proper treatment, the instant case is, in fact, a lost-opportunity action, and because plaintiff has raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether he suffered a greater than 50 percent loss of an opportunity under MCL 600.2912a, I agree with the majority that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed and this case should be remanded to the Court of Appeals for it to consider defendants\u2019 remaining issue on appeal, i.e., the admissibility of the expert witness testimony proffered by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">However, I emphatically disagree with the majority\u2019s incoherent analysis and the implications of such analysis. The majority effectively transforms a lost-opportunity action into a traditional medical-malpractice action, for no other apparent reason than to afford plaintiffs larger potential recoveries. Instead of limiting a plaintiffs recovery to the <em>opportunity </em>that he or she may have lost as a result of the defendant\u2019s negligence, the majority now expands the plaintiffs recovery to include potentially all damages related to his medical condition, even though the plaintiff may well have suffered the condition even had he received <em>perfect </em>medical treatment. Thus, having already undermined the Legislature\u2019s attempt at medical-malpractice reform, see, e.g., <em>Bush v Shabahang, </em>484 Mich 156; 772 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>NW2d 272 (2009); <em>Potter v McLeary, </em>484 Mich 397; 774 NW2d 1 (2009); and ADM File No. 2009-13, 485 Mich cclxxv (order entered February 16, 2010, amending MCR 2.112 and 2.118), the majority now embarks upon transforming medical-malpractice law in exactly the opposite direction of that sought by the Legislature. At the same time, the differing formulas, and non-formulas, adopted by the majority, as well as the internal inconsistencies in its analysis, will only produce more confusion in an already confused area of the law, and more litigation in an already heavily litigated area of the law. The clearest principle of law that can be gleaned from the lead opinion is also the least <em>principled </em>of its asserted principles \u2014 the adoption of whichever formula best serves the plaintiff. Not much more than this \u201cprinciple\u201d really needs to be understood concerning the essence of the lead opinion\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<judges id=\"b572-4\">CORRIGAN, J., concurred with MARKMAN, J., with respect to parts IV(A)(2) and (B).</judges>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b556-6\">1 For a discussion of the common law that existed before the enactment of this statutory provision, see my opinion concurring in the result in <em>Stone v Williamson, </em>482 Mich 144; 753 NW2d 106 (2008) (opinion by Maekman, J.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b556-7\"> As I did in <em>Stone, </em>I use the term \u201cpremalpractice chance\u201d to refer to the plaintiffs chance to survive or achieve a better result with proper treatment, and the term \u201cpostmalpractice chance\u201d to refer to the plaintiffs chance to survive or achieve a better result without proper treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b556-8\"> Because a majority of justices now believes that neither <em>Fulton </em>nor the instant case are lost-opportunity cases, <em>Fulton </em>is now apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>overruled at least with regard to the determination concerning whether a case is a traditional medical-malpractice action or a lost-opportunity action.

Given Justice Cavanagh\u2019s forcefid criticisms of my formula in <em>Stone, </em>it is encouraging that we are now in agreement on this critical point. See, e.g., <em>Stone, </em>482 Mich at 183-184 (opinion by Cavanagh, J.) (\u201cthe Waddell formula [which I adopted in <em>Stone </em>and to which I continue to adhere] is blatantly inconsistent with the language of MCL 600.2912a(2)\u201d; \u201c[i]t is inconceivable that Justice Markman can read the [statute] and conclude that it should be translated into this formula\u201d; \u201c[t]he approach taken by Justice Markman and Dr. Waddell requires [the statute] to be rewritten\u201d; \u201cthe Waddell approach leads to such anomalous results that it cannot possibly reflect the intention of the Legislature\u201d). While Justice Cavanagh is correct that he employs the formula to determine whether plaintiffs cause of action is a traditional medical-malpractice action or a lost-opportunity action, and I use it to determine whether plaintiff has satisfied the greater-than-50-percent requirement, we agree nonetheless that the number produced by the formula represents the opportunity that the plaintiff lost as a result of the defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[6]\">\n<p id=\"b561-10\">6 80-20/100-20 x 100 = 75%</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b564-10\"> An exchange blood transfusion was not performed until <em>after </em>plaintiff suffered a stroke.

Do the justices signing the lead opinion also support Justice Cavanagh\u2019s dissent in <em>People v Gardner, </em>482 Mich 41; 753 NW2d 78 (2008), or any one of his other random dissents? Given that three justices previously supported Justices Cavanagh\u2019s partial dissent in <em>Wickens </em>(Chief Justice Kelly and Justices Cavanagh and Weaver), by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>indicating that she now supports it Justice Hathaway seems to be signaling that there is now majority support in favor of his position in that case. Unfortunately, this type of behavior seems to have become the new majority\u2019s modus operandi \u2014 unnecessarily sowing uncertainty, doubt, and confusion into the law by gratuitously questioning prior cases decided by the former majority.

And, pursuant to <em>Fulton, </em>a lost-opportunity plaintiff must prove that the difference between his premalpractice chance of achieving a better result and his postmalpractice chance of achieving a better result is greater than 50 <em>percentage points. </em>Neither of these conclusions is, to say the least, consistent with my own reading of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-6\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b572-5\">CORRIGAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-3\">(dissenting).

Here, not only do my colleagues in the \u201cnew majority\u201d destroy the doctrinal integrity of medical malpractice law, they do so in highly fractured opinions that will require a Venn diagram for the bench and bar to construct the points at which four of them agree on any governing principle of law. The new majority has thus made it more difficult to determine what it has done today. Perhaps this is intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Chaos and confusion in the law only promote <em>more </em>litigation. The decisions the new majority has issued today in this case will thus benefit <em>only </em>those who profit from litigating medical malpractice cases. The rest of us desire to know what legal rules control our rights and obligations, and we desire and deserve to know them <em>before </em>we act. The citizens of this state are entitled to that kind of clarity in the decisions from the state\u2019s senior court, not the disorder this Court has sown today. Today\u2019s decision returns this Court to an era in which the bench and bar must decipher this Court\u2019s split opinions in order to figure out what principles of law they collectively articulate. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is no small challenge to respond in dissent to the various opinions that shred our medical malpractice laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Despite the Legislature\u2019s codification of the traditional obligation to prove that alleged malpractice \u201cmore probably than not\u201d caused a plaintiffs injury,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 20 years ago, in <em>Falcon v Mem Hosp, </em>this Court waded into the realm of policy-making and judicially created the lost opportunity doctrine as an exception to the traditional and statutorily codified causation standard of proof.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even after the Legislature subsequently recognized the lost opportunity doctrine,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it also expressly retained the traditional requirement that \u201c[i]n an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that he or she suffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or defendants.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Until today, this Court has always made clear that when a <em>traditional </em>medical malpractice claim was at issue, the more-probable-than-not standard of causation applied and required the plaintiff to \u201c \u2018exclude other reasonable hypotheses with a fair amount of certainty.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, as the Court did in <em>Falcon, </em>today the majority makes a radical transformation of medical malpractice law and again jettisons traditional causation doctrine by equating <em>causation </em>of the injury with <em>risk </em>of the injury. But, unlike in <em>Falcon, </em>the new majority here does not recognize merely an <em>exception </em>to the traditional malpractice requirement of \u201cbut for\u201d causation, <em>it essentially eliminates the traditional rule entirely by importing that exception into all malpractice cases. </em>In declaring this case to be a \u201ctraditional\u201d medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>cal malpractice claim, the new majority applies the relaxed causation rules that previously had applied <em>only </em>to lost opportunity claims. After today, therefore, <em>all </em>malpractice claims will be treated under relaxed causation principles previously applied only to lost opportunity claims. This is a tectonic shift in our law, for which there is no basis but the preference of the justices in the new majority to foster more legal chaos that will promote litigation in this area of the law. This shift is significant because a traditional medical malpractice injury creates liability for <em>the entire injury, </em>while a lost opportunity claim creates liability only for that portion of the increased risk of injury attributable to a defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Make no mistake: Although Justice CAVANAGH feigns that he is unaware of the significant change in the law being made in this case, the reduced burden of persuasion and the broader scope of damages permitted is the reason the new majority now applies lost opportunity causation principles to <em>all </em>medical malpractice claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Rather than attempting to give meaning to the words of the statute at issue in this case, the new majority performs a spectacularly hubristic feat in treating a statutory medical malpractice claim as though it were a mere matter of common law and thus subject to its revisionary powers. What is more, these justices have decided to use those extraconstitutional powers to circumvent the Legislature\u2019s explicit decision to retain traditional causation rules. The new majority has cho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>sen \u201cfree form\u201d to change the law to match its policy preference that no legal doctrines shall exist to eliminate <em>any </em>claim of medical malpractice \u2014 even those doctrines codified by our Legislature to accomplish this very goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">For someone who campaigned on the theme that more of this Court\u2019s precedent should be preserved,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we are surprised at how eagerly Justice HATHAWAY has striven in this case to overturn precedent \u2014 even to the extent of offering her own new views that precedent is not a serious barrier to any change desired by the new majority. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The dicta in Justice Hathaway\u2019s opinion bears out her newfound position on stare decisis because her opinion purports to opine on \u201cthe full scope and extent of loss-of-opportunity claims,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> even while denying that such a claim is involved in <em>this </em>case. In doing so, Justice HATHAWAY engages in a completely gratuitous assault on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wickens v Oakwood Healthcare Sys.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> Wickens </em>involved a claim for the lost opportunity <em>to survive, </em>and it was brought by a living plaintiff \u2014 someone who had not yet <em>lost </em>her opportunity to survive. <em>No </em>justice even contends that plaintiff in this case has asserted a claim for the lost opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>to survive, and therefore it is completely unnecessary for Justice HATHAWAY to opine on whether the majority or dissent correctly interpreted the question whether a living plaintiff could recover for the loss of an opportunity to survive.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Ordinarily, this fact would hinder any justice from engaging in a discussion on the scope of a claim for the lost opportunity to survive that is not implicated in the case before the Court. Justice HATHAWAY, though, is not constrained to consider only the legal issues <em>she </em>claims are involved here because, consistent with the new majority\u2019s \u201cagenda,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> she has a desire to overrule in one fell swoop as many cases decided by the \u201cRepublican-dominated court\u201d as she can. Unfazed by the inconvenient fact that <em>Wickens </em>is irrelevant to any question posed by this case, Justice Hathaway\u2019s opinion observes that it \u201cagree[s] with Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s partial dissent in <em>Wickens . . . </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Such dicta do not yet operate to overturn this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wickens. </em>Nevertheless, given that Justice HATHAWAY is now the fourth sitting justice on this Court to support the partial dissenting opinion in <em>Wickens, </em>it is safe to conclude that the majority opinion in <em>Wickens </em>has, more probably than not, lost a substantial part of its opportunity to survive.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Finally, the new majority overrules the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Fulton v William Beaumont Hosp </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>to the extent it is inconsistent with their opinions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, again, the new majority overreaches; <em>Fulton </em>applies <em>only </em>to lost opportunity cases, <em>not </em>to traditional medical malpractice cases, and the new majority\u2019s decision to convert claims previously considered lost opportunity claims into traditional medical malpractice claims serves to eliminate the application <em>o\u00ed Fulton. </em>The new majority\u2019s deliberate decision to repudiate <em>Fulton </em>in this expansive manner provides further support for my claim that it now applies lost opportunity principles to <em>all </em>medical malpractice claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">For these reasons and more, I vigorously dissent. I believe that the new majority has intentionally mischaracterized this as a \u201ctraditional\u201d medical malpractice claim because plaintiffs expert testimony unquestionably established that the alleged malpractice was <em>not </em>the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of plaintiffs injury. Were the new majority\u2019s characterization of this case as a traditional medical malpractice claim accurate, I would affirm for failure of proofs. However, because I believe this to be a lost opportunity case, I would vacate as improvidently entered our September 30, 2009, order granting leave to appeal. I continue to adhere to the position stated in the lead opinion in <em>Stone v Williamson </em>that the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) codifying the lost opportunity remedy is unenforceable as enacted.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Because the Legislature has not clarified the intention of its 1993 amendment of \u00a7 2912a(2), vacating the grant order is the most appropriate course of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Because none of the opinions that collectively create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>a majority elaborates on the facts necessary to decide this case, I present the following complete recitation of the pertinent facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Plaintiff, Raymond O\u2019Neal, suffers from sickle cell anemia, a genetic condition that produces an increased amount of abnormally shaped red blood cells in his bloodstream.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In January 2003, plaintiffs progressively worsening chest pain developed into acute chest syndrome (ACS), a known complication of sickle cell anemia.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> To treat ACS, a patient must undergo blood transfusions to reduce the amount of abnormal red blood cells. The difference between and effectiveness of two types of blood transfusions \u2014 standard transfusions and exchange transfusions \u2014 is at issue in this case. Standard transfusions add healthy red blood cells to the patient\u2019s existing blood supply and thereby reduce the patient\u2019s percentage of abnormal red blood cells. Exchange transfusions are more complicated, but they also more aggressively treat the blood abnormality because they physically remove existing abnormal red blood cells and replace them with healthy red blood cells.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">On January 23 through 24, 2003, plaintiff received a standard transfusion of three units of blood cells. He received two additional units of blood cells in another standard transfusion on January 28, 2003. Plaintiff suffered a stroke on the right side of his brain on February 1, 2003. Plaintiff received a third transfusion \u2014 an exchange transfusion \u2014 on February 2 through 3, 2003. Plaintiffs condition stabilized after this final transfusion, but he alleged permanent injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>as a result of the stroke, including partial paralysis of his left leg and loss of function of his left hand and arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Plaintiff filed the instant medical malpractice complaint, alleging that defendants failed to comply with the appropriate standard of care, which required them to \u201carrange for exchange transfusions\u201d to treat plaintiffs ACS on or before January 28,2003. He also alleged that \u201c[p]er for manee of [an] exchange transfusion prior to the . . . stroke would have prevented the stroke from occurring.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Plaintiff retained and deposed three expert witnesses to testify on his behalf on the issue of causation. Dr. John Luce, a pulmonary care specialist, testified that reducing plaintiffs abnormal hemoglobin concentration to under 30 percent would have made it \u201cprobable that he would not have\u201d suffered the stroke, although he acknowledged that plaintiff still could have suffered the stroke even with such a reduced abnormal hemoglobin concentration. Because no data existed on the frequency of strokes in adult sickle cell patients, Dr. Richard Stein, a hematologist, extrapolated from existing data on the effects of aggressive transfusion therapy on children with sickle cell disease. He testified that \u201cmore likely than not\u201d plaintiff would have avoided a stroke if he had received aggressive transfusion therapy, what plaintiff alleged is the appropriate standard of care. Dr. Griffin Rodgers, also a hematologist, provided the most detailed testimony regarding the causal relationships between the stroke, plaintiffs underlying medical condition, and defendants\u2019 alleged malpractice. He explained that sickle cell patients generally have a baseline risk of stroke that is significantly higher than the average population. Moreover, plaintiffs ACS further increased his baseline risk of stroke to between 10 and 20 percent. Dr. Rodgers testified that, with aggres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>sive transfusion therapy, plaintiffs risk of stroke would have \u201cbeen cut in half,\u201d that is, to between 5 and 10 percent. Stated otherwise, plaintiffs opportunity to avoid a stroke would have been between 90 and 95 percent with aggressive transfusion therapy, but it was reduced to between 80 and 90 percent without aggressive transfusion therapy. Thus, under either treatment regime, plaintiffs experts testified that it was more likely than not that plaintiff would <em>avoid </em>a stroke.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Defendants moved for summary disposition, arguing that Dr. Rodgers\u2019s testimony regarding plaintiffs lost opportunity to avoid a stroke failed to satisfy the requirement of MCL 600.2912a(2)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and Fulton<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> that the opportunity to achieve a better result must decrease by more than 50 percentage points.

The concurring opinion concluded that plaintiff also failed to present sufficient evidence of proximate causation because his \u201cpreexisting medical condition\u201d precluded him from satisfying \u201chis burden of establishing the existence of a genuine factual dispute concerning whether defendants\u2019 alleged professional negligence \u2018more probably tha[n] not\u2019 proximately caused his stroke.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">We granted leave to appeal and directed the parties to brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">(1) whether the requirements set forth in the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) apply in this case; (2) if not, whether the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact with regard to whether the defendants\u2019 conduct proximately caused his injury; or (3) if so, whether <em>Fulton v William Beaumont Hosp, </em>253 Mich App 70 (2002), was correctly decided, or whether a different approach is required to correctly implement the second sentence of \u00a7 2912a(2).<footnotemark>[26]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">II. LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">The lead opinion in <em>Stone </em>aptly summarized the pertinent legal background relevant to this case, including the distinction between traditional malpractice claims and lost opportunity claims that the majority now eviscerates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">In the first Michigan case to refer to the legal theory of \u201cthe value of lost chance,\u201d the Court of Appeals explained: \u201cThis theory is potentially available in situations where a plaintiff cannot prove that a'defendant\u2019s actions were the cause of his injuries, but can prove that the defendant\u2019s actions deprived him of a chance to avoid those injuries.\u201d <em>Vitale v Reddy, </em>150 Mich App 492, 502; 389 NW2d 456 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>(1986). The Court in <em>Vitale </em>noted that allowing such claims would expand existing common law, and it declined to do so, stating that such a decision \u201cis best left to either the Supreme Court or the Legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">In accord with this analysis, this Court has stated: \u201cThe lost opportunity doctrine allows a plaintiff to recover when the defendant\u2019s negligence <em>possibly, </em>i.e., [by] a probability of fifty percent or less, caused the plaintiffs injury.\u201d <em>Weymers v Khera, </em>454 Mich 639, 648; 563 NW2d 647 (1997) (emphasis added). The <em>Weymers </em>Court aptly described the lost-opportunity doctrine as \u201cthe antithesis of proximate cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In cases in which the plaintiff alleges that the defendant\u2019s negligence more probably than not caused the injury, the claim is one of simple medical malpractice. <em>Id. </em>at 647-648.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In <em>Falcon v Mem Hosp, </em>436 Mich 443; 462 NW2d 44 (1990), this Court first recognized a claim for lost opportunity to survive. <em>Falcon </em>was a wrongful-death case in which this Court allowed a claim to go forward even though the plaintiffs granddaughter would have had only a 37.5 percent chance of surviving a medical accident had she received proper care. Because proper medical procedures had not been followed, the granddaughter\u2019s chance of surviving the accident went to essentially zero. The lead opinion in <em>Falcon </em>admitted that the plaintiff could not show that the malpractice had more likely than not caused her granddaughter\u2019s death, but could show that it had caused her granddaughter to lose a \u201csubstantial opportunity of avoiding physical harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470 (Levin, J.). The lead opinion disavowed the traditional rule that requires a plaintiff to show that, but for the defendant\u2019s negligence, the patient would not have suffered the physical harm, saying that the \u201cmore probable than not standard, as well as other standards of causation, are analytic devices \u2014 tools to be used in making causation judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451. Instead, despite the fact that the plaintiff could not show that the doctor\u2019s malpractice had more probably than not caused her granddaughter\u2019s death, the plaintiff had a claim because the malpractice did cause her granddaughter harm. The 37.5 percent chance for a better outcome was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>\u201chardly the kind of opportunity that any of us would willingly allow our health care providers to ignore.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460. This harm occurred <em>before </em>the granddaughter\u2019s death, at the moment \u201c[w]hen, by reason of the failure to implement [certain] procedures,\u201d she was denied any opportunity of living. <em>Id. </em>at 469, 471 n 44. The lead opinion characterized its holding as requiring the plaintiff to show, more probably than not, that the malpractice reduced the opportunity of avoiding harm: \u201cfailure to protect [the granddaughter\u2019s] opportunity of living.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469. Loss of her 37.5 percent opportunity of living, the lead opinion stated, \u201cconstitutes a loss of a substantial opportunity of avoiding physical harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The lead opinion in <em>Falcon </em>thus concluded that the loss-of-opportunity claim accrued not when the patient died, but at the moment she went from having a 37.5 [percent] chance of survival to having no chance of survival. Under this theory, a plaintiff would have a cause of action independent of that for the physical injury and could recover for the malpractice that caused the plaintiff to go from a class of patients having a \u201cgood chance\u201d to one having a \u201cbad chance.\u201d Without this analysis, the plaintiff in <em>Falcon </em>would not have had a viable claim because it could not have been shown that the defendant more probably than not caused the physical injury. Until Falcon, medical-malpractice plaintiffs alleging that the defendant\u2019s act or omission hastened or worsened the injury (such as by failing to diagnose a condition) had to prove that the defendant\u2019s malpractice more probably than not was the proximate cause of the injury. See, e.g., <em>Morgan v Taylor, </em>434 Mich 180; 451 NW2d 852 (1990); <em>Naccarato v Grob, </em>384 Mich 248, 252; 180 NW2d 788 (1970); <em>Skeffington v Bradley, </em>366 Mich 552; 115 NW2d 303 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">When the Court decided <em>Falcon, </em>MCL 600.2912a read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-8\">\u201cIn an action alleging malpractice the plaintiff shall have the burden of proving that in light of the state of the art existing at the time of the alleged malpractice:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">\u201c(a) The defendant, if a general practitioner, failed to provide the plaintiff the recognized standard of acceptable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>professional practice in the community in which the defendant practices or in a similar community, and that as a proximate result of the defendant failing to provide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">\u201c(b) The defendant, if a specialist, failed to provide the recognized standard of care within that specialty as reasonably applied in light of the facilities available in the community or other facilities reasonably available under the circumstances, and as a proximate result of the defendant failing to provide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Three years after <em>Falcon, </em>the Legislature enacted 1993 PA 78, amending MCL 600.2912a to add the second subsection. In its entirety, the statute as amended reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\"><em>\u201c(1) Subject to subsection (2), </em>in an action alleging malpractice, the plaintiff <em>has </em>the burden of proving that in light of the state of the art existing at the time of the alleged malpractice:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">\u201c(a) The defendant, if a general practitioner, failed to provide the plaintiff the recognized standard of acceptable professional practice or <em>care </em>in the community in which the defendant practices or in a similar community, and that as a proximate result of the defendant failing to provide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">\u201c(b) The defendant, if a specialist, failed to provide the recognized standard of <em>practice or </em>care within that specialty as reasonably applied in light of the facilities available in the community or other facilities reasonably available under the circumstances, and as a proximate result of the defendant failing to provide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-10\"><em>\u201c(2) In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that he or she suffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or defendants. In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%.\u201d </em>[New language emphasized.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>As can be seen, the Legislature retained the already-existing language, making it subsection 1 of the statute. Both subsection 1(a) and subsection 1(b) require the plaintiff to show that, \u201cas a proximate result of the defendant failing to provide [the appropriate standard of practice or care], the plaintiff suffered an injury.\u201d Further, the Legislature added subsection 2. Specifically, the first sentence of this new subsection codifies and reiterates the common-law requirement that a plaintiff show that the defendant\u2019s malpractice more probably than not caused the plaintiffs injury The second sentence of subsection 2 adds that, in medical-malpractice cases, a \u201cplaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%. \u201d However, one must keep in mind that the relevant caselaw when subsection 2 was enacted held that the lost-opportunity doctrine applies <em>\u201cin situations where a plaintiff cannot prove that a defendant\u2019s actions were the cause of his injuries </em>....\u201d <em>Vitale, </em>[150 Mich App] at 502 (emphasis added). That is, the first sentence of subsection 2 requires plaintiffs in every medical-malpractice case to show the defendant\u2019s malpractice proximately caused the injury while, at the same time, the second sentence refers to cases in which such proof not only is unnecessary, but is impossible.<footnotemark>[27]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Thus, in contrast with traditional malpractice claims, the very nature of the lost opportunity doctrine allows a plaintiff to recover <em>in the absence of proximate causation between the alleged malpractice and the physical injury suffered. </em>The lead opinion in <em>Stone </em>determined that \u201cthe two sentences of subsection 2 create a paradox, allowing claims in the second sentence while precluding them by the first sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In this case, Justice Hathaway\u2019s opinion and Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s concurring opinion altogether avoid the implications of this paradox by essentially applying the lost opportunity analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>(which never required \u201cbut for\u201d causation) to a traditional medical malpractice claim that, until today, <em>always required </em>\u201cbut for\u201d causation. In doing so, the new majority radically alters proximate causation doctrine by casting aside the traditional component of \u201cbut for\u201d causation and by replacing causation of the injury with consideration only of the <em>increased </em>risk of the injury. This is a revolutionary change in our law and represents a change that not even the <em>Falcon </em>Court dared to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">A necessary component of proximate causation is \u201cbut for\u201d causation, or causation in fact.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> As this Court has previously held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">As a matter of logic, a court must find that the defendant\u2019s negligence was a cause in fact of the plaintiffs injuries before it can hold that the defendant\u2019s negligence was the proximate or legal cause of those injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">Generally, an act or omission is a cause in fact of an injury only if the injury could not have occurred without (or \u201cbut for\u201d) that act or omission. While a plaintiff need not prove that an act or omission was the <em>sole </em>catalyst for his injuries, he must introduce evidence permitting the jury to conclude that the act or omission was <em>a </em>cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">It is important to bear in mind that a plaintiff cannot satisfy this burden by showing only that the defendant <em>may </em>have caused his injuries. Our case law requires more than a mere possibility or a plausible explanation. Rather, a plaintiff establishes that the defendant\u2019s conduct was a cause in fact of his injuries only if he \u201cset[s] forth specific facts that would support a reasonable inference of a logical sequence of cause and effect.\u201d<footnotemark>[30]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>As Justice CAVANAGH has himself previously concluded, plaintiffs must present evidence of proximate causation that \u201c \u2018must exclude other reasonable hypotheses with a fair amount of certainty.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> By allowing plaintiffs claim to proceed as a traditional medical malpractice claim, the new majority today eviscerates the distinction between the weaker causation allowed in lost opportunity claims and the \u201cbut for\u201d causation that has <em>always </em>been required in traditional medical malpractice claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">III. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">A. PLAINTIFF ASSERTED A LOST OPPORTUNITY CLAIM BECAUSE THERE IS NO \u201cBUT FOR\u201d CAUSATION BETWEEN THE ALLEGED MALPRACTICE AND THE PHYSICAL INJURY SUFFERED</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">As stated, the crux of a lost opportunity claim is that a plaintiff cannot show that, more probably than not, the alleged malpractice proximately caused his injuries. This is because a plaintiff need only show that the alleged malpractice merely reduced his opportunity to achieve a better result. Accordingly, whether a claim is a traditional malpractice claim or a claim for the loss of an opportunity to achieve a better result depends on whether the alleged malpractice <em>proximately caused </em>the alleged injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Contrary to the new majority\u2019s position, this case presents a prototypical lost opportunity claim because <em>no proximate causation exists between the alleged malpractice and plaintiff\u2019s physical injury. </em>Plaintiffs experts testified that plaintiffs underlying medical condition \u2014 sickle cell anemia complicated by ACS\u2014 <em>increased his risk of stroke </em>above that of a healthy person and even above that of a sickle cell patient who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>has not developed ACS. Plaintiffs underlying medical condition created a heightened chance of suffering a stroke, <em>with or without the alleged malpractice. </em>As Dr. Rogers, who provided the most detail of plaintiffs causation experts, testified, plaintiff would have had a 5 to 10 percent chance of suffering a stroke <em>even if he had been treated according to the plaintiff\u2019s proposed standard of care.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><em>The evidence here, therefore, does not \u201c \u2018exclude other reasonable hypotheses [of the cause of in</em>jury] <em>with a fair amount of certainty,\u2019 </em>\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> as is required to prove \u201cbut for\u201d causation in a traditional medical malpractice action. Plaintiffs expert testified that, in the absence of the alleged medical malpractice, plaintiff had between a 90 percent and 95 percent chance of avoiding a stroke. The alleged medical malpractice reduced plaintiffs chance of avoiding a stroke to between 80 percent and 90 percent. Even looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, there is no basis for a fact-finder to conclude that defendants\u2019 actions more probably than not <em>caused </em>plaintiffs injury. But this is unimportant because the new majority now only requires causation for the <em>increased risk of injury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Simply stated, the plaintiff has not asserted \u2014 and neither Justice Hathaway\u2019s opinion nor Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s concurring opinion assert \u2014 that the alleged medical malpractice increased his chance of suffering a stroke by the more than 50 percentage points required to prove proximate causation.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This fact irrefutably establishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>that the plaintiff asserts a lost opportunity claim, not a traditional medical malpractice claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">B. THE CONCLUSION THAT PLAINTIFF HAS ASSERTED A TRADITIONAL MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CLAIM AND HAS SATISFIED THE REQUIREMENTS OF \u201cBUT FOR\u201d CAUSATION IS A DANGEROUS DEPARTURE FROM TRADITIONAL CAUSATION REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">As stated, in determining that plaintiffs claim is a traditional medical malpractice claim, the new majority today applies relaxed causation rules that previously had applied <em>only </em>to lost opportunity claims \u2014 claims involving an increased <em>risk of injury </em>that did not rise to the level of proximate causation. These relaxed rules are inconsistent with the position that three of the justices of the new majority have taken previously on what evidence is required for a plaintiff to prove a traditional medical malpractice claim.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Such claims have <em>always </em>required \u201cbut for\u201d causation. After today\u2019s shift, therefore, <em>all </em>malpractice claims will be established using principles that could only have applied to lost opportunity claims. Few can miss how significant a departure this is from all of this Court\u2019s medical malpractice jurisprudence that preceded this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">1. THREE JUSTICES TODAY REPUDIATE THE TRADITIONAL CAUSATION PRINCIPLES THAT THEY <em>REAFFIRMED </em>JUST TWO YEARS AGO</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The new majority appears to be of the view that the less said about its radical rewriting of this statute the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>better. It is apparently not required to maintain a consistent position or explain a fundamental change in position when a judge is \u201cdoing\u201d policy rather than interpreting the law. Certainly, such disclosures are probably not desired by jurists whose positions are undergoing radical \u201crevision.\u201d I commend the reader to compare the positions taken today by Chief Justice KELLY and Justices CAVANAGH and WEAVER with those taken just two years ago in <em>Stone.</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark><em> </em>These three justices now <em>repudiate </em>the traditional proximate cause requirements that they previously recognized and applied at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">In <em>Stone, </em>Justice CAVANAGH, writing for himself and Justices KELLY and Weaver, held that a traditional medical malpractice action required \u201cbut for\u201d causation. He specifically posed a hypothetical example in which a plaintiff\u2019s opportunity to achieve a better result was reduced by 40 percentage points, from 80 percent to 40 percent. Thus, this hypothetical plaintiff\u2019s risk of suffering a bad result increased from 20 percent to 60 percent as a result of the alleged medical malpractice. According to Justice CAVANAGH just two years ago, this hypothetical plaintiff \u201ccould not meet the more-probably-than-not standard of causation . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Today these same three justices declare that a much smaller reduction in the opportunity to achieve a better result \u2014 from 90 to 95 percent to 80 to 90 percent \u2014 now satisfies the causation standard of a <em>traditional </em>malpractice case. This is not a product of the rule of law. This is a naked display of judicial whimsy and aggressive policy-making.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>2. JUSTICE HATHAWAY\u2019S OPINION MISREADS CASELAW TO REDEFINE PROXIMATE CAUSE AND TO DO AWAY WITH THE TRADITIONAL REQUIREMENT THAT A PLAINTIFF PROVE A \u201cBUT FOR\u201d CAUSE UNDER THE MORE-PROBABLE-THAN-NOT STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s opinion places much emphasis on the fact that our caselaw indicates that <em>\u201ca </em>plaintiff need not prove that an act or omission was the <em>sole </em>catalyst for his injuries,\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> in recognition that any given injury may have more than one proximate cause. It then uses this fact of logic and causation to create a false distinction that radically refashions proximate causation and negates the traditional requirement \u2014 as previously articulated even by Justice CAVANAGH \u2014 that proof of \u201cbut for\u201d causation must <em>\u201cexclude </em>other reasonable hypotheses with a fair amount of certainty.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The proposition that any injury may have more than one proximate cause is an unremarkable one for anyone who understands the principles of \u201cbut for\u201d causation. An injury that involves a <em>series </em>of individual occurrences before it is manifested will have multiple \u201cbut for\u201d causes. However, in such a case, <em>each </em>of these causes <em>must be proved to have produced the injury under the more-probable-than-not standard, </em>not merely proved to have <em>increased the risk of injury, </em>as this case does.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">One of this Court\u2019s cases on traditional causation, <em>Brackins v Olympia, Inc, </em>illustrates this point.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The plaintiff, a roller skating instructor, fell while roller skating at the defendant\u2019s rink. He alleged that another skater had clipped his right skate and that, \u201cas a result his skates became locked with his right foot and skate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>behind his left skate.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Furthermore, the plaintiff claimed that he could not have prevented the fall \u201cbecause his left skate struck a ridge or inequality in the floor of the rink . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The defendant rink owner sought summary disposition because it claimed that the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury was the other skater clipping the plaintiffs skate, not the flaw in the rink surface. To be sure, the other skater\u2019s action <em>was </em>a \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the plaintiffs injury, as the injury would not have occurred without it. However, this Court concluded that the skating rink surface was <em>also </em>a proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\">Defendant is not absolved from liability for its negligence because of the act of the other skater.... The proofs support the conclusion ... that plaintiff fell because of the roughness of, or the inequality in, the floor of the skating rink. Defendant\u2019s negligence, if not the sole proximate cause of the accident, was, in any event, <em>a </em>proximate <em>cause.</em><footnotemark><em>[42]</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Each of the \u201cbut for\u201d causes in <em>Brackins </em>could be proved with near certainty. Accordingly, the <em>Brackins </em>Court concluded that <em>both </em>\u201cbut for\u201d causes more probably than not <em>directly </em>caused the plaintiffs injury, and therefore it affirmed the jury\u2019s award of damages to the plaintiff against the defendant. <em>Nevertheless, in recognizing that an injury may have more than one \u201cbut for\u201d cause, this Court has always, until now, required the traditional burden of proving that each particular \u201cbut for\u201d cause more probably than not produced the injury.</em><footnotemark><em>43</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>The dual \u201cbut for\u201d causes in <em>Brackins </em>are very different from the situation in the instant case. Here, all that plaintiff can show is that defendants\u2019 alleged malpractice exacerbated plaintiffs <em>preexisting </em>sickle cell anemia to the extent of increasing his <em>risk </em>of suffering a stroke by between 5 and 10 percentage points. Plaintiff has simply not proved that the alleged malpractice <em>caused </em>his stroke, nor has he \u201cexclude[d]\u201d the \u201cother reasonable hypothes[i]s\u201d \u2014 his preexisting sickle cell anemia \u2014 \u201cwith a fair amount of certainty.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Thus, plaintiffs preexisting sickle cell anemia could well have operated to injure him <em>even in the absence of defendants\u2019 alleged malpractice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">3. JUSTICE HATHAWAY\u2019S AND JUSTICE CAVANAGH\u2019S OPINIONS TAKE INAPPROPRIATE LIBERTIES WITH PLAINTIFF\u2019S EXPERT STATISTICAL EVIDENCE BY FAILING TO COMPARE LIKE WITH LIKE</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Even in applying their radical new approach to proximate causation, the justices in the new majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number><em>only </em>reach their desired result by manipulating the expert\u2019s statistical evidence in ways inconsistent with the experts\u2019 own use of the statistical evidence and, similarly, in ways inconsistent with the uncontroversial and essential principle of statistical methodology of comparing \u201clike with like.\u201d The new majority\u2019s inappropriate use of the statistical evidence presented in this case provides further proof that it is engaging in result-driven jurisprudence. Only this motivation could support such a mathematically illiterate presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s opinion declares, under the guise of requiring \u201cresults [to] be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> that <em>any </em>mishmash of figures that yields a result of greater than 50 percent will establish proximate causation between the alleged malpractice and the plaintiffs injury sufficient to defeat summary disposition. Thus, while Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s opinion expressly declines to adopt any <em>particular </em>mathematical formula for determining whether proximate cause exists in a given case, it essentially adopts <em>every </em>formula that an attorney or judge can manufacture. This is not a serious analysis\u2014 \u201cstatistical\u201d or otherwise. Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s opinion is simply an invitation for the artful manipulation of probability figures and calls to mind the adage Mark Twain once attributed to Benjamin Disraeli, that there are \u201cthree kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> '</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Two of the formulas that Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s opinion identifies by name bear closer analysis. Her opinion indicates that the evidence in this case can be \u201cviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>as a standard percentage increase calculation .. . .\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The flaw in using this \u201cstandard percentage increase calculation\u201d in a traditional medical malpractice case is obvious. Such a calculation would turn the facts of <em>Falcon </em>\u2014 a case in which <em>no </em>justice believed that the plaintiff could prove \u201cbut for\u201d causation using a more-probable-than-not standard<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> \u2014 into a traditional medical malpractice case.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In <em>Falcon, </em>the plaintiffs decedent, Nena Falcon, suffered an amniotic fluid embolism, \u201can unpreventable complication\u201d of childbirth.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> A woman who suffers this complication has a 62.5 percent probability of dying, even if it is treated immediately. Because of alleged malpractice, however, Nena Falcon\u2019s amniotic fluid embolism was not treated immediately. This alleged malpractice increased her chance of death to 100 percent.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Under the \u201cstandard percentage increase calculation\u201d used by Justice HATHAWAY to support her radical departure from requiring traditional proximate causation in this case, the defendant\u2019s alleged malpractice in <em>Falcon </em>was responsible for increasing Nena Falcon\u2019s chance of dying by 37.5 percentage points over the preexisting 62.5 percentage point chance of dying. This represents a 60 percent increase in her chance of dying (37.5/62.5), and satisfies Justice Hathaway\u2019s conclusion that <em>any </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>formula that reaches the magic number of more than 50 percent is satisfactory. Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s opinion has, therefore, taken a judicially created aberration of proximate causation, <em>Falcon, </em>and applied it so that she can satisfy the proximate cause component of a traditional medical malpractice claim. Fortunately, Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s opinion is the only opinion that adopts this approach, so this \u201cstandard percentage increase calculation\u201d does not, therefore, have support from a majority of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">However, a second approach used by Justice HATHAWAY that I wish to discuss <em>does </em>appear to have the support from a majority of this Court \u2014 what Justice HATHAWAY calls the \u201cstandard percentage decrease calculation.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> This approach takes the pre- and postmalpractice probabilities of suffering the injury and calculates what proportion of the postmalpractice probability of injury is attributable to the malpractice. The percentage approach is found nowhere in this Court\u2019s proximate cause jurisprudence, yet both Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s opinion and Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s concurring opinion apply it to conclude that plaintiff has made the requisite showing of probable cause to defeat defendants\u2019 motions for summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">As stated, three of the justices who support this approach do so in opposition to their previously stated positions.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Moreover, Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s opinion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s concurring opinion apply the new standard in an especially troubling fashion. It is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>truism in statistical methodology that one marshaling statistical evidence to support causation must apply the principle of <em>ceteris paribus </em>by \u201ccomparing like with like.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The new majority violates this basic principle of statistical analysis to reach its desired result. The expert testimony indicated that plaintiffs chance of suffering a stroke would have been reduced from the range of 10 to 20 percent to the range of 5 to 10 percent if plaintiff had been treated according to the asserted standard of care. In clarifying these statistical ranges, the expert concluded that plaintiffs likelihood of suffering a stroke would have been \u201ccut in half\u201d under the standard of care urged by plaintiff. In other words, the upper end of the range of plaintiffs likelihood of suffering a stroke was \u201ccut in half,\u201d from 20 percent to 10 percent, and the lower end of that range was <em>also </em>\u201ccut in half,\u201d from 10 percent to 5 percent. Rather than comparing like with like \u2014 the lower end of each range <em>or </em>the upper end of each range \u2014 a majority of this Court fallaciously compares the lower end of one range (5 percent) with the upper end of the other (20 percent). They do so in order to conclude that the alleged malpractice caused 75 percent of plaintiffs chance of suffering a stroke (15/2o).<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> This failure to \u201ccompare like with like\u201d is a patent error of statistical analysis, but it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>gets the majority where it needs to go to support its conclusion that plaintiff has established \u201cbut for\u201d cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Finally, Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s opinion concludes that \u201cplaintiff established a question of fact on the issue of proximate causation because plaintiff\u2019s experts opined that defendants\u2019 negligence more probably than not was the proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> This statement might have had more relevance if it had been supported by the experts\u2019 <em>actual </em>statistical evidence of plaintiffs chances of suffering the stroke. However, as discussed above, plaintiffs experts were unable to show proximate causation between the alleged malpractice and plaintiffs stroke. All they were able to show was a <em>connection </em>between the alleged malpractice and plaintiffs <em>increased likelihood of suffering a stroke, </em>from between 5 to 10 percent to between 10 to 20 percent. Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s analysis, such as it is, allows an expert to say certain \u201cmagic words\u201d about proximate causation, while presenting statistical evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">As stated, this case is a prototypical lost opportunity case because plaintiff cannot establish that, more probably than not, defendants proximately caused his stroke because he was predisposed to suffer one, his risk being in the range of 5 to 10 percent, even with medical care that satisfied plaintiffs proposed standard of care. Accordingly, I vigorously dissent from the conclusion of a majority of this Court that plaintiff asserted a traditional medical malpractice claim and would instead conclude that plaintiff asserted a lost opportunity claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">C. MCL 600.2912a(2) IS (STILL) UNENFORCEABLE AS ENACTED</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Because the new majority concludes that plaintiffs claim is a traditional medical malpractice claim, it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>not need to reach the question whether plaintiffs claim meets the requirements of the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2), which applies only to lost opportunity claims. The decision of the new majority to treat this case as a traditional medical malpractice claim, of course, obviates the need for interpreting the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) because the new majority essentially treats <em>all </em>medical malpractice claims under the weakened <em>Falcon </em>causation standard heretofore applicable <em>only </em>to lost opportunity claims. Therefore, the decision of the new majority to overrule the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Fulton, </em>to the extent <em>Fulton </em>drew a line between lost opportunity cases and traditional medical malpractice cases, also does away with Fulton\u2019s application of the sentence in \u00a7 2912a(2) that applies to lost opportunity cases. <em>Fulton </em>only applies to lost opportunity cases. By concluding that the instant case sounds in traditional medical malpractice, the new majority essentially writes the decision in <em>Fulton </em>out of existence. Thus, its expansive decision in this case is characteristic of the new majority that overreaches in its decisions in order to achieve its own preferred policy outcomes.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>The Legislature added subsection (2) to MCL 600.2912a shortly after the <em>Falcon </em>Court created the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>new claim for loss of an opportunity to survive. The new subsection provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that he or she suffered an injury that more probably than not was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant or defendants. In an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%.<footnotemark>[57]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">As the lead opinion in <em>Stone </em>aptly observed, there are multiple problems in determining whether the requirements of MCL 600.2912a(2) apply in any particular case. As stated above, the two sentences are internally inconsistent and, therefore, create a paradox:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">[T]he first sentence of this new subsection codifies and reiterates the common-law requirement that a plaintiff show that the defendant\u2019s malpractice more probably than not caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury. The second sentence of subsection 2 adds that, in medical-malpractice cases, a \u201cplaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%. \u201d However, one must keep in mind that the relevant caselaw when subsection 2 was enacted held that the lost-opportunity doctrine applies <em>\u201cin situations where a plaintiff cannot prove that a defendant\u2019s actions were the cause of his injuries </em>. . . .\u201d <em>Vitale, </em>[150 Mich App] at 502 (emphasis added). That is, the first sentence of subsection 2 requires plaintiffs in every medical-malpractice case to show the defendant\u2019s malpractice proximately caused the injury while, at the same time, the second sentence refers to cases in which such proof not only is unnecessary, but is impossible.<footnotemark>[58]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Even ignoring the internal inconsistency, the second sentence of subsection (2) is incomprehensible as written. Subsequent to the amendment, the split Court of Appeals panel in <em>Fulton </em>offered two contradictory interpretations of the second sentence, neither of which was consistent with the text of that sentence as enacted. The <em>Fulton </em>majority determined that \u201cMCL 600.2912a(2) requires a plaintiff to show that the loss of the opportunity to survive or achieve a better result exceeds fifty percent.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> As the lead opinion in <em>Stone </em>indicated, this interpretation \u201cimproperly adds to the statute the words \u2018loss of,\u2019 effectively replacing the word \u2018opportunity\u2019 where it is used the second time with the phrase \u2018loss of opportunity.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Thus, <em>the Fulton </em>majority essentially rewrote the second sentence of \u00a7 2912a(2) to include the following bracketed words: \u201cIn an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the [loss of] opportunity was greater than 50%. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The dissenting judge in <em>Fulton </em>did not fare any better. His interpretation of MCL 600.2912a(2) required a plaintiff \u201c \u2018to show that, had the defendant not been negligent, there was a greater than fifty percent chance of survival or a better result.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> This interpretation essentially rewrote the second sentence of \u00a7 2912a(2) to include the following bracketed word: \u201cIn an action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff cannot recover for loss of an opportunity to survive or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>an opportunity to achieve a better result unless the [initial] opportunity was greater than 50%.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Thus, both the majority and the dissent in <em>Fulton </em>inserted additional words into the statute. Their reasons for doing so were identical: each believed the additional language was necessary to enforce the perceived legislative intent to respond to the <em>Falcon </em>Court\u2019s creation of the lost opportunity claim. However, these multiple interpretations show that, even if they were correct that the amendment was a legislative response to <em>Falcon, </em>the scope of such response was far from clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In the end, the lead opinion in <em>Stone </em>concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">It is confounding to attempt to ascertain just what the Legislature was trying to do with this amendment. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">As written, the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) can be made understandable only by adding words or by redefining \u201cinjury\u201d in a way significantly contrary to the mass of caselaw at the time the sentence was added.... None of these multiple, contradictory interpretations can be shown to be the \u201ccorrect\u201d construction of legislative intent. Choosing between them can only he a guess... . Accordingly, I conclude that the second sentence of subsection 2 cannot be judicially enforced because doing so <em>requires </em>the Court to impose its own prerogative on an act of the <em>Legislature.</em><footnotemark><em>[62]</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Since this Court\u2019s split opinions in <em>Stone, </em>the Legislature has not clarified the confusion surrounding the appropriate interpretation of MCL 600.2912a(2). Therefore, my position remains that the provision is unenforceable as enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">The decision by the new majority that this case represents a traditional medical malpractice case further muddles this important area of the law. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>three justices of the new majority have changed their published positions over the past several years on the nature of the evidence required to prove proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">If the numerous fractured decisions and inconsistent opinions of the members of this Court fail to demonstrate that this statute is impossible to interpret reasonably, then it is hard to envision a better illustration that MCL 600.2912a(2) is inherently internally inconsistent and cannot be parsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Confusion and uncertainty in the law prevent citizens from arranging their affairs in a predictable fashion. This Court initially created uncertainty in adopting the lost opportunity claim in <em>Falcon </em>because it was so profoundly at odds with traditional principles of causation. It is no wonder that the Legislature had difficulty reconciling <em>\u201cFalcon </em>causation\u201d with the traditional causation that the Legislature clearly desired to maintain in medical malpractice claims. Today, the new majority has created even more uncertainty in interpreting the legislative response to <em>Falcon. </em>While the result in this case undoubtedly serves the interests of lawyers who litigate medical malpractice cases, it poorly serves the people of this state to have the law become even more incomprehensibly muddled. This is not an accidental act, but one intentionally designed to thwart the legislative directive that the plaintiff prove the traditional requirement of proximate cause in <em>every </em>\u201caction alleging medical malpractice . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Judges, as neutral arbiters whose function is merely to interpret the laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>enacted through the democratic process, should not be agents of \u201csocietal change\u201d they desire, and they certainly should not contribute to confusion and chaos in the law. The new majority\u2019s resolution of this case fails on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Plaintiffs claim is a prototypical lost opportunity claim. As such, the second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) expressly controls plaintiffs claim. However, I continue to maintain that \u00a7 2912a(2) is unenforceable as enacted, and I reiterate former Chief Justice TAYLOR\u2019S call for the Legislature \u201cto reexamine its goal and the policies it wishes to promote and strive to better articulate its intent in that regard.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Today, that call is more urgent than it was just two years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Today is a sad day for predictability in Michigan law. The disorder sown by the new majority in their several opinions speaks poorly of the quality of decision-making in this Court. Doctrinal destruction aside, the obvious manipulation of the statistical evidence by the justices of the new majority to achieve their goal of creating a cause of action when the proofs have failed is itself worthy of condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">For all of the reasons stated, I vigorously dissent from overreaching by the new majority and, instead, would vacate as improvidently entered this Court\u2019s September 30, 2009, order granting leave to appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b607-8\">Corrigan, J., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b572-8\">1 <em>She Said, </em>Detroit Free Press, December 10, 2008, p 2A.

This is patently false. First, as stated, there <em>can </em>he multiple \u201cbut for\u201d causes for a particular injury, including the negligent conduct of <em>multiple </em>medical providers. All of these hypothetical negligent acts, however, must <em>themselves </em>be \u201cbut for\u201d causes, like the chain reaction of events that caused the roller skating injury in <em>Brackins. </em>Second, a medical provider\u2019s negligence may, more probably than not, he a \u201cbut for\u201d cause of an injury <em>even when the plaintiff has a preexisting condition. </em>This was the very situation that this Court encountered in <em>Stone. </em>The plaintiff in <em>Stone </em>alleged that a timely diagnosis of an aortic aneurysm would have given him a 95 percent chance of attaining a good result. Instead, his aneurysm ruptured, requiring emergency surgery and ultimately amputation of his legs. According to the plaintiff\u2019s experts, \u201cmisdiagnosed patients whose aneurysms rupture have only a 10 percent chance to achieve a good result.\u201d <em>Stone, </em>482 Mich at 148 (opinion by Taylor, C.J.). Thus, even though the plaintiff had a preexisting medical condition, the defendants\u2019 misconduct increased the plaintiffs probability of suffering a bad result from 5 percent to 90 percent. This increase of 85 percentage points provided a sufficient factual basis to defeat the defendants\u2019 motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b594-9\"> <em>Skinner, </em>445 Mich at 166 (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b595-8\"> <em>Ante </em>at 505 n 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b595-9\"> Twain, <em>My Autobiography: \"Chapters\u201d from the North American Review </em>(Mine\u00f3la, NY: Dover Publications, Inc, 1999), p 208.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b596-6\"> <em>Ante </em>at 504-505.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b596-7\"> <em>Falcon, </em>436 Mich at 460 (opinion by Levin, J.)

This is because the plaintiffs risk has not increased by the more than 50 percentage points traditionally required to prove \u201cbut for\u201d causation. Justice Cavanagh applies a very different approach today, and, under that approach, his hypothetical <em>Stone </em>plaintiff <em>would </em>be able to prove causation. Whatever innocence Justice Cavanagh now feigns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>in treating both that hypothetical case and the instant case as traditional medical malpractice cases, he is unequivocally converting what used to be a lost opportunity case into a traditional medical malpractice case.</p>\n<p id=\"A5A\">A plaintiff who has a preexisting medical condition is <em>only </em>able to prove \u201cbut for\u201d causation when the alleged malpractice increases the plaintiffs risk of suffering a \u201cbad result\u201d by more than 50 percentage points. Otherwise, there is no way to exclude, as Justice Cavanagh (and this Court) has previously required, all \u201cother reasonable hypotheses with a fair amount of certainty.\u201d <em>Skinner, </em>445 Mich at 166 (quotation marks and citation omitted). The approach adopted by the opinions of Justices Hathaway and Cavanagh negates this basic requirement of proximate cause and would allow a plaintiff to recover for a bad result even in situations in which other, nonmalpractice \u201ccauses\u201d for the result predominated in creating it.</p>\n<p id=\"Arz-\">The new majority\u2019s approach would allow a plaintiff to recover <em>in full </em>from a doctor who, for example, failed to diagnose cancer at its earliest stages, but still diagnosed it at a stage where it was much more probable than not that a patient would survive. To put figures on this situation, suppose a plaintiffs risk of dying from cancer is 1 percent if it is caught at its earliest stages. A doctor who fails to catch the cancer at that stage, but who catches it and treats it at a stage where the risk of dying from cancer is 3 percent, then, is liable, under the new majority\u2019s new approach, for the <em>entire </em>injury, should one occur, because the failure to diagnose contributed to <em>2h </em>of the risk of injury. This is true, according to the new majority, even though the doctor only decreased the patient\u2019s chance of surviving by 2 percentage points, from 99 percent to 97 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"ABQ\">By shifting many lost opportunity claims into traditional medical malpractice claims, the new majority creates additional liability of a defendant for the <em>entire </em>injury, not just for the <em>increased risk </em>of injury, as lost opportunity claims provide. See <em>Falcon, </em>436 Mich at 471 (opinion by Levin, J.) (\u201cIn this case, 37.5 percent times the damages recoverable for wrongful death would be an appropriate measure of damages.\u201d). This shift in determining a defendant\u2019s liability is <em>essential </em>to understanding what the new majority is trying to accomplish in this case. Now plaintiffs need only prove that a doctor\u2019s negligence contributed to the risk of injury, not that his negligence actually <em>caused </em>the injury. And no amount of pretended ignorance about the significance of these changes by members of the new majority alters their fundamental and radical impact on this area of the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b599-4\"> See Lewis-Beck, Bryman, &amp; Liao, eds, 1 <em>The SAGE Encyclopedia of Social Science Research Methods </em>(Thousand Oaks, Cal: SAGE Publications, Inc, 2004), p 117 <em>(\u201cCeteris paribus ... </em>refers to the process of comparing like with like when asserting a causal relationship or the effect of one variable on another.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b599-5\"> The new majority calculates that defendants\u2019 alleged malpractice caused an increase in plaintiffs risk of suffering a stroke by 15 percentage points (5 percent risk without malpractice subtracted from 20 percent risk with malpractice).
