We hold that <em>Kreiner v Fischer, </em>471 Mich 109; 683 NW2d 611 (2004), was wrongly decided because it departed from the plain language of MCL 500.3135, and is therefore overruled. We further hold that, in this case, as a matter of law, plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of a body function. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the case to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">This case arises out of an injury that plaintiff, Rodney McCormick, suffered while working as a medium-duty truck loader at a General Motors Corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>(GM) plant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff s job mainly consisted of assisting in the loading of trucks, which required climbing up and around trucks and trailers, standing, walking, and heavy lifting. He generally worked 9- to 10-hour shifts, 6 days a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">On January 17, 2005, a coworker backed a truck into plaintiff, knocking him over, and then drove over plaintiffs left ankle. Plaintiff was immediately taken to the hospital, and x-rays showed a fracture of his left medial malleolus.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff was released from the hospital that day, and two days later metal hardware was surgically inserted into his ankle to stabilize plaintiffs bone fragments. Plaintiff was restricted from weight-bearing activities for one month after the surgery and then underwent multiple months of physical therapy. The metal hardware was removed in a second surgery on October 21, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">At defendant\u2019s request, plaintiff underwent a medical evaluation with Dr. Paul Drouillard in November 2005. He indicated that plaintiff could return to work but was restricted from prolonged standing or walking. On January 12, 2006, the specialist who performed plaintiffs surgeries cleared him to return to work without restrictions. The specialist\u2019s report noted that plaintiff had an \u201cexcellent range of motion,\u201d and an x-ray showed \u201csolid healing with on [sic] degenerative joint disease of his ankle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Beginning on January 16, 2006, plaintiff returned to work as a medium-duty truck loader for several days, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>but he had difficulty walking, climbing, and crouching because of continuing ankle pain. He requested that his job duties be restricted to driving, but defendant directed him to cease work.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Defendant required plaintiff to undergo a functional capacity evaluation (FCE) in March 2006. The FCE determined that plaintiff was unable to perform the range of tasks his job required, including stooping, crouching, climbing, sustained standing, and heavy lifting. This was due to ankle and shoulder pain,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a moderate limp, and difficulty bearing weight on his left ankle. The report stated that plaintiffs range of motion in his left ankle was not within normal limits and that difficulty climbing and lifting weights had been reported and observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">In May 2006, Dr. Drouillard examined plaintiff again and reported that plaintiff could return to work. Dr. Drouillard\u2019s report stated that plaintiff complained of ankle and foot pain, but the doctor found \u201cno objective abnormality to correspond with his subjective complaints.\u201d In June 2006, plaintiff also underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test, which showed some postoperative scar and degenerative tissue formation around his left ankle. At plaintiffs request, another FCE was performed on August 1, 2006, which affirmed that plaintiff could return to work without restriction and was capable of performing the tasks required for his job. The report stated that plaintiff complained of \u201coccasional aching\u201d and tightness in his ankle, but it did not appear to be aggravated by activities such as prolonged standing or walking. It also noted that plaintiffs range of motion in his left ankle was still not within normal limits, although it had improved since the March 2006 FCE.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Plaintiff returned to work on August 16, 2006, 19 months after he suffered his injury. He volunteered to be assigned to a different job, and his pay was not reduced. He has been able to perform his new job since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">On March 24,2006, plaintiff filed suit, seeking recovery for his injuries under MCL 500.3135. In his October 2006 deposition, plaintiff testified that at the time of the incident, he was a 49-year-old man and his normal life before the incident mostly consisted of working 60 hours a week as a medium-duty truck loader. He stated that he also was a \u201cweekend golfer\u201d and frequently fished in the spring and summer from a boat that he owns. He testified that he was fishing at pre-incident levels by the spring and summer of2006, but he has only golfed once since he returned to work.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He stated that he can drive and take care of his personal needs without assistance and that his relationship with his wife has not been affected. He stated that he has not sought medical treatment for his ankle since January 2006, when he was approved to return to work without restriction. He further testified that his life is \u201cpainful, but normal,\u201d although it is \u201climited,\u201d and he continues to experience ankle pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition on the basis that plaintiff had recovered relatively well and could not meet the serious impairment threshold provided in MCL 500.3135(1). The Court of Appeals affirmed, with one judge dissenting. <em>McCormick v </em>Carrier, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued March 25, 2008 (Docket No. 275888). The majority held that, under <em>Kreiner, </em>plaintiffs impairment did not affect his ability to lead his normal life because he is able to care for himself, fish and golf, and work at the same rate of pay. The dissent disagreed, arguing that two doctors had determined that the impairment would cause problems over plaintiffs entire life and his employer had determined that he could not perform his work duties, the main part of his \u201cnormal\u201d life.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">After initially denying leave to appeal, this Court granted plaintiffs motion for reconsideration, vacated its prior order, and granted the application for leave to appeal. <em>McCormick v Carrier, </em>485 Mich 851 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">This Court reviews a motion for summary disposition de novo. <em>In re Egbert R Smith Trust, </em>480 Mich 19, 23-24; 745 NW2d 754 (2008). The proper interpretation of a statute is a legal question that this Court also reviews de novo. <em>Herman v Berrien Co, </em>481 Mich 352, 358; 750 NW2d 570 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">The issue presented in this case is the proper interpretation of MCL 500.3135. We hold that <em>Kreiner </em>incorrectly interpreted MCL 500.3135 and is overruled because it is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s plain language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>and this opinion. Further, under the proper interpretation of the statute, plaintiff has demonstrated that, as a matter of law, he suffered a serious impairment of body function.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">A. OVERVIEW OF MCL 500.3135</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In 1973, the Michigan Legislature adopted the no-fault insurance act, MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq. </em>The act created a compulsory motor vehicle insurance program under which insureds may recover directly from their insurers, without regard to fault, for qualifying economic losses arising from motor vehicle incidents. See MCL 500.3101 and 500.3105. In exchange for ensuring certain and prompt recovery for economic loss, the act also limited tort liability. MCL 500.3135. See also <em>DiFranco v Pickard, </em>427 Mich 32, 40-41; 398 NW2d 896 (1986). The act was designed to remedy problems with the traditional tort system as it relates to automobile accidents. These included that \u201c[the contributory negligence liability scheme] denied benefits to a high percentage of motor vehicle accident victims, minor injuries were overcompensated, serious injuries were undercompensated, long payment delays were commonplace, the court system was overburdened, and those with low income and little education suffered discrimination.\u201d <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 579; 267 NW2d 72 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Under the act, tort liability for non-economic loss arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a qualifying motor vehicle is limited to a list of enumerated circumstances. MCL 500.3135(3). The act creates threshold requirements in MCL 500.3135(1), which has remained unchanged in all key aspects since the act was adopted. That subsection currently provides that \u201c[a] person remains subject to tort liability for noneconomic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>loss caused by his or her ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle only if the injured person has suffered death, serious impairment of body function, or permanent serious disfigurement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The threshold requirement at issue in this case is whether plaintiff has suffered \u201cserious impairment of body function.\u201d The act did not originally define this phrase. Accordingly, it initially fell to this Court to do so, and the result was a series of differing opinions. In <em>Cassidy v McGovern, </em>415 Mich 483, 502; 330 NW2d 22 (1982), this Court held that whether the serious impairment threshold is met is a question of law for the court to decide where there is no material disputed fact. It further held that in order to meet the threshold, the plaintiff must show an objectively manifested injury and an impairment of an important body function, which it defined as \u201can objective standard that looks to the effect of an injury on the person\u2019s general ability to live a normal life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505. This Court later in part modified and in part affirmed <em>Cassidy </em>in <em>DiFranco. </em>The <em>DiFranco </em>Court agreed that a plaintiff had to suffer an objectively manifested injury, but it rejected the <em>Cassidy </em>Court\u2019s determination that the impairment needed to be \u201cimportant\u201d and its definition of \u201cimportant.\u201d <em>DiFranco, </em>427 Mich at 61-67, 70-75. The <em>DiFranco </em>Court further held that whether the threshold is met is a question of law for the court only if there are no material disputed facts and the facts could not support conflicting inferences. <em>Id. </em>at 53-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In 1995, however, the Legislature intervened. It amended MCL 500.3135 to define a \u201cserious impairment of body function\u201d as \u201can objectively manifested impairment of an important body function that affects the person\u2019s general ability to lead his or her normal life.\u201d MCL 500.3135(7). The Legislature also expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>provided that whether a serious impairment of body function has occurred is a \u201cquestion^ of law\u201d for the court to decide unless there is a factual dispute regarding the nature and extent of injury and the dispute is relevant to deciding whether the standard is met. MCL 500.3135(2)(a). Thus, the Legislature incorporated some language from <em>DiFranco </em>and <em>Cassidy </em>but also made some significant changes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">This Court interpreted the amended provisions in 2004, in <em>Kreiner. </em>The question before this Court is whether the <em>Kreiner </em>majority properly interpreted the statute, and, if not, whether its interpretation should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">B. INTERPRETATION OF MCL 500.3135</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The primary goal of statutory construction is to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Briggs Tax Serv, LLC v Detroit Pub Sch, </em>485 Mich 69, 76; 780 NW2d 753 (2010). This Court begins by reviewing the language of the statute, and, if the language is clear and unambiguous, it is presumed that the Legislature intended the meaning expressed in the statute. <em>Id. </em>Judicial construction of an unambiguous statute is neither required nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>permitted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>In re MCI Telecom Complaint, </em>460 Mich 396, 411; 596 NW2d 164 (1999). When reviewing a statute, all non-technical \u201cwords and phrases shall be construed and understood according to the common and approved usage of the language,\u201d MCL 8.3a, and, if a term is not defined in the statute, a court may consult a dictionary to aid it in this goal, <em>Oakland Co Bd of Co Rd Comm\u2019rs v Mich Prop &amp; Cas Guaranty Ass\u2019n, </em>456 Mich 590, 604; 575 NW2d 751 (1998). A court should consider the plain meaning of a statute\u2019s words and their \u201c \u2018placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em>460 Mich 230, 237; 596 NW2d 119 (1999) (citation omitted). \u201cWhere the language used has been subject to judicial interpretation, the legislature is presumed to have used particular words in the sense in which they have been interpreted.\u201d <em>People v Powell, </em>280 Mich 699, 703; 274 NW 372 (1937). See also <em>People v Wright, </em>432 Mich 84, 92; 437 NW2d 603 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">1. A QUESTION OF LAW OR FACT UNDER MCL 500.3135(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The first step in interpreting MCL 500.3135 is to determine the proper role of a court in applying MCL 500.3135(1) and (7). The Legislature addressed this issue in the amended MCL 500.3135(2)(a), which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">The issues of whether an injured person has suffered serious impairment of body function or permanent serious disfigurement are questions of law for the court if the court finds either of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>(i) There is no factual dispute concerning the nature and extent of the person\u2019s injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\">(ii) There is a factual dispute concerning the nature and extent of the person\u2019s injuries, but the dispute is not material to the determination as to whether the person has suffered a serious impairment of body function or permanent serious disfigurement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Under the plain language of the statute, the threshold question whether the person has suffered a serious impairment of body function should be determined by the court as a matter of law as long as there is no factual dispute regarding \u201cthe nature and extent of the person\u2019s injuries\u201d that is material to determining whether the threshold standards are met.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If there is a material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>factual dispute regarding the nature and extent of the person\u2019s injuries, the court should not decide the issue as a matter of law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Notably, the disputed fact does not need to be outcome determinative in order to be material, but it should be \u201csignificant or essential to the issue or matter at hand.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th ed) (defining \u201cmaterial fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">2. A \u201cSERIOUS IMPAIRMENT OF BODY FUNCTION\u201d UNDER MCL 500.3135(1) AND (7)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">In those cases where the court may decide whether the serious impairment threshold is met as a matter of law, the next issue is the proper interpretation of MCL 500.3135(7). It provides that, for purposes of the section, a \u201cserious impairment of body function\u201d is \u201can objectively manifested impairment of an important body function that affects the person\u2019s general ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>lead his or her normal life.\u201d On its face, the statutory language provides three prongs that are necessary to establish a \u201cserious impairment of body function\u201d: (1) an objectively manifested impairment (2) of an important body function that (3) affects the person\u2019s general ability to lead his or her normal life.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Overall, because we conclude that each of these prongs\u2019 meaning is clear from the plain and unambiguous statutory language, judicial construction is neither required nor permitted. <em>In re MCI, </em>460 Mich at 411. Notably, however, a dictionary may aid the Court in giving the words and phrases in MCL 500.3135(7) their common meaning, and where the language used in MCL 500.3135(7) was originally adopted and interpreted in <em>Cassidy </em>and <em>DiFranco, </em>it may be presumed that the Legislature intended the previous judicial interpretation to be relevant. <em>Oakland Co Bd of Rd Comm\u2019rs, </em>456 Mich at 604; <em>Wright, </em>432 Mich at 92. As will be discussed within, where the <em>Kreiner </em>majority\u2019s interpretation of these prongs is inconsistent with the clear language of the statute, we hold that <em>Kreiner </em>was wrongly decided. Most significantly, its interpretation of the third prong deviates dramatically from the statute\u2019s text.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">a. AN OBJECTIVELY MANIFESTED IMPAIRMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Under the first prong, it must be established that the injured person has suffered an objectively manifested impairment of body function. The common meaning of \u201can objectively manifested impairment\u201d is apparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>from the unambiguous statutory language, with aid from a dictionary, and is consistent with the judicial interpretation of \u201cobjectively manifested\u201d in <em>Cassidy </em>and <em>DiFranco. </em>To the extent that the <em>Kreiner </em>majority\u2019s interpretation of this prong differs from this approach, it was wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">To begin with, the adverb \u201cobjectively\u201d is defined as \u201cin an objective manner,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(1966), and the adjective \u201cobjective\u201d is defined as \u201c1. Of or having to do with a material object as distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existence or reality. 3. a. Uninfluenced by emotion, surmise, or personal prejudice, b. Based on observable phenomena; presented factually\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition </em>(1982). It is defined specifically in the medical context as \u201c [indicating a symptom or condition perceived as a sign of disease by someone other than the person afflicted.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The verb \u201cmanifest\u201d is defined as \u201c1. To show or demonstrate plainly; reveal. 2. To be evidence of; prove.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Overall, these definitions suggest that the common meaning of \u201cobjectively manifested\u201d in MCL 500.3135(7) is an impairment that is evidenced by actual symptoms or conditions that someone other than the injured person would observe or perceive as impairing a body function. In other words, an \u201cobjectively manifested\u201d impairment is commonly understood as one observable or perceivable from actual symptoms or conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Notably, MCL 500.3135(7) does not contain the word \u201cinjury,\u201d and, under the plain language of the statute, the proper inquiry is whether the <em>impairment </em>is objectively manifested, not the <em>injury </em>or its symptoms.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This distinction is important because \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201cimpairment\u201d have different meanings. An \u201cinjury\u201d is \u201c1. Damage of or to a person.... 2. A wound or other specific damage.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition </em>(1982). \u201cImpairment\u201d is the \u201cstate of being impaired,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(1966), and to be \u201cimpaired\u201d means being \u201cweakened, diminished, or damaged\u201d or \u201cfunctioning poorly or inadequately,\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary </em>(1998). These definitions show that while an injury is the actual damage or wound, an impairment generally relates to the effect of that damage. Accordingly, when considering an \u201cimpairment,\u201d the focus \u201cis not on the injuries themselves, but how the injuries affected a particular body function.\u201d <em>DiFranco, </em>427 Mich at 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Further, the pre-existing judicial interpretation of \u201cobjectively manifested\u201d is consistent with the plain language of the later-adopted statute. In <em>Cassidy, </em>this Court explained that the serious impairment threshold was not met by pain and suffering alone, but also required \u201cinjuries that affect the functioning of the body,\u201d i.e., \u201cobjectively manifested injuries.\u201d <em>Cassidy, </em>415 Mich at 505. In other words, <em>Cassidy </em>defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u201cobjectively manifested\u201d to mean affecting the functioning of the body.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>DiFranco </em>affirmed this and further explained that the \u201cobjectively manifested\u201d requirement signifies that plaintiffs must \u201cintroduce evidence establishing that there is a physical basis for their subjective complaints of pain and suffering\u201d and that showing an impairment generally requires medical testimony. <em>DiFranco, </em>427 Mich at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The <em>Kreiner </em>majority\u2019s interpretation of this language was only partially consistent with the plain language of the statute. It addressed this issue briefly, stating that \u201c[sjubjective complaints that are not medically documented are insufficient [to establish that an impairment is objectively manifested].\u201d <em>Kreiner, </em>471 Mich at 132. To the extent that this is inconsistent with DiFranco\u2019s statement that medical <em>testimony </em>will <em>generally </em>be required to establish an impairment, it is at odds with the legislative intent expressed by the adoption of the \u201cobjectively manifested\u201d language from <em>DiFranco </em>and <em>Cassidy. </em>Thus, to the extent that <em>Kreiner </em>could be read to <em>always </em>require medical documentation, it goes beyond the legislative intent expressed in the plain statutory text, and was wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">b. OF AN IMPORTANT BODY FUNCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">If there is an objectively manifested impairment of body function, the next question is whether the impaired body function is \u201cimportant.\u201d The common meaning of this phrase is expressed in the unambiguous statutory language, although reference to a dictionary and limited reference to <em>Cassidy </em>is helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>The relevant definition of the adjective \u201cimportant\u201d is \u201c[m]arked by or having great value, significance, or consequence.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition </em>(1982). See also <em>Random House Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary </em>(1998), defining \u201cimportant\u201d in relevant part as \u201cof much or great significance or consequence,\u201d \u201cmattering much,\u201d or \u201cprominent or large.\u201d Whether a body function has great \u201cvalue,\u201d \u201csignificance,\u201d or \u201cconsequence\u201d will vary depending on the person. Therefore, this prong is an inherently subjective inquiry that must be decided on a case-by-case basis, because what may seem to be a trivial body function for most people may be subjectively important to some, depending on the relationship of that function to the person\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The \u201cimportant body function\u201d language was originally adopted in <em>Cassidy, </em>where the Court stated that an \u201cimportant\u201d body function is not <em>any </em>body function but also does not refer to the <em>entire </em>body function. <em>Cassidy, </em>415 Mich at 504. This pre-existing judicial construction of \u201cimportant body function\u201d is consistent with the common meaning of \u201cimportant.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">For this prong, the <em>Kreiner </em>majority\u2019s interpretation appears to be consistent with the plain language of the statute, as it only briefly stated that \u201c[i]t is insufficient if the impairment is of an unimportant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>body function.\u201d <em>Kreiner, </em>471 Mich at 132.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If, however, the <em>Kreiner </em>majority\u2019s position has been construed in a manner that is inconsistent with this opinion, then we disapprove of those constructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">c. THAT AFFECTS THE PERSON\u2019S GENERAL ABILITY TO LEAD HIS OR HER NORMAL LIFE</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Finally, if the injured person has suffered an objectively manifested impairment of body function, and that body function is important to that person, then the court must determine whether the impairment \u201caffects the person\u2019s general ability to lead his or her normal life.\u201d The common meaning of this phrase is expressed by the unambiguous statutory language, and its interpretation is aided by reference to a dictionary, reading the phrase within its statutory context, and limited reference to <em>Cassidy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">To begin with, the verb \u201caffect\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]o have an influence on; bring about a change in.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition </em>(1982). An \u201cability\u201d is \u201c[t]he quality of being able to do something,\u201d <em>id., </em>and \u201cable\u201d is defined as \u201chaving sufficient power, skill, or resources to accomplish an object,\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary </em>&lt;http://www.merriam-webster.com&gt; (accessed May 27, 2010). The adjective \u201cgeneral\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">1. Relating to, concerned with, or applicable to the whole or every member of a class or category. 2. Affecting or characteristic of the majority of those involved; prevalent: <em>a general discontent. </em>3. Being usually the case; true or applicable in most instances but not all. 4. a. Not limited in scope, area, or application: .as <em>a general rule. </em>b. Not limited to one class of things: <em>general studies. 5. </em>Involving only the main features of something rather than details or particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>lars. 6. Highest or superior in rank. <em>[The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition </em>(1982).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The sixth definition is obviously irrelevant, and the first definition of \u201cgeneral\u201d does not make sense in this context because a person\u2019s \u201cwhole\u201d ability to live his or her normal life is surely not affected short of complete physical and mental incapacitation, which is accounted for in a different statutory threshold: death. The other definitions, however, more or less convey the same meaning: that \u201cgeneral\u201d does not refer to only one specific detail or particular part of a thing, but, at least some parts of it. Thus, these definitions illustrate that to \u201caffect\u201d the person\u2019s \u201cgeneral ability\u201d to lead his or her normal life is to influence some of the person\u2019s power or skill, i.e., the person\u2019s capacity, to lead a normal life.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The next question is the meaning of \u201cto lead his or her normal life.\u201d The verb \u201clead,\u201d in this context, is best defined as \u201c[t]o pass or go through; live.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition </em>(1982). Although the verb \u201clead\u201d has many definitions, some of which have similar nuances, this definition is the most relevant because it expressly applies in the context of leading a certain type of life. Indeed, other dictionaries provide a similar definition with the same context, using a \u201ctype of life\u201d as an example.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Similarly, \u201clife\u201d has multiple meanings, but one specifically references the context of leading a particular type of life, which is \u201c[a] manner of living: <em>led a good life.\u201d Id. </em>Other definitions are similar, such as \u201c[t]he physical, mental, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>and spiritual experiences that constitute a person\u2019s existence,\u201d or \u201c[h]uman existence or activity in general.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given the contextual examples used in the dictionary, the common understanding of \u201cto lead his or her normal life\u201d is to live, or pass life, in his or her normal manner of living.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Therefore, the plain text of the statute and these definitions demonstrate that the common understanding of to \u201caffect the person\u2019s ability to lead his or her normal life\u201d is to have an influence on some of the person\u2019s capacity to live in his or her normal manner of living. By modifying \u201cnormal life\u201d with \u201chis or her,\u201d the Legislature indicated that this requires a subjective, person- and fact-specific inquiry that must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Determining the effect or influence that the impairment has had on a plaintiffs ability to lead a normal life necessarily requires a comparison of the plaintiffs life before and after the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">There are several important points to note, however, with regard to this comparison. First, the statute merely requires that a person\u2019s general ability to lead his or her normal life has been <em>affected, </em>not destroyed. Thus, courts should consider not only whether the impairment has led the person to completely cease a pre-incident activity or lifestyle element, but also whether, although a person is able to lead his or her pre-incident normal life, the person\u2019s general ability to do so was nonetheless affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Second, and relatedly, \u201cgeneral\u201d modifies <em>\u201cability,\u201d </em>not \u201caffect\u201d or \u201cnormal life.\u201d Thus, the plain language of the statute only requires that some of the person\u2019s <em>ability </em>to live in his or her normal manner of living has been affected, not that some of the person\u2019s normal manner of living has itself been affected. Thus, while the extent to which a person\u2019s general ability to live his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>or her normal life is affected by an impairment is undoubtedly related to what the person\u2019s normal manner of living is, there is no quantitative minimum as to the percentage of a person\u2019s normal manner of living that must be affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Third, and finally, the statute does not create an express temporal requirement as to how long an impairment must last in order to have an effect on \u201cthe person\u2019s general ability to live his or her normal life.\u201d To begin with, there is no such requirement in the plain language of the statute. Further, MCL 500.3135(1) provides that the threshold for liability is met \u201cif the injured person has suffered death, serious impairment of body function, or permanent serious disfigurement.\u201d While the Legislature required that a \u201cserious disfigurement\u201d be \u201cpermanent,\u201d it did not impose the same restriction on a \u201cserious impairment of body function.\u201d Finally, to the extent that this prong\u2019s language reflects a legislative intent to adopt this portion of <em>Cassidy </em>in some measure,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Cassidy </em>expressly rejected a requirement of permanency to meet the serious impairment threshold. <em>Cassidy, </em>415 Mich at 505-506 (noting that \u201ctwo broken bones, 18 days of hospitalization, 7 months of wearing casts during which dizzy spells further affected his mobility, and at least a minor residual effect one and one-half years later are sufficiently serious to meet the threshold requirement of serious impairment of body function\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Despite the fact that the language of the statute was plain, the <em>Kreiner </em>majority deviated significantly from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>the statutory text in its interpretation of this prong. To begin with, the <em>Kreiner </em>majority erred in its interpretation of the phrase \u201cthat affects the person\u2019s general ability\u201d for two reasons. First, it selectively quoted only the dictionary definitions of \u201cgeneral\u201d that best supported its conclusions. It gave one definition for this word, \u201c \u2018the whole; the total; that which comprehends or relates to all, or the chief part; a general proposition, fact, principle, etc.; \u2014 opposed to particular; that is, opposed to special,\u2019 \u201d and then relied on definitions of \u201cin general\u201d and \u201cgenerally\u201d to conclude that \u201cgeneral\u201d means \u201c \u2018for the most part.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kreiner, </em>471 Mich at 130, quoting <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary. Webster\u2019s, </em>however, offers <em>10 </em>definitions of the adjective \u201cgeneral,\u201d many of which are similar to definitions quoted above from <em>The American Heritage Dictionary. </em>Moreover, of these 10 definitions, the majority chose the most restrictive, even though, as discussed above, it does not make the most sense in this context. And, even then, the <em>Kreiner </em>majority looked to other forms of the word. Second, the <em>Kreiner </em>majority stated that \u201c[t]he starting point in analyzing whether an impairment affects a person\u2019s \u2018general,\u2019 i.e., overall, ability to lead his normal life should be identifying how his life has been affected, by how much, and for how long.\u201d <em>Kreiner, </em>471 Mich at 131. Although other portions of the <em>Kreiner </em>majority opinion more carefully stated that the test was the effect on a person\u2019s general ability, this particular reasoning could be pulled out of context to suggest that courts should focus on how much the impairment affects a person\u2019s <em>life, </em>instead of how much it affects the person\u2019s <em>ability </em>to live his or her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Further, the <em>Kreiner </em>majority significantly erred in its interpretation of \u201cto lead his or her normal life.\u201d It relied on a dictionary to define \u201clead\u201d as \u201cto conduct or bring in a particular course.\u201d Notably, depending on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>how this definition is interpreted, it may have a similar meaning to \u201clive\u201d or \u201cpass\u201d when \u201cconduct\u201d and \u201ccourse\u201d are given a certain meaning. \u201cConduct\u201d can mean \u201cto behave or act,\u201d and \u201ccourse\u201d can mean \u201c[a] mode of action or behavior\u201d or \u201c[a] typical or natural manner of proceeding or developing: customary passage .. . .\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition </em>(1982). The meaning of \u201cto behave or act in his or her typical or natural manner of proceeding\u201d may be similar to \u201cliving in his or her normal manner of living.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Beyond this point, however, the <em>Kreiner </em>majority went astray and gave the statute a labored interpretation inconsistent with common meanings and common sense. Applying its chosen definition of \u201clead,\u201d the majority concluded that \u201cthe effect of the impairment on the course of a plaintiffs entire normal life must be considered,\u201d and if \u201cthe course or trajectory of the plaintiffs normal life has not been affected, then the plaintiffs \u2018general ability\u2019 to lead his normal life has not been affected. . . .\u201d <em>Kreiner, </em>471 Mich at 131. In other words, the <em>Kreiner </em>majority held that the \u201ccommon meaning\u201d of whether an impairment has affected \u201cthe person\u2019s general ability to lead his or her normal life\u201d is whether it has affected the person\u2019s general ability to conduct the course or trajectory of his or her entire normal life. This \u201ccommon meaning\u201d is quite different from the actual statutory text in form and substance. Significantly, the <em>Kreiner </em>majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute interjects two terms that are not included in the statute <em>or </em>the dictionary definitions of the relevant statutory language: \u201ctrajectory\u201d and <em>\u201centire.\u201d </em>Both terms create ambiguity where the original statutory text had none, and the <em>Kreiner </em>majority thus erred by selectively defining the words used in definitions of statutory terms in order to shift away <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>from the common meaning that the words have in the context of MCL 500.3135(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">As to the first addition, while \u201ctrajectory\u201d is a synonym for \u201ccourse\u201d when \u201ccourse\u201d is defined as, for example, \u201c[t]he direction of continuing movement,\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition </em>(1982), it is not a synonym for the definition of \u201ccourse\u201d that makes sense in the context of defining a \u201cgeneral ability to lead his or her normal life.\u201d When \u201cconduct\u201d is used with this definition of \u201ccourse,\u201d it has the very different meaning of \u201c[t]o direct the course of; control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plain language of the statute does not suggest that the Legislature\u2019s intent was to address the effect of an impairment on the person\u2019s ability to control the direction of their life, as opposed to its effect on the person\u2019s ability to live in his or her normal manner of living. Yet the majority managed to imply this meaning by inserting \u201ctrajectory\u201d as a synonym for \u201ccourse,\u201d thereby shifting the meaning of \u201ccourse\u201d from the most natural contextual reading of the word. The use of \u201ctrajectory\u201d and the suggestion that \u201ccourse\u201d should be understood to mean \u201cthe direction of continuing movement,\u201d instead of \u201ca mode of action or behavior,\u201d creates ambiguity by implying a sense of permanence that is inconsistent with, and does not make sense in the context of, the actual statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">As to the second addition, the majority modified the statutory language \u201chis or her normal life\u201d with \u201centire,\u201d a modification that it apparently created out of thin air,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> thereby creating an ambiguity that had not previously existed in the statutory text. The word \u201clife\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>has more than one meaning. As noted, it can refer to the meaning that would be commonly understood to apply in the context of the statutory language, which is <em>\u201ca </em>manner of living.\u201d It also can refer to \u201c[t]he interval of time between birth and death; lifetime.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition </em>(1982). The differences are significant: whereas the first meaning refers to the day-to-day process of living, the second is a finite measure that encompasses all of one\u2019s time on earth. Although \u201centire\u201d could modify either meaning of \u201clife,\u201d it is probably more commonly used to modify the second. Thus, by inserting \u201centire,\u201d the <em>Kreiner </em>majority created an ambiguity that is not present in the original statutory text because the second, finite definition of \u201clife\u201d does not make sense in the context of the actual statutory language. It would be unusual to refer to someone\u2019s general ability to lead his or her normal \u201clifetime\u201d or \u201cinterval of time between life and death.\u201d At best, this would seem to refer to an effect on the person\u2019s life expectancy, but this would not be a subjective inquiry, and it is an impossible leap from any common understanding of the statutory language.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> At a minimum, using the modifier \u201centire\u201d reinforces the general sense of permanence that is also created by the insertion of \u201ctrajectory,\u201d but which, as explained, is not in the actual statutory text. Because the <em>Kreiner </em>majority created ambiguity where there was none, and crafted a statutory interpretation that is, in effect, a judicially constructed house of cards, we hold that it incorrectly interpreted the third prong of MCL 500.3135(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The <em>Kreiner </em>majority aggravated this error, and departed even more dramatically from the statutory text, by providing an extra-textual \u201cnonexhaustive list <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>of objective factors\u201d to be used to compare the plaintiffs pre- and post-incident lifestyle. These factors are: \u201c(a) the nature and extent of the impairment, (b) the type and length of treatment required, (c) the duration of the impairment, (d) the extent of any residual impairment, and (e) the prognosis for eventual recovery.\u201d <em>Kreiner, </em>471 Mich at 133.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Legislature has unambiguously defined the \u201cserious impairment of body function,\u201d and the role of this Court is to apply the plain language of that definition, not to improve it with a list of judicially created factors that are not necessarily based in the statute\u2019s text. In fact, at least some of the <em>Kreiner </em>majority\u2019s factors have no basis in the statutory text and are instead derived from its extra-textual and extra-definitional additions to the actual statutory language, \u201centire\u201d and \u201ctrajectory,\u201d and serve to reinforce the ambiguity that its interpretation of the third prong created, especially given that all of the factors expressly or impliedly include a temporal component. Because the factors adopted by the <em>Kreiner </em>majority are not based in the statutory text, and this Court\u2019s role is to apply the unambiguous statutory language, not improve it, we hold that the majority erred by adopting them.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>In summary, the <em>Kreiner </em>majority\u2019s interpretation of the third prong departed from the idea that a court \u201cshould not casually read anything into an unambiguous statute that is not within the manifest intent of the Legislature as derived from the words of the statute.\u201d <em>Kreiner, </em>471 Mich at 157 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting). Indeed, as I remarked in dissent, the <em>Kreiner </em>majority\u2019s \u201cinterpretation\u201d of the plain language of MCL 500.3135(7) was a \u201cchilling reminder that activism comes in all guises, including so-called textualism.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we hold that the <em>Kreiner </em>majority\u2019s interpretation of this prong, including the list of non-exhaustive factors, is not based in the statute\u2019s text and is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">3. STARE DECISIS: SHOULD <em>KREINER </em>BE OVERRULED?</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">To the extent that the <em>Kreiner </em>majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute was inconsistent with the foregoing approach, and departed from the legislative intent expressed in the unambiguous language of the statute, we hold that it was wrongly decided. Given this conclusion, the question is whether it should be overruled. We hold that it should be.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Under the doctrine of stare decisis, \u201cprinciples of law deliberately examined and decided by a court of compe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>tent jurisdiction should not be lightly departed.\u201d <em>Brown v Manistee Co Rd Comm, </em>452 Mich 354, 365; 550 NW2d 215 (1996) (citations and quotation marks omitted). Indeed, in order to \u201c \u2018avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that [courts] should be bound down by strict rules and precedents which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them ....\u2019\u201d <em>Petersen v Magna Corp, </em>484 Mich 300, 314-315; 773 NW2d 564 (2009) (opinion by KELLY, C.J.), quoting The Federalist No. 78, p 471 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed, 1961). As the United States Supreme Court has stated, the doctrine \u201cpromotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Payne v Tennessee, </em>501 US 808, 827; 111 S Ct 2597; 115 L Ed 2d 720 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Despite its importance, stare decisis is neither an \u201cinexorable command,\u201d <em>Lawrence v Texas, </em>539 US 558, 577; 123 S Ct 2472; 156 L Ed 2d 508 (2003), nor \u201ca mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision,\u201d <em>Helvering v Hallock, </em>309 US 106, 119; 60 S <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Ct 444; 84 L Ed 604 (1940). Ultimately, it is an attempt \u201cto balance two competing considerations: the need of the community for stability in legal rules and decisions and the need of courts to correct past errors.\u201d <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 314. As a reflection of this balance, there is a presumption in favor of upholding precedent, but this presumption may be rebutted if there is a special or compelling justification to overturn precedent. <em>Id. </em>at 319-320. In determining whether a special or compelling justification exists, a number of evaluative criteria may be relevant, <em>id., </em>but overturning precedent requires more than a mere belief that a case was wrongly decided, see <em>Brown, </em>452 Mich at 365.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In determining whether <em>Kreiner </em>should be overruled, I find several evaluative criteria particularly relevant: (1) \u201cwhether the rule has proven to be intolerable because it defies practical workability,\u201d (2) \u201cwhether reliance on the rule is such that overruling it would cause a special hardship and inequity,\u201d (3) \u201cwhether upholding the rule is likely to result in serious detriment prejudicial to public interests,\u201d and (4) \u201cwhether the prior decision was an abrupt and largely unexplained departure from precedent.\u201d <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 320. As applied here, on the balance, these criteria weigh in favor of overturning <em>Kreiner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The first criterion weighs heavily in favor of overruling <em>Kreiner </em>because the <em>Kreiner </em>majority\u2019s departure from the plain language of MCL 500.3135(7) defies practical workability. As discussed above, the majority took unambiguous statutory text and, through linguistic gymnastics, contorted it into a confusing and am<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>biguous test. Appellate litigation arising out of MCL 500.3135(7) has greatly increased since Kreiner<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and has resulted in confusion. To begin with, the lower courts\u2019 application of <em>Kreiner </em>has led to inconsistent interpretation of the statutory language, with similarly situated plaintiffs being treated differently by different courts.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Further, some courts have interpreted <em>Kreiner </em>as having created a threshold that is higher than that in <em>Cassidy </em>or <em>DiFranco, </em>primarily by reading the <em>Kreiner </em>majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute to effectively create a permanency requirement.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> As discussed, this is contrary to the legislative intent expressed by the plain language of the statute. Because the <em>Kreiner </em>majority\u2019s interpretation of the third prong of MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>500.3135(7) has created ambiguity where there was none, and increased litigation and confusion, the first factor weighs heavily in favor of overruling <em>Kreiner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Second, correcting the errors in the <em>Kreiner </em>majority\u2019s interpretation of MCL 500.3135(7) would not present an undue hardship to reliance interests, and this factor weighs in favor of overruhng <em>Kreiner. </em>As this Court has explained when evaluating a similar factor in the past, \u201cthe Court must ask whether the previous decision has become so embedded, so accepted, so fundamental, to everyone\u2019s expectations that to change it would produce not just readjustments, but practical real-world dislocations.\u201d <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439, 466; 613 NW2d 307 (2000). It further stated that this factor applies to cases that if overruled, \u201ceven if they were wrongfully decided, would produce chaos.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466 n 26. <em>Kreiner </em>is not \u201cso\u201d embedded, accepted, or fundamental to expectations that chaos will result from overruhng it. To begin with, <em>Kreiner </em>was decided only six years ago, and, while it was the first opinion from this Court interpreting MCL 500.3135(7), it was contrary to the plain text of the statute, which had been in place since 1995. As the <em>Robinson </em>majority explained, people normally rely on the words of the statute itself when looking for guidance on how to direct their actions. <em>Robinson, </em>462 Mich at 467. Further, it is unlikely that motor vehicle drivers, and the victims of motor vehicle accidents, have altered their behavior in reliance on <em>Kreiner. </em>As noted by the <em>Robinson </em>majority, where a statute deals with the consequences of accidents, \u201cit seems incontrovertible that only after the accident would... awareness [of this Court\u2019s caselaw] come,\u201d and \u201cafter-the-fact awareness does not rise to the level of a rebanee interest because to have rebanee the knowledge must be of the sort that causes a person or entity to attempt to conform his conduct to a certain norm before the triggering event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466-467. Similarly, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>statute generally involves motor vehicle accidents, and it strains credibility to think that the average driver and the average future injured party have altered their behavior in reliance on <em>Kreiner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The third criterion, the effect on the public interest, also weighs in favor of overruling <em>Kreiner. </em>Although there may be policy arguments on both sides regarding the costs and benefits of having a more or less difficult threshold for recovery under MCL 500.3135, our interpretation of the statute in this case is truer to the statute\u2019s text than that of the <em>Kreiner </em>majority, and, thus, our interpretation most closely reflects the policy balance struck by the Legislature.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In contrast, <em>Kreiner </em>altered the balance from that intended by the Legislature by imposing extra-textual burdens to meeting the threshold, and, as a result, it is difficult to argue that overruling <em>Kreiner </em>to restore the balance intended by the Legislature would hurt the public interest (or that affirming <em>Kreiner </em>serves it).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Finally, the fourth criterion is neutral. <em>Kreiner </em>was not an abrupt change from precedent, but it did provide an interpretation of the statute that was not obvious from the statute\u2019s text.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">On the basis of these evaluative criteria, we hold that <em>Kreiner </em>should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>4. SUMMARY OF LEGISLATIVE TEST</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">On the basis of the foregoing, the proper interpretation of the clear and unambiguous language in MCL 500.3135 creates the following test.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">To begin with, the court should determine whether there is a factual dispute regarding the nature and the extent of the person\u2019s injuries and, if so, whether the dispute is material to determining whether the serious impairment of body function threshold is met. MCL 500.3135(2) (a)(\u00bf) and (ii).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> If there is no factual dispute, or no material factual dispute, then whether the threshold is met is a question of law for the court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">If the court may decide the issue as a matter of law, it should next determine whether the serious impairment threshold has been crossed. The unambiguous language of MCL 500.3135(7) provides three prongs that are necessary to establish a \u201cserious impairment of body function\u201d: (1) an objectively manifested impairment (observable or perceivable from actual symptoms or conditions) (2) of an important body function (a body function of value, significance, or consequence to the injured person) that (3) affects the person\u2019s general ability to lead his or her normal life (influences some of the plaintiffs capacity to live in his or her normal manner of living).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The serious impairment analysis is inherently fact- and circumstance-specific and must be conducted on a case-by-case basis. As stated in the <em>Kreiner </em>dissent, \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Legislature recognized that what is important to one is not important to all[;] a brief impairment may be devastating whereas a near permanent impairment may have little effect.\u201d <em>Kreiner, </em>471 Mich at 145 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting). As such, the analysis does not \u201clend itself to any bright-line rule or imposition of [a] nonexhaustive list of factors,\u201d particularly where there is no basis in the statute for such factors. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, because \u201c[t]he Legislature avoided drawing lines in the sand... so must we.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">C. APPLICATION OF MCL 500.3135</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Under the facts of this case, we hold that plaintiff has met the serious impairment threshold as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">To begin with, there is no factual dispute that is material to determining whether the serious impairment threshold is met. The parties do not dispute that plaintiff suffered a broken ankle, was completely restricted from bearing weight on his ankle for a month, and underwent two surgeries over a 10-month period and multiple months of physical therapy. The parties do dispute the extent to which plaintiff continues to suffer a residual impairment and the potential for increased susceptibility to degenerative arthritis. Plaintiff has provided at least some evidence of a physical basis for his subjective complaints of pain and suffering,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> but defendant disputes whether there is persuasive evidence of impairment beyond plaintiffs subjective complaints. This dispute is not significant or essential to determining whether the serious impairment threshold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>is met in this case, however, because plaintiff has not alleged that the residual impairment, to the extent that it exists, continues to affect his general ability to lead his pre-incident \u201cnormal life,\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> the third prong of the analysis. Moreover, it is not necessary to establish the first two prongs. Therefore, the dispute is not material and does not prevent this Court from deciding whether the threshold is met as a matter of law under MCL 500.3135(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The other facts material to determining whether the serious impairment threshold is met are also undisputed.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Before the incident, plaintiffs \u201cnormal life\u201d consisted primarily of working 60 hours a week as a medium-duty truck loader. Plaintiff also frequently fished in the spring and summer and was a weekend golfer. After the incident, plaintiff was unable to return to work for at least 14 months and did not return for 19 months. He never returned to his original job as a medium-duty truck loader, but he suffered no loss in pay because of the change in job. He was able to fish at pre-incident levels by the spring of 2006 and is able to take care of his personal needs at the same level as before the incident. There is no allegation that the impairment of body function has affected his relationship with his significant other or other qualitative aspects of his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Next, in light of the lack of a factual dispute that is material to determining whether the threshold is met, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>under MCL 500.3135(2)(a), this Court should decide as a matter of law whether plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of body function under the three prongs of MCL 500.3135(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">With regard to the first prong, plaintiff has shown an objectively manifested impairment of body function. There is no dispute that plaintiff has presented evidence that he suffered a broken ankle and actual symptoms or conditions that someone else would perceive as impairing body functions, such as walking, crouching, climbing, and lifting weight. Even 14 months after the incident, an FCE report observed that ankle pain and a reduced range of motion inhibited these body functions. Thus, plaintiff has satisfied this prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">With regard to the second prong, the impaired body functions were important to plaintiff. His testimony establishes that being unable to walk and perform other functions were of consequence to his ability to work. Thus, the second prong of MCL 500.3135(7) is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The next question in this case is whether the third prong is met, but we hold that plaintiff has shown that the impairment affected his general ability to lead his normal life because it influenced some of his capacity to live in his normal, pre-incident manner of living. Before the incident, plaintiffs normal manner of living consisted primarily of working, for 60 hours a week, and secondarily of enjoying his hobbies of fishing and golfing. After the incident, at least some of plaintiffs capacity to live in this manner was affected. Specifically, for a month after the incident, plaintiff could not bear weight on his left ankle. He underwent two surgeries over a period of 10 months and multiple months of physical therapy. Moreover, his capacity to work, the central part of his pre-incident \u201cnormal life,\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>affected.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Whereas before the incident he spent most of his time working, after the incident he was unable to perform functions necessary for his job for at least 14 months, and he did not return to work for 19 months.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> On the basis of these facts, we conclude that some of plaintiffs capacity to live in his pre-incident manner of living was affected, and the third prong of MCL 500.3135(7) is satisfied.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Because all three prongs of MCL 500.3135(7) are satisfied, we hold, as a matter of law, that plaintiff has met the serious impairment threshold requirement under MCL 500.3135(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">D. RESPONSE TO THE DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Despite the dissent\u2019s length, it provides very little substantive disagreement or criticism of the statutory interpretation presented in this opinion and very little response to our criticisms of the statutory interpretation in <em>Kreiner. </em>Where the dissent does actually address the substance of the opinion, its criticisms are often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>based not on the <em>actual </em>holdings of the majority opinion but, instead, on the dissent\u2019s misunderstandings or overgeneralizations of those holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">For example, the dissent complains that the majority \u201cresuscitate[s]\u201d my opinion in DiFranco.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> As a result, the dissent resuscitates old criticisms of <em>DiFranco </em>and attacks the majority for failing to recognize the Legislature\u2019s intent, as expressed in the statute\u2019s legislative history, to reject <em>DiFranco </em>in favor of <em>Cassidy.</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As is plainly evident in the analysis, however, this opinion faithfully applies the text of the statute, even where that text is inconsistent with <em>DiFranco. </em>The opinion fully recognizes the Legislature\u2019s adoption of <em>Cassidy </em>where the Legislature indicated an intent to do so <em>through the text of the statute </em>and \u201cresuscitates\u201d <em>Di-Franco </em>only in the narrow places where, similarly, the statutory text indicates a legislative intent to do so.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Additionally, the dissent\u2019s comments on the majority\u2019s lack of use of legislative history are ill-founded on two levels. First, contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion that I have \u201cnever questioned [the] utility\u201d of legislative history and that \u201cthere is no principled reason\u201d not to use it in this case, I have repeatedly stated that legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>history should only be used to interpret a statute when statutory language is ambiguous. See, e.g., <em>People v Gardner, </em>482 Mich 41; 753 NW2d 78 (2008) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting); <em>Bukowski v Detroit, </em>478 Mich 268; 732 NW2d 75 (2007) (CAVANAGH, J., concurring); <em>Lansing Mayor v Pub Serv Comm, </em>470 Mich 154, 174; 680 NW2d 840 (2004) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The statutory language at issue here is not ambiguous.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Second, even if legislative history should be used, our application of the plain language of the statute is consistent with the House legislative analysis\u2019s statement that the amendments were intended to return the law to a threshold \u201cresem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>bling\u201d <em>Cassidy. </em>House Legislative Analysis, HB 4341, December 18, 1995. The dissent\u2019s statements to the contrary are, again, largely based on its mistaken characterization of the majority opinion as resuscitating <em>DiFranco </em>and ignoring <em>Cassidy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The dissent also repeatedly states that the majority opinion holds that temporal considerations are \u201cwholly or largely irrelevant\u201d to the serious impairment threshold, and, accordingly, it spends a significant amount of energy explaining why temporal considerations are relevant and accusing the majority of holding that the threshold is met if the \u201cplaintiffs general ability to lead his normal life has been affected for even a single moment in time....\u201d Contrary to the dissent\u2019s cries, there is simply no basis in our analysis for concluding that we hold that temporal considerations are irrelevant or that a momentary impairment is sufficient. This opinion merely notes that there is no specific <em>express </em>temporal requirement in the text of the statute and rejects Kreiner\u2019s strained attempts to insert what was essentially a permanency requirement into the statute.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The dissent\u2019s mistaken characterizations of this opinion amount to nothing more than, like <em>Kreiner </em>itself, yet another attempt to distract courts and parties from the <em>actual </em>text of MCL 500.3135.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">We hold that <em>Kreiner </em>should be overruled because the <em>Kreiner </em>majority\u2019s interpretation of MCL 500.3135 departed from the statute\u2019s clear and unambiguous text. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Applying the unambiguous statutory language, we hold that as a matter of law, in this case, plaintiff established that he suffered a serious impairment of body function. Thus, we reverse the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b263-4\">Kelly, C.J., and Weaver (except for part III[B][3]) and Hathaway, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-8\"> The only defendant remaining at this point in the case is GM\u2019s indemnitor, Allied Automotive Group, Inc, because the parties have stipulated the release of the other original defendants.

Defendant has alleged that plaintiff was able to fish while he was not working, but the only factual support it cites is plaintiffs statement that he fished in the six or seven months after January 2006, which was when he was initially cleared to return to work, and when he actually returned to work. Although plaintiffs counsel agreed in the arguments before the trial court that plaintiff had been fishing, it was unclear as to what time period he was referring. In plaintiffs brief to this Court, he alleges that by the time of his deposition, he had \u201creturned\u201d to fishing with the same frequency as before the accident, which suggests that plaintiff might be arguing that his fishing activities were interrupted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b231-8\"> Some courts have broadly stated that the Legislature rejected <em>DiFranco </em>in favor of <em>Cassidy, </em>see <em>Kreiner, </em>471 Mich at 121 n 8, but that is an oversimplification. Some of the language adopted by the Legislature was used consistently in <em>both DiFranco </em>and <em>Cassidy, </em>and the Legislature clearly rejected some elements of <em>Cassidy. </em>The similarities and differences between <em>DiFranco </em>and <em>Cassidy </em>and the amendments of MCL 500.3135 will be discussed below to the extent that they are significant. Although the dissent disagrees in the abstract with my statement that it is an oversimplification to state that the Legislature merely rejected <em>DiFranco </em>in favor of <em>Cassidy, </em>I can only conclude that it is unable to support this accusation with any specific, substantive arguments, given that it fails to expressly address or reject my more nuanced analysis of each of the specific phrases that the Legislature adopted or rejected from <em>Cassidy </em>and <em>DiFranco.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b232-8\"> This Court\u2019s members disagree on when a statute is ambiguous. See <em>Petersen v Magna Corp, </em>484 Mich 300, 310-313; 773 NW2d 564 (2009) (opinion by Kelly, C.J.); <em>id. </em>at 339-342 (opinion by Hathaway, J.). We need not address that issue here because MCL 500.3135 is unambiguous under any of the views.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b233-6\"> Notably, MCL 500.3135(2)(a) could unconstitutionally conflict with MCR 2.116(0(10) in those cases wherein a court is required to (1) resolve material, disputed facts with regard to issues <em>other </em>than the nature and extent of the injury, such as the extent to which the injury actually impairs a body function or the injured party relied on that function as part of his or her pre-accident life, or (2) decide whether the threshold is met even though reasonable people could draw different conclusions from the facts. See <em>Skinner v Square D Co, </em>445 Mich 153, 161-162; 516 NW2d 475 (1994), and <em>Henderson v State Farm Fire &amp; Cas Co, </em>460 Mich 348, 357; 596 NW2d 190 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Given that the allocation of decision-making authority between a judge and a jury is \u201ca quintessentially procedural determination,\u201d <em>Shropshire v Laidlaw Transit, Inc, </em>550 F3d 570, 573 (CA 6, 2008), this potential conflict raises questions as to whether the Legislature may have unconstitutionally invaded this Court\u2019s exclusive authority to promulgate the court rules of practice and procedure to the extent that MCL 500.3135(2)(a) is merely procedural. See <em>Perin v Peuler (On Rehearing), </em>373 Mich 531, 541; 130 NW2d 4 (1964). We do not reach this issue today because we conclude that there are no material factual disputes affecting the serious impairment threshold determination in this case. Notably, however, the division of questions of law and fact between a judge and a jury is based on longstanding procedural rules, see <em>Mawich v Elsey, </em>47 Mich 10, 15-16; 10 NW 57 (1881), that are intended to promote judicial efficiency, see <em>Moll v Abbott Laboratories, </em>444 Mich 1, 26-28; 506 NW2d 816 (1993). Whether MCL 500.3135(2)(a) serves a purpose other than judicial dispatch is not clear, as the Legislature itself stated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Insurance Code was intended, in part, \u201cto prescribe certain procedures for maintaining [tort liability arising out of certain accidents].\u201d See the title of 1956 PA 218 and the title of 1995 PA 222, an act amending the provision of MCL 500.5135 and reiterating the purposes expressed in the 1956 act. And, of course, the scope of the rules governing summary disposition are also supported \u2014 if not compelled \u2014 by the right to a jury trial in civil cases. See, generally, <em>Conservation Dep\u2019t v Brown, </em>335 Mich 343, 346-347; 55 NW2d 859 (1952), and <em>Dunn v Dunn, </em>11 Mich 284, 286 (1863).

For example, in <em>Gagne v Schulte, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued February 28, 2006 (Docket No. 264788), the Court of Appeals held that a plaintiff had not suffered a serious impairment of body function even though her knee injury resulted in surgery and severe restrictions on her movement for a year after the accident, indefinite continuing restrictions on her ability to perform her pre-accident job and other activities in which she participated before the accident, and a permanent loss of stability in her knee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>and an increased risk of osteoarthritis. The majority reasoned that these impairments were insufficient to meet the threshold because she might someday be able to resume some activities with a knee brace and \u201cthere is no evidence that this period of decreased function affected her life so extensively that it altered the trajectory or course of her entire normal life.\u201d <em>Id., </em>unpub op at 2. Indeed, the majority\u2019s reasoning seemed to consider whether the plaintiffs ability to control the direction of her entire life had been altered, rather than her ability to live her life in a normal manner, given that it found the threshold was not met despite evidence that the plaintiff had continuing restrictions on movement, activities, and work, and medically documented long-term damage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b249-8\"> The dissenters\u2019 stare decisis protestations should taste like ashes in their mouths.

None of the cases that the dissent cites involves instances where I relied on legislative history to identify an ambiguity or give unambiguous text a meaning inconsistent with the plain language of the statute. In most, I merely emphasized that the legislative history <em>confirmed </em>the meaning in the unambiguous text. See, e.g., <em>Jackson v Green Estate, </em>484 Mich 209, 230; 771 NW2d 675 (2009) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting); <em>Koester v City of Novi, </em>458 Mich 1, 16; 580 NW2d 835 (1998); <em>People v Sloan, </em>450 Mich 160, 183-184; 538 NW2d 380 (1995); <em>Grand Trunk W R Co v City of Fenton, </em>439 Mich 240, 247; 482 NW2d 706 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\"> The dissent references Judge Leventhal\u2019s remark that using legislative history for statutory interpretation is the equivalent of walking into a crowded room and looking for one\u2019s friends. Similar to my approach, however, this analogy has been used by justices of the United States Supreme Court to explain why legislative history should not be used to interpret clear and <em>unambiguous </em>statutory language. See <em>Exxon Mobil Corp v Allapattah Servs, Inc, </em>545 US 546, 568-570; 125 S Ct 2611; 162 L Ed 2d 502 (2005), using the criticism to explain that legislative history should not he used to determine whether Congress intended an otherwise unambiguous statute to overrule a court\u2019s interpretation of an earlier version of the statute because \u201c[ejxtrinsic materials have a role in statutory interpretation only to the extent they shed a reliable light on the enacting Legislature\u2019s understanding of otherwise ambiguous terms.\u201d See also <em>Conroy v Aniskoff, </em>507 US 511, 518-519; 113 S Ct 1562; 123 L Ed 2d 229 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring) (using the criticism to explain why the majority should have stopped its analysis after concluding that a statute was unambiguous).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b262-9\"> Indeed, the dissent is so blindly intent on concluding that the majority must be rejecting temporal considerations that it fails to consider that its triumphant discovery of the majority\u2019s hypocrisy in referencing time periods in our application of MCL 500.3135(2) is nothing more than a reflection of the fact that we are <em>not </em>holding that temporal considerations are irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b263-5\">WEAVER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4k\">(concurring).

The no-fault automobile insurance act, in MCL 500.3135(1), provides that \u201c[a] person remains subject to tort liability for noneconomic loss caused by his or her ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle only if the injured person has suffered death, serious impairment of body function, or permanent serious disfigurement.\u201d The issue here is whether plaintiff has suffered a serious impairment of body function. \u201c \u2018[Sjerious im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>pairment of body function\u2019 means an objectively manifested impairment of an important body function that affects the person\u2019s general ability to lead his or her normal life.\u201d MCL 500.3135(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">In <em>Kreiner, </em>471 Mich at 132-133, this Court held that in determining whether an impairment affects the plaintiffs general ability to lead his normal life, \u201ca court should engage in a multifaceted inquiry, comparing the plaintiffs life before and after the accident as well as the significance of any affected aspects on the course of the plaintiffs overall life.\u201d In addition, <em>Kreiner </em>indicated that certain factors, such as the duration of the impairment, may be of assistance in evaluating whether the plaintiffs general ability to lead his normal life has been affected. <em>Id. </em>at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The majority overrules <em>Kreiner, </em>rejecting these factors and holding that temporal considerations are wholly or largely irrelevant in determining whether an impairment affects the plaintiffs general ability to lead his normal life. The majority instead holds that, as long as the plaintiffs general ability to lead his normal life has been affected, apparently for even a single moment in time, the plaintiff has suffered a \u201cserious impairment of body function.\u201d This conclusion is at odds with the actual language of the no-fault automobile act and nullifies the legislative compromise embodied in that act. I continue to believe that <em>Kreiner </em>was correctly decided, and that temporal considerations are highly relevant \u2014 indeed necessary \u2014 in determining whether an impairment affects the plaintiffs general ability to lead his normal life. By nullifying the legislative compromise, which was grounded in concerns over excessive litigation, the over-compensation of minor injuries, and the availability of affordable insurance, the Court\u2019s decision today will resurrect a legal environment in which each of these hazards reappears and threatens the continued fiscal integrity of our no-fault system.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Because I do not believe that the lower courts erred in concluding that plaintiff in this case has not suffered a serious impairment of body function, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">I. FACTS AND HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Because the majority opinion provides only a cursory presentation of the facts, in a case requiring a fact-intensive analysis, I find it necessary to set forth a more thorough discussion of these facts. Beginning in August 2002, plaintiff was employed by Allied Systems, and over the years, he has held various positions with the company.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 17, 2005, approximately six months after beginning his position as a medium-duty truck loader, plaintiff was struck by a truck driven by plaintiffs co-worker and co-defendant, Larry Carrier, while shuttling vehicles at a General Motors plant. Plaintiff was knocked down, and the wheels of the truck ran over his left ankle, fracturing his medial malleolus. Plaintiff was immediately taken to the hospital and was released that same day. Two days later, he underwent surgery for the implantation of a device to stabilize his ankle fracture. Immediately following surgery, plaintiff was on crutches and in a boot for approximately four weeks and, during this time, he was restricted from bearing weight on his left leg. Additionally, plaintiff underwent physical therapy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>On October 21,2005, plaintiff again underwent surgery on his ankle, this time to remove the implanted device. The surgeon reported that plaintiffs ankle had \u201chealed nicely.\u201d On November 5, 2005, at the request of Allied, plaintiff was examined by Dr. Paul Drouillard, who stated that plaintiff could return to work with restrictions of no prolonged standing or walking for three weeks, after which time plaintiff could return to work with no restrictions. On November 17, 2005, plaintiff was examined by his surgeon, who observed that plaintiffs \u201cwound is healed veiy nicely\u201d and that plaintiff \u201cneeds to be in seated work for approximately six weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">On January 12, 2006, plaintiffs surgeon examined him and cleared him to return to work with no restrictions. At this examination, plaintiff reported to his surgeon that \u201c[h]is medial malleolus is not giving him any pain.\u201d The surgeon observed that plaintiff had an \u201cexcellent range of motion with no specific tenderness.\u201d Upon returning to work for several days, however, plaintiff indicated that performing the physical tasks that his job required, such as walking, climbing, and crouching, caused his ankle to hurt. After plaintiffs request for a different assignment was denied, plaintiff went back on workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">On March 16, 2006, Allied required plaintiff to undergo a functional capacity evaluation (FCE),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which showed that plaintiff could not fully perform all of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>previous job duties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> During this evaluation, when asked what his goal was in returning to work, plaintiff responded, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to work; there is talk about a buyout and I think I want to do that.\u201d Plaintiff also reported that his ankle pain was 3 on a scale of zero to 10, with 10 being the highest.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">On May 31, 2006, Dr. Drouillard again examined plaintiff, at the request of Allied. Dr. Drouillard found no objective abnormality to correspond to plaintiffs complaints and opined that plaintiff was magnifying his symptoms. Dr. Drouillard also observed that, although plaintiff claimed that he had been wearing an ankle brace for the last two weeks, the tan lines on plaintiffs left and right feet were symmetrical, consistent with wearing flip-flops, with no break in his tan lines to indicate that he had been wearing the brace at all. Dr. Drouillard believed that plaintiff could return to work unrestricted and that plaintiffs ankle required no further treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">On June 12, 2006, plaintiff underwent an MRI test; the physiatrist who reviewed the MRI and performed a follow-up examination found that there was some evidence of ligamentous injury, but he did not establish a plan to decrease plaintiffs pain because there was little the physiatrist could do.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At this examination, plaintiff reported that his pain was 6 on a scale of zero to 10, that the pain was worse with \u201cany movement,\u201d and that nothing alleviated that pain. On June 20, 2006, Dr. Drouillard reviewed the MRI results and found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>plaintiffs ankle had healed well and that his opinion from May 31, 2006, had not changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Shortly thereafter, plaintiffs workers\u2019 compensation benefits were terminated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At this point, <em>plaintiff </em>sought another FCE so that he could return to work. On August 1, 2006, the FCE indicated that plaintiff was able to perform essential job demands without restriction. At this FCE, plaintiff reported that he experienced \u201coccasional aching\u201d in his ankle, and that there were no \u201cactivities that aggravated his symptoms in the left ankle (including prolonged standing, prolonged walking).\u201d Plaintiff reported that his pain level was 2 on a scale of zero to 10 and, during the two weeks immediately preceding the FCE, his highest pain level had been 3 and his lowest pain level had been 1. By the completion of the FCE, plaintiff reported his pain level as zero. On August 16, 2006, approximately 17 months after the accident, plaintiff returned to work and Allied assigned him to a new job with different physical requirements, and with no reduction in pay. Plaintiff volunteered to be assigned to this other job, and has been able to perform his new job duties since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">During his recuperation, plaintiff did not require any assistance with normal household tasks. Additionally, he was able to drive and his injuries have not affected his relationship with his wife in any way.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Outside of work, plaintiff was able to engage in most of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>activities in which he had engaged before his injury, such as fishing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Importantly, by plaintiff\u2019s own admission at his deposition in October 2006, his life was \u201cnormal\u201d despite some \u201coccasional aching.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">On March 24, 2006, plaintiff filed a third-party action against Carrier (the driver of the truck) and General Motors Corporation (GM).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Carrier was later released by stipulation of the parties, and the trial court granted GM\u2019s motion for summary disposition, finding that plaintiff had undergone a relatively good recovery and could not meet the \u201cserious impairment of body function\u201d threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The Court of Appeals affirmed, with one judge dissenting, concluding that the impairment did not affect plaintiffs general ability to lead his normal life. <em>McCormick v Carrier, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued March 25, 2008 (Docket No. 275888). The majority cited various facts to support its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>conclusion, such as plaintiffs golfing, fishing, driving, caring for himself, and returning to work without restriction. The dissent would have reversed for two reasons: first, on the basis that plaintiffs entire life, including the possibility of future problems, must be considered; and, second, on the basis that there was evidence to indicate that plaintiffs life was not currently normal. The evidence that the dissent relied on to reach this conclusion was that plaintiff was assigned to a job with reduced physical requirements and the doctors had identified \u201csome indication of degenerative joint disease in [plaintiffs] ankle.\u201d <em>Id., </em>unpub op at 2 (DAVIS, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">On October 22, 2008, this Court denied plaintiffs application for leave to appeal, although Chief Justice KELLY and Justices Cavanagh and WEAVER would have granted leave to appeal. 482 Mich 1018 (2008). However, after the composition of this Court changed when Justice HATHAWAY replaced former Chief Justice TAYLOR on January 1, 2009, this Court granted plaintiffs motion for reconsideration, even though such motion had not raised any new legal arguments. 485 Mich 851 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">This case presents issues of statutory interpretation, which this Court reviews de novo. <em>Dep\u2019t of Transp v Tompkins, </em>481 Mich 184, 190; 749 NW2d 716 (2008). We also review rulings on motions for summary disposition de novo. <em>Spiek v Dep\u2019t of Transp, </em>456 Mich 331, 337; 572 NW2d 201 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">A. HISTORY OF NO-FAULT INSURANCE ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">In Michigan, before the enactment of the no-fault insurance act, the only available recourse to victims of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>motor vehicle accidents seeking to recover damages was to file a common-law tort action. \u201c[U]nder [this] tort liability system[,] the doctrine of contributory negligence denied benefits to a high percentage of motor vehicle accident victims, minor injuries were overcompensated, serious injuries were undercompensated, long payment delays were commonplace, the court system was overburdened, and those with low income and little education suffered discrimination.\u201d <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 579; 267 NW2d 72 (1978). In response to these deficiencies, the Legislature enacted the no-fault automobile insurance act, MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq., </em>effective March 30, 1973. The primary goal of the no-fault act is \u201cto provide victims of motor vehicle accidents assured, adequate, and prompt reparation for certain economic losses.\u201d <em>Shavers, </em>402 Mich at 579. In order to meet this objective, the Legislature decided to make no-fault insurance compulsory, i.e., \u201cwhereby every Michigan motorist would be required to purchase no-fault insurance or be unable to operate a motor vehicle legally in this state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, \u201c[i]n exchange for the payment of. . . no-fault economic loss benefits from one\u2019s own insurance company, the Legislature limited an injured person\u2019s ability to sue a negligent operator or owner of a motor vehicle for bodily injuries.\u201d <em>Kreiner, </em>471 Mich at 115. That is, with the enactment of the no-fault act, \u201cthe Legislature abolished tort liability generally in motor vehicle accident cases and replaced it with a regime that established that a person injured in such an accident is entitled to certain economic compensation from his own insurance company regardless of fault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>exchange for economic loss benefits regardless of fault, \u201cthe Legislature significantly limited the injured person\u2019s ability to sue a third party for noneconomic damages, e.g., pain and suffering.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115. More specifically, no tort suit against a third party for non-economic damages is permitted unless the injured person \u201chas suffered death, serious impairment of body function, or permanent serious disfigurement.\u201d MCL 500.3135a). <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The Legislature did not initially define the language that is in dispute in this case \u2014 \u201cserious impairment of body function\u201d \u2014 and this Court itself struggled in the process of giving reasonable meaning to this language. In <em>Advisory Opinion re Constitutionality of 1972 PA 294, </em>389 Mich 441, 481; 208 NW2d 469 (1973), we held that whether the plaintiff has suffered a \u201cserious impairment of body function\u201d is \u201cwithin the province of the trier of fact. . . .\u201d However, in <em>Cassidy v McGovern, </em>415 Mich 483; 330 NW2d 22 (1982), noting that an advisory opinion \u201c \u2018is not precedential^ binding in the same sense as a decision of the Court after a hearing on the merits,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 495 (citation omitted), this Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>[W]hen there is no factual dispute regarding the nature and extent of a plaintiffs injuries, the question of serious impairment of body function shall be decided as a matter of law by the court. Likewise, if there is a factual dispute as to the nature and extent of a plaintiffs injuries, but the dispute is not material to the determination whether plaintiff has suffered a serious impairment of body function, the court shall rule as a matter of law whether the threshold requirement... has been met. <em>[Id. </em>at 502.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">In addition, <em>Cassidy </em>held that the phrase \u201cserious impairment of body function\u201d refers to \u201cobjectively manifested injuries\u201d that impair \u201cimportant body functions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504-505. <em>Cassidy </em>also held that \u201cthe Legislature intended an objective standard that looks to the effect of an injury on the person\u2019s general ability to live a normal life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505. Finally, <em>Cassidy </em>held that although \u201can injury need not be permanent to be serious,\u201d \u201c[p]ermanency is, nevertheless, relevant\u201d because \u201c[t]wo injuries identical except that one is permanent do differ in seriousness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505-506.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">However, only four years later, in <em>DiFranco v Pickard, </em>427 Mich 32; 398 NW2d 896 (1986), this Court overruled <em>Cassidy. DiFranco </em>held that \u201c[i]f reasonable minds can differ as to whether the plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of body function, the issue must be submitted to the juiy, even if the evidentiary facts are undisputed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58. In addition, <em>DiFranco </em>held that the \u201cimpairment need not be of... an important body function,\u201d and it is unnecessary to look to the effect of the injury on the person\u2019s \u201c \u2018general ability to live a normal life.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39. <em>DiFranco </em>also held that, although the plaintiff must prove a \u201cmedically identifiable injury,\u201d this can be done on the basis of \u201cthe plaintiffs subjective complaints or the symptoms of an injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75. Finally, <em>DiFranco </em>held that the following factors should be considered when determining whether the impairment was serious:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>The extent of the impairment, the particular body function impaired, the length of time the impairment lasted, the treatment required to correct the impairment, and any other relevant factors. <em>[Id. </em>at 69-70.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In 1995, the Legislature amended the no-fault act. In particular, it amended MCL 500.3135(2)(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">The issues of whether an injured person has suffered serious impairment of body function or permanent serious disfigurement are questions of law for the court if the court finds either of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\"><em>(i) </em>There is no factual dispute concerning the nature and extent of the person\u2019s injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\"><em>(ii) </em>There is a factual dispute concerning the nature and extent of the person\u2019s injuries, but the dispute is not material to the determination as to whether the person has suffered a serious impairment of body function or permanent serious disfigurement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">In addition, the Legislature defined \u201cserious impairment of body function\u201d to mean \u201can objectively manifested impairment of an important body function that affects the person\u2019s general ability to lead his or her normal life.\u201d MCL 500.3135(7). In other words, the Legislature essentially rejected <em>DiFranco </em>and, with one exception, codified <em>Cassidy.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">B. <em>KREINER v FISCHER</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">In <em>Kreiner, </em>this Court for the first time interpreted the Legislature\u2019s definition of \u201cserious impairment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>body function.\u201d Because \u201cgenerally\u201d means \u201c \u2018for the most part,\u2019 \u201d <em>Kreiner </em>held that \u201cdetermining whether a plaintiff is \u2018generally able\u2019 to lead his normal life requires considering whether the plaintiff is, \u2018for the most part\u2019 able to lead his normal life.\u201d <em>Kreiner, </em>471 Mich at 130, quoting <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1991). In addition, because \u201clead\u201d means \u201c \u2018to conduct or bring in a particular course,\u2019 \u201d <em>Kreiner </em>held that \u201cthe effect of the impairment on the course of a plaintiffs entire normal life must be considered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130-131, quoting <em>Random House Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary </em>(2001). Therefore, <em>Kreiner </em>concluded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">[ajlthough some aspects of a plaintiffs entire normal life may be interrupted by the impairment, if, despite those impingements, the course or trajectory of the plaintiffs normal life has not been affected, then the plaintiffs \u201cgeneral ability\u201d to lead his normal life has not been affected and he does not meet the \u201cserious impairment of body function\u201d threshold.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 131.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-5\"><em>Kreiner </em>established a \u201cmulti-step process... for separating out those plaintiffs who meet the statutory threshold from those who do not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>First, the court must determine whether there is a factual dispute that is material to the determination whether the person has suffered a serious impairment of body function.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Second, the court must determine whether an important body function has been impaired. Third, the court must determine whether the impairment is objectively manifested.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Finally, the court must determine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>impairment affects the plaintiffs general ability to lead his or her normal life. \u201cIn determining whether the course of the plaintiffs normal life has been affected, a court should engage in a multifaceted inquiry, comparing the plaintiffs life before and after the accident as well as the significance of any affected aspects on the course of the plaintiffs overall life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132-133. <em>Kreiner </em>indicated that the following factors may be of assistance in evaluating whether the plaintiffs general ability to conduct the course of his normal life has been affected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\">(a) the nature and extent of the impairment, (b) the type and length of treatment required, (c) the duration of the impairment,<footnotemark>[15]</footnotemark>(d) the extent of any residual impairment/<footnotemark>[16]</footnotemark> and (e) the prognosis for eventual recovery. <em>\\Id. </em>at 133.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Although the dissent in <em>Kreiner </em>essentially agreed with the majority\u2019s analysis of the language \u201can objectively manifested impairment of an important body function,\u201d it disagreed with the majority\u2019s analysis of the language \u201cthat affects the person\u2019s general ability to lead his or her normal life.\u201d Most significantly in this regard, the dissent rejected the factors set forth by the majority on the basis that \u201ctime or temporal considerations\u201d are inappropriate considerations. <em>Id. </em>at 147 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">C. MAJORITY\u2019S NEW TEST</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">It is appropriate that Justice CAVANAGH, the authoring justice of the majority opinion in <em>DiFranco, </em>which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>was rejected by the Legislature, and also the authoring justice of the dissent in <em>Kreiner, </em>which was rejected by this Court, is now the authoring justice of the majority opinion, in which <em>Kreiner </em>is overruled. While to some there may be a sense of justice, or at least a sense of irony, in this sequence of events, to others, including those of us in dissent in this case, such sequence embodies all that is wrong when a judiciary confuses its own preferences with those of the people\u2019s representatives in the Legislature. While it is intriguing that Justice CAVANAGH now is able to transform his dissent in <em>Kreiner </em>into a majority opinion, and thereby resuscitate his earlier opinion in <em>DiFranco, </em>this has been achieved only after the people of this state, through their Legislature, have made clear that <em>DiFranco </em>did <em>not </em>reflect what ought to be the policy of this state. Therefore, just as he did in his dissent in <em>Kreiner, </em>Justice CAVANAGH, now with majority support, rejects Kreiner\u2019s analysis of the language \u201cthat affects the person\u2019s general ability to lead his or her normal life.\u201d The worm has turned, and never mind what the people and their Legislature have sought to accomplish in establishing as the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Before proceeding too far into where our substantive disagreements lie, I would be remiss not to point out where we are in agreement. First, the majority, just as did the <em>Kreiner </em>dissent, largely agrees with Kreiner\u2019s analysis of MCL 500.3135(2)(a), i.e., if there is no material factual dispute, whether a person has suffered a serious impairment of body function should be determined by the court as a matter of law.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>also largely agrees with Kreiner\u2019s analysis of the language \u201can objectively manifested impairment of an important body function.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In addition, the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>agrees with Kreiner\u2019s conclusion that the serious impairment of body function threshold entails a subjective analysis, i.e., \u201c[wjhether an impairment that precludes a person from throwing a ninety-five miles-an-hour fastball is a \u2018serious impairment of body function\u2019 may depend on whether the person is a professional baseball player or an accountant who likes to play catch with his son every once in a while.\u201d <em>Kreiner, </em>471 Mich at 134 n 19. The majority also agrees with <em>Kreiner\u2019s </em>conclusion that determining whether a plaintiffs general ability to lead his or her normal life has been affected \u201cnecessarily requires a comparison of the plaintiffs life before and after the incident.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Finally, the majority agrees with Kreiner\u2019s conclusion that permanency is not required.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">1. <em>DiFRANCO </em>VERSUS <em>CASSIDY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">However, this is where our agreements end. First, the majority takes issue with <em>Kreiner\u2019s </em>statement that \u201cthe Legislature largely rejected <em>DiFranco </em>in favor of <em>Cassidy.\u201d Kreiner, </em>471 Mich at 121 n 8. As explained earlier, the Legislature adopted <em>Cassidy </em>with a single exception. That single exception pertains to the fact that <em>Cassidy, </em>415 Mich at 505, required an evaluation of \u201cthe effect of an injury on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>the person\u2019s general ability to live <em>a </em>normal life,\u201d while MCL 500.3135(7) requires an evaluation of the effect of an injury on \u201cthe person\u2019s general ability to lead <em>his or her </em>normal life.\u201d (Emphasis added.) That is, while the <em>Cassidy </em>test was entirely objective, the MCL 500.3135(7) test is at least partially subjective. As this Court explained in <em>Kreiner, </em>471 Mich at 121 n 7:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\">[T]he Legislature modified the entirely objective <em>Cassidy </em>standard to a partially objective and partially subjective inquiry. Thus, what is \u201cnormal\u201d is to be determined subjectively on the basis of the plaintiffs own life and not the life of some objective third party. However, once that is fixed as the base, it is to be objectively determined whether the impairment in fact affects the plaintiffs \u201cgeneral ability to lead\u201d that life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Nevertheless, given that: (a) <em>Cassidy, </em>415 Mich at 505, held that courts <em>should </em>\u201clook[] to the effect of an injury on the person\u2019s general ability to live a normal life\u201d; (b) <em>DiFranco, </em>427 Mich at 39, held that courts <em>should not </em>look to the effect of the injury on the person\u2019s \u201c \u2018general ability to live a normal life\u2019 \u201d; and (c) the Legislature subsequently and affirmatively directed the courts to look to the effect of an injury on \u201cthe person\u2019s general ability to lead his or her normal life,\u201d MCL 500.3135(7), the Legislature obviously preferred the policy of <em>Cassidy </em>to that of <em>DiFranco. </em>In addition, in contrast to <em>DiFranco, </em>and consistent with <em>Cassidy, </em>the Legislature expressly adopted an \u201cimportant body function\u201d requirement, MCL 500.3135(7), and amended MCL 500.3135 to make clear that whether a serious impairment of body function has occurred is a question of law unless there is a material factual dispute. MCL 500.3135(2)(a). Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s understandably defensive posture, it is hardly an \u201coversim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>plification\u201d to conclude that the Legislature essentially rejected <em>DiFranco </em>in favor of <em>Cassidy.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Moreover, the Legislature\u2019s action of amending MCL 500.3135 following <em>DiFranco </em>is an example of legislative history that has genuine utility in the interpretative process. This Court has emphasized that \u201cnot all legislative history is of equal value,\u201d and has specifically noted that \u201c[cjlearly of the highest quality is legislative history that relates to an action of the Legislature from which a court may draw reasonable inferences about the Legislature\u2019s intent. . . .\u201d <em>In re Certified Question, </em>468 Mich 109, 115 n 5; 659 NW2d 597 (2003). The instant case presents an ideal \u201c[e]xample[] of legitimate legislative history,\u201d i.e., the recitation of \u201cactions of the Legislature intended to repudiate the judicial construction of a statute....\u201d <em>Id. </em>And yet, not altogether inexplicably, the majority entirely disregards these legislative actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Defendant and the Attorney General as amicus curiae have presented the Court with legislative analyses, committee reports, and other materials to support their argument that, in enacting the amendments, the Legislature intended to repudiate <em>DiFranco </em>and restore <em>Cassidy, </em>just as <em>Kreiner </em>held. Even the most cursory review of these documents demonstrates that defendant and the Attorney General\u2019s reading has merit. For example, the original draft of House Bill 4341 was accompanied by a memorandum from its sponsor that stated that the bill\u2019s <em>first </em>goal was to \u201c[reestablish the two-part <em>Cassidy </em>standard of: (1) definition of \u2018serious impairment of body function,\u2019 and (2) make the determination of whether an injury is a serious impairment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>of body function a question of law (judge) rather than of fact (jury).\u201d Memorandum of Representative Harold J. Voorhees, enclosing the original draft of HB 4341 as introduced, February 8, 1995, available in defendant\u2019s appendix on appeal, p 8b. Similarly, the House legislative analysis expressly set forth the chronology of <em>Cassidy </em>and <em>DiFranco, </em>noting that <em>DiFranco </em>had \u201crejected\u201d <em>Cassidy </em>and that the bill \u201cwould return to a tort threshold resembling that provided by the <em>Cassidy </em>ruling....\u201d House Legislative Analysis, HB 4341, December 18, 1995. The analysis provided to the Senate Financial Services Committee likewise explained <em>in the first sentence of the bill\u2019s description </em>that it \u201cwould put into law the <em>Cassidy </em>standards for meeting the serious impairment of body function threshold.\u201d Department of Commerce Bill Analysis of HB 4341, February 14,1995. And finally, it is apparent from the statements of protest of the bill\u2019s opponents that they also clearly understood House Bill 4341 to be a \u201creturn to the Cassidy standard . . ..\u201d Statement of Senator Henry E.

Cherry, Jr., <em>id. </em>at 1785.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">While on several occasions I have explained why I do not find all forms of legislative history to be useful tools in the interpretative process, see, e.g., <em>Petersen v Magna Corp, </em>484 Mich 300, 381-382; 773 NW2d 564 (2009) (MARKMAN, J., dissenting), the author of the majority opinion has never questioned their utility.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>is no apparent reason why the majority \u201cturn[s] a blind eye to the wealth of extrinsic information available\u201d on the history of the 1995 amendments. <em>Nat'l Pride at Work, Inc v Governor, </em>481 Mich 56, 95 n 34; 748 NW2d 524 (2008) (KELLY, J., dissenting). Rather, the only, quite obvious explanation for the majority\u2019s selective silence is that it can find <em>nothing </em>in this \u201cwealth of extrinsic information available\u201d to support its interpretation. One of the most common and compelling critiques of the use of legislative history is that a judge can almost always find <em>something </em>in the legislative history to support the interpretation he personally wishes to give to a law. To borrow an analogy invoked by United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, using legislative history is like entering a room, looking over the assembled multitudes in the crowd, and picking out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>your friends. See Scalia, <em>A Matter of Interpretation </em>(Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997), p 36. In its near silence, the majority places a new twist on this analogy, and illustrates another fundamental problem with the use of legislative history. Here, the majority enters a room and, finding <em>no </em>friends in sight, makes a quick exit. Considering the quality and quantity of the legislative history available here, the majority\u2019s \u201cquick exit\u201d and its selective silence on the subject speaks volumes. It should not go unremarked that it is this dissent that cites legislative history \u2014 albeit a uniquely persuasive and bona fide form of legislative history \u2014 as a relevant factor in interpreting MCL 500.3135, while the justices of the majority, the supposed advocates of this mode of interpretation, exclude this from their consideration. Apparently, legislative history is to be considered when it supports a justice\u2019s preferred interpretation, and ignored when it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Indeed, the problem with this approach of <em>sometimes </em>relying on legislative history and sometimes not is, as I explained in my dissent in <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 381-382, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">it is a process in which judges in the very guise of selecting the tools and factors to be employed in \u201cinterpreting\u201d the law are effectively its formulators \u2014 in short, judges who are wielding the legislative, not the judicial, power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">A critical strength of a judicial philosophy committed to exercising only the constitution\u2019s \u201cjudicial power\u201d is that reasonably clear rules of decision-making are established <em>before the fact. </em>That is, a judge essentially promises the parties that he or she will decide their case, as with sill others, by attempting to discern the reasonable meaning of relevant statutes or contracts and that this will be done by relying upon recognized rules, and tools, of interpretation. By contrast, under the [majority\u2019s] approach ..., in which there is essentially a limitless array of rules, and tools, that may be employed for \u201cdefining\u201d the law apart from its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>language, there is no consistently applied interpretative process with which the judge promises beforehand to comply. He or she may promise to be \u201cfair,\u201d and he or she may seek to be fair, but there are no rules for how this fairness is to be achieved. There is only the promise that the judge will address each dispute on a case-by-case basis, using whatever rules, and whichever tools, he or she believes are required in that instance. And the suspicion simply cannot be avoided that these varying and indeterminate rules, and tools, may be largely a function of the outcome preferred by the judge and by his or her personal attitudes toward the parties and their causes. Any interpretative rules will be identified only <em>after the fact, </em>and these \u201crules\u201d may or may not have been invoked in resolving yesterday\u2019s dispute, and may or may not be employed in resolving tomorrow\u2019s dispute. Any judge can concoct an <em>after-the-fact </em>rationale for a decision; the <em>judicial </em>process, however, is predicated upon <em>before-the-fact </em>rationales. An <em>ad hoc </em>process is not a judicial process at all. In the place of predetermined rules \u2014 otherwise understood as the rule of law \u2014 the [majority] would substitute rules to be determined later.

In addition, contrary to the majority\u2019s contention, Kreiner\u2019s use of the word \u201centire\u201d was not \u201ccreated out of thin air ... .\u201d Instead, the use of the word \u201centire\u201d derived from the Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cgeneral\u201d because \u201cin general\u201d means \u201cwith respect to the <em>entirety.\u201d Random House Webster\u2019s College </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number><em>Dictionary </em>(1991) (emphasis added). More accurately, it is the meaning that the majority gives to \u201cgeneral\u201d that is \u201ccreated out of thin air.\u201d The majority concludes that the word \u201cgeneral\u201d means \u201csome,\u201d even though the definition that the majority itself relies upon does not even include \u201csome,\u201d but instead indicates that \u201cgeneral\u201d means \u201cwhole,\u201d \u201cevery,\u201d \u201cmajority,\u201d \u201cprevalent,\u201d \u201cusually,\u201d \u201cin most instances,\u201d \u201cnot limited,\u201d and \u201cmain features.\u201d Nowhere among these possible meanings can a reader sight the word \u201csome.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">3. TEMPORAL CONSIDERATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Finally, the majority rejects the non-exhaustive list of factors that <em>Kreiner </em>set forth for consideration in evaluating whether the plaintiffs general ability to lead his normal life has been affected. The majority asserts that <em>Kreiner </em>\u201cdeparted . . . from the statutory text, by providing an extra-textual \u2018nonexhaustive list of objective factors\u2019 to be used to compare the plaintiffs pre- and post-incident lifestyle.\u201d This critique is quite surprising given that it is not uncommon for courts in general, and for this Court in particular, to provide \u201cextra-textual\u201d factors to be considered in interpreting a statute that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>demands a fact-specific analysis.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> To the best of my knowledge, members of this majority have never before complained about this practice, but consistency in the application and non-application of interpretative factors is hardly a preoccupation of this majority.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Indeed, in <em>DiFranco </em>itself, Justice CAVANAGH provided numerous \u201cextra-textual\u201d factors to be considered in determining whether a plaintiff has established a serious impairment of body function. <em>DiFranco, </em>427 Mich at 69-70, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">In determining whether the impairment of body function was serious, the jury should consider such factors as the extent of the impairment, the particular body function impaired, the length of time the impairment lasted, the treatment required to correct the impairment, and any other relevant factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Indeed, these \u201cextra-textual\u201d factors are remarkably similar to the <em>Kreiner </em>factors: \u201c(a) the nature and extent of the impairment, (b) the type and length of treatment required, (c) the duration of the impairment, (d) the extent of any residual impairment, and (e) the prognosis for eventual recovery.\u201d <em>Kreiner, </em>471 Mich at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>133. It not clear why the authoring justice thought it acceptable to list \u201cextra-textual\u201d factors in <em>DiFranco, </em>but unacceptable to cite virtually the same factors in <em>Kreiner. </em>In addition, in <em>Wexford Med Group v City of </em>Cadillac, 474 Mich 192; 713 NW2d 734 (2006), he listed \u201cextra-textual\u201d factors a court should consider in determining whether an entity is a \u201ccharitable institution\u201d and thus exempt from ad valorem property taxes. Also, in <em>Chmielewski v Xermac, Inc, </em>457 Mich 593, 633; 580 NW2d 817 (1998), the Court considered the Handicapper\u2019s Civil Rights Act requirement that to be handicapped one must be \u201csubstantially limited in a major life activity.\u201d MCL 37.1103(e)(i)(A). Then-Justice KELLY, joined by Justice CAVANAGH, stated in dissent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\">I would hold that the following factors should be considered to determine whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity: (1) the nature of the impairment, (2) its severity, (3) its duration or expected duration, and (4) its long-term effect. <em>[Chmielewski, </em>457 Mich at 633.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">See, also, <em>Wood v Detroit Auto Inter-Ins Exch, </em>413 Mich 573; 321 NW2d 653 (1982), listing several \u201cextra-textual\u201d factors a court should consider in awarding \u201creasonable\u201d attorney fees under MCL 500.3148(1);<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>Workman v Detroit Auto Inter-Ins Exch, </em>404 Mich 477, 496-497; 274 NW2d 373 (1979), adopting a four-factor test to determine whether for purposes of the no-fault act a person is \u201cdomiciled in the same household\u201d as a relative pursuant to MCL 500.3114; <em>Stewart v Michigan, </em>471 Mich 692, 698-699; 692 NW2d 376 (2004), stating that \u201cextra-textual\u201d \u201cfactors such as the manner, location, and fashion in which a vehicle is parked\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>are material to determining whether the parked vehicle poses an unreasonable risk under MCL 500.3106(1); and <em>Reed v Yackell, </em>473 Mich 520; 703 NW2d 1 (2005), utilizing an \u201cextra-textual\u201d multifactor economic-reality test to determine who is an employer for purposes of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">As should be readily apparent, the majority\u2019s claim that <em>Kreiner </em>erred by including \u201cextra-textual\u201d factors to consider in interpreting a statute is a wholly manufactured concern. The statute <em>requires </em>a fact-specific analysis. As Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s <em>DiFranco </em>opinion and numerous other decisions of this Court have recognized, such factors assist courts in applying the statutory language on a case-by-case basis. To date, none of the members of the majority have objected to the inclusion of such factors in any other of this Court\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Nevertheless, the majority rejects Kreiner\u2019s \u201cextra-textual\u201d factors on the basis that they all \u201cinclude a temporal component,\u201d reiterating the argument made by the <em>Kreiner </em>dissent that \u201cthe statute does not create an express temporal requirement as to how long an impairment must last. . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 203, 208; see also <em>Kreiner, </em>471 Mich at 147 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he serious impairment of body function threshold does not suggest any sort of temporal limitation. . . . Therefore, the duration of the impairment is not an appropriate inquiry.\u201d). Indeed, the majority now holds that it is unnecessary to consider whether the impairment even <em>\u201ccontinues </em>to affect [plaintiffs] general ability to lead his pre-incident \u2018normal life\u2019 . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The majority, not surprisingly, claims that this dissent mischaracterizes its holding when we conclude that temporal considerations are wholly or largely irrel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>evant in the majority\u2019s holding. Not only, as explained above, is my characterization of their holding supported by the actual language of the majority opinion, but it is also dictated by simple <em>logic. </em>That is, given that the majority rejects Kreiner\u2019s factors because they all \u201cinclude a temporal component,\u201d given that it feels passionately enough about this to write a lengthy opinion overruling <em>Kreiner, </em>and given that we can discern no other significant departure from <em>Kreiner </em>in the majority\u2019s new test than that of the temporal component,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> it is difficult to escape the conclusion we reach here, that the majority believes that temporal considerations are wholly or largely irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">I am reminded of a famous Sherlock Holmes line:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">\u201cHow often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, <em>however improbable, </em>must be the truth?\u201d [A. Conan Doyle, <em>The Sign of the Four, </em>from <em>The Complete Sherlock Holmes </em>(New York: Doubleday, 1890), ch 6, p 111.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>That is, given that the majority essentially agrees with everything in <em>Kreiner </em>but its temporal considerations,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>Kreiner\u2019s </em>temporal considerations are all that remain as to our disagreement. Therefore, that the majority disagrees with Kreiner\u2019s temporal considerations, such as the duration of the impairment, \u201cmust be the truth.\u201d In other words, when comparing the <em>Kreiner </em>test and the majority\u2019s new test \u2014 whatever that is intended to be\u2014 the only apparent substantive difference is that, while <em>Kreiner </em>expressly includes temporal considerations, the majority\u2019s test does not. Given that the majority essentially agrees with everything in <em>Kreiner </em>but its temporal considerations, and given that the only reason it gives for rejecting these considerations is that they all \u201cinclude a temporal component,\u201d how can we deduce anything <em>other </em>than that the majority holds that temporal considerations, such as the duration of the impairment, are irrelevant? Furthermore, if temporal considerations are not irrelevant, why does the majority not explain <em>in what way </em>these <em>are </em>relevant, or how, in fact, the majority views the relevancy of temporal considerations, and how these views differ from those expressed in Kreiner? This glaring void in explanation of its own test in the majority opinion can only be explained by the fact that the majority is holding that temporal considerations are wholly or largely irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>In sum, if temporal considerations are relevant: (1) why <em>is </em>the majority overruling <em>Kreiner; </em>(2) why does the majority reject Kreiner\u2019s factors, such as the duration of the impairment; (3) why does the majority not include temporal considerations within its new test; (4) why does the majority fail to explain the relevancy of temporal considerations; (5) why does the majority conclude that it is unnecessary to consider whether the impairment <em>\u201ccontinues </em>to affect [plaintiffs] general ability to lead his pre-incident \u2018normal life\u2019 \u201d; and (6) perhaps most tellingly, why does not the majority clarify its position, whatever it may be, in light of this dissent? Simply saying that our conclusion is \u201cerroneous\u201d does not make it so, and, even more to the point, will hardly assist the bench and bar of this state in determining whether, and how, temporal considerations somehow remain relevant after today\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">For these reasons, we are unable to avoid the conclusion that the majority is, indeed, holding that temporal considerations are wholly or largely irrelevant, even though this \u201cimprobable\u201d result constitutes a departure from <em>Cassidy, DiFranco, </em>and <em>Kreiner, </em>and makes utterly no sense. How can it possibly be determined whether an impairment \u201caffects the person\u2019s general ability to lead his or her normal life\u201d without taking into account temporal considerations? As <em>Kreiner, </em>471 Mich at 133 n 18, inquired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">Does the dissent [now the majority] really believe that an impairment lasting only a few moments has the same effect on a person\u2019s \u201cgeneral ability to lead his or her normal life\u201d as an impairment lasting several years or that an impairment requiring annual treatment has the same effect on a person\u2019s \u201cgeneral ability to lead his or her normal life\u201d as an impairment requiring daily treatment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Does the majority really believe that the Legislature intended for the serious impairment threshold to be met in every instance where an objectively manifested impairment of an important body function affected a person\u2019s ability to lead his normal life for a mere moment in time? What if a person gets hit in the head and passes out for five minutes, but after those five minutes is completely unaffected by the impairment? If all temporal considerations are irrelevant, would not this person satisfy the majority\u2019s threshold, because his general ability to lead his normal life was certainly affected for those five minutes of unconsciousness? Under the majority\u2019s rule, it is apparently irrelevant that the person arose after those five minutes and led a completely normal life thereafter. The majority asserts that all that matters is that for that moment in time, the person\u2019s general ability to lead his normal life had been affected. I am not sure that the majority\u2019s new threshold can even be called a \u201cthreshold\u201d when it can be satisfied in virtually every automobile accident case that results in injury.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> As long as the plaintiff has suffered an objectively manifested impairment of an important body function, that plaintiff will have satisfied the majority\u2019s threshold, because the majority has essentially read the third criterion, i.e., \u201cthat affects the person\u2019s general ability to lead his or her normal life,\u201d out of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The clearest illustration of the difficulty in determining whether an impairment \u201caffects the person\u2019s general ability to lead his or her normal life\u201d without taking into account temporal considerations is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>majority\u2019s <em>own </em>inability to do so.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In determining whether the plaintiff in the <em>instant </em>case suffered an impairment that affects his general ability to lead his normal life, the majority itself repeatedly cites temporal considerations. For example, the majority indicates that \u201cfor <em>a month </em>after the incident, plaintiff could not bear weight on his left ankle\u201d; \u201c[h]e underwent two surgeries over a period of <em>10 months </em>and <em>multiple months </em>of physical therapy\u201d; \u201cafter the incident he was unable to perform functions necessary for his job for at least <em>14 </em>months\u201d; and \u201che did not return to work for <em>19 months.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Are such temporal considerations irrelevant or relevant? Do we interpret the words or the actions of the majority? And, if temporal considerations are irrelevant, how are we to determine whether an impairment affects a plaintiffs \u201cgeneral ability to lead his or her normal life\u201d? The majority does not appear to know the answers, and it appears not to care that it does not know.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Indeed, under the majority\u2019s new threshold, it would seem that the moment the plaintiff in this case went to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the emergency room and it was determined that he had broken his ankle, the threshold was met. For at that moment, plaintiff could not work. While at the emergency room, and for some measurable time afterwards, plaintiffs broken ankle affected not just some, but all of his capacity to live his normal life. Under the majority\u2019s non-temporal test, there is apparently no need to consider anything beyond the emergency room visit. If this reading of its decision is wrong, once again, the majority might wish to explain why this is so <em>for the </em>benefit of the bench, the bar, and the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In crafting its new threshold, the majority would also have been wise to consider the larger no-fault statute. Recall that the Legislature has decided that an injured plaintiff should only be allowed to sue to recover noneconomic damages resulting from an automobile accident where he or she has suffered: (a) death; (b) permanent serious disfigurement; or (c) serious impairment of body function. MCL 500.3135. It is well established that \u201c [w]hen construing a series of terms ... we are guided by the principle that words grouped in a list should be given related meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Complaint of Rovas Against SBC Mich, </em>482 Mich 90, 114; 754 NW2d 259 (2008) (citation omitted). \u201cIn other words, this Court applies the doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>which \u2018stands for the principle that a word or phrase is given meaning by its context of setting.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Therefore, as this Court explained in <em>Cassidy, </em>415 Mich at 503:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">In determining the seriousness of the injury required for a \u201cserious impairment of body function\u201d, this threshold should be considered in conjunction with the other threshold requirements for a tort action for noneconomic loss, namely, death and permanent serious disfigurement. MCL 500.3135 .... The Legislature clearly did not intend to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>erect two significant obstacles to a tort action for noneconomic loss and one quite insignificant obstacle.<footnotemark>[31]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">In addition, the Legislature defined \u201cserious impairment of body function\u201d to mean \u201can objectively manifested impairment of an important body function that affects the person\u2019s general ability to lead his or her normal life.\u201d MCL 500.3135(7). Obviously, in enacting this threshold language, and in joining it with \u201cdeath\u201d and \u201cserious permanent disfigurement,\u201d the Legislature was unlikely to have had in mind an impairment that only affected a plaintiffs ability to lead his normal life for a moment in time, with no consideration being given to the plaintiffs general ability to lead his normal life beyond that moment. Indeed, it is quite certain that this is not what the Legislature had in mind, given that the very premise of the no-fault act, and the core of the accompanying legislative compromise, was that <em>some </em>injured persons would <em>not </em>be able to recover <em>noneconomic </em>damages, so that <em>all </em>injured persons <em>would </em>be able to recover <em>economic </em>loss benefits regardless of fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">D. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">As explained earlier, both <em>Kreiner </em>and the majority agree that the court must first determine whether there is a factual dispute that is material to the determination whether plaintiff has suffered a serious impairment of body function. Here, there are no material factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>disputes. Before the accident, plaintiff worked approximately 60 hours a week and for the six months immediately before the accident, plaintiffs position was that of a medium-duty truck loader. Additionally, plaintiff fished and golfed. Twelve months after the accident, plaintiffs surgeon cleared him to return to work with no restrictions. Seventeen months after the accident, plaintiff returned to work and has been able to perform all of his job duties since then. During the entire time he was recuperating, plaintiff could tend to his needs and there was no effect on his relationship with his thenfianc\u00e9e. Additionally, plaintiff continued to fish and golf. Thus, I agree with the majority that there are no factual disputes that are material to the determination of whether plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of a body function. The facts are clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">I also agree with the majority that the \u201cbody function\u201d that was \u201cimpaired,\u201d the ability to walk, was \u201cimportant,\u201d and that the impairment was \u201cobjectively manifested.\u201d Although plaintiff was able to walk to some extent, his ability to do so was impaired, and his impairment, a broken ankle, was recognized by his doctors. The final, and critical, inquiry in this case concerns whether the impairment affected plaintiffs general ability to lead his normal life. This is where the majority and I depart. The <em>Kreiner </em>analysis requires a comparison of plaintiffs life before the accident and after the accident, including \u201cthe significance of any affected aspects on the course of the plaintiffs overall life.\u201d Kreiner, 471 Mich at 132-133. To aid in this analysis, the following factors may be considered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">(a) the nature and extent of the impairment, (b) the type and length of treatment required, (c) the duration of the impairment, (d) the extent of any residual impairment, and (e) the prognosis for eventual recovery. <em>[Id. </em>at 133.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Plaintiffs ability to walk, as just noted, was impaired by a broken ankle. However, once plaintiffs ankle was placed in a cast at the emergency room, he was able to walk with the aid of crutches. And, immediately following his initial surgeiy in which a device was implanted to stabilize his ankle, plaintiff was still able to walk with crutches, although he was instructed not to place any weight on his ankle for one month. Plaintiff underwent physical therapy and nine months later, in October 2005, plaintiff again underwent surgery to remove the device. By January 2006 (one year after the accident), plaintiffs surgeon had cleared plaintiff to return to work with no restrictions. However, plaintiff claimed that he could not keep up with the demands of his job and thus was placed back on workers\u2019 compensation. Although plaintiffs subjective reports of his pain from January 2006 forward varied greatly,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the March 2006 FCE supported plaintiffs claim that he could not fully perform all of his previous job duties; however, this was due in part to a preexisting and unrelated shoulder injury. After plaintiffs workers\u2019 compensation benefits were terminated, however, plaintiff requested another FCE, and, on August 1, 2006, the FCE showed that plaintiff was able to perform essential job demands with no restrictions. Plaintiff returned to work on August 16, 2006, and has been able to perform his job duties since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Although plaintiff was assigned to a position that was less physically demanding than the position he had been performing before he was injured, plaintiff did this voluntarily and he suffered no loss in pay. Moreover, at the time plaintiff was injured, he had only been in that position for six months and, since he began to work for Allied in 2002, he had worked in three different positions. Thus, the fact that defendant was assigned to a different position upon his return is not particularly significant in this Court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Plaintiffs only argument regarding his inability to lead his normal life is that he was unable to work at certain times. During the time he was recuperating, plaintiff could care for himself and tend to his household chores without assistance. His relationship with his fianc\u00e9e/wife was unaffected. And he was able to enjoy his recreational activities without interruption. By plaintiffs own admission, his life was \u201cnormal\u201d with some \u201coccasional aching\u201d that was not aggravated by any activities, including standing or prolonged walking. It is fair to say that by August 2006 plaintiff had fully recovered from his broken ankle. Because only plaintiffs ability to work was affected and because this only lasted, at most, 17 months, the lower courts did not err in concluding that the impairment did not affect plaintiffs general ability to lead his normal life and, therefore, that plaintiff did not meet the \u201cserious impairment of body function\u201d threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">E. STARE DECISIS</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">The majority overrules <em>Kreiner </em>while paying its usual lip service to stare decisis.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> My fundamental disagree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>ment with the majority\u2019s application of the stare decisis doctrine is quite easily summarized. In <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439, 464; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), this Court drew on past caselaw and identified several relevant considerations in determining whether a case should be overruled under stare decisis.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> As explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>herein, <em>Kreiner </em>was the first occasion on which this Court was called upon to interpret the 1995 amendments to MCL 500.3135. <em>Kreiner </em>gave effect to the legislative intent as expressed in the language of the amended statute and was not, in my judgment, wrongly decided. Nonetheless, my disagreement with the majority on this point is not the thrust of this section. Rather, it is to remind the majority \u201cthat there are larger issues at stake in this case: the rule of law, respect for precedent, the integrity of this Court, and judicial restraint. Accordingly, larger institutional issues are implicated in this case.\u201d <em>Paige v Sterling </em>Hts, 476 Mich 495, 543; 720 NW2d 219 (2006) (CAVANAGH, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Indeed, the author of the majority opinion, as one who subscribes to the doctrine of legislative acquiescence, has often argued that principles of stare decisis are <em>especially strong </em>in matters of statutory interpretation.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Accordingly, his own words are relevant here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\u201c[T]he majority does not adequately explain why it disregards the doctrine of stare decisis in a matter of statutory interpretation when the Legislature itself has not seen fit in [six] years to correct <em>[Kreiner\u2019s] </em>allegedly incorrect interpretation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 536. To be fair, it is not only the author of the majority opinion, but <em>all </em>the justices who comprise the majority who should more clearly recognize the consequences of what they are doing. Even a cursory analysis of the majority\u2019s treatment of precedent since it ascended to power in January 2009 reveals a lack of sufficient regard for recent precedents that is directly contrary to their own previous assertions of the need not to needlessly overrule cases on account of stare decisis. Past complaints on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>their part that cases should not be overruled when the only thing that has changed is the membership of the Court have gone by the wayside.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">1. MAJORITY AND PRECEDENT IN 2009</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The new majority assumed power in January 2009, and wasted little time in beginning its efforts to \u201cundo\u201d decisions of the previous majority.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> On December 29, 2008, the former majority issued its opinion in <em>United States Fidelity Ins &amp; Guaranty Co v Mich Catastrophic Claims Ass\u2019n, </em>482 Mich 414, 417; 759 NW2d 154 (2008). Soon after Justice HATHAWAY replaced former Chief Justice TAYLOR on January 1, 2009, the plaintiffs filed motions for rehearing. The new majority granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motions for rehearing, and the cases were resubmitted for decision \u201cwithout further briefing or oral argument.\u201d 483 Mich 918 (2009). Then, in <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co v Mich Catastrophic Claims Ass\u2019n (On Rehearing), </em>484 Mich 1, 26; 795 NW2d 101 (2009), the new majority reversed the former majority\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>In <em>Bush v Shabahang, </em>484 Mich 156, 175 n 34; 772 NW2d 272 (2009), the majority stated that it \u201cquestion[ed] whether <em>Roberts I [Roberts v Mecosta Co Gen Hosp, </em>466 Mich 57; 642 NW2d 663 (2002)] and <em>Boodt </em>[v <em>Borgess Med Ctr, </em>481 Mich 558; 751 NW2d 44 (2008)] were correctly decided . . . And, in <em>Potter v McLeary, </em>484 Mich 397, 424 n 32; 774 NW2d 1 (2009), the majority said: \u201cWe question whether <em>Roberts II [Roberts v Mecosta Co Gen Hosp (After Remand), </em>470 Mich 679; 684 NW2d 711 (2004)] was correctly decided . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">The majority\u2019s treatment of precedent in the seven-month period from when it took power until the end of the Court\u2019s term in July 2009 was well explained in earlier statements of mine and of Justices CORRIGAN and YOUNG. For example, in <em>Henry v Dow Chem Co, </em>484 Mich 483, 528 n 28; 772 NW2d 301 (2009), Justice YOUNG observed in his partial dissent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">The majority\u2019s determination to ignore facts and precedent inconvenient to its desired outcome has become its <em>modus operandi. </em>See, e.g., <em>Vanslembrouck v Halperin, </em>483 Mich 965 (2009), where the new majority ignored <em>Vega v Lakeland Hospitals at Niles &amp; St Joseph, Inc, </em>479 Mich 243, 244; 736 NW2d 561 (2007); <em>Hardacre v Saginaw Vascular Services, </em>483 Mich 918 (2009), where it failed to follow <em>Boodt v Borgess Med Ctr, </em>481 Mich 558; 751 NW2d 44 (2008); <em>Sazima v Shepherd Bar &amp; Restaurant, </em>483 Mich 924 (2009), where it failed to follow <em>Chrysler v Blue Arrow Transport Lines, </em>295 Mich 606; 295 NW 331 (1940), and <em>Camburn v Northwest School Dist, </em>459 Mich 471; 592 NW2d 46 (1999); <em>Juarez v Holbrook, </em>483 Mich 970 (2009), where it failed to follow <em>Smith v Khouri, </em>481 Mich 519; 751 NW2d 472 (2008);<footnotemark>[38]</footnotemark> <em>Chambers v Wayne Co Airport Auth, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>483 Mich 1081 (2009), where it failed to follow <em>Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, </em>477 Mich 197; 731 NW2d 41 (2007);<footnotemark>[39]</footnotemark> and <em>Scott v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, </em>483 Mich 1032 (2009), where it failed to enforce <em>Thornton v Allstate Ins Co, </em>425 Mich 643; 391 NW2d 320 (1986), and <em>Putkamer v Transamerica Ins Corp of America, </em>454 Mich 626; 563 NW2d 683 (1997).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">And, as Justice CORRIGAN stated in her dissenting statement in <em>Beasley v Michigan, 483 </em>Mich 1025, 1029-1030 (2009):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">[T]he new majority\u2019s failure to abide by <em>Rowland </em>continues a growing and troubling trend. Rather than forthrightly overruling that decision, it is increasingly becoming the practice of this Court to simply ignore precedents with which it disagrees....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">On this Court, the new majority offers no articulable reasons whatsoever for its apparent detours from stare decisis. Instead, the majority declines to explain whether \u2014 and, if so, why \u2014 it is overruling precedent despite the obvious appearance that it is doing so. If it intends to alter legal principles embedded in this Court\u2019s decisions, then the new majority should explain its reasons clearly and intelligibly. Instead, the new majority overrules by indirection, or at least leaves the impression that it is doing so, thereby sowing the seeds of confusion and making it difficult for the citizens of this state to comprehend precisely what our caselaw requires. This appears to be an unfortunate return to our predecessors\u2019 past practice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>\u201cfrequently pa[ying] little attention to the inconsistencies among its cases and declin [ing] to reduce confusion in [the Court\u2019s] jurisprudence by overruling conflicting decisions.\u201d <em>Devillers v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>473 Mich 562, 571 n 19 [702 NW2d 539] (2005).<footnotemark>[40]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Additionally, in <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 313-326, Chief Justice KELLY authored an opinion, joined only by Justice CAVANAGH, in which she indicated that she wanted to overrule <em>Robinson </em>and <em>Lansing Mayor v Pub Serv Comm, </em>470 Mich 154; 680 NW2d 840 (2004). In my dissent, I stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">Given that in this case the Chief Justice would expressly overrule, not one, but two of this Court\u2019s prior decisions, \u201cone is naturally tempted to re-inquire, see <em>Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, </em>477 Mich 197, 223-228; 731 NW2d 41 (2007) (Markman, J., concurring), whether the ongoing dispute between the [former] majority and Justice KELLY over overrulings of precedent truly concerns attitudes toward stare decisis or merely attitudes toward particular previous decisions of this Court.\u201d <em>[People v Smith, </em>478 Mich 292, 322-323 n 17; 733 NW2d 351 (2007).] \u201cA justice\u2019s perspective on stare decisis is not evidenced by her willingness to maintain precedents with which she <em>agrees, </em>but by her willingness to maintain precedents with which she <em>disagrees.\u201d Rowland, </em>477 Mich at 224-225 n 3 (Markman, J., concurring). Now that the Chief Justice is positioned to overrule decisions with which she disagrees, her actions increasingly demonstrate that her former claims of fealty toward stare decisis were considerably overstated. Despite all her rhetoric concerning the impor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>tance of stare decisis for the exercise of the judicial power, see, e.g., her hollow claim that she possessed a \u201cdiffering [and elevated] esteem for stare decisis\u201d than another justice, <em>People v Gardner, </em>482 Mich 41, 88 n 31; 753 NW2d 78 (2008), such rhetoric was in reality little more than a means of communicating her opposition to overruling particular past decisions with which she agreed. <em>[Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 389-390 (Markman, J., dissenting) (emphasis in the original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">One other practice to which the new majority began to adhere in 2009 was requesting that the parties brief whether a decision of the former majority should be overruled. See, e.g., Justice Young\u2019s partial dissent in <em>Potter, </em>484 Mich at 450 n 43, in which he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">It is quickly becoming a new favored practice of the majority to flag decisions of the past decade and invite challenges to those decisions. It is difficult to reconcile this practice with the majority\u2019s previous claims of fidelity to stare decisis. See, e.g.,... <em>Pohutski v City of Allen Park, </em>465 Mich 675, 712; 641 NW2d 219 (2002) (Kelly, J., dissenting) (\u201c[I]f each successive Court, believing its reading is correct and past readings wrong, rejects precedent, then the law will fluctuate from year to year, rendering our jurisprudence dangerously unstable.\u201d); <em>Devillers, supra </em>at 620 (WEAVER, J., dissenting) (\u201cUnder the doctrine of stare decisis, it is necessary to follow earlier judicial decisions when the same points arise again in litigation.\u201d); <em>Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, </em>477 Mich 197, 278; 731 NW2d 41 (2007) (Cavanagh, J., dissenting) (\u201cUnder the doctrine of stare decisis, principles of law deliberately examined and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction become precedent and should not be lightly departed. Absent the rarest circumstances, we should remain faithful to established precedent.\u201d).... See also Todd C. Berg, Esq., <em>Hathaway Attacks, </em>Michigan Lawyers Weekly, October 27, 2008, in which Justice HATHAWAY was quoted: \u201cI believe in stare decisis. Something must be drastically wrong for the court to overrule\u201d; <em>Lawyers\u2019 Election Guide: Judge Diane Marie Hathaway, </em>Michigan Lawyers Weekly, October 30, 2006, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>which Justice HATHAWAY, then running for a position on the Court of Appeals, was quoted: \u201cToo many appellate decisions are being decided by judicial activists who are overturning precedent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Thus, from January 2009 through July 31, 2009, the new majority reversed an opinion on rehearing, sowed seeds of confusion by questioning three cases decided by the former majority, i.e., <em>Roberts I, Roberts II, </em>and <em>Boodt, </em>failed to follow numerous other precedents, as cited above, and began to issue orders requesting that the parties brief whether decisions made by the former majority should be overruled.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> And Chief Justice KELLY and Justice CAVANAGH went on record urging the express overruling of two cases: <em>Robinson </em>and <em>Lansing Mayor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">2.

In <em>Lansing Sch Ed Ass\u2019n v Lansing Bd of Ed, </em>487 Mich 349; 792 NW2d 686 (2010), the majority overruled <em>Lee v Macomb Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>464 Mich 726; 629 NW2d 900 (2001), <em>Crawford v Dep\u2019t of Civil Serv, </em>466 Mich 250; 645 NW2d 6 (2002), <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Federation v Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co, </em>471 Mich 608; 684 NW2d 800 (2004), <em>Associated Builders &amp; Contractors v Dep\u2019t of Consumer &amp; Indus Servs Dir, </em>472 Mich 117; 693 NW2d 374 (2005), <em>Mich Chiropractic Council v Comm\u2019r of the Office of Fin &amp; Ins Servs, </em>475 Mich 363; 716 NW2d 561 (2006), <em>Rohde v Ann Arbor Pub Sch, </em>479 Mich 336; 737 NW2d 158 (2007), <em>Mich Citizens for Water Conservation v Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America Inc, </em>479 Mich 280; 737 NW2d 447 (2007), and <em>Manuel v Gill, </em>481 Mich 637; 753 NW2d 48 (2008). In <em>Bezeau v Palace Sports &amp; Entertainment, Inc, </em>487 Mich 455; 795 NW2d 797 (2010), the majority expressly overruled the limited retroactive effect of <em>Karaczewski v Farbman Stein &amp; Co, </em>478 Mich 28; 732 NW2d 56 (2007). In <em>Univ of Mich Regents v Titan Ins Co, </em>487 Mich 289; 791 NW2d 897 (2010), the majority expressly overruled <em>Cameron v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>476 Mich 55; 718 NW2d 784 (2006). In <em>O\u2019Neal v St John Hosp &amp; Med Ctr, </em>487 Mich 485, 506 n 22; 791 NW2d 853 (2010), the lead opinion authored by Justice HATHAWAY indicated its agreement with Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s partial dissent in <em>Wickens v Oakwood Healthcare Sys, </em>465 Mich 53, 63-67; 631 NW2d 686 (2001), which already had the support of three justices (Chief Justice KELLY and Justices CAVANAGH and WEAVER). And, of course, in the case at bar, the majority has expressly overruled <em>Kreiner. </em>Finally, by amending MCR 2.112 and MCR 2.118 to allow amendments of affidavits of merit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>relate back to the of the original filing of the affidavit, the majority effectively overruled <em>Kirkaldy v Rim, </em>478 Mich 581; 734 NW2d 201 (2007). 485 Mich cclxxv, cclxxvi (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">3. OVERRULINGS OF PRECEDENT TO COME</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The majority\u2019s work, however, has apparently only just begun. In orders granting applications for leave to appeal, it has already teed up six more cases for possible overruling. These include: <em>Mich Citizens for Water Conservation v Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America Inc, </em>479 Mich 280; 737 NW2d 447 (2007);<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> <em>Preserve the Dunes, Inc v Dep\u2019t of Environmental Quality, </em>471 Mich 508; 684 NW2d 847 (2004);<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> <em>Trentadue v Buckler Automatic Lawn Sprinkler Co, </em>479 Mich 378; 738 NW2d 664 (2007);<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> <em>Griffith v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, </em>472 Mich 521; 697 NW2d 895 (2005);<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> <em>Rory v Continental </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number><em>Ins Co, </em>473 Mich 457; 703 NW2d 23 (2005) ;<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> and <em>Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, </em>477 Mich 197; 731 NW2d 41 (2007).<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The new majority once purported to be concerned about the stability of the law,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> but that concern appears to have passed with the passing of the former majority. Indeed, it is difficult to consider anything more destabilizing to the law than to have the majority issue multiple orders continually requesting that the parties brief whether recently decided cases have been properly decided. Justices who once postured as champions of stare decisis now cannot act quickly enough to overrule disfavored precedents. The majority\u2019s past claims of fealty to stare decisis were greatly exaggerated, and obviously nothing more than a function of their opposition to <em>particular </em>decisions being decided by the Court at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">4. HYPOCRISY AND STARE DECISIS</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The majority accuses the dissenting justices of hypocrisy with regard to our stare decisis criticisms of the majority.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The dissenters\u2019 stare decisis protestations should taste like ashes in their mouths. To the principles of stare decisis, to which they paid absolutely no heed as they denigrated the wisdom of innumerable predecessors, the dissenters now would wrap themselves in its benefits to save their recent precedent. <em>[Ante </em>at 209 n 21.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">However, the position of the dissenting justices on stare decisis has not changed a whit since we were in the majority; by contrast, the position of the majority justices is unrecognizable.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">It has always been our position that stare decisis is not an \u201cinexorable command,\u201d and that a judge\u2019s primary obligation is to the law and the constitution, not to the judgments of his or her predecessors. To that end, we have always asserted that there are multiple judicial values that must be assessed in any case in which previous decisions of the Court are implicated. In every such case, a judge must respectfully consider the interests served by stare decisis \u2014 predictability and certainty in the law, and the uniformity of its application. However, in every such case, a judge must also consider the interests served by interpreting the law correctly\u2014 regard for the lawmaker, adherence to constitutional dictates concerning the \u201cjudicial power\u201d and the separation of powers, and competing predictability and certainty interests that are served where the law means what it plainly says. <em>Robinson, 462 </em>Mich at 464-468. As we explained in <em>Robinson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">[I]t is well to recall in discussing reliance, when dealing with an area of the law that is statutory ..., that it is to the words of the statute itself that a citizen first looks for guidance in directing his actions. This is the essence of the rule of law: to know in advance what the rules of society are. Thus, if the words of the statute are clear, the actor should be able to expect, that is, rely, that they will be carried out by all in society, including the courts. In fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>should a court confound those legitimate citizen expectations by misreading or misconstruing a statute, it is that court itself that has disrupted the reliance interest. When that happens, a subsequent court, rather than holding to the distorted reading because of the doctrine of stare decisis, should overrule the earlier court\u2019s misconstruction. The reason for this is that the court in distorting the statute was engaged in a form of judicial usurpation that runs counter to the bedrock principle of American constitutionalism, i.e., that the lawmaking power is reposed in the people as reflected in the work of the Legislature, and, absent a constitutional violation, the courts have no legitimacy in overruling or nullifying the people\u2019s representatives. Moreover, not only does such a compromising by a court of the citizen\u2019s ability to rely on a statute have no constitutional warrant, it can gain no higher pedigree as later courts repeat the error. <em>[Id. </em>at 467-468.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">That has been the consistent approach of the dissenting justices, and this continues to be our approach. Respect for stare decisis is a critical judicial value, but so is a regard for the constitutional processes of government by which a judge strives to interpret the law in accordance with its actual language. Balancing these values is sometimes difficult, and reasonable people can often disagree as to how this balance should be struck. <em>Robinson </em>supplies one attempt at identifying the factors that courts have traditionally looked to in striking this balance in a consistent and reasonable manner. Despite suggestions to the contrary, <em>Robinson </em>does not establish a \u201cmechanical\u201d process, but simply attempts to afford reasonable guidance in achieving a fair equilibrium between stare decisis and getting the law right.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>However, as explained above, the justices now in the majority who were on the Court at the time took a quite different approach to stare decisis when they were in the minority. As Justice YOUNG has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-4\">[Our] position on stare decisis has not changed, and the [the majority] attempts to shift focus to [us] in order to avoid confronting [their] own inconsistency. The public should understand when justices\u2019 positions on important matters shift. And that is the focus of this dissent: when the [majority] justice[s] [were] in the minority, [they] liked stare decisis a lot; now that [they are] in the majority, it is not an issue. That is the \u201cirony\u201d the public should understand. <em>[Anglers, </em>486 Mich at 993 (2010) (Young, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The majority entirely misapprehends our criticism of its record on stare decisis if it thinks that we are simply counting the number of occasions on which they have overruled precedent over the past term and a half. That is not our intention at all. We freely acknowledge that we too overruled precedents when we were in the majority\u2014 although hardly at their remarkable pace. That is not the nub of our critique. Rather, the nub is: (a) that the majority justices have demonstrated a remarkably inconsistent and \u201cflexible\u201d attitude toward stare decisis, in which their views on the subject appear to be nothing more than a function of whether they are in the majority or the minority; and (b) that the majority justices equate their own overrulings of precedent, in which they have <em>widened </em>the distance between the law of the lawmaker and the law of the court, with the previous majority\u2019s overrulings, in which we did the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\u201c[N]o meaningful discussion of a court\u2019s attitude toward precedent can be based solely on an arithmetical analysis in which raw numbers of overrulings are simply counted. Such an analysis obscures that not all precedents are built alike, that some are better reasoned than others, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>that some are grounded in the exercise of discretionary judgments and others in the interpretation of plain language, that some are thorough in their analyses and others superficial.\u201d <em>Rowland, </em>477 Mich at 226 (Markman, J., concurring). The chart set forth in <em>Rowland </em>demonstrates, we believe, that the overrulings of precedent that occurred between January 1, 2000, until <em>Rowland </em>was decided on May 2, 2007, \u201coverwhelmingly came in cases involving what the justices in the majority [at that time] view[ed] as the misinterpretation of straightforward words and phrases in statutes and contracts, in which words that were <em>not </em>there were read into the law or words that <em>were </em>there were read out of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is, these overrulings of precedent sought more closely to equate our state\u2019s caselaw with our statutes, while the overrulings of precedent of the present majority have achieved exactly the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Thus, the present majority has regard neither for precedent nor for the most significant competing value that would sometimes warrant overturning a precedent, to wit, that it is not in accord with the words of the lawmaker. In the end, the majority\u2019s approach to stare decisis is empty and incoherent. The majority has unsettled the precedents of this Court at a Guinness world\u2019s record pace, and it has done so while disserving <em>both </em>the values of stare decisis and that of a court acting in accordance with the constitutional separation of powers to respect the decisions of the lawmaker. The majority has run amuck in service of values that have no grounding in either stare decisis or any other conception of the \u201cjudicial power,\u201d other than that they comprise an arithmetical majority of this Court. In this regard, the majority confuses power and authority. The majority unsettles and confuses the law <em>both </em>in its disregard for this Court\u2019s previous decisions and in its equal disregard for the language of the law. It com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>pounds the confusion it fosters in one realm with the confusion that it fosters in the other.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> There is no saving grace in its overrulings of precedent, no balancing of difficult judicial principles, no apparent recognition of the values served by either of the competing considerations involved where precedents are at issue, and no thoughtful effort to articulate even the roughest principles for its actions. In its destructive march through the caselaw of this state to identify surviving and straggling decisions that need to be \u201ctaken out,\u201d the majority furthers no discernible legal value of any kind, other than litigation and still more litigation. In the end, there is no legal core to the majority\u2019s approach to stare decisis, and it is left with nothing other than a feeble effort to equate its own actions with those of the dissenting justices when they were in the majority. \u201cWe are no worse than you\u201d is the majority\u2019s banner, when in truth the majority has not the slightest conception of <em>our </em>approach to stare decisis, and not the slightest conception of the damage that their <em>own </em>approach to stare decisis is doing to the citizens of this state who wish to act in accordance with the law and who wish to understand their rights and obligations under that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">E UNDOING THE LEGISLATIVE COMPROMISE</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">As discussed earlier, although virtually all legislation involves some sort of compromise, the no-fault act, in particular, entailed a substantial and well-understood compromise. In exchange for the payment of economic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>loss benefits from one\u2019s own insurance company (first-party benefits), the Legislature limited an injured person\u2019s ability to sue a negligent operator or owner of a motor vehicle for noneconomic losses (third-party benefits). <em>Kreiner, </em>471 Mich at 114-115. As stated in <em>Stephens v Dixon, </em>449 Mich 531, 541; 536 NW2d 755 (1995): \u201cIt was a specific purpose of the Legislature in enacting the Michigan no-fault act to partially abolish tort remedies for injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents and to substitute for those remedies an entitlement to first-party insurance benefits.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\">At least two reasons are evident concerning why the Legislature limited recovery for noneconomic loss, both of which relate to the economic viability of the system. First, there was the problem of the overcompensation of minor injuries. Second, there were the problems incident to the excessive litigation of motor vehicle accident cases. Regarding the second problem, if noneconomic losses were always to be a matter subject to adjudication under the act, the goal of reducing motor vehicle accident litigation would likely be illusory. The combination of the costs of continuing litigation and continuing overcompensation for minor injuries could easily threaten the economic viability, or at least desirability, of providing so many benefits without regard to fault. If every case is subject to the potential of litigation on the question of noneconomic loss, for which recovery is still predicated on negligence, perhaps little has been gained by granting benefits for economic loss without regard to fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">Regarding the trade-off involved in no-fault acts, 7 Am Jur 2d, Automobile Insurance, \u00a7 340, p 1068, contains the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">\u201cIt has been said of one such plan that the practical effect of the adoption of personal injury protection insurance is to afford the citizen the security of prompt and certain recovery to a fixed amount of the most salient elements of his out-of-pocket expenses * * *. In return for this he surrenders the possibly minimal damages for pain and suffering recoverable in cases not marked by serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>economic loss or objective indicia of grave injury, and also surrenders the outside chance that through a generous settlement or a liberal award by a judge or jury in such a case he may be able to reap a monetary windfall out of his misfortune.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-4\">Thus, it is apparent that the threshold requirements for a traditional tort action for noneconomic loss play an important role in the functioning of the no-fault act. [Cassidy, 415 Mich at 500-501.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Accordingly, there is no question that the legislative compromise that produced the no-fault act recognized that some injuries would not be considered sufficient to meet the no-fault threshold. While every injury resulting from a motor vehicle accident certainly has adverse consequences, and may involve medical costs, treatment, and bodily pain, not all injuries rise to the level of the no-fault threshold of a \u201cserious impairment of body function.\u201d <em>Some </em>injured persons are able to recover <em>noneconomic </em>damages, so that <em>all </em>injured persons are able to recover <em>economic </em>loss benefits regardless of fault. Otherwise, \u201clittle has been gained by granting benefits for economic loss without regard to fault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 500. Indeed, \u201cthe excessive litigation of motor vehicle accident cases\u201d would continue, and, yet, economic loss benefits would have to be paid regardless of fault. <em>Id. </em>In other words, plaintiffs would be able to recover economic loss benefits regardless of fault and without having to go to a jury, while these same plaintiffs would also be able to go to a jury and seek noneconomic benefits as well. That is not the compromise reached by the Legislature. In particular, it is a lose-lose proposition for those funding the no-fault system, i.e., all insured Michigan drivers.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>In addition, it has been repeatedly recognized that, due to the mandatory nature of no-fault insurance, the Legislature intended that its cost be affordable. <em>Shavers, </em>402 Mich at 599 (\u201cThe Legislature has . . . fostered the expectation that no-fault insurance will be available at fair and equitable rates.\u201d).<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Indeed, because it is mandatory, it <em>must </em>be affordable. <em>Id. </em>at 600 (\u201cWe therefore conclude that Michigan motorists are constitutionally entitled to have no-fault insurance made available on a fair and equitable basis.\u201d). It is a matter of economic logic that in order to maintain a system in which motor vehicle accident victims are able to receive economic loss benefits regardless of fault, drivers must be required to purchase insurance, and in order to ensure that drivers purchase this insurance, it must be kept affordable. The majority\u2019s decision, however, very considerably \u201clowers the bar\u201d that an injured plaintiff must satisfy in order to meet the serious impairment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>body function threshold, making it significantly easier for a plaintiff to recover for noneconomic losses. This means insurance companies that issue no-fault policies will be financially obligated in more cases and, as a result, will be required to pass along their increased costs to policyholders by way of increased premiums charged to Michigan drivers.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Today\u2019s decision, just as last term\u2019s decision by the new majority in <em>United States Fidelity (On </em>Rehearing9,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> will eventually result in a substantial <em>increase </em>in premiums paid for their <em>mandatory </em>no-fault policies.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Every owner of a car that is driven on a public highway must buy certain basic coverages in order to register the vehicle and obtain license plates. MCL 500.3101(1). The Legislature has provided two incentives to ensure that owners purchase the required insurance. First, it is a misdemeanor to drive a motor vehicle without basic no-fault coverage. Under MCL 500.3102(2), if someone is convicted of driving without basic no-fault insurance coverage, he or she can be fined up to $500, incarcerated in jail for up to one year, or both. Second, the no-fault act precludes receipt of no-fault personal protection insurance benefits if at the time of the accident the person was the owner or registrant of an uninsured motor vehicle involved in the accident. MCL 500.3113(b). Notwithstanding this criminal sanction, and this potential preclusion of no-fault benefits, it is estimated that 17 percent<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> of Michigan\u2019s approximately 8 million motor vehicles<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> are still operated without a no-fault policy in effect. With such mandatory policies now becoming even more expensive, one can also reasonably anticipate a corresponding increase in the already large number of uninsured vehicles being driven on our roads and highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The majority\u2019s decision will not only result in increased automobile insurance premiums, and more uninsured vehicles on our roads and highways, but it will also mean that substantially more lawsuits will be filed, even though an express goal of the no-fault act was to reduce \u201cexcessive litigation of motor vehicle accident cases.\u201d <em>Cassidy, </em>415 Mich at 500. Yet, under the majority\u2019s opinion, more lawsuits will make their way to juries for the consideration of noneconomic loss benefits, straining our already overburdened courts.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>As it is, no-fault automobile negligence cases remain a dominant factor in Michigan civil filings every year. Indeed, of the 47,300 new civil case filings in Michigan circuit courts in 2009, 9,067 \u2014 approximately 20 percent of all civil cases \u2014 were automobile related.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Given that many no-fault claims are settled without the filing of a lawsuit, the number of claims potentially affected by the majority\u2019s ruling is even higher.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The majority\u2019s decision will also increase the costs incurred by the state of Michigan itself (and, of course, the taxpayers who fund those costs). In the course of arguing that <em>Kreiner </em>should not be overruled because it \u201cclarifies rather than expands the statutory language,\u201d the Attorney General\u2019s amicus curiae brief warns that if <em>Kreiner </em>is overruled, as a self-insured entity, the state will realize \u201ca direct, significant increase in the cost of its litigation and coverage obligations.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Finally, and as a consequence of all the above, the majority\u2019s decision will almost certainly call into question the long-term economic integrity of the present no-fault system in Michigan. By nullifying the legislative compromise that was struck when the no-fault act was adopted \u2014 a compromise grounded in concerns over excessive litigation, the over-compensation of minor injuries, and the availability of affordable insurance\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>the Court\u2019s decision today will restore a legal environment in which each of these hazards reappears and threatens the continued fiscal soundness of our no-fault system.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The no-fault automobile insurance act, in MCL 500.3135(1), provides that \u201c[a] person remains subject to tort liability for noneconomic loss caused by his or her ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle only if the injured person has suffered death, serious impairment of body function, or permanent serious disfigurement.\u201d The issue here is whether plaintiff has suffered a serious impairment of body function. \u201c \u2018[S]erious impairment of body function\u2019 means an objectively manifested impairment of an important body function that affects the person\u2019s general ability to lead his or her normal life.\u201d MCL 500.3135(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">In <em>Kreiner, </em>471 Mich at 132-133, this Court held that in determining whether the impairment affects the plaintiffs general ability to lead his normal life, \u201ca court should engage in a multifaceted inquiry, comparing the plaintiffs life before and after the accident as well as the significance of any affected aspects on the course of the plaintiffs overall life.\u201d In addition, <em>Kreiner </em>indicated that certain factors, such as the duration of the impairment, may be of assistance in evaluating whether the plaintiffs general ability to lead his normal life has been affected. <em>Id. </em>at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>The majority overrules <em>Kreiner, </em>rejecting these factors and holding that <em>temporal </em>considerations are wholly or largely irrelevant in determining whether an impairment affects the plaintiffs general ability to lead his or her normal life. The majority apparently holds instead that as long as a plaintiffs general ability to lead his normal life has been affected for even a single moment in time, the plaintiff has suffered a serious impairment of body function. This conclusion is at odds with the actual language of the statute and nullifies the legislative compromise embodied in the no-fault act. Because I believe that <em>Kreiner </em>was correctly decided and that temporal considerations are, in fact, highly relevant, and indeed necessary, in determining whether an impairment affects the plaintiffs general ability to lead his normal life, I would sustain <em>Kreiner. </em>By nullifying the legislative compromise over the no-fault act \u2014 a compromise grounded in concerns over excessive litigation, the over-compensation of minor injuries, and the availability of affordable insurance \u2014 the Court\u2019s decision today will revive a legal environment in which each of these hazards reappears and threatens the continued fiscal integrity of our no-fault system.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Because I do not believe that the lower courts erred in concluding that plaintiff has not suffered a serious impairment of body function, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b328-5\">Corrigan and Young, JJ., concurred with Markman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-8\"> Before plaintiff began working for Allied, he installed windows.
