In legal terms, the question becomes whether the doctrine of contribution can be applied between co-tenants in a tenancy by the entirety where one spouse has willfully abandoned the other before that spouse\u2019s death and, thus, is not a \u201csurviving spouse.\u201d See MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(i). In either iteration of the question before this Court, the core issue is the same, and the inequities in this case are inescapable. Accordingly, the resolution of this case turns exclusively on whether the firmly established doctrine of contribution can be appropriately applied on these facts. Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>cause there is no adequate remedy at law for the harm plaintiff alleges, because no other governing legal or equitable principle precludes this remedy, and because the relief plaintiff seeks \u2014 when properly understood\u2014 will not upset the common law of this state, we conclude that the equitable doctrine of contribution can be appropriately applied in this context. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand to the probate court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">I. PACTS AND HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Janet and Frank Mandeville were married in 1975 and remained so until Janet died on July 13, 2002, after a battle with breast cancer. The Mandevilles acquired two properties during their marriage. In 1984, they acquired a marital residence in Macomb County, and, in 1987, they acquired a parcel of property in Ogemaw County. They owned both properties as tenants by the entirety. Accordingly, by the right of survivorship inherent in a tenancy by the entirety, the marital real properties passed to Frank upon Janet\u2019s death. Without question, he now owns them in fee simple absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In the last decade of their marriage, Frank Mandeville was often out of the country for extended periods. Specifically, he was absent for the 18 months preceding Janet\u2019s death. During this period, Frank did not attempt to call Janet or otherwise communicate with her, even though, as he acknowledged, he knew that she was seriously ill. He did not attend her funeral. In Frank\u2019s absence, Janet maintained the properties and was responsible for paying the taxes, insurance, and mortgage. In Frank\u2019s absence, Janet was cared for by her sister, Susan Tkachik.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>In the months before she died, Janet executed a living trust and final will that disinherited her husband and left everything to her mother, Wanda Tkachik. Janet\u2019s will stated: \u201cIt is my specific intent to give nothing to my husband under this Trust Agreement. If I am survived by my husband, for the purposes of this Trust Agreement, he will be deemed to have predeceased me.\u201d In addition, the will named Susan Tkachik (hereafter Tkachik) the personal representative of the estate. Tkachik now brings this action in that capacity. Moreover, consistent with Janet\u2019s unequivocal intent to disinherit her husband in her will, before she died, Janet also transferred her retirement benefits so that they would not pass to Frank, and she unsuccessfully attempted to defeat the right of survivorship by transferring her interest in the marital properties by quitclaim deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Several months after Janet\u2019s death, Frank Mandeville filed a petition for probate as well as a complaint seeking to set aside Janet\u2019s will and trust. Tkachik, acting as the personal representative of her deceased sister\u2019s estate, moved for summary disposition, arguing that Frank Mandeville should not be considered a surviving spouse because he had been willfully absent from the marriage for more than a year. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Applying the clear language of MCL 700.2801(2), the probate court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>ruled that Frank Mandeville was not a \u201csurviving spouse\u201d and granted plaintiffs motion in October 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">In November 2003, Tkachik filed suit on behalf of the estate in probate court to effectuate her sister\u2019s intent to disinherit Frank Mandeville completely. Plaintiff sought a determination that, because defendant was not a \u201csurviving spouse,\u201d the Mandevilles should be considered tenants in common with regard to their real properties and defendant should not obtain fee ownership of the properties. The probate court denied plaintiffs request, reasoning that the surviving spouse statute is limited in its application and does not destroy a tenancy by the entirety. Therefore, it properly held that upon Janet\u2019s death, fee-simple title to the properties had vested in defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Plaintiff amended her complaint to seek contribution from defendant for the monetary expenses Janet incurred in maintaining the properties before her death. The probate court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition on the estate\u2019s contribution claim. Plaintiff filed a delayed application for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals, which was denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented. <em>Tkachik v Mandeville, </em>unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, entered November 16, 2006 (Docket No. 270253). Initially, plaintiffs application for leave to appeal in this Court was also denied. <em>Tkachik v Mandeville, 477 </em>Mich 1057 (2007). However, this Court granted plaintiffs motion for reconsideration, and, on reconsideration and in lieu of granting leave to appeal, remanded the case to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Court of Appeals as on leave granted to consider \u201cwhether a contribution claim against the defendant, based on an unjust enrichment theory, is appropriate under the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Tkachik v Mandeville, </em>480 Mich 898 (2007).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">On remand, the Court of Appeals affirmed the probate court\u2019s decision. <em>Tkachik v Mandeville, </em>282 Mich App 364, 366; 764 NW2d 318 (2009). The panel reasoned that defendant had not been unjustly enriched because he had only received \u201cthat which was given to him by operation of law, without any obligation . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372. Moreover, the panel emphasized the fact that Janet was deceased, and stated that it could not enter a \u201cposthumous divorce\u201d based on \u201cperceived inequities\u201d because \u201cMichigan law does not recognize such an action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373, 378. Plaintiff again appealed in this Court. We granted plaintiffs application for leave to appeal, directing the parties to address the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">[W]hether, when a husband has abandoned his wife for the year and a half preceding her death, and the wife alone has made mortgage, tax, and insurance payments on property held as tenants by the entirety, the wife (or her estate) may receive contribution for the husband\u2019s share of these payments. <em>[Tkachik v Mandeville, </em>485 Mich 853 (2009).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Plaintiffs claim sounds in equity, and requires this Court to consider whether the common law doctrine of contribution is appropriately applied in this context. We hear and consider equity cases de novo on the record on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>appeal. <em>Biske v City of Troy, </em>381 Mich 611, 613; 166 NW2d 453 (1969). The interpretation and applicability of a common-law doctrine is also a question that is reviewed de novo. <em>James v Alberts, </em>464 Mich 12, 14; 626 NW2d 158 (2001). \u201c \u2018[T]he granting of equitable relief is ordinarily a matter of grace, and whether a court of equity will exercise its jurisdiction, and the propriety of affording equitable relief, rests in the sound discretion of the court, to be exercised according to the circumstances and exigencies of each particular case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Youngs v West, </em>317 Mich 538, 545; 27 NW2d 88 (1947) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Plaintiff asks this Court to exercise its equitable powers. Therefore, this case requires an understanding of the principles that guide this Court in determining whether to provide equitable relief, a determination that, in this case, also requires consideration of the law governing tenancy by the entirety, the doctrine of contribution, and claims for unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">A. EQUITABLE PRINCIPLES</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">In its sound discretion, this Court may grant equitable relief \u201c[w]here a legal remedy is not available[.]\u201d <em>Powers v Fisher, </em>279 Mich 442, 448; 272 NW 737 (1937). \u201cA remedy at law, in order to preclude a suit in equity, must be complete and ample, and not doubtful and uncertain. .. .\u201d <em>Edsell v Briggs, </em>20 Mich 429, 433 (1870). Furthermore, to preclude a suit in equity, a remedy at law, \u201cboth in respect to its final relief and its modes of obtaining the relief, must be as effectual as the remedy which equity would confer under the circumstances ....\u201d <em>Powers, </em>279 Mich at 447, citing 1 Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence (3d ed), \u00a7 280. Equity jurispru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>dence \u201c \u2018mold[s] its decrees to do justice amid all the vicissitudes and intricacies of life.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spoon-Shacket Co, Inc v Oakland Co, </em>356 Mich 151, 163; 97 NW2d 25 (1959) (citation omitted). While legislative action that provides an adequate remedy by statute precludes equitable relief, the <em>absence </em>of such action does not. This is so because \u201c[e]very equitable right or interest derives not from a declaration of substantive law, but from the broad and flexible jurisdiction of courts of equity to afford remedial relief, where justice and good conscience so dictate.\u201d 30A CJS, Equity, \u00a7 93, at 289 (1992). Equity allows \u201ccomplete justice\u201d to be done in a case by \u201cadapting] its judgment^] to the special circumstances of the case.\u201d 27A Am Jur 2d, Equity, \u00a7 2, at 520-521.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">B. TENANCY BY THE ENTIRETY</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">A tenancy by the entirety is a type of concurrent ownership in real property that is unique to married persons. <em>Field v Steiner, </em>250 Mich 469, 477; 231 NW 109 (1930). In <em>Long v Earle, </em>277 Mich 505, 517; 269 NW 577 (1936), this Court explained that a defining incident of this tenancy under Michigan law is \u201cthat one tenant by the entirety has no interest separable from that of the other\u201d and \u201chas nothing to convey or mortgage or to which he alone can attach a lien.\u201d Thus, when title to real estate is vested in a husband and wife by the entirety, separate alienation by one spouse only is barred. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, MCL 557.71 states, \u201ca husband and wife shall be equally entitled to the rents, products, income, or profits, and to the control and management of real or personal property held by them as tenants by the entirety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">In addition to these rights, both spouses have a right of survivorship, meaning that, in the event that one spouse dies, the remaining spouse automatically owns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>the entire property. MCL 700.2901(2)(g); <em>Rogers v Rogers, </em>136 Mich App 125, 134; 356 NW2d 288 (1984). Thus, entireties properties are not part of a decedent spouse\u2019s estate, and the law of descent and distribution does not apply to property passing to the survivor. <em>Id. </em>at 134-135.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">C. CONTRIBUTION AND UNJUST ENRICHMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Contribution is an equitable remedy based on principles of natural justice. <em>Lorimer v Julius Knack Coal Co, </em>246 Mich 214, 217; 224 NW 362 (1929). In <em>Caldwell v Fox, </em>394 Mich 401, 417; 231 NW2d 46 (1975), this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">The general rule of contribution is that one who is compelled to pay or satisfy the whole <em>or to bear more than his aliquot share of the common burden or obligation, </em>upon which several persons are equally liable or which they are bound to discharge, is entitled to contribution against the others to obtain from them payment of their respective shares. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">This Court has applied the doctrine of contribution between co-contractors. <em>Comstock v Potter, </em>191 Mich 629, 637; 158 NW 102 (1916) (\u201c[O]ne who has paid more than his share of the joint obligation may recover contribution from his co-contractors.\u201d). And, in <em>Strohm v Koepke, </em>352 Mich 659, 662-663; 90 NW2d 495 (1958), this Court recognized the right of equitable contribution for tenants in common. <em>Strohm </em>grounded a co-tenant\u2019s right to contribution \u201cupon purely equitable considerations,\u201d explaining that \u201c[i]t is premised upon the simple proposition that equality is equity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Plaintiff predicates her claim for contribution on a theory of unjust enrichment. Unjust enrichment is defined as the unjust retention of \u201c \u2018money or benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>which in justice and equity belong to another.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCreary v Shields, </em>333 Mich 290, 294; 52 NW2d 853 (1952) (citation omitted). \u201cNo person is unjustly enriched unless the retention of the benefit would be unjust.\u201d <em>Buell v Orion State Bank, </em>327 Mich 43, 56; 41 NW2d 472 (1950). <em>Buell </em>also explained: \u201c \u2018One is not unjustly enriched... by retaining benefits involuntarily acquired which law and equity give him absolutely without any obligation on his part to make restitution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">D. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">In this case, we must determine: (a) whether defendant was unjustly enriched; and, if so, (b) whether the doctrine of contribution can be appropriately applied in these circumstances to prevent his unjust enrichment. After carefully considering the governing legal and equitable principles, and after meaningfully engaging with \u201c \u2018the circumstances and exigencies of [this] particular case,\u2019 \u201d as equity requires, <em>Youngs, </em>317 Mich at 545 (citation omitted), we answer both questions in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">1. UNJUST ENRICHMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Defendant argues, and the Court of Appeals and the dissents in this Court agree, that he has not been unjustly enriched because he \u201chas only received that which was given to him by operation of law, without any obligation ....\u201d <em>Tkachik, </em>282 Mich App at 372. In support of this conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied on <em>Buell </em>for the proposition that there can be no unjust enrichment where a person comes into ownership of property that \u201c \u2018law and equity give him absolutely without any obligation on his part to make restitution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buell, </em>327 Mich at 56 (citation omitted). There are significant legal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>factual flaws in this argument, which we herein reject. As a threshold matter, this conclusion is based on a misreading of <em>Buell, </em>the primary authority offered in support of the conclusion that defendant has not been unjustly enriched. The Court of Appeals and the dissents fail to note what is most obvious in <em>Buell, </em>namely, that its limitation on a finding of unjust enrichment requires the consideration of both legal <em>and </em>equitable factors. Thus, even though by operation of <em>law </em>defendant received the property \u201cabsolutely,\u201d he is still unjustly enriched if he is obligated by <em>equity </em>to make restitution. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, <em>Buell </em>does not preclude a finding that defendant was unjustly enriched. Rather, its rule plainly states exactly the contrary \u2014 that a defendant may be held to have been unjustly enriched if <em>equity </em>demands that he make restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">On the facts of this case, we conclude that equity, and the principles of natural justice embodied therein, call on defendant Frank Mandeville to contribute his share of the property maintenance costs incurred by his wife Janet Mandeville, who bore these obligations alone in the 18 months before her death. While defendant was willfully absent from the marriage, and from the marital properties, Janet maintained the properties and incurred all the necessary expenses. In light of these facts, the Court of Appeals\u2019 and the dissents\u2019 conclusion that defendant received the properties \u201cwithout any obligation\u201d is an oversimplification that is at odds with the realities of this case. Significantly, this conclusion does not account for what <em>would </em>have happened to the properties had Janet not made the mortgage, tax, and insurance payments. Janet made those payments to preserve the undivided interest in the properties that she and her husband shared. Failure to make these mortgage and tax payments would have resulted in the loss of the properties to foreclosure. Simply put, but for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Janet\u2019s payments, <em>there would he no property </em>to pass to defendant by operation of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Considering this reality, we are unable to conclude that defendant received the properties \u201c \u2018without any obligation on his part to make restitution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buell, </em>327 Mich at 56 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 and the dissents\u2019 contrary conclusion is also based on a misunderstanding concerning the relief plaintiff requests. The Court of Appeals determined that a finding of unjust enrichment \u201cwould subvert the protective purpose of the tenancy by the entirety, as it would permit the state to pierce the marital relationship and divide property contrary to how the parties chose to hold the property.\u201d <em>Tkachik, </em>282 Mich App at 376. The flaw in this argument is that <em>plaintiff is not seeking to divide marital real property, </em>and the relief she <em>actually </em>seeks will not \u201csubvert\u201d or in any other way affect the law of tenancies by the entirety. Indeed, plaintiff is legally incompetent to divide or alter defendant\u2019s interest in the marital properties because, as the parties acknowledge, defendant already owns the properties in fee simple absolute, as they passed to him solely and absolutely upon Janet\u2019s death. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> What plaintiff is seeking as the personal representative of Janet\u2019s estate is contribution for the past <em>monetary </em>expenses that Janet incurred in maintaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>the marital properties while defendant was willfully absent from Janet and the properties. Thus, the fact that the properties undisputedly passed to defendant automatically by operation of law does not defeat a finding that defendant was unjustly enriched or bar a claim for contribution. As the facts here illustrate, permitting a contribution claim in these circumstances will not interfere with well-settled principles governing property held in a tenancy by the entirety and specifically will not affect the unencumbered right of survivorship.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Janet and Frank Mandeville held their properties as tenants by the entirety; upon Janet\u2019s death, such properties passed to Frank solely and absolutely, at which point he owned them in fee simple absolute. The law of tenancy by the entirety, and specifically the right of survivorship, has already been given full effect in this case, a result that is unaltered when Frank is required to pay contribution to plaintiff for past monetary expenses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>In sum, when the applicable law is understood, and the specific circumstances of this case are evaluated in the context of a contribution claim, we conclude that defendant has been unjustly enriched by his retention of \u201c \u2018money or benefits which in justice and equity belong to another.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCreary, </em>333 Mich at 294 (citation omitted). Defendant owns the marital properties <em>only because of </em>Janet\u2019s maintenance payments. Considering his willful abandonment of Janet, by which she alone became responsible for the properties, for defendant to retain the monies that preserved these properties and made his ownership possible would be unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">2. ADEQUATE REMEDY</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The next consideration is whether the doctrine of contribution can be appropriately applied in these circumstances to prevent defendant\u2019s unjust enrichment. In making this determination, the first question to be addressed is whether there is an adequate legal remedy that precludes this Court from providing equitable relief. <em>Powers, </em>279 Mich at 447. We conclude that there is not. Although Justice YOUNG claims that \u201c[h]ere, Janet Mandeville had several available remedies that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>she declined to pursue,\u201d specifically arguing that Janet could have filed for divorce or separate maintenance, <em>post </em>at 82, one simply does not need to think too long or too hard about the legal remedies of divorce or separate maintenance to realize that they are entirely inadequate for several reasons. First, divorce, and by extension separate maintenance, is an <em>inappropriate </em>remedy for many people, especially those for whom divorce is religiously or morally objectionable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Second, divorce is a <em>disproportionate </em>remedy when compared to the relief actually sought \u2014 contribution for the past monetary expenses that Janet incurred in maintaining the properties.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The Court of Appeals and dissents disagree. They fault Janet for not taking legal steps to dissolve her marriage and accuse plaintiff of attempting to create a \u201c \u2018de facto\u2019 \u201d divorce that would \u201cdistribute jointly held property\u201d in the absence of such action. <em>Tkachik, </em>282 Mich App at 373. However, this criticism is based on a persistent misunderstanding about plaintiffs claim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>contribution. As stated, plaintiffs contribution claim will <em>not </em>divide the marital real properties that defendant undisputedly owns in fee simple absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Thus, the remedy of divorce, which would have both dissolved the Mandevilles\u2019 bonds of marriage and necessitated a division of real property, does not constitute an adequate remedy at law for the actual, and relatively narrow, relief sought by plaintiff. As this Court has made clear,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">[t]he fact that there is a legal remedy is not the criterion. That legal remedy, both in respect to its final relief and its modes of obtaining the relief, must be as effectual as the remedy which equity would confer under the circumstances .... [Powers, 279 Mich at 447.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Because the \u201cfinal relief\u201d granted in divorce\u2014 dissolution of the marital bonds and division of marital property \u2014 is hardly as \u201ceffectual\u201d as contribution in recouping the limited monetary payments at issue, we do not believe that plaintiffs claim must fail because, for whatever reason, Janet did not pursue this action in life.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Divorce would have been a hugely blunderbuss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u201cremedy\u201d in view of what plaintiff here is actually seeking, and could only be viewed as equivalently \u201ceffectual\u201d if a surgical amputation of a toe could be viewed as equivalently \u201ceffectual\u201d to a podiatrist appointment as a remedy for an ingrown toenail.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In addition, we do not think that plaintiffs claim is precluded by the equitable maxim that \u201c \u2018[e]quity will not assist a [person] whose condition is attributable only to that want of diligence which may be fairly expected from a reasonable person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Powers v Indiana &amp; Mich Electric Co, 252 </em>Mich 585, 588; 233 NW 424 (1930) (citation omitted). To find that Janet was somehow derelict in her legal responsibilities because she should have done <em>more </em>would be both inaccurate and more than a little unfair. First, Janet took significant steps in preparation for her death to make clear her intentions that her husband not receive property when she died. She unequivocally disinherited Frank in her will; she transferred her retirement benefits so that they would not pass to him; and she undertook specific efforts to divest him of his interest in the marital real properties before she died. Second, it should be remembered that she undertook these efforts as she was preparing for death, receiving treatment for breast cancer, and preserving and maintaining the two properties at issue by herself. As plaintiffs counsel explained at oral argument: \u201c[Janet] did everything possible, including transferring her ERISA benefits, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>her real property, and her estate property, all three buckets of property, to prevent them from going to her husband at the time \u2014 and unfortunately she passed before she could take that next step whatever that next step might have been for her.\u201d In light of the hard realities in this case, we do not think that Janet was derelict in these circumstances for not doing <em>more </em>in pursuance of her legal responsibilities.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">3. CONTRIBUTION AND TENANCY BY THE ENTIRETY</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Because divorce and separate maintenance are inappropriate, disproportionate, and ineffectual remedies, an equitable remedy is necessary because there is no adequate remedy at law. <em>Powers, </em>279 Mich at 447. Accordingly, defendant should be liable on a contribution theory for the payments Janet made in excess of her \u201caliquot share of the common burden or obligation ....\u201d <em>Caldwell, </em>394 Mich at 417. Although in <em>Strohm </em>this Court recognized the application of contribution between co-tenants in common, the question whether contribution can be applied between co-tenants by the entirety is one of first impression in this state. Established equitable principles guide this Court in determining whether the doctrine of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>contribution should be extended. We are particularly mindful that the Court\u2019s equitable powers are \u201c \u2018to be exercised according to the circumstances and exigencies of each particular case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Youngs, </em>317 Mich at 545 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">On these facts, we conclude that the firmly established doctrine of contribution can be appropriately applied between tenants by the entirety and, therefore, we will permit plaintiffs claim for contribution. Equity allows \u201ccomplete justice\u201d to be done by \u201cadapting] its judgment^] to the special circumstances of the case.\u201d 27A Am Jur 2d, Equity, \u00a7 2, at 520-521 (1996). Our consideration of the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d of this case leads us to conclude that the following facts are legally sufficient to permit a claim for contribution between tenants by the entirety: (a) where the decedent spouse has taken sole responsibility for the property maintenance payments while the other spouse had absolutely no personal contact with her for at least the last 18 months of her life; (b) where the other spouse did not attempt once to communicate with the decedent spouse during this time, even though he acknowledged that he was aware that she was battling cancer; (c) where the other spouse was disinherited in the decedent spouse\u2019s will; (d) where the decedent spouse sought diligently, albeit unsuccessfully, to divest the other spouse of his interest in the real properties before she died; and (e) where the other spouse was deemed a non-surviving spouse under MCL 700.2801(2)(e)(i). These unusual facts cry out for equitable relief so that \u201ccomplete justice\u201d can be done and give us assurance that in granting plaintiffs remedy we are exercising our discretion carefully and responsibly.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Defendant, the Court of Appeals, and Justice Young\u2019s dissent raise several arguments in opposition to our determination that the doctrine of contribution can be applied appropriately in this case. Their arguments, however, do not consider equity\u2019s guiding principles, but rather are grounded on flawed legal analysis and unwarranted policy concerns. First, Justice Young\u2019s dissent claims that the surviving spouse provision bars the relief plaintiff requests because, in its view, plaintiff is asking this Court to extend the provision in contradiction of its express limitations. We fail to see how granting plaintiffs equitable claim would impermissibly \u201cextend\u201d MCL 700.2801, when this Court is neither interpreting this provision nor acting in pursuance of its authority.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rather, our power to grant equitable relief derives, not from this provision, but from this Court\u2019s inherent authority to do equity where no ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>equate remedy at law exists. Indeed, contribution is available to plaintiff <em>precisely because </em>neither the Estates and Protected Individuals Code nor any other statute provides, or precludes, the remedy that plaintiff seeks. Thus, the fact that MCL 700.2801 is silent with respect to contribution can hardly be said to defeat plaintiffs claim. Justice Young\u2019s contrary position, under which this Court may not grant plaintiff relief because the Legislature did not specify this remedy in the surviving spouse provision, ignores a basic tenet of our jurisprudence: courts possess an inherent power to afford equitable remedies. These do not derive from any \u201cdeclaration of substantive law, but from the broad and flexible jurisdiction of courts of equity to afford remedial relief where justice and good conscience so dictate.\u201d 30A CJS, Equity, \u00a7 93, at 289 (1992).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Second, the Court of Appeals below and Justice Young\u2019s dissent distinguish and dismiss as unpersua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>sive decisions from other jurisdictions that permit a claim for contribution between tenants by the entirety, and, thus, lend support to plaintiffs claim in the instant case. See, e.g., <em>Crawford, </em>293 Md 307; <em>Turner, </em>147 Md App 350; <em>Cagan, </em>56 Misc 2d 1045. Each of these out-of-state cases ruled that the ordinary presumption that a spouse\u2019s payments toward real property are considered a gift to the other spouse is inapplicable where the spouses are not living together as husband and wife. <em>Crawford, </em>293 Md at 311; <em>Turner, </em>147 Md App at 407; <em>Cagan, </em>56 Misc 2d at 1049-1050. And therefore, each of these courts recognized that the doctrine of contribution may be applicable between tenants by the entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Justice Young\u2019s dissent distinguishes these cases because, in its view, \u201c[t]he common thread among these cases is that the plaintiffs were able to overcome \u2014 in <em>live divorce proceedings that sought to partition marital property </em>\u2014 the presumption that money expended by one party to the divorce to maintain a concurrent estate was not a gift to his or her spouse.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 89-90 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> While the issues in these out-of-state cases undisputedly arise in the context of di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>vorce and separate maintenance actions, Justice YOUNG\u2019S exclusive focus on this context in his analysis of the central teaching of these cases is questionable. From the actual language of these authorities, it seems that each of these cases stands clearly for the proposition that \u201ca tenant by the entireties is entitled to contribution when he or she makes a payment, <em>after the parties discontinue living together as husband and wife, </em>which preserved the property and, therefore, accrued to the benefit of the co-tenant.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>293 Md at 313 (emphasis added); see also <em>Turner, </em>147 Md App at 406 (explaining that <em>Crawford \u201c </em>\u2018permit\u00eds] a spouse to seek contribution in those instances <em>when married parties were not residing together </em>and one of them, or the other, had paid a disproportionate amount of the carrying costs of property\u2019 \u201d) (emphasis added; citation omitted).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">When viewed as standing for this core proposition, the persuasive authority from sister states and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>instant case have much in common. Janet and Frank Mandeville had \u201cdiscontinue[dj living together as husband and wife.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>293 Md at 312. There was no \u201cshowing of an intention to make a gift\u201d on Janet\u2019s part; in fact, the record is replete with evidence to the contrary. <em>Id. </em>at 313. And, Janet made payments that \u201cpreserve[d] the property, and therefore, accrue[d] to the benefit of the co-tenant [Frank].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under this analysis, Janet is entitled to contribution. <em>Id.; </em>see also <em>Turner, </em>147 Md App at 407. While it is certainly possible to distinguish these cases, as the Court of Appeals and Justice YOUNG have worked hard to do, it is nonetheless difficult to dismiss them because their logic and reasoning closely resemble those of this case. These cases provide persuasive authority on which this Court may rely as it exercises its equitable jurisdiction \u201cto afford remedial relief, where justice and good conscience so dictate.\u201d 30A CJS, Equity, \u00a7 93, at 289 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Third, the dissent warns that granting plaintiff\u2019s requested relief constitutes a \u201csweeping modification of the common law,\u201d <em>post </em>at 68, \u201crepresents a sea-change in our laws governing property,\u201d <em>post </em>at 93, and is the equivalent of recognizing \u201can action amounting to posthumous divorce.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 97. These concerns are considerably overwrought, and incorrect, largely because they are grounded in a misapprehension that the remedy plaintiff seeks will somehow result in the division of marital real property. However, as has been explained already, contrary to the Court of Appeals\u2019 and Justice Young\u2019s assertions, there is nothing in the relief sought that would in any way \u201csubvert the protective purpose of the tenancy by the entirety . . . .\u201d <em>Tkachik, </em>282 Mich App at 376. In this case, as in every future case, the \u201cprotective purpose of the tenancy by the entirety\u201d\u2014 i.e. the unencumbered right of survivorship\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>will be given full effect, and the surviving spouse would own entirety properties in fee simple absolute.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Moreover, granting plaintiff the monetary compensation she is seeking would not require a \u201cposthumous divorce.\u201d Indeed, this whole concept of \u201cposthumous divorce\u201d is inapposite, and in fact seems quite peculiar,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> because granting plaintiffs claim for contribution would not require this Court, or any future court, to do anything even remotely akin to rendering a judgment for divorce. Plaintiff is not asking this Court to take off anyone\u2019s wedding ring, decide who gets the family heirlooms, or become involved in any of the hard issues that arise in a divorce, such as child custody, parenting time, and child and spousal support. And, as we have repeatedly made clear in this opinion, granting the relief plaintiff seeks will not divide marital real property. Instead, it will simply require a court to look to the evidence of how much Janet paid in mortgage payments, taxes, insurance, and other costs to maintain the real properties and then award an appropriate amount in the form of contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Justice Young\u2019s final, and most overwrought, argument is that our decision somehow \u201cignores the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>marriage has always been recognized in Michigan as a <em>special </em>relationship\u201d and \u201ctransforms this... into no more than a mere \u2018business partnership.\u2019 \u201d <em>Post </em>at 81. Thus, our decision is \u201cyet another (however well intentioned) assault on the institution of marriage in our country.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 81. We respectfully suggest that these arguments would be more aptly directed inwardly. It is Justice YOUNG\u2019s dissent that wishes to focus exclusively on the way that property is titled, as if the Mandevilles were mere business partners whose relationships and mutual obligations did not extend beyond their real property transactions, in other words, that a tenancy by the entirety is nothing more than a real property arrangement that is more <em>extra-strongly </em>binding upon persons who are married than upon <em>all </em>other persons. It is Justice YOUNG\u2019s dissent that ignores all evidence concerning the realities of a particular marriage, and that would \u2014 exclusively in the case of married persons \u2014 subordinate all such realities to the deed itself. Thus, <em>alone </em>among parties to a deed, the realities of the parties\u2019 actual conduct and relationship, and the demands of fairness and equity, would be irrelevant for married parties. Under the rule the dissents would adopt, marriage would indeed define a \u201cspecial relationship,\u201d but not in a way that <em>honors </em>or <em>respects </em>marriage, but in a way that <em>disadvantages </em>marriage. Married parties <em>alone </em>would be deprived of resort to equity, no matter how compelling the circumstances, and <em>alone </em>would be bound by a legal document, no matter how unfair and inequitable its consequences in a particular circumstance. Marriage indeed entails a \u201cspecial relationship,\u201d because it involves persons who have vowed to be with their spouse for better or worse, in sickness and in health, and because it gives rise to life-long commitments of a singular nature, not because it comprises a legal arrangement in which persons are forever to be deprived of fundamental principles of equity that apply to all other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>persons. See <em>Strohm, </em>352 Mich at 662. To say the least, we do not believe it is <em>this </em>opinion that degrades the <em>genuinely </em>\u201cspecial relationship\u201d of a marriage, or that treats marriage as tantamount to a mere \u201cbusiness partnership.\u201d The dissents accord \u201cspecial\u201d treatment to marriage only in the sense of imposing \u201cspecial\u201d disadvantages upon married persons, and by \u201cspecially\u201d depriving such persons of a remedy in equity available to all others.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In sum, the counterarguments presented by defendant, the Court of Appeals, and the dissents are unavailing. No governing legal principle precludes the remedy plaintiff seeks, and no policy concern persuades us that granting this remedy will somehow upset the common law of this state, or produce what Justice Young\u2019s dissent describes as a \u201c \u2018tectonic shift\u2019 \u201d in our common-law jurisprudence. <em>Post </em>at 68 n 1. Rather, the decision here is altogether consonant with the \u201cincremental process of common-law adjudication as a response to the facts presented.\u201d <em>In re Arbitration Between Allstate Ins Co &amp; Stolarz, </em>81 NY2d 219, 226; 597 NYS2d 904; 613 NE2d 936 (1993). Therefore, we decide this case by exercising our equitable powers \u201c \u2018according to the circumstances and exigencies of [this] particular case\u2019 \u201d where no adequate remedy at law exists. <em>Youngs, </em>317 Mich at 545 (citation omitted). Significantly, the circumstances and exigencies of this particular case contain a limiting principle that provides further assurance that we have properly exercised our discretion in granting equitable relief. Such limiting principle is inherent in MCL 700.2801, which sets forth the circumstances in which a spouse is not a \u201csurviving spouse,\u201d namely, where that spouse has been willfully absent from the decedent spouse for a year or more before the decedent\u2019s passing. As explained, this provision is not the <em>source </em>of this Court\u2019s power to grant plaintiff relief, for we possess an inherent power to afford equitable relief in our sound discretion and under carefully defined cireum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>stances; rather, it merely provides context for when a spouse\u2019s conduct is so offensive to any \u201cnatural sense of justice\u201d that a court may properly act.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> With this limiting principle in place, any fear that permitting a claim for contribution in the context of a tenancy by the entirety will result in a radical sea-change in the common law of this state rings hollow.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">On the facts of this case, and particularly in considering defendant\u2019s willful absence from his decedent spouse, by which she alone took responsibility for the properties in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>the last year and a half of her life, it would be unjust for defendant to retain the benefit of the monies that preserved these properties and made his eventual sole ownership possible upon her death. Because divorce is an inappropriate, disproportionate, and ineffectual remedy, an equitable remedy is necessary because there is no adequate remedy at law. <em>Powers, </em>279 Mich at 447. Accordingly, by extending the doctrine of contribution to co-tenants by the entirety, defendant is properly held hable for the payments that his spouse made in excess of her \u201caliquot share of the common burden or obligation ....\u201d <em>Caldwell, </em>394 Mich at 417. Thus, consistent with the longstanding and important principle of our jurisprudence concerning the availability of equitable relief, we conclude that the doctrine of contribution can be appropriately applied between tenants by the entirety and that plaintiffs claim for contribution should be granted. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand to the probate court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b107-5\">Kelly, C.J., and Cavanagh and Corrigan, JJ., concurred with MARKMAN, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b82-6\"> MCL 700.2801(2) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">For purposes of parts 1 to 4 of this article and of section 3203, a surviving spouse does not include any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">(e) An individual who did any of the following for 1 year or more before the death of the deceased person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\"><em>(i) </em>Was willfully absent from the decedent spouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Parts 1 through 4 of Article II of the Estates and Protected Individuals Code (EPIC), MCL 700.2101 <em>et seq., </em>relate to: (1) intestate succession, (2) spousal elections, (3) spouses or children not provided for in the will, and (4) exempt property and allowances.

Thus, although Janet attempted diligently before her death to defeat the right of survivorship by transferring her interest in the properties by quitclaim deed, this deed was ineffectual in nullifying defendant\u2019s rights in the properties. While Janet\u2019s efforts have no legal significance in regards to defendant\u2019s ownership of the properties, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>do </em>evidence her clear intentions regarding whether she wanted defendant to benefit from her preservation of the properties, for which she alone took responsibility in his absence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b91-9\"> Justice Young\u2019s dissent states that \u201c[t]his is true only to a certain extent.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 81. In light of the reality that defendant owns the properties in fee simple absolute, I fail to see how this is anything but <em>completely </em>true. His dissent itself acknowledges that this decision \u201cdoes not alter the actual ownership of the property,\u201d but then argues that this analysis \u201cforce[s] defendant to compensate the estate for the privilege of such ownership \u2014 notwithstanding the fact that <em>both </em>the law <em>and </em>the express means by which the Mandevilles themselves titled their property provide this property to Frank Mandeville with <em>no conditions whatsoever.\u201d Post </em>at 81 (emphasis in original). No one disputes that under the law of tenancy by the entirety, and specifically by right of survivorship, defendant took the properties without any conditions or obligations at law. The open question presented in this case, however, is whether defendant in the instant circumstances is obligated now by <em>equity </em>to contribute his share of the property maintenance payments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b91-10\"> The analysis and conclusion are the same when the question of whether defendant is unjustly enriched is viewed through a contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>lens. See <em>Mich Med Serv v Sharpe, </em>339 Mich 574, 577; 64 NW2d 713 (1954) (\u201cEnrichment of [a person or entity] is not unjust if pursuant to the express agreement of the parties, fairly and honestly arrived at before hand.\u201d). The fact that the properties passed to Frank in accordance with the agreement the Mandevilles made when taking title as tenants by the entirety does not preclude a finding that he was unjustly enriched because, once again, plaintiff is not seeking to affect that contract. Permitting a contribution claim to prevent unjust enrichment will not interfere with the parties\u2019 freedom to contract. Janet and Frank contracted to hold the properties by the entirety with a right of survivorship; when defendant is required to pay contribution to plaintiff, this contract will, notwithstanding, already have been given full effect: the properties passed to defendant by right of survivorship, at which point, as now, he held title in fee simple absolute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b93-6\"> By bringing an action for separate maintenance, a spouse is exposed to a counterclaim and judgment for divorce. See MCL 552.7(2) through (4). Notably, if a counterclaim for divorce is filed, such judgment is mandatory. MCL 552.7(4)(b) (providing that \u201cthe court <em>shall </em>enter ... [a] judgment dissolving the bonds of matrimony if a counterclaim for divorce has been filed\u201d) (emphasis added). Thus, if divorce is an inappropriate remedy because of a person\u2019s religious or moral beliefs, separate maintenance is also. Although Justice Young\u2019s dissent does not dispute our understanding of the procedural workings of an action for separate maintenance set forth in the statute, it charges that we do not adequately explain why separate maintenance constitutes an inadequate legal remedy. <em>Post </em>at 82. We offer exactly such an explanation in this section. It is <em>that dissent </em>that owes an explanation of its contrary position to people who have religious or moral objections to divorce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b93-7\"> Moreover, one wonders how an action for separate maintenance at this juncture could be said to be as \u201ceffectual\u201d in \u201cits modes of obtaining... relief,\u201d <em>Powers, </em>279 Mich at 447, where, for obvious reasons, neither Janet nor her estate can bring such an action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b94-9\"> The same can be said of a claim for separate maintenance. Justice Young\u2019s dissent argues at length that separate maintenance constituted Janet\u2019s sole remedy in these circumstances. Specifically, it claims this must be true because that \u201cthe <em>standard </em>that the majority employs \u2014 a breakdown in the marital relationship sufficient to show that the couple is no longer acting as husband and wife \u2014 is <em>precisely </em>the standard used in an action for divorce or separate maintenance proceedings.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 83 (emphasis in original). His dissent misapprehends the standard we employ. While the facts of this case certainly evidence a breakdown of the marital relationship, satisfying this standard alone is not what moves us to act in equity. Rather, our decision is based on a fact-specific analysis that takes into account the manner in which <em>this </em>marital relationship broke down, and particularly considers the conduct of defendant as evidence of the nature and extent of the breakdown. Simply put, marriages may break down in a variety of ways that would be sufficient to satisfy the general standard used in an action for separate mainte<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>nance or divorce. However, it is defendant\u2019s <em>inequitable </em>conduct, evidencing the nature of the specific breakdown of <em>this </em>marriage, that satisfies the equitable standard. Thus, contrary to Justice Young\u2019s dissent, the two standards \u2014 whether a marriage has broken down sufficiently to grant a judgment for divorce or separate maintenance and whether equity can be invoked to allow contribution between spouses \u2014 are distinct. Moreover, regardless of the differences between these standards, separate maintenance is an inadequate remedy in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\"> In light of these facts, we are confident that allowing equity to come to Janet\u2019s aid, even when she did not seek a divorce or bring an action for separate maintenance while alive, will not upset any legitimate financial arrangement between the Mandevilles. This record leaves little need to speculate about how Janet felt about the \u201carrangement\u201d by which she took sole responsibility for maintaining the properties at the end of her life after being abandoned by her husband. Again, she unequivocally disinherited him in her will, transferred her retirement benefits, and attempted to divest him of his interest in the marital real properties. Furthermore, plaintiff \u2014 Janet\u2019s sister, the person who cared for her in her final months and who is the personal representative of her estate' \u2014 is bringing this action on Janet\u2019s behalf. These facts dispel any fear that, by permitting plaintiffs claim for contribution, we are upsetting any arrangement in contravention of Janet\u2019s intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b97-6\"> As this list of factors makes clear, contrary to Justice Young\u2019s assertion, our determination that contribution is appropriately applied in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>this case is based on much more than an \u201c \u2018I know it when I see it\u2019 \u201d intuition. <em>Post </em>at 95. Rather, it is based on a consideration of the highly unusual and inequitable circumstances of this case. Justice Young\u2019s dissent itself acknowledges that the facts of this case are \u201crare,\u201d <em>post </em>at 95, but fails to realize that these \u201crare\u201d facts are precisely what make it appropriate for this Court to do equity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b98-5\"> Once more, Justice Young\u2019s dissent fails to recognize that we are <em>not </em>construing MCL 700.2801 or any other statutory provision in this case. The issue here only requires this Court to determine whether to exercise its equitable powers where no statute provides for or precludes such an exercise. It does not require us to give effect to any statute. For this reason, granting (or failing to grant) equitable relief cannot possibly contravene \u201cthe most basic of judicial interpretative rules.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 86 n 45. It is important to remember, however, that although <em>this </em>Court is not called upon to interpret MCL 700.2801, this provision has already been given full and proper effect by the lower court, a result that is unaltered by this decision. The probate court properly recognized the provision\u2019s limited applicability to the identified sections of EPIC, which relate to intestate succession. It thus held that defendant\u2019s status under MCL 700.2801 is immaterial to his sole ownership of the marital real properties, which passed to him by the right of survivorship, not by intestate succession. In light of this disposition, the statutory argument in Justice Young\u2019s dissent is errant from the start.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b99-7\"> For much the same reason, Justice Young\u2019s observation that \u201cthe Michigan Legislature has <em>declined </em>to adopt legislation that would have accomplished statutorily exactly the changes plaintiff seeks in the common law here\u201d has no bearing on the proper result in this case. <em>Post </em>at 99 (emphasis in original). By inserting this observation into its discussion, Justice Young\u2019s dissent misses the critical difference between the respective duties of a legislative body and a court sitting in equiiy. While the Legislature crafts policy for the general public, a court in equity examines \u201cthe circumstances and exigencies of [the] particular case.\u201d <em>Youngs, </em>317 Mich at 545 (citation omitted). Thus, simply because, for whatever reason, the Legislature did not adopt a broad, statewide statutory remedy \u2014 and Justice Young has no greater insight into why this transpired than anyone else\u2014 does not mean that such a remedy is not appropriate to achieve equity in the particular circumstances of a case. Concerning Justice Young\u2019s allegation that we have \u201cfashion[ed] an unprecedented judge-created rule,\u2019\u2019post at 100, we can only point out, first, that the <em>entirety </em>of the common law constitutes the \u201cfashion[ing of] a judge-created rule,\u201d the dissents\u2019 preferred rule no more and no less than the majority\u2019s; and, second, that, as a case of genuinely first impression, it is quite certain that, whatever rule prevails, it will be one without \u201cprecedent,\u201d because this is precisely how the common law has always evolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b100-6\"> The Court of Appeals rejected the analysis of these cases because it determined that it was \u201cnot applicable in the context of considering whether a decedent\u2019s estate is entitled to contribution from the surviving spouse ....\u201d <em>Tkachik, </em>282 Mich App at 376. In focusing on the fact that Janet is deceased, the Court of Appeals implied that, <em>if </em>she had been living, she might have been entitled to contribution, while her estate would not be. This implication is inconsistent with MCL 600.2921, which states, \u201cAll actions and claims survive death.\u201d If, under the Court of Appeals\u2019 rationale, Janet could have sought contribution from defendant while alive, there is no reason why her estate itself should not also be able to seek contribution. See <em>In re Olney\u2019s Estate, </em>309 Mich 65, 83; 14 NW2d 574 (1944) (\u201cWhen the law declares that a cause of action shall survive, it is equivalent to saying an executor may sue upon it.\u201d) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\"> Justice Young\u2019s dissent claims that these cases only support our position \u201cwhen read out of context and after ignoring [these] decisions\u2019 own internal limitations.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 87. In response, one can merely invite the readers to peruse these cases for themselves and judge which of our readings is the more sound. In our judgment, each of these cases stand clearly for the proposition that a tenant by the entirety may be entitled to contribution when he or she makes some payment after the spouses discontinue living together as husband and wife. <em>Crawford, Turner, </em>and <em>Cagan </em>stand for this same proposition. Thus, Justice Young\u2019s dissent does not present the whole story when it asserts that this decision \u201crenders Michigan the one place in the common law world where a tenant by the entirety can now be liable for contribution to his deceased spouse\u2019s estate.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 68. <em>No state </em>whose courts have addressed this specific proposition has rejected it. That is, his dissent insists on focusing on the <em>general </em>rule of non-contribution between tenants by the entirety \u2014 a rule with which we agree \u2014 rather than the <em>exception </em>to the rule that is the subject of this case, as well as <em>Crawford, Turner, </em>and <em>Cagan. </em>The reader can determine what is most \u201cdisingenuous\u201d in this case, <em>post </em>at 91 n 58 \u2014 for the dissent to include within its supposed consensus states whose judiciaries have never before addressed the <em>specific </em>issue before this Court, or for this majority to point out the artificiality of that consensus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\"> Accordingly, we are not persuaded by Justice Young\u2019s overwrought accusation that this decision \u201cupsets the reliance interests of all Michigan spouses\u201d who have taken title to property as tenants by the entirety. <em>Post </em>at 94. Not only is this inaccurate because the right of survivorship is not affected by this decision, but it imputes ludicrous motives to Michigan spouses. We believe that there are few men and women in Michigan who get married, and who acquire property as tenants by the entirety, in <em>reliance </em>on the fact that they can later abandon their spouses and their marital property, contribute nothing to the maintenance of such property, succeed to the property upon their spouse\u2019s death, and have no further responsibilities at law or in equity. <em>That </em>is the only reliance interest that could conceivably be upset by this decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b103-8\"> No more peculiar, however, than Justice Young\u2019s notion that we are \u201cmentally divorcing\u201d the Mandevilles. <em>Post </em>at 97 n 65.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b106-8\"> Justice Young\u2019s dissent is highly critical of our consideration of the surviving-spouse provision, but its own analysis of the role of MCL 700.2801 is simply inaccurate. His dissent treats this provision as controlling, asserting that it precludes this Court from doing equity because \u201cthe Legislature actually <em>has acted </em>in this area through its enactment of Michigan\u2019s surviving spouse statute.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 99 (emphasis in original). In view of this assertion, we reiterate that the surviving spouse provision is <em>silent </em>as to contribution and, thus, neither permits nor precludes this Court from granting this remedy. The provision is, however, <em>relevant </em>in this case because it is descriptive of the exact behavior that moves this Court here to act in equity \u2014 defendant willfully abandoning his wife during the last 18 months of her life. We know of no principle of statutory construction that bars a court in equity from taking into consideration conduct that is relevant to the equitable claim simply because the Legislature, in an entirely different context, has determined that such conduct is sanctionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Accordingly, Justice Young need not wonder, \u201cWhere, other than in the guts of the majority, shall we determine how \u2018principles of natural justice\u2019 or \u2018good conscience\u2019 should direct our decisions?\u201d <em>Post </em>at 96 n 64. If and when a court again encounters these rare facts, its determination of whether a tenant by the entirety is entitled to equitable contribution is to be informed by a time-honored and uncontroversial belief about marriage \u2014 i.e., one spouse should not benefit from the abandonment of the other in a time of great need. This belief is reflected in community norms, the teachings of religious traditions, <em>and </em>the non-surviving spouse provision, and, thus, future courts need not concern themselves with our \u201cguts,\u201d but can direct their decisions to these reliable guides.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b107-6\">WEAVER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9I\">(dissenting).

Because of the danger of unintended consequences and the difficulty that a court has in assessing them when amending the common law, the Hippocratic admonition to \u201cfirst do no harm\u201d is a wise prescription for restraint. It is an admonition that the majority today unfortunately ignores. Because the tenets of property law at issue here are among the most settled and uncontroversial in all of our jurisprudence, I vigorously dissent from the majority\u2019s sweeping modification of the common law in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Under the banner of equity, the majority today creates a rule that renders Michigan the one place in the common law world where a tenant by the entirety can now be liable for contribution to his deceased spouse\u2019s estate. This distinction is a dubious honor. For hundreds of years, the tenancy by the entirety with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>concomitant right of survivorship has existed as a means of protecting and fostering marriage, allowing a husband and wife to manage their property and assign financial equities as they saw fit, free from interference by third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">With its decision today, the majority now permits posthumous collateral attacks on the validity of marriages in this state where neither spouse has taken the appropriate legal steps to challenge the marriage or the financial equities of the marriage during life. In doing so, the majority ignores the perfectly adequate legal remedies that our Legislature created in specific contemplation of marital disharmony \u2014 specifically, an action for separate maintenance \u2014 instead preferring to craft a new remedy recognized nowhere else in the country. This rule allowing contribution between tenants by the entirety <em>outside the context of a divorce or separate maintenance action </em>is not supported by a single case or authority from <em>any </em>jurisdiction, let alone authority from Michigan. As such, the new rule the majority creates today is untested and holds unforeseen consequences that reach much further than the narrow and unassuming decision the majority <em>believes </em>it has issued in this case. Moreover, although in today\u2019s decision the husband is required to make a contribution on marital property held by the entirety, given the fact that men still generally contribute more to family assets than women, I fear that the majority\u2019s new rule may have a disproportionate adverse effect on women in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Until today, Michigan law did not recognize the right of contribution between tenants by the entirety outside the context of the divorce or separation actions, and accordingly, I believe that Janet Mandeville\u2019s estate does not have a cognizable claim for contribution to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>pursue against Frank Mandeville, the defendant. Simply put, under Michigan\u2019s settled law, a tenant by the entirety is not <em>unjustly </em>enriched when he takes sole ownership by operation of law over property that he previously owned with his spouse. The tenancy by the entirety is a unique incident of marriage. How married people choose to arrange their finances is varied and entirely a product of their determination. After a spouse\u2019s death, it is difficult for a court to assess any alleged inequity in the contributions of the respective spouses that they failed to address during the marriage itself. Indeed, there is a great danger in authorizing post hoc judicial inquiries concerning how a husband and wife choose to structure their marriage, as the majority authorizes in this case. Rights created by a tenancy by the entirety, being anchored in marriage, are not affected where one spouse makes greater contributions to acquiring or maintaining the property, and thus no inequities arise that would compel restitution by a surviving spouse. Where spouses do not avail themselves of the legal means of disaggregating their interests in property owned by the entirety, the courts should not be authorized to do so after one spouse dies.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">I. PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND EQUITY</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Because I believe that the majority\u2019s opinion is contrary to and undermines settled principles of law and equity, I begin my analysis with an examination of the legal principles underlying this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">A. THE LAW OF TENANCY BY THE ENTIRETY</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Michigan\u2019s law of estates and its rules governing concurrent estates is derived from the English common law, although much of this law has now been codified by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Generally, there are three types of concurrent estates: the tenancy in common, the joint tenancy, and the tenancy by the entirety.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties do not dispute that the facts of the instant case and the issues they raise implicate only this last type of estate: the tenancy by the entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">A tenancy by the entirety is a type of concurrent ownership in real property unique to married persons.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>A tenancy by the entirety represents a legal policy arising from the English common law whereby a husband and wife each have a sole tenancy in the real property acquired during the course of the marriage. Like many of our laws, the unique nature of this estate has a unique presumption: at common law, a husband and wife were recognized as but one legal person, and thus their ownership of real property reflected this unique status.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A conveyance to a husband and wife that shares the unities required for joint possession<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> presumptively creates a tenancy by the entirely unless the conveyance otherwise explicitly indicates that the parties intend to create a separate type of estate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consistent with the historical practice, under Michigan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>law one tenant by the entirety holds no legal interest in the realty separable from that of the other tenant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because of this legal presumption, neither spouse can act unilaterally to convey or alienate any portion of an interest in the property.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As this Court has stated: \u201cWhen the husband and wife have thus together acquired an unencumbered title to real estate[,] they have laid up treasures, where, without their concerted action, neither moth, nor rust, nor thieves, nor creditors, nor anything else but death or the tax gatherer can divest them.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In sum, each spousal tenant is vested with the entire title, and thus each tenant paradoxically holds complete, <em>sole </em>ownership <em>jointly </em>with the other tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The most important feature of a tenancy by the entirety is the <em>right of </em>survivorship. This right provides that in the event that one spouse dies during the course of the marriage, the surviving spouse <em>automatically </em>takes fee simple ownership in the entire property.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, this type of property is <em>not </em>a part of the decedent\u2019s estate, and the laws of descent and distribution do not apply.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>A tenancy by the entirety can only be terminated in limited, specific ways. The death of one of the tenants, a joint conveyance of the property, a creditor\u2019s action against both cotenants, or a dissolution of the tenants\u2019 marriage all operate to terminate a tenancy by the entirety. As stated, the death of one of the tenants automatically passes sole title to the remaining tenant through the right of survivorship. A conveyance executed by both tenants transfers title and ownership to new grantees of the property under whatever form of estate the grantees choose. Consistent with the concept that both cotenants must act to encumber a tenancy by the entirety, a creditor\u2019s action against both a husband and wife who have together encumbered their property may terminate the tenancy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Finally, in divorce proceedings after a marriage has been terminated, property held as a tenancy by the entirety becomes a tenancy in common unless the parties or the court terminating the marriage provides otherwise.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> During this time, as is consistent with divorce proceedings generally, the court equitably divides all marital property, including real property that had been held as a tenancy by the entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">B. THE RIGHT OF CONTRIBUTION AND CLAIMS FOR UNJUST ENRICHMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The doctrine of equitable contribution has evolved from the common law and is \u201cfounded on principles of equity and natural justice.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It provides that one who pays or satisfies \u201cthe whole or [bears] more than his aliquot share of the common burden or obligation, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>which several persons are equally liable or which they are bound to discharge, is entitled to contribution against the others to obtain from them payment of their respective shares.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, where contribution is appropriate to reach an equitable result, the party seeking contribution may recover the proportionate share from each of the joint obligors.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Regarding concurrent estates, claims for contribution are generally available to cotenants who hold real property as tenants in common or joint tenants.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As this Court held in <em>Strohm v Koepke, </em>which acknowledged the right of equitable contribution for tenants in common, \u201c[t]he doctrine of contribution between cotenants is based upon purely equitable considerations.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> However, neither Michigan\u2019s statutory law nor any decision by this Court or any Michigan court has ever specifically recognized the right of contribution for a husband and wife who hold their property as a tenancy by the entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Even though a tenancy by the entirety resembles a joint tenancy, a tenancy by the entirety is <em>not </em>a joint tenancy; rather, it is a type of sole tenancy.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Our law has recognized important distinctions among these co-tenancies, providing rights and responsibilities to some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>but not others. For example, joint tenants and tenants in common have a statutory right of partition; tenants by the entirety do not.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Also, joint tenants and tenants in common may unilaterally convey their property rights for any reason; tenants by the entirety may not.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> These distinctions and others represent a type of severability among other concurrent estates not permitted in a tenancy by the entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">This understanding is in accord with the historical tradition of the tenancy by the entirety, because it has been inextricably tied to marriage.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> At common law, where the law viewed a married couple as a single legal person, there was no legal need to allow recovery or contribution by one tenant essentially against himself. By contrast, other types of cotenancies among nonmarried persons \u2014 whether they are two or more relatives, Mends, business partners, or any other combination of individuals who may jointly buy real property \u2014 do not share the bond of marriage, and thus the law allowed mechanisms for recovery if one party was forced to assume more than his fair share of the costs or if there was a breakdown in the relationship. Moreover, a tenancy by the entirety already contained a mechanism for the contingency that a marriage relationship may break down: separation or divorce expressly allowed the courts to divide equitably property owned by the tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>However, the lack of a specific provision or doctrine of law providing a right of contribution in a tenancy by the entirety does not necessarily preclude a right of contribution. In the instant case, plaintiff advances the theory that Frank Mandeville is liable for contribution to the decedent\u2019s estate on the basis of a theory of unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Unjust enrichment is defined as the unjust retention of \u201c \u2018money or benefits which in justice and equity <em>belong to </em>another.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Restatement provides that \u201c[e]ven where a person has received a benefit from another, he is liable to pay therefor only if the circumstances of its receipt or retention are such that, as between the two persons, it is unjust for him to retain it \u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This Court adopted a similar standard in <em>Buell v Orion State Bank: </em>\u201cOne is not unjustly enriched ... by retaining benefits involuntarily acquired which law and equity give him absolutely without any obligation on his part to make restitution.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus, there can be no unjust enrichment where a party only receives or retains that which he already owns by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">II. application</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">With these principles regarding Michigan\u2019s law of real property and equity in mind, I turn to the facts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>this particular case. Plaintiff asks this Court to order contribution from Frank Mandeville to his deceased wife\u2019s estate under two alternative theories: either by a claim of unjust enrichment, or by extending Michigan property law to allow for a claim of contribution in a tenancy by the entirety. The majority has accepted this request, arguing that if there is no mechanism by which the estate can recover defendant\u2019s proportionate share for money the decedent expended to maintain the tenancy\u2019s properties, then defendant will be unjustly enriched by his wife\u2019s maintenance of the properties before her death. Contrarily, defendant argues that contribution designed to prevent unjust enrichment does not apply where a cotenant by the entirety receives property by the right of survivorship. For the reasons set forth below, I agree with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">A. NEITHER MICHIGAN LAW NOR PRINCIPLES OF EQUITY SUPPORT THE MAJORITY\u2019S RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In light of the legal doctrines discussed above, defendant here is not unjustly enriched when he takes full ownership by a right of survivorship to property held as a tenant by the entirety. And this is true even if one cotenant has contributed more to the expenses of property ownership within the marriage, which is consistent with how the cotenants designed their marriage. There simply is no obligation in Michigan for a cotenant by the entirety to pay interest and expenses to the estate of the deceased cotenant when fee simple title passes by operation of law. The surviving cotenant, receiving title by right of survivorship as the parties agreed when titling the property, cannot be <em>unjustly </em>enriched. Instead, the cotenant by the entireties takes fee ownership to property in which he already had prior <em>sole, inalienable </em>ownership with his spouse. As this Court stated in <em>Buell, </em>there can be no unjust enrichment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>where a person comes into ownership of property that \u201c <em>\u2018law and equity give him absolutely </em>-without any obligation on his part to make restitution.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Here, by operation of law, Frank Mandeville automatically takes the properties in fee simple absolute by the right of survivorship inherent in the tenancy by the entirety, which was exactly the Mandevilles\u2019 intent when they purchased the properties more than 20 years ago.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Neither plaintiff nor the majority can persuasively argue that, in taking full ownership to property he already owns, Frank Mandeville will retain \u201cmoney or benefits\u201d that belong to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The majority holds otherwise. Through an elaborate formulation, the majority attempts to rebalance the equities of the Mandevilles\u2019 marriage in order to show that Frank Mandeville was unjustly enriched because his wife paid certain costs associated with home ownership for an 18-month period. In the process, the majority has created a rule that subverts the purpose of the tenancy by the entirety and unnecessarily allows the state to dissect the marital relationship for the purpose of reassigning equities contrary to how the parties saw fit to title their property and conduct their marital relationship. More disturbing, the majority does so notwithstanding the fact that neither Janet nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Frank Mandeville took any legal action <em>while both spouses remained alive </em>that would have extinguished the tenancy by the entirety that governed the properties at issue here or rebalanced the equities of their marriage. Indeed, despite Frank Mandeville\u2019s extended absence, the couple did not consider their marriage over,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> they never sought a divorce or legal separation, nor did Janet Mandeville file an action for separate maintenance.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>The majority\u2019s opinion ignores the fact that marriage has always been recognized in Michigan as a <em>special </em>relationship unlike those involved in other concurrent ownership relationships. Thus, it is worthy of unique protections that can only be altered upon formal dissolution in a divorce or modification in a separate maintenance action. The majority\u2019s decision transforms this special marital relationship into no more than a mere \u201cbusiness partnership.\u201d Married couples have the additional options of buying property as tenants in common or joint tenants. <em>A married couple that enters into a tenancy by the entirety does so in specific reliance on the unique protections that our common law affords this form of joint property ownership. </em>Today\u2019s decision eviscerates such reliance interests but fails to explain why these interests are no longer worthy of protection. The majority\u2019s decision is yet another (however well intentioned) assault on the institution of marriage in our country.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The majority states that nothing in its analysis would alter the reality that Frank Mandeville is the fee simple owner of the properties previously held with his wife, and that the law of the tenancy by the entirety \u201chas already been given full effect... ,\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> This is true only to a certain extent.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The majority does not alter the actual ownership of the properly, but it does force defendant to compensate the estate for the privilege of such ownership \u2014 notwithstanding the fact that <em>both </em>the law <em>and </em>the express means by which the Mandevilles themselves titled their property provide this property to Frank Mandeville with <em>no conditions whatsoever. </em>Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>the majority cannot deny that it is today recognizing a new right of contribution that <em>diminishes </em>the property rights of a surviving tenant by the entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Moreover, contrary to the majority\u2019s argument, this is <em>not </em>an appropriate case in which to employ this Court\u2019s equitable powers. Equity is customarily employed only where there is <em>no adequate remedy at law.</em><footnotemark><em>33</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Here, Janet Mandeville had several available remedies that she declined to pursue. These remedies include filing for divorce or separate maintenance.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> An action for separate maintenance, for example, would not require the couple to seek a divorce; instead, a showing that the marriage relationship had broken <em>down </em>\u2014 precisely <em>what plaintiff argues happened in this case </em>\u2014 would allow the trial court to make a determination based on all the circumstances as to how much financial support would be due to a complainant.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> It could do so on the basis of the evidence offered by <em>both </em>spouses \u2014 something that cannot be done after one of the spouses has died.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The fact is that a claim for separate maintenance seems to be <em>precisely </em>the remedy contemplated by our Legislature to provide relief to an aggrieved spouse in this type of situation. Yet, the majority cannot adequately explain why the already existing action for separate maintenance is an inadequate legal remedy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Instead, the majority prefers to create an action for contribution that allows an estate to collaterally attack financial arrangements made during the course of a valid marriage. The majority states that an action for divorce or separate maintenance is \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cdisproportionate,\u201d and thus apparently \u201cinadequate.\u201d This is ironic given that the <em>standard </em>that the majority employs \u2014 a breakdown in the marital relationship sufficient to show that the couple is no longer acting as husband and wife \u2014 is <em>precisely </em>the standard used in an action for divorce or separate maintenance proceedings. <em>I fail to see how the majority can reject this standard as inadequate as a matter of law while at the same time using it as an equitable substitute for these supposedly inadequate legal remedies. </em>Although the majority argues that these remedies are not \u201cas \u2018effectual\u2019 \u201d as a claim for contribution, that hardly demonstrates that they are inadequate as a matter of law.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Although the majority focuses on claims for divorce as \u201ca hugely blunderbuss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>\u2018remedy,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> it simply has <em>no answer </em>for why an action for <em>separate maintenance </em>is inadequate. This flaw in the majority\u2019s argument not only belies its conclusion that equity should be employed in this case,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> but also undermines the entire rationale of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">While it would certainly be troubling for courts to attempt to recalibrate the equities of a marriage after death, the majority\u2019s decision is even more troubling because it does just that when the parties declined to take available legal action in life. A longstanding principle of this Court precludes equitable relief to parties who do not fully pursue the remedies available to them at law.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Just as Michigan courts are incompetent to grant a divorce after the death of one of the parties,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>unlike the majority, I believe that courts are equally incompetent to reassign equities, divide property, or award monetary contribution concerning marital property owned by the spouses after the death of one <em>as if a </em>divorce had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The majority also argues that the Legislature\u2019s enactment of the surviving spouse provision of the Estates and Protected Individuals Code<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> indicates its intent to recognize that a marital relationship can cease to exist even if it is not officially or legally severed. This argument is simply a nonstarter. The surviving spouse provision states that, if certain conditions are met showing a breakdown in a marriage, then a surviving spouse will not be treated as having survived the decedent.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> However, the provision also <em>specifically restricts </em>its applicability to issues of intestate succession, spousal elections and allowances, and priority among persons seeking appointment as personal representatives.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Thus, the Legislature expressly limited the surviving spouse provision to specific circumstances involving a deceased spouse, none of which is present here. Pursuant to well established principles of statutory construction,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> this Court <em>should decline </em>plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>request to extend the application of this statute where the Legislature has expressly limited it.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Today, however, the majority manufactures an extension of the surviving spouse provision despite the limitations plainly expressed by the Legislature. The majority borrows the criteria of the surviving spouse provision as a means of deeming the Mandevilles' relationship sufficiently defunct to merit the employment of equity through a right of contribution while it ignores the limitations that the Legislature specifically imposed. It stands to reason that any time a spouse qualifies under MCL 700.2801 as a nonsurviving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>spouse, the majority would allow the estate of the decedent spouse to seek contribution for any perceived inequities. Thus, notwithstanding the majority\u2019s protestations to the contrary, its theory now results in the wholesale application of the surviving spouse provision in a new class of cases not otherwise contemplated under the plain language of the statute. I do not believe it is within a judge\u2019s power to borrow a limiting principle \u201cinherent\u201d in a statute that specifically excludes the very issue to which it would be applied and apply it in situations divorced from the statutory scheme and intent. The general equitable powers of this Court do not increase the judicial power to rewrite statutes.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">B. THE MAJORITY\u2019S NEW RULE IS UNPRECEDENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The majority has not cited a single authority from this state or any other that provides support for its position allowing an action between spouses for contribution regarding property held as a tenancy by the entirety <em>outside the context of divorce or separation proceedings. </em>Indeed, no such authority exists. The decisions from other jurisdictions cited by the majority support its position only when read out of context and after ignoring those decisions\u2019 own internal limitations. There should be no mistake: the rule that the majority today creates represents a radical departure from this state\u2019s jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>In <em>Crawford v Crawford, </em>a wife sought contribution for property-related expenses incurred after the couple had separated but not yet divorced. At issue was the presumption that any money paid by one spouse should be considered a gift to the other spouse, and thus not eligible for contribution in the divorce. Under Maryland law, where the parties had separated before divorce, \u201ca co-tenant in a tenancy by the entireties is entitled, to the same extent as a co-tenant in a tenancy in common or joint tenancy is entitled, to contribution for that spouse\u2019s payment of the carrying charges which preserve the property.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The Maryland Court of Appeals held that absent a showing that the paying party intended to make a gift, \u201ca tenant by the entireties is entitled to contribution when he or she makes a payment, after the parties discontinue living together as husband and wife, which preserves the property and, therefore, accrues to the benefit of the co-tenant.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> In Maryland, where a court finds contribution appropriate for one cotenant in equitable separation proceedings, that cotenant may receive <em>\u201cCrawford </em>credits.\u201d As a later decision from the Maryland Court of Special Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-4\">A \u201cCrawford Credit\u201d is a credit that one co-tenant, who, <em>after separation, </em>lays out money to make mortgage payments or other carrying charges on property held as tenants by the entireties, is usually entitled to receive, absent an agreement between the parties. Prior to a divorce decree, the entitlement of a spouse to such credits is an equitable matter and not a matter of right.<footnotemark>[49]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>The Maryland Court of Special Appeals later applied this concept in <em>Turner v Turner, </em>a <em>divorce action </em>that stated that the general law of contribution applies to a tenancy by the entirety \u201c \u2018when married parties, owning property jointly, separate.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> <em>Crawford, </em>as applied now when courts issue <em>\u201cCrawford </em>credits,\u201d appears to have become a legal colloquialism for assigning and balancing equities when dividing property in divorce proceedings. These decisions are entirely consistent with Maryland\u2019s <em>divorce </em>law and provide no support for plaintiffs theory that contribution is appropriate where no divorce proceeding exists, and certainly not where a spouse has died.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Similarly, in <em>Cagan v Cagan, </em>a New York trial court allowed the plaintiff to recover costs for payments made by one tenant by the entirety in order to maintain the property and prevent foreclosure <em>following an action for </em>separation,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> In a later case also from New York, the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, held that the responsibility for mortgage payments, taxes, and insurance on an entireties property should not be borne solely by the cotenant who remained in possession <em>after a legal decree of separation was entered </em>on the grounds of abandonment.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The common thread among these cases is that the plaintiffs were able to overcome \u2014 in <em>live divorce proceedings that sought to partition marital property </em>\u2014 the presumption that money expended by one party to the divorce to maintain a concurrent estate was not a gift to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>his or her spouse.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> In a divorce action, it is <em>necessary </em>to make equitable divisions of property among the living spouses, and this necessarily includes what is often a couple\u2019s largest asset: their home. It is an unremarkable proposition that divorce courts, <em>sitting in equity while dividing marital property, </em>would require contributions to the spouse who paid more than his share during the divorce process, even when dealing with a couple who own their home as tenants by the entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">And Michigan divorce law is in accord with these principles of law articulated in other states. Michigan law demands equity in divorce and other domestic relations proceedings. Statutory law provides that upon an annulment of a marriage, a divorce, or an order of separate maintenance, a court will divide property \u201cas it shall deem just and reasonable. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> A separate statutory provision allows a court to award to either party a portion of the other\u2019s real and personal property, as well as spousal support, \u201cas the court considers just and reasonable, after considering the ability of either party to pay and the character and situation of the parties, and all the other circumstances of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> In sum, when apportioning marital property <em>in a divorce, </em>Michigan courts must make a division that, although it need not be equal, must be equitable considering all the circumstances.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>However, the cases on which the majority relies\u2014 discussing the presumption of gift doctrine among spouses and equity in divorce and separation actions\u2014 interpret concepts that are separate and distinct from those relevant to a tenancy by the entirety that is automatically terminated upon death. As such, they are wholly inapposite to the case presently before this Court, and their \u201clogic and reasoning\u201d most certainly do <em>not </em>\u201cclosely resemble\u201d this case, as the majority alleges.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> They present facts and thus legal decisions involving a <em>living husband, and wife in the context of divorce or separation actions that are being actually litigated for the very purpose of partitioning marital property. </em>Indeed, the majority recognizes and admits this, stating that \u201cthe issues in these out-of-state cases undisputedly arise in the context of divorce and separate maintenance actions . .. .\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Yet, the majority\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>argument irresponsibly and imprecisely conflates the law of contribution as applied in these two separate and distinct contexts. The majority argues that, because domestic relations and divorce law generally allows claims of contribution when necessary to produce an equitable result, this should also control when determining parties\u2019 rights and obligations in managing real property in probate after the death of a spouse. I strongly disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">It is difficult to apply the principles of these foreign cases after the death of one of the parties where there has been no divorce (or even any steps taken toward obtaining a divorce or separate maintenance), and no attempt to dispose of the property with judicial oversight while the parties remained alive. Contribution related to property held as a tenancy by the entirety is only available under Michigan law in the context of a divorce, separation, or separate maintenance proceeding where a court, addressing a breakdown in the marriage, is forced to balance the equities between the parties. Thus, because Janet Mandeville <em>could not </em>have sought contribution from defendant while alive because she did not pursue an action for divorce, separation, or separate maintenance, her estate likewise cannot pursue such an action.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The law is pellucidly clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>absent the destruction of the tenancy by the entirety by one of the legal means previously described,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> the death of a cotenant by the entirety automatically makes the surviving spouse the sole owner of the property and simultaneously extinguishes the decedent\u2019s ownership interest in the property. Thus, by operation of the type of estate chosen by the Mandevilles and how the Mandevilles chose to structure and maintain their marriage, there is no entitlement to order contribution in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">C. ALTHOUGH THE COMMON LAW RULE IS EQUITABLE, THE MAJORITY REJECTS IT IN FAVOR OF A NEW RULE THAT IS CONTRARY TO THE POLICIES OF THIS STATE</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">While this Court unquestionably has the authority to modify the common law,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> doing so is a task we approach with the utmost caution,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> and this case is a good illustration as to why. We are presented here with a set of rules that has been in place and applied in common law societies since before Michigan became a state. Everyone from young couples buying their first home to estate planners advising their clients how to structure their property have relied on these tenets with the justified expectation that the force of law will protect their choices. The majority\u2019s decision to change the common law in this case represents a sea-change in our laws governing property and threatens to upend legitimate financial relationships into which married persons have entered.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>There is a great danger in authorizing courts to engage in post hoc factual inquiries concerning how a husband and wife should have decided to structure their marriage, their finances, and the various equities involved in a lifetime of making choices as a couple rather than as individuals pursuing separate self-interests. The majority fails to address the unknown\u2014 and perhaps unknowable \u2014 implications that accompany its change in the common law. Beyond recounting the facts of this case, the majority does not discuss what facts would be legally sufficient for courts to divide marital property equitably after death. Nor does the majority sufficiently address what would serve as the limiting principle concerning a contribution claim against the surviving spouse. Moreover, as previously stated, the majority\u2019s new rule upsets the reliance interests of all Michigan spouses who have entered into tenancies by the entirety in preference'to other forms of lesser protected joint property relationships. Strangely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>but perhaps not unexpectedly, the majority opinion is silent on its justifications for unsettling these rebanee interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Instead, the majority rests on the standards set forth by the surviving spouse provision, inappropriately borrowing its framework to order contribution in this case, even though the Legislature never intended this provision to be used in such a way. Yet, where this Court is considering a sweeping change to Michigan\u2019s common law through the employment of equity, I believe that the justices certainly owe more consideration and guidance to future courts than what amounts to the majority\u2019s theory of \u201cI know it when I see it.\u201d The majority uses the rare facts of this case to change the overarching principle applicable in all cases; in essence, it uses the exception to rewrite the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">In its desire to order contribution for a plaintiff it clearly deems sympathetic, the majority leaves myriad questions unanswered regarding the scope of this new-found legal avenue to collaterally attack financial arrangements made in the course of a valid marriage. Particularly in situations where neither spouse ever asked a court to intervene in the marital relationship, it is deeply troubling that the majority now allows courts to do so under the guise of equity after the death of a spouse. This difficulty in allowing estates to pursue an action for contribution or unjust enrichment after the death of a spouse, particularly where neither party ever sought separate maintenance, is that doing so risks upsetting intimate and perfectly legitimate marital arrangements and the law that heretofore supported such relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">This difficulty arises because courts are poorly positioned to make such weighty decisions after the death of a married party, and especially as here, where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>parties <em>themselves </em>chose not to end their marriage. For example, at least in cases that follow the historical norm in which men contribute more than their spouses to acquiring and maintaining family property, the rule adopted by the majority may be turned into a \u201csword\u201d to be used against stay-at-home wives and women who earn less than their husbands. Similarly, I wonder whether the majority would permit a rebalancing of marital equities <em>any time </em>a husband and wife have discontinued living together, or where there is no showing of an intent to make a gift, or where one spouse in a rocky marriage takes action that benefits the other spouse \u2014 all facts that the majority finds relevant to rebalance the equities of the Mandevilles\u2019 marriage. Under the majority\u2019s theory, what would stop disgruntled spouses, third parties, or courts from intervening in the financial arrangements of marriages wherever \u201cprinciples of natural justice\u201d and \u201cgood conscience so dictate\u201d?<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> And to what extent does the majority allow courts to assess the equities of a marriage \u2014 which may last for decades \u2014 in determining the appropriate level for contribution? Should defendant receive credits or be allowed to counterclaim against a plaintiff-estate for areas in the marriage where he shared a larger portion of the financial burden, as he likely would have in a divorce or separate maintenance proceeding? The majority simply does not \u2014 and probably cannot \u2014 answer these questions. Because the method by which spouses arrange their financial circumstances is entirely a product of their own determination and in accordance with their wishes and values, I would decline to authorize this type of post <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>hoc judicial inquiry into the equitable nature of those arrangements that the majority permits \u2014 indeed, requires \u2014 upon a challenge of this nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Moreover, by accepting plaintiffs invitation to change our common law, the majority today creates an unprecedented action akin to allowing a new type of \u201cposthumous divorce\u201d in this state. As the preceding sections discussing Michigan divorce law and caselaw from our sister states demonstrates, the only method by which a spouse can normally obtain contribution for property involving a tenancy by the entirety is when a court is balancing equities concerning property in divorce or separate maintenance proceedings. That being the case, the majority grants plaintiff the <em>same relief </em>that Janet Mandeville would have been accorded in a divorce or separation, but without the benefit of an <em>actual </em>divorce or separation proceeding. And indeed, the majority treats the Mandevilles\u2019 marriage as sufficiently defunct in order to hold defendant hable for contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">I strongly object to any decision that recognizes an action amounting to posthumous divorce.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Following this decision, Michigan courts are now permitted to determine after a spouse\u2019s death whether a couple\u2019s relationship had broken down in life in order to reassign equities just as a family court would do in divorce or separate maintenance proceedings. The facts of this case show that neither Frank nor Janet Mandeville legally ended their marriage or took the steps that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>would allow courts to order contribution while Janet Mandeville was alive. Therefore, <em>courts should not be allowed to rebalance the equities of a marriage after the death of a party as if there had been a divorce </em>in order to determine the proper amount for monetary contribution. Recognizing the equivalent of posthumous divorce in this state is an untenable course of action for this Court to take where the positive law of this state has provided extensive indications that marriage is to be fostered, preserved, and ended only by judicial intervention at the request of the spouses themselves.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">I also recognize that the Legislature is better positioned to balance the complex public policy consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>ations inherent in plaintiffs request to allow the recalculation of equities after death or create a type of posthumous divorce in this state. As this Court has stated previously: \u201cThe responsibility for drawing lines in a society as complex as ours \u2014 of identifying priorities, weighing the relevant considerations and choosing between competing alternatives \u2014 is the Legislature\u2019s, not the judiciary\u2019s.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> This principle is even more important where the requested change in the common law is contrary to a public policy of the state, as is the case here.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Further, I note that the Michigan Legislature has <em>declined </em>to adopt legislation that would have accomplished statutorily exactly the changes plaintiff seeks in the common law here.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> And as observed earlier, the Legislature actually <em>has acted </em>in this area through its enactment of Michigan\u2019s surviving spouse statute. However, the Legislature acted in a highly <em>limited </em>fashion and has <em>not </em>extended the statute\u2019s reach in ways that would encompass the facts of this case.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> In this regard, the Legislature has already selected a policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>for this state. Nevertheless, the majority apparently has no qualms extending the common law in a contrary fashion. As previously noted, long-established principles of statutory construction do not give this Court the authority to do so. Normally, if the Legislature believes that such a historical principle should be changed, it is free to do so. Although to date the Legislature has declined to make such a change, the majority has instead fashioned an unprecedented judge-created rule in contravention of this state\u2019s public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">There is an old legal adage that \u201cbad facts make bad law.\u201d This phrase has rarely been as true as on the circumstances giving rise to this case. In its eagerness to provide relief to a plaintiff it deems sympathetic, the majority today rejects the legal remedies that were available to that plaintiff, and instead crafts an unprecedented new remedy. In doing so, the majority extends the law\u2019s equitable reach in new and unique ways, unsettling centuries of law in this area and implicitly reworking what is the key feature of a tenancy by the entirety: the unencumbered right of survivorship. Moreover, by allowing courts to make post hoc determinations regarding the distribution of equities in a marriage, the majority\u2019s decision imposes upon the citizenry of Michigan rules that amount to posthumous divorce under the guise of equity. And it does so by inappropriately borrowing the framework from a narrow statute limited in application by its explicit terms, resulting in the wholesale application of that statute into an area of law in which it was never intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Because the law\u2019s equitable reach is surely not designed to allow the estates of parties to accomplish after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>death that which the parties themselves declined to pursue in life, I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision today. Instead, I believe that plaintiff cannot present a claim under Michigan law or in equity that would allow the decedent\u2019s estate to recover contribution from defendant. Michigan law does not recognize a right of contribution among tenants by the entirety, and thus plaintiffs claim is not cognizable under our current law governing real property. Nor, perforce, is her claim justified in equity on a theory of unjust enrichment. Defendant was not unjustly enriched when, by operation of law, he took sole ownership of marital property previously held as a tenancy by the entirety with the decedent. Unlike the majority, I would decline to extend the common law of this state as plaintiff requests. Michigan\u2019s public policy can provide no justification for, and is in fact antithetical to, the concept of \u201ccommon law divorce\u201d or the notion that courts should recalculate the equities involved in a marriage after a spouse has passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Accordingly, I vigorously dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-10\"> This Court has on occasion allowed for the development of the common law as the circumstances and considerations of public policy have warranted, but our common-law jurisprudence has been guided by a number of prudential principles.

This concern ignores what is obvious about such a concern: if a couple has religious objections to divorce, then by the nature of those objections, the responding spouse would not counterclaim for a divorce in an action for separate maintenance. In any case, where a couple has decided no longer to live together as husband and wife but not divorce, an action for contribution is no more effectual than an action for separate maintenance. The primary difference is that only the latter was provided for by our Legislature, and only the latter prevents a spouse from unilaterally requiring a court to rebalance the equities of marital decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b124-7\"> <em>Ante </em>at 54-55.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\"> The majority quotes <em>Powers v Fisher, </em>279 Mich 442, 447; 272 NW 737 (1937), for the proposition that the \u201clegal remedy, both in respect to its final relief and its modes of obtaining the relief, must be as effectual as the remedy which equity would confer under the circumstances....\u201d How can separate maintenance possibly be viewed as inadequate when, if it had been pursued, it would have allowed Janet Mandeville to acquire the same costs her estate now seeks here, after making virtually an identical legal showing that the marital relationship had broken down?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b124-9\"> See <em>Zoellner v Zoellner, </em>46 Mich 511, 515; 9 NW 831 (1881).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">I do not, as the majority implies, believe that Janet Mandeville was \u201cderelict\u201d in pursuing her legal remedies.

See <em>Twin City Pipe Line Co v Harding Glass Co, </em>283 US 353, 357; 51 S Ct 476; 75 L Ed 1112 (1931).

Where the majority makes such extraordinary <em>factual </em>findings as that the Mandevilles had \u201cdiscontinued living together as husband and wife,\u201d it is hard to argue that the majority is doing anything other than mentally divorcing the couple in order to hold defendant liable for contribution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"66\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\"> By allowing post hoc, posthumous judicial inquiries into the equities of a marriage, the majority\u2019s opinion here is in deep conflict with Michigan\u2019s public policy <em>favoring </em>marriage. See <em>Van v Zahorik, </em>460 Mich 320, 332; 597 NW2d 15 (1999); <em>Wagoner v Wagoner, </em>128 Mich 635, 638; 87 NW 898 (1901).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">The majority\u2019s assertion that <em>its </em>opinion is the one that fosters and preserves marriage by allowing married couples to pursue actions for contribution is too clever by half. At its core, our society\u2019s respect for marriage relies on the marital couple itself to chart its own course and make its own decisions. In return, the marital couple relies on a set of established principles \u2014 legal and otherwise \u2014 to ensure that decisions will be given effect. Unlike the majority, I am not prepared to alter either this reliance or the principles themselves where one party unilaterally decides that he or she no longer likes the marital agreement. Ultimately, the majority\u2019s opinion allows plaintiff to obtain relief she otherwise would not be able to achieve based on the way the decedent and her husband structured their marriage. How can this possibly be said to preserve marriage or accord respect to the way a couple structured its marriage? Marriage necessitates mutuality in decision-making, yet the majority now grants to one spouse the power to invite courts into the marriage to analyze the decisions and equities as a court would in any normal business or partnership dispute \u2014 and worse still, it apparently allows a spouse to do so from beyond the grave. This absurd situation underscores the majority\u2019s inability to recognize this case for what it is: a marriage that arguably faltered in its latter years because of apparent problems for which there are settled, appropriate, and adequate remedies in existence that neither spouse in this case pursued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"67\">\n<p id=\"b139-6\"> <em>O\u2019Donnell v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, </em>404 Mich 524, 542; 273 NW2d 829 (1979); see also <em>Henry, </em>473 Mich at 98 (\u201c[W]hat we as <em>individuals </em>prefer is not necessarily what we <em>as justices </em>ought to impose upon the people.
