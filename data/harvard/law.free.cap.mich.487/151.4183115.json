Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand these cases to the Wayne Circuit Court for further proceedings on plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Plaintiffs are African-Americans formerly employed by defendant. They worked for defendant at banking centers in Wayne County. On or around May 17, 2007, defendant terminated their employment for alleged misconduct. Plaintiff Sharon Champion learned of her dismissal through a telephone call from defendant\u2019s office in Oakland County to her home in Wayne County. The parties dispute where plaintiff Brandon Brightwell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>received notice of his dismissal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\">Plaintiffs filed separate lawsuits in Wayne County, each alleging that defendant had terminated their employment for reasons of racial discrimination in violation of the CRA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendant moved in both lawsuits to change venue to Oakland County. It supported the motions with an affidavit from Michael Andrzejewski, an employee relations consultant who worked in defendant\u2019s Southfield regional office in Oakland County.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Andrzejewksi averred in his affidavit that he was personally involved in the final decisions to terminate plaintiffs\u2019 employment and that those decisions were made in the Southfield regional office. Defendant claimed that because it made the decisions in Oakland County, venue was proper only there. Both trial courts declined to change venue. Defendant sought interlocutory appeals in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The Court of Appeals granted both applications for leave to appeal, consolidated the appeals, and reversed the trial courts\u2019 rulings in a divided decision. Relying on <em>Barnes, </em>the lead opinion concluded that \u201cthe appropriate venue for a CRA cause of action. .. depends on where the defendant\u2019s violation occurred, not where the plaintiff was injured.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It noted that \u201c[t]his Court has held that the alleged violation of the CRA is the action which gives rise to liability under the act, i.e., the corporate decision affecting the plaintiffs employment.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The Court of Appeals concurrence agreed that \u201cvenue is appropriate where the CRA was violated through the use of improper characteristics in making an employment decision.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It criticized the dissenting opinion\u2019s discussion of the statutory tort venue provision, MCL 600.1629, as interpreted in our decision in <em>Dimmitt &amp; Owens Fin, Inc v Deloitte &amp; Touche (ISC), LLC.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The Court of Appeals dissent argued that the employment decisions constituted only a \u201cpotential violation\u201d of the CRA and that it was the actual discharges that constituted the adverse employment actions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The dissent would have held that venue was proper in Wayne County.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Plaintiffs sought review in this Court, and we granted their applications for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">An appellate court uses the clearly erroneous standard to review a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to change venue.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Statutory interpretation involves questions of law that are reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">The relevant statutory provision, MCL 37.2801, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">(1) A person alleging a violation of this act may bring a civil action for appropriate injunctive relief or damages, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">(2) An action commenced pursuant to subsection (1) may be brought in the circuit court for the county where the alleged violation occurred, or for the county where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>person against whom the civil complaint is filed resides or has his principal place of business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">As always, our analysis begins with the language of the statute.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The primary goal of statutory interpretation is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature as expressed in the statute.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">These cases involve only the first clause of subsection (2), which makes venue proper \u201cin the circuit court for the county where the alleged violation occurred.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In <em>Barnes, </em>the Court of Appeals held, without citation or analysis, that the \u201cviolations alleged are adverse employment decisions\u201d and that \u201cthe place of corporate decision making is an appropriate venue.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Judge WHITE concurred separately, opining that \u201c[discrimination also \u2018occurs\u2019 in the county where the decision is implemented and the discrimination is inflicted.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> She rejected the majority\u2019s implication that \u201cvenue of a civil rights action is proper only in the county where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>discriminatory decision is made.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The question of where venue properly lies for a lawsuit brought under the CRA turns on the meaning of the phrase \u201cwhere the alleged violation occurred\u201d found in MCL 37.2801(2). \u201cViolation\u201d is defined in part as \u201c1. the act of violating or the state of being violated. 2. a breach or infringement, as of a law or promise.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Plaintiffs alleged that defendant violated MCL 37.2202(1), which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">An employer shall not do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">(a) Fail or refuse to hire or recruit, discharge, or otherwise discriminate against an individual with respect to employment, compensation, or a term, condition, or privilege of employment, because of religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, or marital status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">A \u201cviolation\u201d of MCL 37.2202, therefore, is equally dependent on an adverse employment action (in these cases the act of \u201cdischarging]\u201d) and an improper motive for taking that action (a decision to discriminate \u201cbecause of\u201d a protected status). We believe it logically follows that a violation of the CRA \u201coccur[s]\u201d when the discriminatory decision is made and adverse employment actions are implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Thus, we agree with Judge White\u2019s concurrence in <em>Barnes, </em>which is also consistent with other courts\u2019 interpretations of similar venue provisions. The majority in <em>Barnes </em>erred by restricting what constitutes a violation of the CRA to \u201cadverse employment decisions.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Relying heavily on <em>Barnes, </em>the Court of Appeals lead and concurring opinions here reached the same erroneous conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">We overrule <em>Barnes </em>because it restricted the analysis of a violation of the CRA to the adverse employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>decision. <em>Barnes </em>is inconsistent with MCL 37.2202(l)(a) and the meaning of \u201cviolation\u201d and \u201coccurred\u201d in MCL 37.2801.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\">However, this determination does not fully resolve the issue before us. A remaining question is: What specific actions constitute the unlawful discharge that establishes the CRA violation? Venue in these cases was clearly proper in Oakland County because it is undisputed that defendant resides in Oakland County. However, plaintiffs filed suit in Wayne County. The Court of Appeals determined that the trial courts erred by denying defendant\u2019s motions to change venue to Oakland County because venue did not properly lie in Wayne County. Therefore, we must determine whether a CRA violation occurred in Wayne County that would provide a basis for venue in that location as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Defendant asserts that, even if <em>Barnes </em>is overruled, venue is proper only in Oakland County because that is where defendant completed several actions necessary to effectuate each plaintiffs discharge. For example, it removed plaintiffs from its payroll system at its Oakland County office. Plaintiffs counter that the only action that was relevant was the communication of the discharge decisions to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We reject both parties\u2019 arguments. It would be arbitrary to consider any of the suggested actions entirely dispositive of where the CRA violation occurred. Discrimination claims often involve numerous actions concerning employers\u2019 practices. Moreover, often it is unclear where the actions occurred that the parties claim are dispositive. Indeed, these cases provide a good illustration of the problem. If the location where the employment decision was communicated to a plaintiff is solely dispositive, a court must still determine where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>that decision was \u201ccommunicated.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Finally, under this approach, defendants could unilaterally control venue by completing administrative tasks related to terminating a plaintiffs employment in their choice of locales. Or they could order an employee to report to a location in the venue they desire and fire the employee there. We believe these are not results that the Legislature intended in enacting the CRA.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">We conclude that the adverse employment actions in these cases occurred where plaintiffs\u2019 place of employment was located.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> That is where most relevant actions involving the employer-employee relationship occur. Moreover, it is the severing of the employment relationship that is the truly adverse employment action. This action happens when the employee is no longer entitled to enter his or her place of work and perform the responsibilities of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">As Judge WHITE observed, it is also at this point that the allegedly unlawful discharge is fully \u201cimplemented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>and the discrimination is inflicted.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Applying that logic to these cases, we note that plaintiffs worked in Wayne County. Because defendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful actions precluded plaintiffs from continuing to do so, the CRA violations occurred in Wayne County.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\">The concurrence/dissent erroneously limits the occurrence of a violation solely to the place where a discriminatory decision is communicated to an employee. In doing so, it attaches too much significance to where the disclosure of the allegedly discriminatory discharge occurs. Indeed, the essence of the concurrence/dissent\u2019s conclusion is found in its statement that \u201cit can only be the actual communication, which itself implements a discriminatory decision, that amounts to the actual \u2018discharge\u2019 ... ,\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Our reaction to this assertion is to ask: Why is this inherently so?</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The concurrence/dissent offers no persuasive analysis to support its conclusion that the CRA violation must occur where the discharge is communicated. The right being violated under the CRA is not the right to be free from communication of adverse employment actions. Rather, it is the right to be free from actions that actually separate the employee from gainful employment for discriminatory reasons.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The justices joining the concurrence/dissent convey an incorrect interpretation of this opinion when they write \u201cthat scarcely one in a thousand people would believe that a person is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\u2018discharged\u2019 from employment at the moment an employer says to the employee: \u2018You\u2019re fired.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In a world where snappy soundbites often distort the facts, this statement fits well and has face appeal. In truth, we justices do not disagree that \u201cYou\u2019re fired\u201d means \u201cYou are discharged from your employment.\u201d Rather, this case addresses a quite different question, which is: If you are fired, in what location are you entitled to bring suit?</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">It is true that the <em>actus reus </em>and the <em>mens rea </em>of a CRA violation converge when a defendant communicates a discriminatory decision to an employee. But while that convergence causes the CRA violation, it does not settle the issue of what constitutes discharging the employee: the communication of the discriminatory decision or removing the employee\u2019s right to work at his or her place of employment.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Decisions from other jurisdictions involving similar statutes have generally taken a more nuanced approach in evaluating where an employment discrimination violation occurs.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Other jurisdictions have consistently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>analyzed similar statutory language as including \u201c \u2018the place where the decisions and actions concerning the employment practices occurred.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> We believe that it is the severance of the employment relationship that constitutes the actual discharge, not the mere communication of an adverse employment decision.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The concurrence/dissent\u2019s definition of \u201cdischarge\u201d provides greater support for our interpretation.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> To \u201crelieve of obligation,\u201d \u201cdeprive of. . . employment,\u201d or \u201cdismiss from service\u201d involves many decisions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>actions. One is the communication of the dismissal to the employee, which the concurrence/dissent concludes is the basis for a CRA violation. However, it is not the communication of the discharge that violates the CRA, it is the actual discharge of the employee from his or her employment. This act occurs where the employee works because the employer has discharged the employee by removing his or her ability to work in that location.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">The concurrence/dissent\u2019s determination of when a CRA violation occurs leads it to assert that the doctrine of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>undermines our conclusion.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> However, this argument is premised on the concurrence/dissent\u2019s erroneous construction of the term \u201cdischarge\u201d and of the language \u201cwhere the alleged violation occurred\u201d in MCL 37.2801(2). Since the Legislature intended the interpretation we ascribe to the language, there was no reason to expressly include an employee\u2019s place of employment as an alternative basis for venue. Hence, if \u201cwhere the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>alleged violation occurred\u201d encompasses acts precluding an employee from continuing to work at his or her place of employment, why would additional language be necessary?</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Moreover, the last portion of the provision furnishing a basis for venue in MCL 37.2801(2) is explicitly tied to locations over which the employer has exclusive control; specifically, it provides for proper venue in \u201cthe county where the person against whom the civil complaint is filed resides or has his principal place of business.\u201d Presumably, if the Legislature had also intended that \u201cwhere the alleged violation occurred\u201d be a place over which a defendant had full control, it would have said so.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The Legislature certainly could have provided venue in \u201cthe county where the person against whom the civil complaint is filed resides, has its principal place of business, or communicates the alleged violation to the employee.\u201d It did not do so. This omission suggests that the phrase \u201cwhere the alleged violation occurred\u201d was not similarly meant to be limited to locations subject to a defendant\u2019s exclusive control.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In sum, there is no textual basis in the CRA for reading the language of MCL 37.2801(2) as the concurrence/dissent reads it.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Finally, our analysis avoids the arbitrariness of the approaches suggested by the parties and accepted by the concurrence/dissent. Employers and employees generally both have some influence in determining where an employment relationship is formulated. \u201cVenue rules traditionally have served to ensure that proceedings are held in the most convenient forum,\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> and it defies common sense to conclude that the county in which the employee actually worked for the employer would be an inconvenient forum for either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">We again reject the concurrence/dissent\u2019s assertion that our decision is policy driven and that our analysis is merely justification for a predetermined interpretation. In fact, our decision is reasonably derived from the language of the statute. This decision invokes at least the following exercises in statutory interpretation: (1) an attempt to reasonably comprehend the meaning of \u201cviolation,\u201d \u201coccurred,\u201d and \u201cdischarge\u201d in the CRA, (2) an attempt to reasonably comprehend the meaning of these terms in the context of MCL 37.2801(2) as a whole, (3) an attempt to assess where the <em>actus reus </em>and the <em>mens rea </em>of the statute converge, (4) an attempt to compare the language of MCL 37.2801(2) with that of its predecessor statute, (5) an assessment of the relevance of traditional maxims of statutory construction, in this case <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>(6) an attempt to assess alternative meanings of the relevant statutory terms, including those adopted by the concurrence/dissent, in light of the overall purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the statute, and (7) an attempt to compare and contrast the caselaw of other states construing similar language. That we additionally point out that our interpretation results in a considerably more convenient forum than that of the concurrence/dissent does not detract from the focus of our interpretative approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Plaintiffs both worked for defendant in Wayne County. Because adverse employment actions \u2014 the severance of plaintiffs\u2019 employment relationships \u2014 took place in Wayne County, the CRA violations occurred in Wayne County. Thus, venue properly lay in Wayne County under MCL 37.2801(2). Therefore, the Court of Appeals incorrectly held that the trial courts clearly erred by denying defendant\u2019s motions to change venue to Oakland County.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">We conclude that, under MCL 37.2801(2), a violation of the CRA occurs when the alleged discriminatory decision is made and the allegedly adverse employment actions are implemented. We overrule the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Barnes v Int\u2019l Business Machines Corp </em>to the extent that it held otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">We further conclude that the CRA violation in a case alleging discharge from employment is the severance of the employment relationship. The decisions and actions constituting that violation are implemented, and therefore occur, when the employee is no longer entitled to enter the workplace and perform the responsibilities of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">In these cases, each plaintiffs employment relationship with defendant was based and severed in Wayne County. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Thus, defendant\u2019s alleged violations of the CRA. occurred in Wayne County. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand these cases to the Wayne Circuit Court for further proceedings there on plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<judges id=\"b209-3\">CAVANAGH, MARKMAN, and HATHAWAY, JJ., concurred with Kelly, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-13\"> MCL 37.2801.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b193-14\"> MCL 37.2101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b194-8\"> <em>Barnes v Int\u2019l Business Machines Corp, </em>212 Mich App 223; 537 NW2d 265 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b194-9\"> <em>Brightwell v Fifth Third Bank of Michigan, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued April 9, 2009 (Docket Nos. 280820 and 281005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b194-10\"> In <em>Barnes, </em>the Court of Appeals did not explicitly limit venue to the place where the employment decisions were made.

We note that <em>Barnes </em>relied heavily on the policy rationale articulated in <em>Gross v Gen Motors Corp, </em>448 Mich 147, 164; 528 NW2d 707 (1995), that one of the goals of venue provisions is to discourage forum-shopping. <em>Barnes, </em>212 Mich App at 226. As a general matter, this statement is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">However, <em>Gross </em>interpreted the tort venue provision, MCL 600.1629, which was added as part of the tort reforms enacted in 1986. One of the Legislature\u2019s explicit goals was to reduce forum-shopping by plaintiffs. <em>Gross, </em>448 Mich at 157-158.

Thus, only locations related to the defendant in a CRA. action could properly be considered excluded by implication under this canon.

Under the concurrence/dissent\u2019s approach, venue for a discriminatory discharge case would not be proper in Wayne County if the employer invited her to lunch in Windsor, Canada to tell her she was discharged. Similarly, the employee might attend a work retreat in the Upper Peninsula at her employer\u2019s request and be informed there that she was discharged.

I dissent, however, from the majority\u2019s analysis regarding <em>when </em>this implementation occurs. In order to justify its interpretation that venue is always proper at an employee\u2019s place of work, the majority holds that a violation of the CRA has not occurred at the moment when an employer communicates a discriminatory employment decision to an employee. This conclusion is contrary to the basic principle that the CRA violation occurs with the convergence of a prohibited act and a discriminatory intent. In light of that principle, I believe that the communication of the discriminatory decision <em>is itself </em>the CRA violation. Thus, once an adverse employment action is actually communicated, a violation has occurred and the plaintiffs claim becomes actionable, thereby making venue proper under the plain language of the CRA only in those places where the violation occurred. I also dissent from the majority\u2019s related holding that where an employee physically works provides an independently proper place of venue, even when a violation of the CRA did not occur in that location. While the location of employment may present a convenient or logical forum, because it is not necessarily where a statutory violation occurs for the purposes of the CRA\u2019s venue provision, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>dissent from the portion of the majority\u2019s opinion manufacturing it as a proper venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"pAo\">The venue provision within the CRA provides, in relevant part: \u201cAn action commenced pursuant to [MCL 37.2801(1)] may be brought in the circuit court for the county <em>where the alleged violation occurred, </em>or for the county where the person against whom the civil complaint is filed resides or has his principal place of business.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The CRA itself describes what constitutes a violation. It provides, among other things, that an employer shall not \u201c[f]ail or refuse to hire or recruit, <em>discharge, </em>or otherwise discriminate against an individual with respect to employment ... because of... race ... .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ASW\">Our interpretation of this statute is governed by clear and uncontroversial rules of statutory construction. \u201cIn interpreting statutory language, this Court\u2019s primary goal is to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent. If the Legislature has clearly expressed its intent in the language of the statute, that statute must be enforced as written, free of any \u2018contrary judicial gloss.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In doing so, \u201c[w]e first review the language of the statute itself. If it is clear, no further analysis is necessary or allowed to expand what the Legislature clearly intended to cover.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>The language of the CRA clearly requires that a defendant commit an <em>actus reus </em>(an adverse employment action, such as a \u201cdischarge\u201d) with a specific <em>mens rea </em>(a discriminatory intent) in order to violate its provisions. Moreover, a violation of the CRA only occurs when an improper discriminatory intent is <em>actually communicated </em>within the context of the adverse employment action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Stated otherwise, for venue purposes, I believe that a violation occurs under the statute <em>only </em>at the time and in the place or places where the <em>actus reus </em>and the <em>'mens rea </em>converge: where the defendant <em>implements </em>the discriminatory adverse employment action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">The majority disagrees with this straightforward understanding and application of the CRA\u2019s venue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>provision, although it cannot explain why the convergence of the <em>mens rea </em>and the <em>actus reus </em>does not equate with a statutory violation \u2014 here, two discharges. The majority confusingly explains that \u201cit is not the communication of the discharge that violates the CRA, it is the actual discharge of the employee from his or her employment.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Yet when an employer fires an employee for a discriminatory purpose, as was alleged here, why is the communication of that adverse employment decision not <em>itself </em>the violation of the CRA?</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">I think that scarcely one in a thousand people would believe that a person is not \u201cdischarged\u201d from employment at the moment an employer says to the employee: \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d Yet in the context of discriminatory discharges under the CRA, the majority holds otherwise. The majority thus believes that the communication or implementation of a discriminatory decision only causes a <em>future </em>violation of the CRA at some later, indeterminate time (when an employee is actually prevented from returning to the workplace or performing his work duties) and is not itself the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>actual violation of the CRA. I fail to see how this can be true. An employer who tells an employee that he is fired <em>actually </em>severs the employment relationship at that time; if he also communicates a discriminatory intent to the employee at this time, he has violated the CRA. Such a converg\u00e9nce is more than a mere discriminatory statement devoid of meaning or consequence until some later time. The majority fails to understand that the issue of <em>when </em>a person is fired is inextricably linked to <em>where </em>the person is fired, given that the location(s) at the time the discharge occurs establish the statutory venue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">The majority\u2019s analysis on this point is also internally inconsistent. If the communication terminating employment only caused a later violation that occurred at the employee\u2019s place of work, then <em>only </em>the <em>place of employment </em>could ever be the locus of the violation that establishes venue under the CRA. However, the majority opinion also holds that a violation may occur elsewhere at some place other than the place of employment. Under the majority\u2019s theory, why would the place where the communication is received, if it is not the place of actual employment, <em>ever </em>be a proper venue if it were not the place where the <em>actus reus </em>and the <em>mens rea </em>converge to cause the violation? The majority cannot explain this anomaly.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Similarly, the majority opinion additionally provides that the \u201cadverse employment actions in these cases occurred where plaintiffs\u2019 place of employment was located\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 that is, where plaintiffs physically worked. It is difficult to see how the majority\u2019s \u201cplace of employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>ment\u201d theory of violation relates in any relevant way to the occurrence of the <em>actual </em>discharge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In effect, the majority\u2019s analysis establishes as a matter of law that venue is proper not only where the discriminatory communication terminating the employment occurred, but also where the \u201ceffects\u201d of the discrimination occurred, namely at an employee\u2019s place of work. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The majority\u2019s position is further undermined by the fact that the CRA explicitly makes the <em>defendant\u2019s </em>place of business a proper venue, while at the same time it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>says nothing about the plaintiffs place of employment. The CRA\u2019s venue provision provides that a CRA action \u201cmay be brought in the circuit court for the county where .. . the person against whom the civil complaint is filed resides or has his principal place of business.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This language underscores the fact that the majority essentially creates a new venue provision that is contrary or in addition to the statutory language regarding where a violation occurs, as well as the structure and specific language chosen by the Legislature.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">If the Legislature had wished to make a plaintiffs place of employment a proper venue, it could have easily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>and explicitly done so.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Indeed, if the Legislature wishes to establish parallel venue provisions, it is capable of doing and has done so.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, when the Legislature has not done so, this Court may not expand upon the clear language chosen by the Legislature. Simply put, the CRA\u2019s venue provision says nothing about the plaintiffs place or locus of employment as an independent site of proper venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">That the majority is expanding the scope of the CRA is further underscored when considering potential violations that are <em>not </em>discriminatory <em>discharges, </em>but are nonetheless CRA violations that will therefore be implicated by this decision. As previously noted, the CRA prohibits discriminatory \u201cfailures] or refus[als] to hire or recruit\u201d and other unnamed types of general employment discrimination against a person.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Under the majority\u2019s formulation, venue would be proper in a plaintiffs place of <em>potential </em>employment even if the plaintiff <em>never worked </em>in that place because of a refusal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>to hire.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> By way of contrast, my interpretation of the venue provision appropriately prevents venue from being established in such a location because neither the <em>actus reus </em>nor the <em>mens rea </em>\u2014 which together comprise a violation \u2014 would occur in that place. Moreover, whereas Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act explicitly contemplates such a result,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the Michigan Legislature declined to adopt comparable language when it crafted Michigan\u2019s CRA.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, the majority\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>struction ascribes additional meaning to the words of Michigan\u2019s CRA not contemplated by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Finally, the majority notes several policy considerations supporting its position, but I believe that each is unavailing to displace the clear language of the statute. The majority argues that its additional rule creates another convenient forum and that it also prevents an employer from controlling the place of venue by choosing where he fires an employee. First, the resort to \u201cconvenience\u201d as a justification for the rule in this case conflates forum non conveniens theory with the statutory venue provision.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> They are not based on similar principles \u2014 the latter being predicated on where the forum is <em>proper, </em>not convenient. Additionally, even if a defendant tries to control venue by firing the plaintiff from a place wholly unrelated to the actual place of employment, the plaintiffs remedy at <em>that </em>time is a motion for a change of venue based on forum non conveniens.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It is not this Court\u2019s duty to manufacture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>alternative forums as a matter of law merely because they would <em>also </em>be convenient to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">For these reasons, I would restrict venue solely to the place of the violation, as defined by where the <em>mens rea </em>and the <em>actus reus </em>converge, in accordance with the clear terms of the statute. To the extent that the majority interprets this state\u2019s civil rights laws in a way that prevents a putative plaintiffs claims from becoming actionable the moment a violation of the CRA occurs, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b219-6\">Corrigan, J., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\"> MCL 37.2801(2) (emphasis added).

I note, however, that these multiple locations are explicitly related to the <em>communication, and thus implementation, </em>of the discriminatory discharge, which is itself the violation of the statute. Regarding plaintiff Brandon Brightwell, though, there is a factual dispute about his location when defendant communicated the adverse employment decision to him. If, as defendant says is the case, Brightwell was at home in Oakland County and the phone call terminating his employment was also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>placed from Oakland County, then the statutory violation occurred completely in Oakland County, irrespective of the fact that Brightwell worked in Wayne County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b212-9\"> <em>Ante </em>at 165. This analysis is made even more confusing by the majority\u2019s admission that \u201cthe <em>actus reus </em>and the <em>mens rea </em>of a CRA violation converge when a defendant communicates a discriminatory decision to an employee\u201d and that this \u201cconvergence causes the CRA violation . . ..\u201d <em>This accepts precisely my stated formulation. </em>However the majority then states that \u201cit does not settle the issue of what constitutes discharging the employee: the communication of the discriminatory decision or removing the employee\u2019s right to work at his or her place of employment.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 162.1 fail to see why not. If, as the majority <em>admits, </em>the convergence causes a violation at the time of convergence and the statute specifically and plainly defines \u201cviolation\u201d as a \u201cdischarge,\u201d then the issue is settled: the discharge/violation occur at the point of communication of a discriminatory decision, which by definition, is <em>also </em>the same time as the employee\u2019s right to work has been removed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b213-6\"> See <em>ante </em>at 162 &amp; n 33. It is this failure that allows the majority simply to assert that this opinion\u2019s criticisms \u201cmiss[] the mark\u201d rather than address the substance of those criticisms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\"> <em>Ante </em>at 160.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b214-7\"> I agree with the majority that it is the <em>severance </em>of employment that amounts to a discriminatory discharge. <em>Ante </em>at 164. The CRA\u2019s venue provision only allows proper venue where the actual severance occurred, though, which need <em>not </em>necessarily be in the place where the employee worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">To advance its argument, the majority erroneously relies on this dissent\u2019s definition of \u201cdischarge,\u201d which again is commonly defined as \u201cto relieve of obligation, responsibility\u201d; \u201cto relieve or deprive of office, employment, etc.; dismiss from service.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 164-165 &amp; n 37. For our purposes, the relevant words here are the verbs \u201crelieve,\u201d \u201cdeprive,\u201d and \u201cdismiss\u201d because they add context to the statutory verb \u201cdischarge,\u201d which is the prohibited <em>act </em>relevant here. Thus, it can only be the actual communication, which itself implements a discriminatory decision, that amounts to the actual \u201cdischarge\u201d or relieving of, depriving of, or dismissing from employment. And, again, this <em>act </em>need not occur at the place of actual employment. Since, it is the very <em>act </em>of communicating a discriminatory discharge that constitutes a violation of the CRA, if that communication or implementation is not made at the workplace, then the workplace is not a proper venue for a CRA action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b214-9\"> Cf. <em>Rylott-Rooney v Alitalia-Linee Aeree Italiane-Societa Per </em>Azioni, 549 F Supp 2d 549, 554 (SD NY, 2008) (applying New York City\u2019s and New York State\u2019s human rights laws and making the distinction that \u201cwhen an employee is terminated in a location other than his workplace, the act of termination is the original tortious act. .. and the experience of being removed from employment is the original event causing injury,\u201d only the latter of \u201cwhich occurs at the employee\u2019s workplace\u201d). Notably, unlike New York City\u2019s and New York State\u2019s laws, Michigan\u2019s CRA provision provides venue <em>only </em>in the place of the original tortious act, <em>and not </em>in the place of injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b215-5\"> MCL 37.2801(2). Because plaintiffs asserted that venue was proper in Wayne County, a place where defendant neither resides nor has its principal place of business, this portion of the CRA\u2019s venue provision was not relevant to venue for this action, which instead turned on whether a violation of the CRA had occurred in Wayne County. However, this language is instructive for our purposes in determining how to interpret the disputed language relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Additionally, I do not subscribe, as the majority curiously implies, to the view that venue is limited to the places over which defendant has exclusive control. See <em>ante </em>at 166 n 39. This is an altogether odd argument that, to the best of my knowledge, has not been advanced by any party or justice, and certainly not by me, as such a construction would be contrary to the language of the statute. Indeed, my construction of the statute permits what the wording explicitly provides: venue is proper in the place of the violation (here, a discharge), regardless under whose control that place falls. Accordingly, venue exists where the Legislature has stated that venue should exist, and \u201cour judicial role \u2018precludes imposing different policy choices than those selected by the Legislature ....\u2019\u201d <em>Robertson v DaimlerChrysler Corp, </em>465 Mich 732, 759; 641 NW2d 567 (2002), quoting <em>People v Sobczak-Obetts, </em>463 Mich 687, 694; 625 NW2d 764 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b215-7\"> General rules of statutory construction support this position. \u201cMichigan has recognized the principal of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterious </em>[sic] \u2014 express mention in a statute of one thing implies the exclusion of other similar things.\u201d <em>Stowers v Wolodzko, </em>386 Mich 119, 133; 191 NW2d 355 (1971), citing <em>Dave\u2019s Place, Inc v Liquor Control Comm, </em>277 Mich 551; 269 NW 594 (1936), and <em>Sebewaing Indus, Inc v Village of Sebewaing, </em>337 Mich 530; 60 NW2d 444 (1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\"> The majority contends that \u201c[s]mee the Legislature intended the interpretation we ascribe to the language [regarding the terms \u2018discharge\u2019 and \u2018violation\u2019], there was no reason to expressly include an employee\u2019s place of employment as an alternative basis for venue.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 165 (emphasis added). There is no indication, however, that the Legislature intended the majority\u2019s broad construction that interprets \u201cviolation\u201d as something other than where the <em>actus reus </em>and the <em>mens rea </em>come together. Moreover, if the Legislature intended to give those terms the meanings I have fairly ascribed to them, it <em>would </em>have needed to include additional language regarding the plaintiffs place of employment as an additional venue. Thus, the majority\u2019s assertion in this regard only advances its argument if one accepts its underlying premise that an overly broad reading of the statutory terms is required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b216-8\"> See, e.g., MCL 600.1629.

Even though the student never set foot or worked in Wayne County, venue would nonetheless be proper in Wayne County under the majority\u2019s theory that Detroit would have been the place of employment and thus the employer \u201cremov[ed] the [potential] employee\u2019s right to work at his or her [never-established] place of employment.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 162.

If one were to adopt the majority\u2019s reasoning when interpreting this federal venue provision, the resulting construction would either render these alternative clauses redundant or render the latter clause surplusage because under the first clause, venue would always be proper in the place of potential employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\"> The Missouri Supreme Court has come to a similar conclusion. See <em>Igoe v Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Indus Relations, </em>152 SW3d 284, 288-289 (Mo, 2005). Using language that is nearly identical to Michigan\u2019s CRA, the venue provision of Missouri\u2019s Human Rights Act provides venue where the \u201cunlawful discriminatory practice is alleged to have occurred.\u201d The Missouri Supreme Court held that vacant positions in St. Louis to which plaintiff had applied did not establish St. Louis as a proper venue because \u201call of the acts \u2014 the receipt and review of applications, the interviews, and the decision making \u2014 all occurred\u201d in a separate county and thus no discriminatory practice had occurred in St. Louis. <em>Id. </em>at 288.

Moreover, when a statute makes clear where venue is proper, I am not sure why any argument that meets the low threshold of being \u201ccommon sense\u201d can vary this statutory determination. I believe that the Legislature\u2019s choice makes \u201csense\u201d \u2014 even if the majority would prefer another or an additional choice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"Aeg\"> This is the precise response and remedy to the hypothetical example posed in the majority opinion regarding an employer who fires a Wayne County employee while on retreat in the Upper Peninsula. See <em>ante </em>at 166 n 39. Indeed, the majority\u2019s hypothetical only reaffirms and <em>proves </em>my criticism that the majority improperly conflates forum non conveniens theory with venue rules. Similarly, the majority\u2019s alternative hypothetical example regarding an employee who is fired while at lunch in Canada again does nothing to disprove the reality that a statutory violation occurs when the <em>mens rea </em>and the <em>actus reus </em>converge. In such a case, the CRA venue provision provides <em>alternative </em>venues to ensure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>that the plaintiff would have <em>a </em>Michigan forum in which to litigate his claim. See MCL 37.2801(2). And again, this forum may be relocated if it is determined to be inconvenient pursuant to forum non conveniens theory.</p>\n<p id=\"AcN\">Moreover, the mere fact that one can conceive of an exceptional hypothetical case does not mean that we should rewrite the general rule contrary to the plain meaning of the statute. I note that most cases will likely not implicate the distinction drawn between these opinions because many, if not most, employment violations occur at a person\u2019s place of employment. Thus, my interpretation of the venue provision does <em>not </em>lead to a situation that is contrary to common sense, that would deprive the parties of a convenient forum, or that will work a hardship against prosecuting potential CRA violations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b219-7\">WEAVER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-z\">odissenting).
