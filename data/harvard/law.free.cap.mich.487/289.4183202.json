We hold that MCL 600.5821(4) exempts the state entities it lists from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>one-year-back rule. As a consequence, we overrule <em>Liptow v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which held to the contrary, and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. We also overrule <em>Cameron v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>on which the <em>Liptow </em>decision relied exclusively in reaching its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Nicholas Morgan was severely injured in an automobile accident in March 2000. He was treated at the University of Michigan Health System for six days. Less than one year after the accident, Morgan sought personal protection insurance benefits through the Michigan Assigned Claims Facility (MACF). Because he was not covered under a no-fault insurance policy, the MACF designated Titan Insurance Company as the servicing insurer for his claims. In January 2006, the University of Michigan Health System and the university\u2019s regents filed this lawsuit against Titan, seeking payment from defendant for Morgan\u2019s medical treatment. Plaintiffs sought reimbursement of the full cost of Morgan\u2019s hospitalization, which they alleged was $69,957.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Defendant moved for summary disposition, arguing that the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> barred plaintiffs from recovering the claimed damages. Plaintiffs countered that MCL 600.5821(4)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> allows the state and its political subdivisions to file suit without limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>tion and entirely supersedes MCL 500.3145(1). They asserted that MCL 600.5821(4) exempts certain suits brought by public entities from \u201cthe statute of limitations\u201d and allows initiation of such actions \u201cat any time without limitation, the provisions of any statute notwithstanding.\u201d The trial court agreed with defendant and dismissed the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed in a divided decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The majority concluded that, under MCR 7.215(J)(1), it was bound to follow the <em>Liptow </em>decision and uphold the trial court. Judge DAVIS agreed that <em>Liptow </em>was controlling, but opined that it had been wrongly decided and that the Court should convene a conflict panel pursuant to MCR 7.215(J)(2) and (3). Initially, we denied leave to appeal,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but on reconsideration, we vacated the denial order, granted reconsideration, and granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">MCL 600.5851(1) \u2014 THE MINORITY/INSANITY PROVISION</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">An analysis of this Court\u2019s rulings on the issues implicated in this case naturally begins with <em>Lambert v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Calhoun,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Lambert </em>held that MCL 600.5851(1)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> preserves a claim by a minor or incompetent person even though the statute of limitations in the act under which the claim is brought bars the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Four years later, the Court of Appeals in <em>Rawlins v Aetna Cas &amp; Surety Co </em>followed <em>Lambert.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It held that MCL 600.5851(1) preserves a no-fault claim by a minor even though it would otherwise be barred by the limitations period in the no-fault act.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Shortly after, in <em>Geiger v Detroit Auto Inter-Ins Exch,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court of Appeals held that MCL 600.5851(1) preserves a claim by a minor or incompetent person for personal protection insurance benefits even though it would otherwise be barred by the one-year-back rule. <em>Geiger </em>remained the prevailing law in this state for the next 24 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\"><em>CAMERON </em>AND <em>LIPTOW</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In 2006, in <em>Cameron, </em>this Court overruled <em>Geiger </em>in a 4 to 3 decision. The majority held that the minority/insanity provision in MCL 600.5851(1) did not remove the plaintiffs claim from application of the one-year-back rule. The analysis stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>By its unambiguous terms, MCL 600.5851(1) concerns when a minor or person suffering from insanity may \u201cmake the entry or bring the action.\u201d It does not pertain to the damages recoverable once an action has been brought. MCL 600.5851(1) then is irrelevant to the damages-limiting one-year-back provision of MCL 500.3145(1). Thus, to be clear, the minority/insanity tolling provision in MCL 600.5851(1) does not operate to toll the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(l).<footnotemark>[12]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Accordingly, the majority held that a statute governing when a party may bring an action does not affect the damages recoverable under the one-year-back rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">In <em>Liptow, </em>the Court of Appeals examined the interplay of the one-year-back rule and MCL 600.5821(4). Relying solely on <em>Cameron, </em>it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">Thus, the pertinent question is whether the damages-limiting portion of MCL 500.3145(1), the one-year-back rule, limits the [claimant\u2019s] recovery. This Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Univ of Michigan Regents </em>[v <em>State Farm Mut Ins Co, </em>250 Mich App 719, 733; 650 NW2d 129 (2002)] is of no assistance in this determination. The issue appears to be one of first impression.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">MCL 600.5821(4) provides that actions brought by the state or its subdivisions to recover the cost of maintenance, care, and treatment of persons in state institutions \u201care not subject to the statute of limitations and may be brought at any time without limitation, the provisions of any statute notwithstanding.\u201d We conclude that, by the plain import of this language, the Legislature intended to exempt the state from statutes of limitations when bringing an action to recover public funds. The language refers to statutes of limitations and provides that an action may be brought at any time. But the statute does not address damage limitation provisions or any other limiting provisions. In other words, like the minority tolling provision, MCL 600.5821(4) concerns the <em>time </em>during which the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>may bring an action; it \u201cdoes not pertain to the damages recoverable once an action has been brought.\u201d <em>Cameron, supra, </em>476 Mich at 62. Accordingly, we conclude that MCL 600.5821(4), like the minority tolling provision of MCL 600.5851(1), does not operate to toll the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1). <em>Cameron, supra, </em>476 Mich at 61-62. Therefore, we hold that defendant is liable to the [claimant] only for costs it incurred for [the patient\u2019s] care, maintenance, and treatment in state institutions within one year before the filing of the complaint.<footnotemark>[13]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">This case presents questions of statutory interpretation that are reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">No party disputes that MCL 600.5821(4) preserves plaintiffs\u2019 right to bring the instant cause of action. The question before us is whether MCL 500.3145(1) restricts plaintiffs\u2019 recovery to damages incurred one year before plaintiffs filed suit. The answer turns on the correct understanding of the interaction between MCL 500.3145(1) and MCL 600.5821(4). It is undisputed that all of plaintiffs\u2019 costs were incurred between March 18 and March 23, 2000. Thus, if the one-year-back rule applies to their claim, plaintiffs are entitled to no damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Defendant relies on <em>Liptow, </em>which held that the one-year-back rule governs actions to which MCL 600.5821(4) applies because that statute does not exempt state entities from its limitation on damages. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Defendant\u2019s argument and the holding in <em>Liptow </em>rest on a fundamentally incorrect premise. <em>Liptow </em>reasoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>that (1) MCL 600.5821(4) exempts state entities from any statute of limitations, (2) the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1) is not a statute of limitations, but a damages limitation, and therefore (3) MCL 600.5821(4) does not exempt a governmental entity from the one-year-back-rule of MCL 500.3145(1).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This premise is derived from our decision in <em>Cameron. </em>Therefore, we are required to revisit <em>Cameron\u2019s </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The <em>Cameron </em>majority concluded that actions brought pursuant to MCL 600.5851(1) are subject to the one-year-back rule because that statute does not implicate when a plaintiff may \u201cbring an action.\u201d We conclude that the statutory language in MCL 600.5851(1) and MCL 500.3145(1) does not command the conclusion that the <em>Cameron </em>majority reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">To begin with, we conclude that the approach in <em>Cameron </em>was flawed because it read the statutory language in isolation. MCL 600.5851(1) does not create its own independent cause of action. It must be read together with the statute under which the plaintiff seeks to recover. In no-fault cases, for example, MCL 600.5851(1) must be read together with MCL 500.3145(1). Doing so, the statutes grant infants and incompetent persons one year after their disability is removed to \u201cbring the action\u201d \u201cfor recovery of personal protection insurance benefits . . . for accidental bodily injury. . . .\u201d On the basis of its language, MCL 600.5851(1) supersedes all limitations in MCL 500.3145(1), including the one-year-back rule\u2019s limitation on the period of recovery.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>For what purpose might a plaintiff \u201cbring an action\u201d? Surely not for the sole satisfaction of filing papers in court. A plaintiff brings a tort action to recover damages. Although the right to bring an action would be a hollow one indeed if a plaintiff could not recover damages, <em>Cameron </em>and <em>Liptow </em>limited a plaintiff to just that hollow right. Therefore, we restore the proper understanding of the interaction between MCL 600.5851(1) and the one-year-back rule. We hold that the \u201caction\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d preserved by MCL 600.5851(1) include the right to collect damages. As Justice CAVANAGH explained in his dissenting opinion in <em>Cameron,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">[t]he word \u201cclaim\u201d has been discussed by this Court many times over the past century. For instance, in <em>Allen v Bd of State Auditors, </em>122 Mich 324; 81 NW 113 (1899), this Court noted the following definition of the word \u201cclaim\u201d: \u201c \u2018[A] demand of a right or alleged right; a calling on another for something due or asserted to be due; as, a claim of wages for services.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328, citing <em>Cent Dict. </em>In <em>In re Chamberlain\u2019s Estate, </em>298 Mich 278; 299 NW 82 (1941), this Court explained that \u201c \u2018[t]he word \u201cclaims\u201d is \u201cby authorities generally construed as referring to demands of a pecuniary nature and which could have been enforced against the deceased in his lifetime.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285, quoting <em>In re Quinney\u2019s Estate, </em>287 Mich 329, 333; 283 NW 599 (1939), quoting <em>Knutsen v Krook, </em>111 Minn 352, 357; 127 NW 11 (1910). More recently, in <em>CAM Constr v Lake Edgewood Condo Ass\u2019n, </em>465 Mich 549, 554-555; 640 NW2d 256 (2002), this Court set forth the legal definitions of the term:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">\u201c T.

The statute at issue in this case, MCL 600.5821(4), also addresses \u201c[a]ctions.\u201d Specifically, it preserves actions brought by state entities. It also explicitly delineates that the action contemplated is one brought for the recovery for certain costs incurred. MCL 600.5821(4) lists the costs as those for the \u201cmaintenance, care, and treatment of persons in hospitals, homes, schools, and other state institutions . .. .\u201d Thus, it is apparent from the language of the statute that the Legislature intended to preserve more than the state entities\u2019 right to file papers in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Moreover, this Court\u2019s caselaw predating <em>Cameron </em>also does not support the <em>Cameron </em>majority\u2019s holding. The only authority cited for <em>Cameron\u2019s </em>interpretation was in Justice MARKMAN\u2019S concurring opinion, which relied on dicta from Justice BRICKLEY\u2019s lead opinion in <em>Howard v Gen Motors Corp.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">In <em>Howard, </em>two justices analyzed the one-year-back rule in the workers\u2019 compensation act to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>whether it was a jurisdictional affirmative defense akin to a statute of limitations. Justice BRICKLEY concluded that \u201cthe \u2018statute of limitations\u2019 interpretation of the one-year-back rule offered in <em>Kleinschrodt</em><footnotemark><em>[19]</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and applied to the two-year-back rule in <em>Kingery</em><footnotemark><em>[20]</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Howard </em>[in the Court of Appeals] contradicts our earlier precedent on the subject as well as the plain language of the statutes.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> By contrast, in <em>Kleinschrodt, </em>five justices stated that \u201c[w]e are of the opinion that the one-year-back provision is a defense, akin to the statute of limitations . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">In sum, for more than 20 years before <em>Cameron, </em>the majority in all of the Court\u2019s relevant opinions saw no basis for treating any of the provisions of MCL 500.3145(1) differently. In <em>Welton v Carriers Ins Co, </em>we made a distinction among the provisions only to the extent of noting that the section contains \u201ctwo limitations on time of suit and one limitation on period of recovery[.]\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Even then, the <em>Welton </em>Court saw no basis for treating the provisions differently.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Indeed, the law was so well settled that the defendants in <em>Cameron </em>did not even argue for different treatment until this Court heard oral argument on appeal.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Thus, we conclude that <em>Cameron </em>erroneously held that MCL 600.5851(1) does not protect a plaintiffs claim from the one-year-back rule. We also hold that this understanding of the interaction between the statutes is equally applicable to the interaction between MCL 600.5821(4) and MCL 500.3145(1). Therefore, the provisions of MCL 600.5821(4) preserving a plaintiffs right to bring an action also preserve the plaintiffs right to recover damages incurred more than one year before suit is filed. The one-year-back rule in MCL 500.3145(1) is inapplicable to such claims.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">STARE DECISIS<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">For the aforementioned reasons, we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number><em>Cameron </em>was wrongly decided. However, despite the fact that a previous decision was wrongly decided, we must be mindful of the doctrine of stare decisis when deciding whether to overrule it.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Our analysis always begins with a presumption that upholding precedent is the preferred course of action.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> That presumption should be retained until effectively rebutted by the conclusion that a compelling justification exists to overturn it.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Nonetheless, when analyzing precedent that itself represents a recent departure from established caselaw, we apply a decreased presumption in favor of upholding precedent.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">In determining whether a compelling justification exists to overturn precedent, the Court may consider numerous evaluative criteria, none of which, standing alone, is dispositive. Historically, courts have considered (1) whether the precedent has proved to be intolerable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>because it defies practical workability, (2) whether reliance on it is such that overruling it would cause a special hardship and inequity, (3) whether related principles of law have so far developed since the precedent was pronounced that no more than a remnant of it has survived, (4) whether facts and circumstances have so changed, or come to be seen so differently, as to have robbed the precedent of significant application or justification, (5) whether other jurisdictions have decided similar issues in a different manner, (6) whether upholding the precedent is likely to result in serious detriment prejudicial to public interests, and (7) whether the prior decision was an abrupt and largely unexplained departure from then existing precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">These factors may or may not be applicable in a given case. Nor is there a magic number of factors that must favor overruling a case in order to establish the requisite compelling justification. Rather, this conclusion should be reached on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Here, we first consider whether <em>Cameron </em>has proved intolerable because it defies practical workability. Indeed it does. <em>Cameron </em>left MCL 600.5851(1) and similar provisions void of effect in many cases while ostensibly protecting an injured party\u2019s right to file suit. This created an indefensible paradox and, as such, an unworkable and confusing legal landscape. Consider, for example, the hypothetical case of a boy injured in a car accident at age 12 and fully recovered by age 15. Upon reaching 18, he retains an attorney to file suit to recover the costs associated with the treatment of his injuries, relying on MCL 600.5851(1). The defendant also retains counsel, who responds by filing a motion to dismiss, arguing that none of the plaintiffs damages are recoverable. The trial court parses the parties\u2019 filings and determines that none of the plaintiffs costs were incurred in the year before suit was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Under <em>Cameron, </em>the plaintiff in this hypothetical case was indisputably entitled to file suit, because MCL 600.5851(1) preserved his right to do so. Yet <em>Cameron </em>gutted his suit of any practical worth because, under its interpretation of MCL 600.5851(1), the plaintiff had no chance to recover any damages. Thus, the plaintiff was denied the legal recourse the Legislature provided him, which is, after reaching his majority, to recover the damages he incurred more than a year earlier. Accordingly, we conclude that <em>Cameron </em>is frequently innately unworkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Second, we consider whether reliance interests weigh in favor of overruling <em>Cameron, </em>We conclude that they do. <em>Cameron </em>is of recent vintage, having been decided a mere four years ago. Hence, reliance on its holding has been of limited duration. Moreover, <em>Cameron </em>represented a sea change in one area of the law and toppled settled interpretations of the no-fault act that had existed almost since the adoption of MCL 600.5851.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In doing so, <em>Cameron </em>disrupted the reliance interests of the injured minors and the incompetents who relied on its provisions to preserve their claims until removal of their disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">We recognize that there exists a competing reliance interest in the continuing validity of Cameron: that of the defendants in no-fault cases. Yet <em>Cameron\u2019s </em>evisceration of the crux of a plaintiffs claim \u2014 the potential to recover damages \u2014 effectively removed altogether the incentive to file suit as permitted by MCL 600.5851(1). We conclude that, while no-fault defendants\u2019 reliance on this interpretation is reasonable, it is not itself sufficient to preclude overruling <em>Cameron </em>given the extent of <em>Cameron\u2019s </em>prejudice to no-fault plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Third, we consider whether related principles of law have developed since <em>Cameron\u2019s </em>interpretation of MCL 600.5851(1) was pronounced. This factor is inapplicable to our stare decisis analysis in this case, as we are aware of no intervening change in the law that further supports or undermines <em>Cameron\u2019s </em>continuing legitimacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Fourth, we examine whether facts and circumstances have so changed, or have come to be seen so differently, that <em>Cameron </em>has been robbed of significant justification. Like the previous factor, we discern no factual or circumstantial changes that counsel for or against overruling <em>Cameron. </em>Therefore, this factor also is inapplicable to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Fifth, we consider whether other jurisdictions have decided similar issues in a different manner. This factor is likewise inapplicable to our stare decisis analysis. Michigan\u2019s comprehensive no-fault insurance scheme is unique to our state. While other states share the fundamental underpinnings of our system, judicial interpretations of the no-fault act have evolved independently of those of other states with similar insurance schemes. Thus, other jurisdictions\u2019 interpretations of similar statutes are unhelpful to our analysis in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Sixth, we examine whether upholding <em>Cameron </em>is likely to result in serious detriment prejudicial to public interests. We conclude that this factor weighs heavily in favor of overruling <em>Cameron. Cameron </em>drastically curtailed the protection provided by the Legislature for minors and incompetents. In enacting MCL 600.5851(1), the Legislature conveyed its intention to protect individuals in those groups with unique treatment under the law. The statute represents the culmination of the Legislature\u2019s deliberative process. <em>Cameron </em>undermined the Legislature\u2019s decision to provide a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\u201cyear of grace\u201d to infants and incompetents in recognition of their inability to legally act until their disabilities are removed.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Moreover, <em>Cameron </em>set an ironic trap for minors and incompetents. As Justice CAVANAGH astutely noted in dissent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">[I]f a person is injured in a motor vehicle accident while an infant or legally incompetent, and his injuries resolve a year or more before his disability resolves, then <em>\\Cam</em>eron\u2019s] interpretation of MCL 500.3145(1) will completely preclude that person from recovering <em>any </em>of the damages incurred from the accident, and, thus completely abrogate his claim.<footnotemark>[34]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Thus, what the Legislature intended as a provision to preserve a plaintiffs claims, <em>Cameron </em>rendered largely meaningless. In certain circumstances, <em>Cameron\u2019s </em>interpretation of the saving provision actually operates to extinguish a claim, not save it.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Finally, we consider whether <em>Cameron </em>represented an abrupt and largely unexplained departure from precedent. We conclude that this factor also weighs heavily in favor of overruling <em>Cameron. Cameron </em>overruled <em>Geiger,</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a Court of Appeals case interpreting the interplay between the saving provision and the no-fault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>act. <em>Geiger </em>was decided in 1982 and stood as the seminal interpretation of the one-year-back rule until <em>Cameron </em>unexpectedly swept it aside 24 years later.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Furthermore, as noted, a majority of this Court had concluded before <em>Cameron </em>that the one-year-back rule does not apply to claims preserved by tolling. We made this decision even though in <em>Welton </em>we described the provisions of MCL 500.3145(1) as \u201ctwo limitations on time of suit and one limitation on period of recovery[.]\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> To the extent that <em>Cameron </em>held otherwise, it also implicitly overruled <em>Welton. </em>Thus, we are firmly convinced that <em>Cameron </em>represented an abrupt and largely unexplained departure from precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">In summary, <em>Cameron </em>is often unworkable, has not engendered valid reliance interests, has caused serious detriment prejudicial to public interests, and represented an abrupt and largely unexplained departure from precedent. Accordingly, we conclude that a compelling justification exists for overruling it.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">We overrule our decision in <em>Cameron </em>and the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Liptow. </em>Entities listed in MCL 600.5821(4) may bring an action and recover costs notwithstanding the limiting provisions of MCL 500.3145(1), including the one-year-back rule.

Not only have our positions been put forth without vitriol and ad hominem innuendos, there has been no pretense about them.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">Nor do we simply ignore precedent with which we disagree, as Justice Young once again asserts. It appears that he intends to repeat himself using an identical attack in each and every case in which I vote for a different result than he does.

Post </em>at 337. To be clear, we conclude that it is appropriate to overrule <em>Cameron </em>because it was wrongly decided and stare decisis considerations do not support retaining it. Thus, weighing the merits of overruling <em>Cameron </em>vis-a-vis overriding <em>Geiger, </em>an analysis that his dissent engages in, <em>post </em>at 337-338, is not necessary to our analysis. He also claims that our decision to overrule <em>Cameron </em>makes the caselaw of our state less consistent with the intentions of the Legislature. <em>Post </em>at 338.

By holding that the one-year-back rule was a period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>limitations, the <em>Cameron </em>majority failed to \u201cgive meaning to the actual text of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">In addition to the lack of restraint of the <em>Cameron </em>majority\u2019s use of the judicial power of interpretation, Chief Justice Kelly\u2019s majority opinion in this case shows that the <em>Cameron </em>majority failed to exercise common sense and fairness. As noted in Chief Justice Kelly\u2019s majority opinion in this case, <em>Cameron </em>resulted in the Legislature\u2019s saving provisions regarding minors and governmental entities becoming hollow rights when injuries occurred more than a year before a lawsuit was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">On the subject of stare decisis, Justice Young\u2019s dissent in this case attempts to deceive the public.

With respect to myself, the dissent quotes a statement I made in response to the improper and unfair dismantling of decades of longstanding insurance contract law by the former \u201cmajority of four\u201d in <em>Devillers v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>473 Mich 562; 702 NW2d 539 (2005).

The case has not been made why the Court should not adhere to the doctrine of stare decisis <em>in this case.\u201d Id. </em>at 622 (WEAVER, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Justice Young\u2019s dissent uses my <em>Devillers </em>statement in what appears to be an attempt to try to get people to believe that I have somehow changed my view of stare decisis since former Chief Justice TAYLOR was defeated. The dissent\u2019s misleading assertions are simply incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">My <em>Devillers </em>statement itself shows that I was criticizing the disregard for stare decisis in that <em>specific case. </em>My <em>Devillers </em>statement is an example of my service to the rule of law and a partial expression of my view of the policy of stare decisis, which is that past precedent should generally be followed but that, in deciding whether wrongly decided precedent should be overruled, each case should be looked at individually on its facts and merits through the lens of judicial restraint, common sense, and fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Justice Young\u2019s dissent cannot point to a statement where I professed some sort of position regarding stare decisis as an immutable doctrine because I have not taken that position and therefore have made no such statements.

[Young, <em>A judicial traditionalist confronts the common law, </em>8 Texas Rev L &amp; Pol 299, 301-302 (2004).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b353-7\"> Over the past decade, the principal tool used by this Court to decide when a precedent should be overruled is the set of guidelines that was laid out in <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439, 463; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), an opinion written by former Justice Taylor that Justices Corrigan, Young, Markman, and I signed, and that I have used numerous times. By no means do I consider the <em>Robinson </em>guidelines a \u201cbe-all, end-all test\u201d that constitutes precedent of this Court to be used whenever this Court considers overruling precedent. I view <em>Robinson </em>as merely providing guidelines to assist this Court in its legal analysis when pertinent. I note that my position in <em>Devillers </em>is in no way inconsistent with my position on stare decisis in this case, nor is it inconsistent with any position on stare decisis that I have taken in other cases, such as <em>Robinson. Devillers </em>involved the \u201cmajority of four\u201d overruling precedent involving contract interpretation from a case that was nearly twenty (20) years old. In my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number><em>Devillers </em>dissent, I noted that I agreed with the majority\u2019s interpretation that the old precedent was incorrect, but given the passage of time since that specific precedent was decided, the Court should not disturb that longstanding precedent because the law had become so ingrained that to overrule it would harm the reliance interests of parties in insurance cases. My position in <em>Devillers </em>was entirely consistent with the reliance prong of the <em>Robinson </em>guidelines. My position in the instant case is also consistent with the reliance prong of the <em>Robinson </em>guidelines since <em>Cameron, </em>the case which is now being overruled, was only decided four (4) years ago.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b354-7\">HATHAWAY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1m\">(concurring). I fully concur with Chief Justice KELLY\u2019s analysis and conclusion in this matter and support overruling <em>Cameron v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>476 Mich 55; 718 NW2d 784 (2006). I also fully concur with Justice Weaver\u2019s stare decisis analysis in her concurring opinion. I write separately to express my own thoughts on the doctrine of stare decisis.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Given the debate amongst the justices of this Court concerning what constitutes the proper stare decisis analysis, I find it insightful to review how our United States Supreme Court has treated the doctrine. Stare decisis is a principle of policy that commands judicial respect for a court\u2019s earlier decisions and the rules of law that they embody. See <em>Harris v United States, </em>536 US 545, 556-557; 122 S Ct 2406; 153 L Ed 2d 524 (2002); <em>Helvering v Hallock, </em>309 US 106, 119; 60 S Ct 444; 84 L Ed 604 (1940). <em>\u201cStare decisis </em>is the preferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Payne v Tennessee, </em>501 US 808, 827; 111 S Ct 2597; 115 L Ed 2d 720 (1991). However, when balancing the need to depart from precedent with the need to adhere to established precedent, it is important to bear in mind that stare decisis is neither an \u201cinexorable command,\u201d <em>Lawrence v Texas, </em>539 US 558, 577; 123 S Ct 2472; 156 L Ed 2d 508 (2003), nor \u201ca mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision,\u201d <em>Helvering, </em>309 US at 119. \u201cIf it were, <em>segregation would be legal, minimum wage laws would be unconstitutional, and the Government could wiretap ordinary criminal suspects without first obtaining warrants. </em>See <em>Plessy </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>163 U. S. 537 [16 S Ct 1138; 41 L Ed 256] (1896), overruled by <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>347 U. S. 483 [74 S Ct 686; 98 L Ed 873] (1954); <em>Adkins </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hospital of D. C, </em>261 U. S. 525 [43 S Ct 394; 67 L Ed 785] (1923), overruled by <em>West Coast Hotel Co. </em>v. <em>Parrish, </em>300 U. S. 379 [57 S Ct 578; 81 L Ed 703] (1937); <em>Olmstead </em>v. <em>United States, </em>277 U. S. 438 [48 S Ct 564; 72 L Ed 944] (1928), overruled by <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U. S. 347 [88 S Ct 507; 19 L Ed 2d 576] (1967).\u201d <em>Citizens United v Fed Election Comm, </em>558 US _, _; 130 S Ct 876, 920; 175 L Ed 2d 753, 806 (2010) (Roberts, C.J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">I too believe that stare decisis is a principle of policy. As stated in <em>Helvering-.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">We recognize that <em>stare decisis </em>embodies an important social policy. It represents an element of continuity in law, and is rooted in the psychologic need to satisfy reasonable expectations. But <em>stare decisis </em>is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such adher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>ence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experiencep<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">I do not agree with any approach to stare decisis that suggests or implies that it is a \u201crule\u201d or \u201claw\u201d subject to a particularized test to be used in all circumstances. Any particular approach to stare decisis, such as the one taken in <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), is not \u201claw\u201d or \u201cestablished precedent\u201d that would require us to overrule, reject, or modify its analysis. The <em>Robinson </em>approach to stare decisis, just as the one taken in <em>Petersen v Magna Corp, </em>484 Mich 300; 773 NW2d 564 (2009), is one among many varying approaches, and no particular approach, in and of itself, is inherently superior to another. As with any policy determination, the approach taken in any given case will depend on the facts and circumstances presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Historically, the United States Supreme Court has utilized many different approaches to stare decisis, including such approaches as those involving a \u201ccompelling justification,\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cspecial justification,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a determination that a case was \u201cwrongly decided.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Each of these approaches is valid and offers a different nuance to stare decisis consideration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, because stare decisis is a policy consideration, which must be considered on a case-by-case basis, the particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>analytical approach will differ from case to case. Most importantly, the critical analysis should be on the rationale regarding whether or not to change precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">It is also worthy to note that not only has the United States Supreme Court historically not taken one single approach to the application of stare decisis, the Court has not felt compelled to discuss stare decisis in all cases when precedent is being overturned. Many landmark cases that overruled well-established precedent did not discuss or even mention the phrase \u201cstare decisis.\u201d For example, <em>Brown </em>overruled <em>Plessy, </em>thereby ending segregation in our public schools, without mentioning the phrase \u201cstare decisis,\u201d much less articulating and following a particularized test. Similarly, <em>Gideon v Wainwright, </em>372 US 335; 83 S Ct 792; 9 L Ed 2d 799 (1963), which established the rights of indigents to have counsel in all criminal cases, not merely capital offenses, overruled <em>Betts v Brady, </em>316 US 455; 62 S Ct 1252; 86 L Ed 1595 (1942), again without mentioning \u201cstare decisis\u201d or a particularized test. Instead, both of these cases focused on the important policy considerations that weighed in favor of overruling precedent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">With these principles in mind, any analysis of the impact of stare decisis must focus on the individual case and the reason for overruling precedent. Thus, the reasons for overruling <em>Cameron </em>are paramount to any articulated test and the special and compelling justifications to do so are overwhelming in this case. As I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>agree with the well-articulated reasons expressed by Chief Justice KELLY, I will not repeat them here.</p>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\">1 <em>Helvering, </em>309 US at 119.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b356-9\"> See <em>14 Penn Plaza LLC v Pyett, </em>556 US 247, 280; 129 S Ct 1456; 173 L Ed 2d 398 (2009) (Souter, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b356-10\"> <em>Arizona v Rumsey, </em>467 US 203, 212; 104 S Ct 2305; 81 L Ed 2d 164 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b356-11\"> <em>Seminole Tribe of Florida v Florida, </em>517 US 44, 66; 116 S Ct 1114; 134 L Ed 2d 252 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b356-12\"> Any of these approaches to stare decisis can be valid depending on the issues before the court.

I authored the majority opinion in this case and therefore join it in its entirety. I write separately because Justices YOUNG and CORRIGAN continue to misleadingly refer to a statement I made off the bench nearly two years ago that was published by the <em>Detroit Free Press.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>They seem to believe that this statement provides them insight into my motivation for voting as I have in every subsequent case that has come before the Court. They are manifestly incorrect.

His dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>senting opinion demonstrates that my efforts in the area of civility have not yet been as successful as I hoped.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Written opinions serve an important function in the judicial process: they provide a forum in which the majority and dissenting justices debate the legal issues raised in cases. Sometimes that debate focuses on a narrow question. Other times, the debate extends to broader legal questions with wider implications, such as the doctrine of stare decisis, a particularly controversial matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">It is no secret that the philosophical divisions among the justices on this Court are deep. For some years now, our disagreements on legal questions have erupted in occasionally heated and unpleasant personal recriminations. This case is a perfect example.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">I know that, if asked, both Justices YOUNG and CORRIGAN would agree with my sentiments and would deplore these outbursts. Both justices fully understand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>that personal recriminations reduce the public\u2019s confidence in the objectivity and wisdom of judges and in the Court as an institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">With these reflections in mind, I urge them to reevaluate the utility of their ad hominem attacks and eliminate them. Surely each has significant confidence in the strength of their legal arguments to allow those arguments to stand on their merits, absent distracting attack props. Moreover, their personal assaults do nothing to resolve the legal issues before us; they do not benefit the parties to a case or the citizens of Michigan whom we serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">I sincerely regret having to address these matters in the first place and would prefer that this opinion were not necessary. But I cannot stand passively by and allow Justices YOUNG and CORRIGAN to accuse me and the justices in the \u201cnew majority\u201d of being unprincipled and driven by inappropriate motives. Their attacks wrongly accuse Justices CAVANAGH, WEAVER, HATHAWAY, and me of reaching predetermined outcomes in many, if not all, cases rather than following the law, as we are sworn to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">People respect the judiciary only insofar as they believe that judges decide cases impartially and without ulterior motives. Justices YOUNG\u2019S and CORRIGAN\u2019s assertions in this and previous cases that we have an \u201cagenda\u201d that involves selecting and overturning certain precedents is unfair and untrue. Furthermore, it undermines respect both for the justices attacked and for those making the unwarranted accusations. Most importantly, it reduces public confidence in the judiciary as a whole.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-5\"> <em>Post </em>at 322-323.

This process produces a result whereby the parties and the public will never know what criteria or standards several justices on this Court will employ until <em>after </em>the decision has been made. This ad hoc, subjective process is the very antithesis of the \u201crule of law\u201d and instead denotes a system hijacked by the concurring justices, who appear to be guided and constrained only by their personal beliefs. That stare decisis is a \u201cprinciple of policy,\u201d as Justice HATHAWAY repeats many times, does <em>not </em>mean that analysis of a case pursuant to the doctrine should be driven by each judge\u2019s <em>personal policy choices.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Nor does the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>stare decisis is a \u201cprinciple of policy\u201d mean that judges need not announce a fixed set of principles that will guide their decisions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Yet this is precisely what char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>acterizes Justices WEAVER and HATHAWAY\u2019s unique brand of feckless jurisprudence announced today.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">The rule of law, by definition, requires judges to decide cases on the basis of principles, announced in advance, rather than on a personal or subjective preference for or against a party before them. This ensures stability in the law despite the diversity of judges\u2019 personal beliefs. Whether we, as judges, \u201clike\u201d the outcome is, quite simply, <em>irrelevant </em>to whether it reflects a correct conclusion of law. It is harrowing that Justices WEAVER and HATHAWAY either do not understand this concept or refuse to subscribe to it, preferring to base their decisions on subjective \u201cpolicy consideration^]. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Finally, Chief Justice KELLY has tried on several occasions to explain away what she meant when she said the \u201cnew majority\u201d would \u201cundo . . . the damage [of] the Republican-dominated court,\u201d as she again attempts today. Chief Justice KELLY finds it disquieting that I quote her remarks about the \u201cnew majority\u2019s\u201d agenda. She should. Her remarks <em>are </em>as disquieting as they are scurrilous. What is noteworthy is that Chief Justice Kelly has never repudiated what she said, apologized for it, or sufficiently explained why that statement doesn\u2019t mean what it plainly says. Instead, she merely prefers that I not repeat it for reasons that are obvious to all. Rare is it that a judge publicly tells the public that she has an agenda and what it is. I am glad that the Chief Justice was so candid because everyone can examine her conduct in light of her statement. Her motivations for making this dreadful remark and whether her subsequent resolution of cases is consistent with her remark are questions for the public to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Moreover, after being the target of much arccivil criticism by then Justice KELLY over the years, I am nonplussed by the Chief Justice\u2019s pique at the passion of my dissent and the tone in which I have expressed it.

Given the context that this remark was made just after the defeat of Chief Justice TAYLOR in the last election, Chief Justice Kelly\u2019s final comment that \u201cwe will not sleep on the bench\u201d was a particularly uncivil reference denigrating our distinguished former colleague.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Chief Justice KELLY was present during the arguments of the case in which it was falsely asserted that Chief Justice TAYLOR fell asleep, and she knew, or should have known, that the claim was false. These facts are impossible to square with her current desire to improve civility among members of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>The public should be just as indignant as I am \u2014 not only regarding the hypocrisy of the new majority\u2019s radically changing views on the question of preserving precedents, but also with its equally radically subjective approach to the law. I will continue to strive to bring such issues to the public\u2019s attention. The public may judge whether the former majority\u2019s or this new majority\u2019s opinions provided greater predictability in the law and were more faithful to the actual language of the statutes, or whether the legislative \u201cwork product\u201d was disregarded for the pet policies of the several justices who formed these respective majorities. Indeed, in a constitutional republic where judges are elected, it is the obligation of the public to do just that. Otherwise, for the foreseeable future, the public can look forward to more \u201cdamage control\u201d in the form of brash judicial activism from the new majority.</p>\n<judges id=\"b370-6\">Corrigan, J., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-7\"> 487 US 654, 712; 108 S Ct 2597; 101 L Ed 2d 569 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\"> \u201cNew majority\u201d is the self-description selected by Chief Justice Kelly.

See <em>Rowland, </em>477 Mich at 223-247 (Markman, J., concurring). His conclusions demonstrate quite the opposite: that while we did, in fact, overrule some prior cases, those precedents had either failed to follow even more established precedents from this Court or failed to accord the appropriate and text-based meaning to the words of this state\u2019s statutes or constitution. Moreover, we specifically set forth a test explaining the explicit standards by which a case would be reviewed in determining whether overruling it would be appropriate. See <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439; 613 NW2d 307 (2000).

As any student of the law can explain, her theory represents the precise <em>opposite </em>principle that governs courts in a society based on the rule of law. Judges serve an important yet <em>limited </em>role in a constitutional republic. Not being of the policy-making branches of government, they should never base their decisions on their own subjective policy beliefs. If nothing else, Justice Hathaway\u2019s admission that she is making her own personal \u201cpolicy determination]\u00bb\u201d in cases at least provides a view into what has driven many of the decisions produced by the new majority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b366-7\"> My criticism of Justice Weaver\u2019s approach is not, as she alleges, that she has subscribed to a theory of stare decisis as an \u201cinexorable command\u201d that she now rejects. In fact, it is precisely the opposite: <em>She often subscribes to no objective test whatsoever. </em>Cases from time to time may need to be overruled, but the ultimate problem with Justice Weaver\u2019s approach is that she relies on her <em>subjective </em>application of \u201cjudicial restraint, common sense, and a sense of fairness \u2014 justice for all,\u201d rather than any defined legal standard in making these decisions. And unlike her prior protests that \u201c[cjorrection for correction\u2019s sake does not make sense,\u201d <em>Devillers, </em>473 Mich at 622, Justice Weaver is now working to \u201ccorrect\u201d and overrule as many recent precedents as possible. Worse still, she is content to do so without any serious stare decisis analysis as long as doing so does not offend her subjective \u201csense of fairness.\u201d And, as the public is no doubt aware, \u201ccommon sense\u201d is not so common and Justice Weaver has no greater fund of common sense than anyone else. If for no other reason, that is why simply \u201cfollowing the law\u201d is the best course for any serious jurist committed to the \u201crule of law\u201d rather than the \u201crule of judges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Justice Weaver also selectively quotes without context a passage from an extended law review article that I authored. See Robert E Young, Jr., <em>A judicial traditionalist confronts the common law, </em>8 Texas Rev L &amp; Fol 299 (2004). The article was designed to highlight, in an arresting way, how difficult it should be for any judge committed to the rule of law to make the difficult policy choices necessary when modifying the common law. Quite simply, pohcy-making in the judiciary is one of least desirable and most difficult things for judges to do. This is because it is hard to assess the trade-offs that competing policies might create, especially when, unlike the Legislature, judges cannot consider the competing policy positions of interest groups affected by the issue in question. However, since Justice WEAVER is not committed to the rule of law, but instead applies her brand of \u201ccommon sense,\u201d she has no qualms with judicial policy-making in any context \u2014 common law or otherwise.

[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">In <em>Cameron, </em>this Court held that the minority/insanity tolling provision of the RJA, MCL 600.5851(1), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>addresses when one may \u201cbring [an] action,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> does not preclude the application of the no-fault automobile insurance act\u2019s one-year-back rule because the latter only limits the amount of benefits that can be recovered, i.e., the one-year-back rule is a damages-limiting provision rather than a statute of limitations.

MCL 600.5851(1) then is irrelevant to the damages-limiting one-year-back provision of MCL 500.3145(1). Thus, to be clear, the minority/insanity tolling provision in MCL 600.5851(1) does not operate to toll the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1). <em>[Id. </em>at 62.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">That is, the one-year-back rule by its straightforward language serves only as a limitation on the recovery of benefits; it does not define a period within which a claimant may file a cause of action.

Second, as <em>Cameron </em>itself explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">In reaching this conclusion the Court of Appeals [in Geiger], looking behind the language of the statute and focusing on its understanding of the Legislature\u2019s purported intent, determined that the legislative purpose behind the minority/insanity tolling provision for periods of limitations was to preserve not only a person\u2019s cause of action during the period of disability but also the person\u2019s damage claims. It opined that to not read the statute in this fashion would \u201cseverely limit the utility\u201d of the minority/insanity tolling provision. The Court then concluded that, \u201c[i]n order to advance the policy of RJA \u00a7 5851,\u201d the minority/insanity tolling provision applies to prevent the capping of damages under the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">We believe this ruling was erroneous for the most uncomplicated reason; namely, that we must assume that the thing the Legislature wants is best understood by reading what it said. Because what was said in MCL 500.3145(1) and MCL 600.5851(1) is clear, no less clear is the policy. Damages are only allowed for one year back from the date the lawsuit is filed. We are enforcing the statutes as written. While some may question the wisdom of the Legislature\u2019s capping damages in this fashion, it is unquestionably a power that the Legislature has under our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Constitution. Thus, because <em>Geiger\u2019s </em>conclusion that the minority/insanity tolling provision applies to extend the one-year-back rule is contrary to what the Legislature clearly directed in MCL 500.3145(1) and MCL 600.5851(1), <em>Geiger </em>is overruled. [Cameron, 476 Mich at 63-64.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The majority here commits the same error that <em>Geiger </em>committed. That is, the majority believes that it can somehow discern the purpose of the statute from something other than its actual language, despite the fact that this Court has repeatedly held that this constitutes an improper approach to statutory interpretation. As I explained in my concurring opinion in <em>Cameron:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">In <em>Geiger v Detroit Automobile Inter-Ins Exch, </em>114 Mich App 283; 318 NW2d 833 (1982), the Court of Appeals held that the minority/insanity tolling provision does toll the one-year-back rule of the no-fault automobile insurance act. However, the only reason it gave for reaching such a conclusion is that \u201c[a] contrary rule would severely limit the utility of the minority saving provision ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291. I do not necessarily disagree with <em>Geiger </em>that not tolling the one-year-back rule may well \u201climit the utility\u201d of the tolling provision, perhaps even \u201cseverely,\u201d but that is often what happens when there are statutes that are in tension with one another. It can be argued just as easily that to do the opposite, to toll the one-year-back rule, would be to \u201cseverely limit the utility\u201d of the one-year-back rule. Indeed, it can be argued that to toll the one-year-back rale is not merely to \u201cseverely limit its utility,\u201d but to do it even greater damage by vitiating its language altogether<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark> In the end, the <em>Geiger </em>rationale is not even a legal rationale at all; rather, it is little more than a statement by the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>in <em>Geiger </em>that it preferred a different statute than the one actually enacted by the Legislature. <em>[Id. </em>at 83-84 (MARKMAN, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The majority criticizes <em>Cameron </em>on the basis that \u201c[t]he only authority cited for [its] interpretation was in Justice MARKMAN\u2019s concurring opinion, which relied on dicta from Justice BRICKLEY\u2019s lead opinion in <em>Howard v Gen Motors Corp.\u201d </em>This statement very much illustrates the flaw in the majority\u2019s approach to statutory construction \u2014 it fails to recognize that the best indicator of the Legislature\u2019s intent is the language of the statute itself. That is, the best \u201cauthority\u201d cited in either the majority or concurring opinions in <em>Cameron </em>for their interpretation is the actual language of the statutes at issue. That the majority fails to apprehend this first principle of statutory interpretation sufficiently speaks to the shortcomings in its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Finally, with regard to the majority\u2019s apparent belief that it is somehow appropriate to overrule <em>Cameron </em>because <em>Cameron </em>overruled <em>Geiger, </em>even if <em>Geiger </em>were controlling precedent \u2014 which it is not \u2014 the majority errs by conflating all precedents as deserving of equal respect. However, as I explained in my concurring opinion in <em>Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, </em>477 Mich 197, 226; 731 NW2d 41 (2007), \u201cnot all precedents are built alike . . . .\u201d Indeed, \u201csome are better reasoned than others, . . . some are grounded in the exercise of discretionary judgments and others in the interpretation of plain language, [and] some are thorough in their analyses and others superficial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As discussed earlier, while <em>Cameron </em>entailed a serious effort to interpret the language of the law and to render our caselaw consistent with this language, <em>Geiger, </em>as also explained earlier, was principally grounded in a desire to advance the policy of the minority/insanity tolling provision over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>the policy of the one-year-back rule of the no-fault act. For these reasons, <em>Cameron\u2019s </em>overruling of <em>Geiger </em>can hardly be equated with the majority\u2019s overruling of <em>Cameron. </em>The former entailed an effort to render the caselaw of our state <em>more consistent </em>with the intentions of the Legislature, while the latter renders it <em>less consistent. </em>The majority has never quite grasped that the issue of stare decisis is one that cannot be viewed exclusively in quantitative terms, but must also be viewed in qualitative terms. By indiscriminately placing on equal footing all decisions of this Court that overrule precedent, without considering whether each does so in order to further the intentions of the lawmaker or to further the intentions of the judge, the majority communicates well the flaws in its understandings of stare decisis and of the judicial role itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">In <em>Liptow, </em>the Court of Appeals, relying on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cameron, </em>held that MCL 600.5821(4) does not preclude the application of the one-year-back rule because MCL 600.5821(4) only exempts the state and its political subdivisions from a statute of limitations and the one-year-back rule is a damages-limiting provision, not a statute of limitations. This Court denied leave to appeal in <em>Liptow, </em>478 Mich 853 (2007), and I agree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision. As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Liptow:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">MCL 600.5821(4) provides that actions brought by the state or its subdivisions to recover the cost of maintenance, care, and treatment of persons in state institutions \u201care not subject to the statute of limitations and may be brought at any time without limitation, the provisions of any statute notwithstanding.\u201d We conclude that, by the plain import of this language, the Legislature intended to exempt the state from statutes of limitations when bringing an action to recover public funds. The language refers to statutes of limitations and provides that an action may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>brought at any time. But the statute does not address damage limitation provisions or any other limiting provisions. In other words, like the minority tolling provision, MCL 600.5821(4) concerns the <em>time </em>during which the state may bring an action; it \u201cdoes not pertain to the damages recoverable once an action has been brought.\u201d <em>Cameron, supra, </em>476 Mich at 62. Accordingly, we conclude that MCL 600.5821(4), like the minority tolling provision of MCL 600.5851(1), does not operate to toll the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1). <em>Cameron, supra, </em>476 Mich at 61-62. <em>[Liptow, </em>272 Mich App at 555-556 (emphasis in the original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">While the RJA, specifically MCL 600.5821(4), states that an action by the state or one of its political subdivisions \u201cmay be <em>brought </em>at any time without limitation,\u201d the no-fault act, specifically MCL 500.3145(1), states that the claimant \u201cmay not <em>recover </em>benefits for any portion of the loss incurred more than 1 year before the date on which the action was commenced.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Having the right to <em>bring </em>a cause of action is not the equivalent of having the right to <em>recover </em>an unlimited amount of damages.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, when these two provisions are read together, it is clear that while a political subdivision may <em>bring </em>an action at any time, it cannot <em>recover </em>benefits for any portion of the loss incurred more than 1 year before the date on which the action was commenced. In other words, MCL 600.5821(4), which pertains only to <em>when </em>an action may be commenced, does not preclude the application of the one-year-back rule, which only limits <em>how much </em>can be recovered after the action has been commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The majority overrules <em>Liptow </em>simply because it relied on <em>Cameron. </em>Because I believe that <em>Cameron </em>was correctly decided and that <em>Liptow </em>appropriately relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>on <em>Cameron, </em>I would not overrule either <em>Cameron </em>or <em>Liptow. </em>As is obvious from the flood of opinions that the majority has recently overruled, the majority justices\u2019 repeated self-proclamations of adherence to stare decisis were merely a reflection of the fact that they agreed with the particular decisions that were being overruled. For a more thorough discussion of the majority justices\u2019 past expressions of fealty toward stare decisis, see my dissent in <em>McCormick v Carrier, </em>487 Mich 180, 262-279; 795 NW2d 517 (2010). However, the lead opinion\u2019s reliance on Chief Justice KELLY\u2019s opinion in <em>Petersen v Magna Corp, </em>484 Mich 300; 773 NW2d 564 (2009), which only Justice CAVANAGH joined, rather than the majority opinion in <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), should not go unnoticed. For a thorough discussion of Chief Justice KELLY\u2019s <em>Petersen </em>standard for overruling precedent, see my dissent in <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 350.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>What also cannot <em>go </em>without comment is the lead opinion\u2019s conclusion that \u201cupholding <em>Cameron </em>is likely to result in serious detriment prejudicial to public interests\u201d and, thus, that \u201cthis [Petersen] factor weighs heavily in favor of overruling <em>Cameron.\u201d </em>Given that the lead justices believe that it is appropriate to consider their own conceptions of \u201cpublic interests,\u201d their relative silence is telling with regard to the \u201cpublic interest\u201d in the viability of our state\u2019s no-fault system. It has been repeatedly recognized that because of the mandatory nature of no-fault insurance, the Legislature intended that it be affordable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The lead opinion gives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>little heed to the fact that its decision will once again raise the premiums of all insured drivers in this state.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The majority also asserts that because \u201cMCL 600.5821(4) lists the costs [for which recovery may be sought] as those for the \u2018maintenance, care, and treatment of persons in hospitals, homes, schools, and other state institutions,\u2019 \u201d it \u201csupersedes all limitations in MCL 500.3145(1), including the one-year-back rule\u2019s limitation on the period of recovery.\u201d In other words, the majority contends that MCL 600.5821(4) provides an absolute right to recover the enumerated costs. The problem with this argument, however, is that the statute says no such thing. The statute does not say that there is an unfettered right to recover the enumerated costs. Instead, MCL 600.5821(4) says only that \u201c[a]ctions brought. . . for the recovery of the [enumerated] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>cost[s] . . . are not subject to the statute of limitations and may be brought at any time without limitation, the provisions of any statute notwithstanding.\u201d That is, the reference to \u201cthe recovery of the cost[s]\u201d is in the context of describing what types of actions are <em>not </em>subject to the statute of limitations \u2014 those \u201c[a]ctions brought. . . for the recovery of the [enumerated] cost[s] . . . .\u201d Nowhere within the statute is there any indication that the Legislature intended to preclude <em>any </em>and <em>all </em>limitations on the amounts of money the state and its political subdivisions can recover. Instead, because MCL 600.5821(4) only pertains to <em>when </em>an action may be <em>brought, </em>it \u201cis irrelevant to the damages-limiting one-year-back provision of MCL 500.3145(1).\u201d <em>Cameron, </em>476 Mich at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Plaintiffs also argue that <em>Liptow </em>was inconsistent with <em>Univ of Mich Regents v State Farm Mut Ins Co, </em>250 Mich App 719; 650 NW2d 129 (2002), in which the Court of Appeals held that MCL 600.5821(4) in the RJA exempts the state and its political subdivisions from the no-fault act\u2019s statute of limitations in MCL 500.3145(1). Specifically, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">The language of the statute clearly indicates that the Legislature intended to exempt the state and its political subdivisions from all <em>statutes of limitation. </em>Thus, [MCL 600.5821(4)3 exempts plaintiff from the <em>statute of limitations </em>contained in [MCL 500.3145(1)]. <em>[Id. </em>at 733 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">However, as the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Univ of Mich Regents v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued March 12, 2009 (Docket No. 281917):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">[T]he decision in <em>Univ of Michigan Regents </em>[v <em>State Farm Mut Ins Co] </em>concerned \u201cstatutes of limitation,\u201d not \u201cthe damages-limiting portion of MCL 500.3145(1), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>one-year back rule.\u201d Consequently, there is no conflict between <em>Univ of Michigan Regents </em>and <em>Liptow </em><footnotemark>[13]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">As this Court has explained, \u201cMCL 500.3145(1) contains two limitations on the time for commencing an action and one limitation on the period for which benefits may be recovered[.]\u201d <em>Cameron, </em>476 Mich at 61, citing <em>Devillers v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>473 Mich 562, 574; 702 NW2d 539 (2005). First, \u201can action for PIP benefits must be commenced within a year of the accident unless the insured gives written notice of injury or previously received PIP benefits from the insurer.\u201d <em>Cameron, </em>476 Mich at 61.

In my concurring opinion in <em>Cameron, </em>I indicated that I was concerned because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\">although the tolling provision instructs minors and insane persons that they are entitled to wait until one year after their legal disabilities have been removed to bring their civil actions, if they do wait, they will only be allowed to recover what may be a portion of the total damages incurred.

The same remains true here. Although to some it may seem less than optimal to exempt entities such as plaintiffs from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>a one-year limitation on <em>bringing </em>an action, but not also from a one-year limitation on <em>recovery </em>in that an action, that is clearly what the Legislature has done, and it is entitled to act in a way that is viewed with disapproval by members of the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Nor is this, assuming arguendo that such is a relevant consideration, an \u201cabsurd result.\u201d Even to the extent that an \u201cabsurd result\u201d doctrine exists in Michigan,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> a result is only \u201cabsurd\u201d if it is \u201c \u2018quite impossible that [the Legislature] could have intended the result....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85 n 9 (MARKMAN, J., concurring), quoting <em>Pub Citizen v United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>491 US 440, 470-471; 109 S Ct 2558; 105 L Ed 2d 377 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring). It is entirely possible that the Legislature could have intended the result reached in <em>Liptow. </em>For example, the Legislature <em>\u201cmight </em>have intended these results in order to make no-fault insurance more affordable.\u201d <em>Cameron, </em>476 Mich at 80 (MARKMAN, J., concurring) (emphasis in the original), citing <em>Griffith v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, </em>472 Mich 521, 539; 697 NW2d 895 (2005) (stating that this Court has always been cognizant of the potential problem of \u201ccost containment for this mandatory coverage\u201d when interpreting the no-fault act), citing <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 599; 267 NW2d 72 (1978) (holding that \u201c[i]n choosing to make no-fault insurance compulsory for all motorists, the Legislature has made the registration and operation of a motor vehicle inexorably dependent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>on whether no-fault insurance is available at fair and equitable rates\u201d). Conceivably, as well,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">a reasonable lawmaker <em>might </em>have intended to maintain the solvency of insurers, and to enhance their ability to undertake future planning, by protecting them from multimillion dollar lawsuits filed many years after medical expenses have been incurred, and only after relatively manageable month-to-month expenses have been allowed to develop into more extraordinary decade-to-decade expenses. [Cameron, 476 Mich at 81-82 (Markman, J., concurring) (emphasis in the original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">That is,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">[s]uch a lawmaker <em>might </em>have sought to obligate those who have incurred medical expenses to seek reimbursement on a relatively ongoing basis, rather than allowing them to wait for many years before seeking compensation. Indeed, it is conceivable that a reasonable lawmaker <em>might </em>have wished to incentivize earlier, rather than later, causes of action in order to encourage those who have incurred medical expenses to act in a manner consistent with their own financial self-interest, and to ensure that their medical expenses were reimbursed expeditiously. <em>\\Id. </em>at 82 (emphasis in the original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\u201cFinally, a reasonable lawmaker <em>might </em>have concluded that practical problems pertaining to evidence and proofs in old claims required some balance between the interests of the [claimant] and those of the insurer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">As the majority acknowledges, \u201cif the one-year-back rule applies to [plaintiffs\u2019] claim, plaintiffs are entitled to no damages,\u201d because all of their losses were \u201cincurred more than 1 year before the date on which the action was commenced,\u201d MCL 500.3145(1). Indeed, all of plaintiffs\u2019 losses were incurred in 2000, and yet plaintiffs waited until 2006 to file this cause of action. Because I believe, for the reasons set forth above, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the one-year-back rule <em>does </em>apply to plaintiffs\u2019 claim, I conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 damages are not recoverable.

However, as <em>Cameron </em>itself explained, 476 Mich at 69-72, such a conclusion is inconsistent with the clear language of MCL 500.3145(1), which contains three pertinent provisions. The first provides that if notice was not provided and benefits were not previously paid, the action must be filed within one year after the accident. The second provides that if notice was provided or benefits were previously paid, the action must be filed within one year after the most recent allowable loss was incurred. And the third, known as the one-year-back rule, provides that losses incurred more than one year before an action was filed cannot be recovered.

And the suspicion simply cannot be avoided that these varying and indeterminate [\u201cpolicy considerations\u201d] may be largely a function of the outcome preferred by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>judge and by his or her personal attitudes toward the parties and their causes. Any [pertinent \u201cpolicy considerations\u201d] will be identified only <em>after the fact, </em>and these [\u201cpolicy considerations\u201d] may or may not have been invoked in resolving yesterday\u2019s dispute, and may or may not be employed in resolving tomorrow\u2019s dispute. <em>Any </em>judge can concoct an <em>after-the-fact </em>rationale for a decision; the judicial process, however, is predicated upon <em>before-the-fact </em>rationales.

It also states that <em>\u201cCameron\u2019s </em>interpretation of the saving provision actually operates to extinguish a claim, not save it.\u201d However, the lead opinion ignores that a plaintiff will only be unable to recover damages if that plaintiff has not suffered <em>any </em>losses within the year preceding the filing of the action. Contrary to the lead opinion\u2019s contention, this does not make <em>Cameron </em>and <em>Liptow </em>\u201cunworkable.\u201d It just means that they work differently than the lead justices would like them to work. Furthermore, it is not <em>Cameron </em>or <em>\u201cCameron\u2019s </em>interpretation of the saving provision\u201d that prohibits a plaintiff from recovering losses incurred more than one year before the action was filed; it is the Legislature\u2019s adoption of the one-year-back rule in the no-fault act. The lead opinion also states that <em>Cameron </em>and <em>Liptow </em>are \u201cunworkable\u201d because they deny plaintiffs \u201cthe legal recourse the Legislature provided [them], which is ... to recover the damages [they] incurred more than a year earlier.\u201d The problem with this assertion is that the Legislature has provided no such right. Instead, the Legislature has only provided certain people and entities the right to bring a cause of action after the period of limitations has expired. Nowhere, however, has the Legislature provided these same people and entities the right to recover an unlimited amount of money in those actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\"> Whether the \u201cabsurd result\u201d doctrine should exist in Michigan is a matter of some debate, but the Court need not address the question in this case because, as discussed, what was done here by the Legislature was not absurd. It suffices to note, however, that while I still subscribe to the view that the absurd result doctrine is an appropriate tool of statutory construction, the two justices who join this dissent do not.
