We hold that the standing doctrine adopted in <em>Lee v Macomb Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>464 Mich 726; 629 NW2d 900 (2001), and extended in later cases, such as <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Federation v Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co, </em>471 Mich 608; 684 NW2d 800 (2004), lacks a basis in the Michigan Constitution and is inconsistent with Michigan\u2019s historical approach to standing. Therefore, we overrule <em>Lee </em>and its progeny and hold that Michigan standing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>jurisprudence should be restored to a limited, prudential approach that is consistent with Michigan\u2019s longstanding historical approach to standing. Under the proper standing doctrine, we further hold that the Court of Appeals erred in determining that plaintiffs lacked standing. Therefore, we reverse and remand to the Court of Appeals to address the parties\u2019 remaining issues, including whether plaintiffs meet the requirements to bring an action for a declaratory judgment under MCR 2.605.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Plaintiffs are the Lansing School Education Association (LSEA), the Michigan and National Education Associations (MEA/NEA), and four teachers who are employed by defendants, the Lansing School District and the Lansing Board of Education. Each of the four teachers alleges that they were physically assaulted in the classroom by a student who was in grade six or higher, and each of the incidents was reported to a school administrator.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The students were suspended but not expelled. Plaintiff Penny Filonczuk alleges that the assaultive student was returned to her building, but not to her classroom, and none of the other teachers alleges that the student was returned to the same classroom or school.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Plaintiffs filed suit, alleging that defendants failed to comply with their mandatory duty under MCL 380.1311a(l) to expel students who physically assault a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>teacher.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They sought a writ of mandamus and declaratory and injunctive relief. In support of the action, three of the teachers filed affidavits stating that they believe that failing to expel students who physically assault a teacher increases the likelihood of other assaults and threatens the safety of the school environment. Plaintiff Filonczuk further stated that she felt discomfort due to the student\u2019s return to her building, and the other two teachers stated that they would have felt unsafe if the students who assaulted them had returned to their buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Defendants moved for summary disposition, arguing that plaintiffs lack standing, the statute does not create a private cause of action, and plaintiffs\u2019 claims fail as a matter of law because the school district did not abuse its discretionary authority in determining that none of the students had committed an \u201cassault.\u201d .The trial court granted the motion, reasoning that the court lacked the authority to supervise the school district\u2019s exercise of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Plaintiffs appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition on different grounds. <em>Lansing Sch Ed Ass\u2019n, MEA/NEA v Lansing Bd of Ed, </em>282 Mich App 165; 772 NW2d 784 (2009). The Court concluded that plaintiffs lacked standing under <em>Lee </em>and did not reach the case\u2019s merits. This Court granted plaintiffs\u2019 application for leave to appeal. 485 Mich 966 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The issue in this case is whether the <em>Lee/Cleveland Cliffs </em>majority erred in adopting a standing doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>that departed dramatically from Michigan\u2019s historical approach to standing. We hold that they did and that Michigan\u2019s standing doctrine should be restored to an approach that is consistent with the limited, prudential approach used historically. Under this approach, plaintiffs do not lack standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">A. THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF MICHIGAN\u2019S STANDING DOCTRINE</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The purpose of the standing doctrine is to assess whether a litigant\u2019s interest in the issue is sufficient to \u201censure sincere and vigorous advocacy.\u201d <em>Detroit Fire Fighters Ass\u2019n v Detroit, </em>449 Mich 629, 633; 537 NW2d 436 (1995). Thus, the standing inquiry focuses on whether a litigant \u201cis a proper party to request adjudication of a particular issue and not whether the issue itself is justiciable.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins Co v Hayes, </em>442 Mich 56, 68; 499 NW2d 743 (1993) (quotation marks and citations omitted). This doctrine has deep roots in Michigan law, and, although it has been used with increasing frequency in modern jurisprudence, before <em>Lee </em>it remained a limited, prudential doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Historically, the standing doctrine grew out of cases where parties were seeking writs of mandamus to compel a public officer to perform a statutory duty. See, e.g., <em>People ex rel Ayres v Bd of State Auditors, </em>42 Mich 422, 429-430; 4 NW 274 (1880); <em>People ex rel Drake v Univ of Mich Regents, 4 </em>Mich 98, 101-102 (1856). Standing was a prudential limit, which is to say that the court\u2019s decision to invoke it was \u201cone of discretion and not of law.\u201d <em>Ayres, 42 </em>Mich at 429. See, also, <em>Toan v McGinn, </em>271 Mich 28, 33-34; 260 NW 108 (1935); <em>Thompson v Secretary of State, </em>192 Mich 512, 522; 159 NW 65 (1916); <em>Drake, 4 </em>Mich at 103. The general rule was that a court would not hear a case where \u201can individual citizen, who is only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>interested in common with all other citizens of the state in the subject matter of [the] complaint,\u201d was suing a public entity to force compliance with a legal duty. <em>Drake, </em>4 Mich at 101-102. Generally, the court exercised its discretion to hear a case if the citizen had \u201csome individual interest in the subject matter of [the] complaint which is not common to all the citizens of the state ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103. This was sometimes articulated as a special or specific injury or interest. <em>Inglis v Pub Sch Employees Retirement Bd, </em>374 Mich 10, 13; 131 NW2d 54 (1964); <em>Hastings Bd of Ed v Gilleland, </em>191 Mich 276, 278; 157 NW 609 (1916); <em>Brophy v Schindler, </em>126 Mich 341, 347; 85 NW 1114 (1901).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">This rule was eventually applied in other cases where a party sought enforcement of a public right without a clear cause of action under the law, including where a plaintiff was seeking an injunction against a state agency on the basis that the agency\u2019s actions were unconstitutional. <em>Home Tel Co v Michigan R Comm, </em>174 Mich 219, 223-226; 140 NW 496 (1913). See, also, <em>Gilleland, </em>191 Mich at 278, listing remedies to which the rule had been extended. Notably, these cases only discussed the doctrine when no cause of action was clearly provided under law and the Court was deciding whether, within its discretion, to allow the party to bring the claim despite the lack of an express cause of action. Further, the standing inquiry was distinct from the merits of the case. Thus, although the Court sometimes reached the merits of a case despite concluding that a party lacked standing, the Court did not find it necessary to determine whether a party\u2019s claim had merit in order to determine whether a party had standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">References to standing became more frequent in Michigan\u2019s modern jurisprudence, and the doctrine was developed more extensively but remained a prudential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>limit that could, within the Court\u2019s discretion, be ignored.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, the fact that there was a cause of action under law, or the Legislature expressly conferred standing, was sufficient to establish standing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Where a party was seeking declaratory relief, the Court repeatedly held that meeting the requirements of the court rule governing declaratory actions was sufficient to establish standing. <em>House Speaker v Governor, </em>443 Mich 560, 572-573; 506 NW2d 190 (1993); <em>Allstate, </em>442 Mich at 69-70; <em>Sloan v Madison Hts, </em>425 Mich 288, 294-295; 389 NW2d 418 (1986). See, also, <em>East Grand Rapids Sch Dist v Kent Co Tax Allocation Bd, </em>415 Mich 381, 392-395; 330 NW2d 7 (1982); <em>Workman v Detroit Auto Inter-Ins Exch, </em>404 Mich 477, 492 n 1; 274 NW2d 373 (1979); <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 588-592; 267 NW2d 72 (1978). The Court also reaffirmed that \u201c[standing does not address the ultimate merits of the substantive claims of the parties.\u201d <em>Detroit Fire Fighters Ass\u2019n, </em>449 Mich at 633 (opinion by Weaver, J.). See also <em>Eide v Kelsey-Hayes Co, </em>431 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>26, 50 n 16; 427 NW2d 488 (1988) (opinion by Griffin, J.) (treating standing as an inquiry that was distinct from whether the plaintiffs requested remedy was available).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">While the doctrine continued to serve the purpose of ensuring \u201csincere and vigorous advocacy\u201d by litigants, over time the test for satisfying this requirement was further developed. In cases involving public rights, the Court held that a litigant established standing by demonstrating a \u201csubstantial interest [that] will be detrimentally affected in a manner different from the citizenry at large.\u201d <em>House Speaker, </em>443 Mich at 572 (quotation marks and citations omitted). Additionally, however, the Court recognized that even if a statute did not expressly grant standing, it could be implied from duties created by law. <em>See Romulus City Treasurer v Wayne Co Drain Comm\u2019r, </em>413 Mich 728, 741; 322 NW2d 152 (1982) (stating that there were cases in which \u201cstanding was not expressly granted by statute [but] standing was implied by the duties and obligations that were expressly stated)\u201d. Thus, where a statute did not expressly grant standing, this Court would consider whether the Legislature nonetheless intended to confer standing on the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Bradley v Saranac Bd of Ed, </em>455 Mich 285, 296; 565 NW2d 650 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>(1997); <em>Bowie v Arder, </em>441 Mich 23, 42; 490 NW2d 568 (1992); <em>Girard v Wagenmaker, </em>437 Mich 231, 235; 470 NW2d 372 (1991); <em>Shavers, </em>402 Mich at 587. In a case involving private rights, the Court explained that the litigant should have \u201csome real interest in the cause of action, or a legal or equitable right, title, or interest in the subject matter of the controversy.\u201d <em>Bowie, </em>441 Mich at 42 (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">In summary, standing historically developed in Michigan as a limited, prudential doctrine that was intended to \u201censure sincere and vigorous advocacy\u201d by litigants. If a party had a cause of action under law, then standing was not an issue. But where a cause of action was not provided at law, the Court, in its discretion, would consider whether a litigant had standing based on a special injury or right or substantial interest that would be detrimentally affected in a manner different from the citizenry at large, or because, in the context of a statutory scheme, the Legislature had intended to confer standing on the litigant. It was not necessary to address the merits of the case in order to address standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">B. THE <em>LEE/CLEVELAND CLIFFS </em>STANDING DOCTRINE</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Despite the consistency of the historical development of the standing doctrine in Michigan, <em>Lee </em>and its progeny abruptly departed from precedent and radically changed the standing doctrine. This doctrine\u2019s flaws are many.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">1. OVERVIEW OF THE <em>LEE/CLEVELAND CLIFFS </em>MAJORITY\u2019S APPROACH TO STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">In <em>Lee, </em>a majority of the Court determined, for the first time in Michigan jurisprudence, that standing was <em>required </em>by the Michigan Constitution, and, further, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Michigan\u2019s standing doctrine should be abandoned in favor of the standing doctrine adopted by the United States Supreme Court in the context of the federal constitution. The reasoning presented in <em>Lee, </em>and expanded in <em>Cleveland Cliffs, </em>is that standing is essential to Michigan\u2019s separation of powers doctrine. See <em>Lee, </em>464 Mich at 735. The <em>Lee/Cleveland Cliffs </em>majority explained that Article III, \u00a7 1 of the federal constitution grants federal courts only the \u201cjudicial power\u201d and Article III, \u00a7 2 limits the judicial power to certain \u201cCases\u201d or \u201cControversies.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>464 Mich at 735. Although the Michigan Constitution does not include \u201cCases\u201d or \u201cControversies\u201d requirements, the <em>Lee/Cleveland Cliffs </em>majority concluded that the Michigan Constitution is analogous to the federal constitution because it expressly requires the separation of powers and grants courts only the judicial power. <em>Cleveland Cliffs, </em>471 Mich at 615; <em>Lee, </em>464 Mich at 737-738. The majority further determined that the cornerstone of the judicial power is the case-or-controversy requirement. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The <em>Lee/Cleveland Cliffs </em>majority thus concluded that Michigan should adopt the federal constitutional standing test from <em>Lujan v Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 US 555, 560; 112 S Ct 2130; 119 L Ed 2d 351 (1992), as the \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum of <em>standing... </em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>The <em>Lee/Cleveland Cliffs </em>majority also held that a litigant must meet the <em>Lujan </em>standing requirements regardless of whether the Legislature expressly created a cause of action or conferred standing on the litigant because, although the Legislature has the power to create causes of actions, it does not have the power to expand the judicial authority granted to the courts by the Michigan Constitution. See <em>Mich Citizens for Water Conservation v Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America Inc, </em>479 Mich 280, 302-303; 737 NW2d 447 (2007). The Court also held that a litigant must meet <em>Lujan\u2019s </em>requirements in order to bring a declaratory action. <em>Associated Builders &amp; Contractors v Dep\u2019t of Consumer &amp; Indus Servs Dir, </em>472 Mich 117, 124-127; 693 NW2d 374 (2005). Thus, after <em>Lee </em>and its progeny, little remained of the historical limited, prudential approach to standing, and the doctrine was significantly expanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">2. CRITICISMS OF THE <em>LEE/CLEVELAND CLIFFS </em>MAJORITY\u2019S APPROACH TO STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The flaws in the <em>Lee/Cleveland Cliffs </em>approach are many.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Perhaps most egregiously, however, the <em>Lee/Cleveland Cliffs </em>majority dramatically distorted Michigan jurisprudence to invent out of whole cloth a constitutional basis for the standing doctrine and then, perplexingly, determined that Michigan\u2019s standing doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>trine should be essentially coterminous with the federal doctrine, despite the significant differences between the two constitutions and the powers held by the respective court systems. There is no support in either the text of the Michigan Constitution or in Michigan jurisprudence, however, for recognizing standing as a constitutional requirement or for adopting the federal standing doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">To begin with, there is no textual basis in the Michigan Constitution for concluding that standing is constitutionally required, and there are important differences between the two constitutions. The Michigan Constitution provides for the separation of powers between the legislative, judicial, and executive branches and vests the courts with the judicial power. Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2; art 6, \u00a7 1. The federal constitution similarly vests the judicial power in the courts. US Const, art III, \u00a7 1. Unlike the Michigan Constitution, however, the federal constitution enumerates the cases and controversies to which the judicial power extends, and the federal standing doctrine is largely derived from this Article III case-or-controversy requirement. See <em>Lujan, </em>504 US at 560 (stating that \u201cthe core component of standing is an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III)\u201d. Additionally, strictly interpreting the judicial power of Michigan courts to be identical to the federal courts\u2019 judicial power does not reflect the broader power held by state courts. Whereas federal courts only have the powers enumerated in the United States Constitution, the states retain powers not ceded to the federal government. US Const, Am X. See also <em>Cleveland Cliffs, </em>471 Mich at 683-684 (KELLY, J, concurring). As this Court has stated, in Michigan, \u201c[w]hile the legislature obtains legislative power and the courts receive judicial power by grant in the State Constitution, the whole of such power reposing in the sovereignty is granted to those bodies except as it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>be restricted in the same instrument.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Washington-Detroit Theatre Co v Moore, </em>249 Mich 673, 680; 229 NW 618 (1930). Given that the text of the Michigan Constitution lacks an express basis for importing the federal case-or-controversy requirement into Michigan law, the justification for doing so, if one can be found, must lie elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The <em>Cleveland Cliffs </em>majority dismissed the lack of a textual case-or-controversy requirement in the Michigan Constitution as irrelevant because it held that the case- or-controversy requirement is a limitation inherent in the judicial power.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, even assuming arguendo that the judicial power implicitly extends only to cases or controversies, there is no basis for rejecting the understanding Michigan courts traditionally had of this power to instead give it the same meaning it has in the very different context of the federal constitution. This conclusion is certainly not required by federal law, as the United States Supreme Court has \u201crecognized often that the constraints of Article III do not apply to state courts, and accordingly the state courts are not bound by the limitations of a case or controversy or other federal rules of justiciability____\u201d <em>ASARCO Inc v Kadish, </em>490 US 605, 617; 109 S Ct 2037; 104 L Ed 2d 696 (1989).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There is also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>no basis for doing so in Michigan law, as this Court long ago explained that Michigan courts\u2019 judicial power to decide controversies was broader than the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Article III case-or-controversy limits on the federal judicial power because a state sovereign possesses inherent powers that the federal government does not. <em>Washington-Detroit Theatre Co, </em>249 Mich at 679-680.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Most importantly, however, not only does the federal standing jurisprudence have no basis in Michigan law, it is contrary to it. As explained above, before <em>Lee, </em>the standing doctrine was not treated as a constitutional requirement in Michigan jurisprudence; that is, the Court never concluded that a lack of standing equated to the lack of a controversy necessary for the invocation of the judicial power under the Michigan Constitution. As discussed, before <em>Lee, </em>from the doctrine\u2019s inception this Court has at times addressed a case\u2019s merits despite concluding that the parties lacked standing. And, more generally, before <em>Lee, </em>\u201ccontroversy\u201d was never interpreted, as it is under <em>Lujan, </em>to refer only to instances where the party suffered a concrete and particularized injury caused directly by the challenged conduct. Thus, the Michigan Constitution does not compel adoption of the federal standing doctrine, and there is no support for doing so in this Court\u2019s historical jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Indeed, the <em>Lee/Cleveland Cliffs </em>majority, and the dissent in this case, make unsupported logical, or, rather, illogical, leaps. They expend significant energy explaining that Michigan law has historically required a case or a controversy to invoke the judicial power. See, e.g., <em>Cleveland Cliffs, </em>471 Mich at 626-628. Then, citing only cases that stand for that limited proposition, and without distinguishing or overruling the volume of precedent discussed in this opinion, they conclude that simply because this Court has stated that the judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>power extends to cases and controversies, standing is therefore required by the Michigan Constitution and must be equivalent to the federal standing doctrine adopted in <em>Lujan. Id. </em>at 628-629. They utterly fail to explain, however, why decades of Michigan standing jurisprudence must be sacrificed on the altar of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the <em>federal </em>case-or-controversy requirement, despite the lack of support in Michigan caselaw for understanding a \u201ccontroversy\u201d to exist only in the same, limited circumstances explained in <em>Lujan </em>and despite the conflict with <em>Michigan\u2019s </em>historic approach to standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">C. STARE DECISIS</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In light of the fact that the Michigan Constitution\u2019s reference to the judicial power does not inherently incorporate the federal case-or-controversy requirement, and, in fact, importing this requirement is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s historical view of its own powers and the scope of the standing doctrine, the question arises as to whether this Court should continue to apply the <em>Lee/Cleveland Cliffs </em>doctrine. Under the longstanding doctrine of stare decisis, \u201cprinciples of law deliberately examined and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction should not be lightly departed.\u201d <em>Brown v Manistee Co Rd Comm, </em>452 Mich 354, 365; 550 NW2d 215 (1996) (quotation marks and citations omitted). The importance of the stare decisis doctrine is well established, for, as Alexander Hamilton stated, to \u201c \u2018avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that [courts] should be bound down by strict rules and precedents which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them ....\u2019\u201d <em>Petersen v Magna Corp, </em>484 Mich 300, 314-315; 773 NW2d 564 (2009) (opinion by Kelly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>C.J.), quoting The Federalist No. 78, p 471 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed, 1961). As the United States Supreme Court has stated, the doctrine \u201cpromotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Payne v Tennessee, </em>501 US 808, 827; 111 S Ct 2597; 115 L Ed 2d 720 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Despite its importance, stare decisis is neither an \u201cinexorable command,\u201d <em>Lawrence v Texas, </em>539 US 558, 577; 123 S Ct 2472; 156 L Ed 2d 508 (2003), nor \u201ca mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision,\u201d <em>Helvering v Hallock, </em>309 US 106, 119; 60 S Ct 444; 84 L Ed 604 (1940). Ultimately, it \u201cattempts to balance two competing considerations: the need of the community for stability in legal rules and decisions and the need of courts to correct past errors.\u201d <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 314 (opinion by Kelly, C.J.). To reflect this balance, while there is a presumption in favor of upholding precedent, this presumption may be rebutted if there is a special or compelling justification to overturn precedent. <em>Id. </em>at 319-320. In determining whether a special or compelling justification exists, a number of evaluative criteria may be relevant, <em>id.,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but overturning precedent requires more than a mere belief that a case was wrongly decided, see <em>Brown, </em>452 Mich at 365.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>In this case, the question is whether there is a special or compelling justification to overrule the <em>LeelCleveland Cliffs </em>majority\u2019s decision to dramatically depart from this Court\u2019s deeply rooted standing doctrine. We hold that there is.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">To begin with, a case may be given less deference when it was an abrupt departure from longstanding precedent and lacks a constitutional basis. <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc v Pe\u00f1a, </em>515 US 200, 231-234; 115 S Ct 2097; 132 L Ed 2d 158 (1995). In such cases, \u201c[b]y refusing to follow [the erroneous precedent], then, we do not depart from the fabric of the law; we restore it.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 233-234. As discussed, <em>Lee </em>and its progeny departed dramatically from historical jurisprudence in Michigan, and the bounds of the constitutional text, when they interpreted the <em>Michigan </em>Constitution to compel a standing doctrine that is essentially coterminous with the federal standing doctrine. Thus, by reinstating the decades-old precedent from which <em>Lee </em>departed, we are restoring, not departing from, the fabric of the law and this Court\u2019s fidelity to the Michigan Constitution.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Further, regardless of the level of deference due <em>Lee </em>and <em>Cleveland Cliffs, </em>there is a compelling justification to overrule the standing doctrine adopted in those cases. I find several evaluative criteria to be relevant, including: (1) \u201cwhether the rule has proven to be intolerable because it defies practical workability\u201d; (2) \u201cwhether reliance on the rule is such that overruling it would cause a special hardship and inequity\u201d; (3) \u201cwhether upholding the rule is likely to result in serious detriment prejudicial to public interests\u201d; and (4) \u201cwhether the prior decision was an abrupt and largely unexplained departure from precedent.\u201d <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 320.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The first criterion weighs slightly in favor of affirming the <em>Lee/Cleveland Cliffs </em>standing doctrine because, although confusion sometimes arises over the application of the factors, the test does not rise to the level of defying practical workability.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The second criterion, the strength of reliance on the rule, weighs in favor of overruling <em>Lee </em>and <em>Cleveland Cliffs </em>because it seems unlikely that potential future defendants, including the government, have been violating laws on the basis of the assumption it could not be challenged because no party would have standing under <em>Lee </em>to do so. To the extent that such interests exist, they are not the type of reliance interests that this Court seeks to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The third criterion weighs heavily in favor of overruling <em>Lee </em>because the doctrine is likely to result in serious detriment to the public interest. The purpose of the standing doctrine in Michigan has always been to \u201censure sincere and vigorous advocacy.\u201d But the <em>LeefCleveland Cliffs </em>standing doctrine is, at the expense of the public interest, broader than this purpose because it may prevent litigants from enforcing public rights, despite the presence of adverse interests and parties, and regardless of whether the Legislature intended a private right of enforcement to be part of the statute\u2019s enforcement scheme. As noted by Chief Justice Kelly\u2019s <em>Cleveland Cliffs </em>concurrence, the <em>Lee/Cleveland Cliffs </em>standing doctrine \u201ccreates a self-inflicted wound\u201d that prevents the Court from serving justice and protecting the public interest. <em>Cleveland Cliffs, </em>471 Mich at 689. Further, as many commentators have noted, the federal standing doctrine has the effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>of encouraging courts to decide the merits of a case under the guise of merely deciding that the plaintiff lacks standing, thus using \u201cstanding to slam the courthouse door against plaintiffs who are entitled to full consideration of their claims on the merits.\u201d <em>Valley Forge Christian College v Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State, </em>454 US 464, 490; 102 S Ct 752; 70 L Ed 2d 700 (1982) (Brennan, J., dissenting) (quotation marks and citation omitted).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, the <em>Lee/Cleveland Cliffs </em>standing doctrine is overly broad compared to the doctrine\u2019s historical purpose and development and unjustifiably \u201cslams the courthouse door\u201d on numerous controversies that present legitimately adverse parties and interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Finally, the fourth criterion weighs heavily in favor of overruling precedent because, as discussed above, by adopting the <em>Lujan </em>test as a constitutionally required standing doctrine, the majority casually displaced decades of inconsistent precedent without notice or adequate explanation and thus implemented an abrupt and insufficiently explained departure from precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In light of these considerations, we hold that <em>Lee </em>and its progeny should be overruled.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>D. THE PROPER STANDING DOCTRINE</p>\n<p id=\"A_g\">1. OVERVIEW OF THE PROPER APPROACH TO STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The question then becomes what standing doctrine this Court should adopt in lieu of <em>Lee/Cleveland Cliffs. </em>We hold that Michigan standing jurisprudence should be restored to a limited, prudential doctrine that is consistent with Michigan\u2019s longstanding historical approach to standing.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Under this approach, a litigant has standing whenever there is a legal cause of action. Further, whenever a litigant meets the requirements of MCR 2.605, it is sufficient to establish standing to seek a declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Where a cause of action is not provided at law, then a court should, in its discretion, determine whether a litigant has standing. A litigant may have standing in this context if the litigant has a special injury or right, or substantial interest, that will be detrimentally affected in a manner different from the citizenry at large or if the statutory scheme implies that the Legislature intended to confer standing on the litigant.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>2. APPLICATION OF THE STANDING DOCTRINE TO THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">The next question is whether, in this case, plaintiffs have standing. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment, a writ of mandamus, and injunctive relief.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We hold that plaintiffs have standing to pursue at least some of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">To begin with, under the proper approach to standing, plaintiffs may seek a declaratory judgment if the requirements in MCR 2.605 are met. We remand to the Court of Appeals to decide whether plaintiffs meet the requirements of MCR 2.605 because it did not previously address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Further, we must decide whether plaintiffs have standing to pursue the rest of their claims because the Revised School Code, MCL 380.1 <em>et seq., </em>does not create an express cause of action or expressly confer standing on plaintiffs to enforce the act\u2019s provisions.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We hold that, in this case, plaintiffs have standing because they have a substantial interest in the enforcement of MCL 380.1311a(l) that will be detrimentally affected in a manner different from the citizenry at large if the statute is not enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>To begin with, the text of MCL 380.1311a itself suggests that plaintiffs have a substantial and distinct interest. It requires that a qualifying student be expelled for physically assaulting an employee of the school, which is defined to include the plaintiff-teachers. Given that the students are expelled for assaulting employees of the school, and not the citizenry at large, it is apparent from the statute that the plaintiff-teachers have a substantial interest in the enforcement of this provision distinct from the general public. The members of the general public might never be in a school, and, even for those who are, an assault on those members would not necessarily lead to the expulsion of the assaultive student.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Moreover, the legislative history to the 1999 legislative amendments that adopted MCL 380.1311a(l) into the Revised School Code make clear that the purpose of the section is to create a safer school environment and, even more specifically, a safer and more effective working environment for teachers.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The enrolled analysis of the public act adopting the amendments explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the rationale for their enactment is that \u201c[i]n Michigan, school safety is an ongoing concern,\u201d and, although an earlier public act \u201caddresses several aspects of school violence, additional concerns remain,\u201d and \u201c[i]n particular, it has been suggested that students should be expelled or suspended when they physically or verbally assault teachers or other school personnel...Senate Legislative Analysis, SB 183, SB 206, HB 4240, and HB 4241, July 21,1999. The analysis explains that the arguments in favor of the act included that \u201cadditional measures are necessary to create and maintain a safe educational environment\u201d because <em>\u201c[tjeachers who are subject to student assaults cannot effectively teach, </em>and pupils who feel endangered cannot learn.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It further explained that \u201c[s]ince just one miscreant can disrupt an entire classroom, and a handful can ruin the atmosphere of a school, removing these individuals will promote efforts to educate and to learn, as well as <em>protect the physical safety of school personnel </em>and students\u201d and concluded by explaining that \u201c[a] comprehensive State approach toward student violence should deter future assaults and other disciplinary problems.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In other words, the legislative history of the act indicates that the intended purposes of MCL 380.1311a(l) are exactly what common sense would suggest based on the statutory text: to make the school and classroom environment safer in general and specifically to protect teachers\u2019 physical safety and their ability to effectively teach by removing miscreants and assisting in deterring future assaults. The plaintiff-teachers\u2019 affidavits indicate that, consistent with these purposes, the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>failure of the school board to comply with the statute increases the threat to their safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In light of these purposes, and the plaintiff-teachers\u2019 affidavits, it is even more clear that teachers have a substantial interest in the enforcement of MCL 380.1311a(l) that is distinct from that of the general public. The legislative history specifically contemplates that the statute is intended to not only make the general school environment safer but additionally to specifically protect <em>teachers </em>from assault and to assist them in more effectively performing their jobs. These are hardly interests that are shared by the general public.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus, teachers who work in a public school have a significant interest distinct from that of the general public in the enforcement of MCL 380.1311a(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">We agree that, as stated by the dissent, the issue in this case is whether \u201ca teacher [can] sue a school board for its failure to expel a student who allegedly assaulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>that teacher[.]\u201d <em>Post </em>at 390. In its many erroneous blanket statements about what we are holding today, the dissent seems to assume that we have answered that question with a definitive \u201cyes.\u201d To the contrary, however, we have not. We have only held that if a teacher cannot sue the school board for allegedly failing to comply with MCL 380.1311a(1), <em>standing </em>is not the reason why. In their motion for summary disposition, defendants raised several arguments as to why plaintiffs cannot sue the school board besides standing, including that plaintiffs have failed to plead a cause of action and that their claims fail as a matter of law.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Plaintiffs appealed those issues. Because the Court of Appeals decided the case on the basis of standing alone, and did not reach the other issues, we remand to that Court to address the remaining issues.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>In summary, we hold that plaintiffs have standing because plaintiffs have a substantial interest in the enforcement of MCL 380.1311a(l) that is detrimentally affected in a manner distinct from that of the general public if the statute is not enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">We overrule the standing test adopted in <em>Lee </em>and its progeny and restore Michigan standing jurisprudence to be consistent with the doctrine\u2019s longstanding, prudential roots. We reverse the Court of Appeals judgment and remand to that Court to determine whether plaintiffs meet the requirements of MCR 2.605. Further, because we hold that plaintiffs have standing to pursue their remaining claims, we also remand to the Court of Appeals for consideration of the issues that it did not previously reach.</p>\n<judges id=\"b418-8\">KELLY, C.J., and WEAVER (except for part II[C]) and HATHAWAY, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\"> Cathy Stachwick alleges that a seventh grader threw a leather wristband with metal spikes towards her back, and the wristband bounced off the blackboard and struck her in the head.

As discussed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>concurrences by Justice Weaver and Justice Hathaway, however, justices may take varying approaches to stare decisis. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has not applied one strict standard or a single \u201ccommonly accepted... <em>test,\"post </em>at 449, when considering stare decisis issues and has applied various approaches, even within the same year. For example, in <em>Montejo v Louisiana, </em>556 US 778, _; 129 S Ct 2079, 2088-2089; 173 L Ed 2d 955, 967 (2009), in an opinion authored by Justice Scalia, the Court explained that \u201cthe fact that a decision has proved \u2018unworkable\u2019 is a traditional ground for overruling it.\u201d The Court also stated that other relevant factors include \u201cthe antiquity of the precedent, the reliance interests at stake, and of course whether the decision was well reasoned.\u201d Yet, in <em>Pearson v Callahan, </em>555 US 223, 233; 129 S Ct 808; 172 L Ed 2d 565 (2009), in an unanimous opinion authored by Justice Alito, the Court stated that \u201c[r]evisiting precedent is particularly appropriate where... a departure would not upset expectations, the precedent consists of a judge-made rule that was recently adopted to improve the operation of the courts, and experience has pointed up the precedent\u2019s shortcomings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Ironically, the very doctrine and approach that the dissent claims to vehemently adhere to today was not so faithfully applied by the members of the dissent in the past.

Further, as noted, the jurisprudence from other states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>and jurisdictions has limited value because it is based on distinct jurisprudential history and constitutions, and, regardless, there are states that have followed <em>Lujan </em>and there are states that have rejected it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\"> See, e.g., <em>Allen v Wright, </em>468 US 737, 782; 104 S Ct 3315; 82 L Ed 2d 556 (1984) (Brennan, J., dissenting), quoting numerous academic commentaries to explain that \u201c[m]ore than one commentator has noted that the causation component of the Court\u2019s standing inquiry is no more than a poor disguise for the Court\u2019s view of the merits of the underlying claims.\u201d Indeed, there is perhaps no better example of this than the dissenting opinion in this case, which, in order to apply the <em>Lee </em>standing test, also voluminously addressed the merits of each of plaintiffs\u2019 claims and the availability of the remedies they sought.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\"> The cases extending or applying <em>Lee </em>and <em>Cleveland Cliffs </em>include: <em>Rohde v Ann Arbor Pub Sch, </em>479 Mich 336; 737 NW2d 158 (2007); <em>Mich Citizens for Water Conservation; </em>and <em>Mich Chiropractic Council v Comm\u2019r of the Office of Fin &amp; Ins Servs, </em>475 Mich 363; 716 NW2d 561 (2006).

See, e.g., <em>Trout Unlimited, Muskegon-White River Chapter v White Cloud, </em>195 Mich App 343, 348; 489 NW2d 188 (1992). Thus, because we hold that the plaintiff-teachers have standing, and it is not disputed that the plaintiff-teachers are members of the plaintiff-organizations, the plaintiff-organizations have standing as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\"> In dicta, the Court of Appeals decision in this case suggested that there is no implied private cause of action to enforce the Revised School Code. We do not reach the merits of that issue, however, because plaintiffs are not seeking a private cause of action for damages. See, generally, <em>Lash v Traverse City, </em>479 Mich 180, 196-197; 735 NW2d 628 (2007), explaining that a party may seek remedies other than monetary damages, such as declaratory relief under MCR 2.605(A)(1), against a governmental unit without having to demonstrate that a statute has an implied private right of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b414-7\"> The dissent suggests that the same limitations that apply to using legislative history to <em>interpret </em>a statute should be applied to determining whether a party has a substantial and distinct interest in the statute\u2019s enforcement that is sufficient to establish standing. We disagree. If the Legislature unambiguously expresses an intent to confer standing through a statute\u2019s text, then it would certainly be sufficient to confer standing. But the inquiry into whether a party has a substantial and distinct interest in the enforcement of the statute is a much broader inquiry for which legislative history may he instructive. Indeed, before <em>Lee, </em>this Court would sometimes consider legislative history in determining whether a party had standing. See, e.g., <em>Frame v Nehls, </em>452 Mich 171, 176-180; 550 NW2d 739 (1996); <em>Girard, </em>437 Mich at 244-247. Further, while analyzing legislative intent is essential if a party is attempting to demonstrate that the Legislature intended to confer standing or create a private right that the party would have standing to enforce, this Court has not historically found an analysis of legislative intent necessary for a party to demonstrate that the party has a substantial interest in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>enforcement of a statute relating to a public right that is distinct from that of the general public. See, e.g., <em>House Speaker v State Admin Bd, </em>441 Mich 547; 495 NW2d 539 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b416-8\"> Indeed, because of this, plaintiffs\u2019 claim to having a more substantial interest than that of the general public is greater than that of the plaintiff-firefighters in <em>Detroit Fire Fighters Ass\u2019n. </em>In that case, Justice Weaver\u2019s lead opinion explained that, in her view, firefighters did not have a substantial interest in the effects of reduced funding for the fire department that was sufficiently distinct from that of the general public because, although firefighters were subject to a greater risk of harm if the number of total firefighters was reduced, members of the public who were trapped in burning houses were also subject to a greater likelihood of injury, and, thus, \u201c[b]oth segments of society are at greater risk when there is a dearth of fire fighters.\u201d <em>Detroit Fire Fighters Ass\u2019n, </em>449 Mich at 638 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Other justices, including myself, would have concluded that the firefighters did have a sufficiently distinct interest to establish standing. But, regardless, it is apparent that plaintiffs\u2019 interest in this case is even more distinct than that of the firefighters. As noted by the dissent, a teacher is more likely to be at a school, just as a firefighter is more likely to be at a fire. But whereas all members of the public are at risk of being in a building that may catch fire, all members of the public are not necessarily in schools so that they are at risk of being assaulted in a classroom or, even if they are in a school, of being affected by a less effective teaching environment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b417-6\"> As discussed, the merits of a party\u2019s claims and their right to the requested remedies were frequently intertwined in the standing analysis erroneously adopted in <em>Lee. </em>Indeed, the dissent in this case perfectly models this troubling aspect of that decision. But, under the proper approach to standing, the issues of whether plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded a cause of action and are entitled to the requested remedies are independent of the standing inquiry. Indeed, the issues the dissent raises regarding whether students\u2019 rights would be violated if a court decided to review the school board\u2019s disciplinary hearings and discretionary decision <em>and </em>found that plaintiffs were entitled to an injunction expelling the students are certainly premature at this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b417-7\"> Just as the dissent\u2019s cries that the historical standing test, in general, will lead to a stampede to the courthouse ignore that we are reversing a decision that is only <em>nine </em>years old, the dissent\u2019s cries regarding the stampede of lawsuits that will result from this specific case ignore that the Revised School Code predated <em>Lee </em>and yet the courts were not overburdened with similar cases before <em>Lee. </em>The reason for this lack of lawsuits is self-evident, as standing is certainly not the only hurdle to prevailing in a case, including winning on the merits. As noted, we are not holding that there is an implied cause of action for private damages under the Revised School Code. Thus, the plaintiff-teachers seeking enforcement of MCL 380.1311a(l) must meet the requirements for some other cause of action, such as a writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>of mandamus under MCR 3.305 or a declaratory action under MCR 2.605(A)(1).

Stare decisis is a principle of policy that commands judicial respect for a court\u2019s earlier decisions and the rules of law that they embody. See <em>Harris v United States, </em>536 US 545, 556-557; 122 S Ct 2406; 153 L Ed 2d 524 (2002); <em>Helvering v Hallock, </em>309 US 106, 119; 60 S Ct 444; 84 L Ed 604 (1940). <em>\u201cStare decisis </em>is the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Payne v Tennessee, </em>501 US 808, 827; 111 S Ct 2597; 115 L Ed 2d 720 (1991). However, when balancing the need to depart from precedent with the need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>adhere to established precedent, it is important to bear in mind that stare decisis is neither an \u201cinexorable command,\u201d <em>Lawrence v Texas, </em>539 US 558, 577; 123 S Ct 2472; 156 L Ed 2d 508 (2003), nor \u201ca mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision,\u201d <em>Helvering, </em>309 US at 119. \u201cIf it were, <em>segregation would be legal, minimum wage laws would be unconstitutional, and the Government could wiretap ordinary criminal suspects without first obtaining warrants. </em>See <em>Plessy </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>163 U.

As stated in <em>Helvering:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">We recognize that <em>stare decisis </em>embodies an important social policy. It represents an element of continuity in law, and is rooted in the psychologic need to satisfy reasonable expectations. But <em>stare decisis </em>is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">I do not agree with any approach to stare decisis that suggests or implies that it is a \u201crule\u201d or \u201claw\u201d subject to</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>a particularized test to be used in all circumstances. Any particular approach to stare decisis, such as the one taken in <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), is not \u201claw\u201d or \u201cestablished precedent\u201d that would require us to overrule, reject or modify its analysis. The <em>Robinson </em>approach to stare decisis, just as the one taken in <em>Petersen v Magna Corp, </em>484 Mich 300; 773 NW2d 564 (2009), is one among many varying approaches, and no particular approach, in and of itself, is inherently superior to another. As with any policy determination, the approach taken in any given case will depend on the facts and circumstances presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Historically, the United States Supreme Court has utilized many different approaches to stare decisis, including such approaches as those involving a \u201ccompelling justification,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cspecial justification,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a determination that a case was \u201cwrongly decided.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Each of these approaches is valid and offers a different nuance to stare decisis consideration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> **However, because stare decisis is a policy consideration, which must be considered on a case-by-case basis, the particular analytical approach will differ from case to case. Most importantly, the critical analysis should be on the rationale regarding whether or not to change precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">It is also worthy to note that not only has the United States Supreme Court historically not taken one single approach to the application of stare decisis, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>has not felt compelled to discuss stare decisis in all cases when precedent is being overturned. Many landmark cases that overruled well-established precedent did not discuss or even mention the phrase \u201cstare decisis.\u201d For example, <em>Brown </em>overruled <em>Plessy, </em>thereby ending segregation in our public schools, without mentioning the phrase \u201cstare decisis,\u201d much less articulating and following a particularized test. Similarly, <em>Gideon v Wainwright, </em>372 US 335; 83 S Ct 792; 9 L Ed 2d 799 (1963), which established the rights of indigents to have counsel in all criminal cases, not merely capital offenses, overruled <em>Betts v Brady, </em>316 US 455; 62 S Ct 1252; 86 L Ed 1595 (1942), again without mentioning \u201cstare decisis\u201d or a particularized test. Instead, both of these cases focused on the important policy considerations that weighed in favor of overruling precedent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">With these principles in mind, any analysis of the impact of stare decisis must focus on the individual case and the reason for overruling precedent. Thus, the reasons for overruling <em>Lee </em>are paramount to any articulated test and the special and compelling justifications to do so are overwhelming in this case. As I agree with the well-articulated reasons expressed by Justice CAVANAGH and Justice WEAVER, I will not repeat them here.</p>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b425-9\">1 <em>Helvering, </em>309 US at 119.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b426-8\"> See <em>14 Penn Plaza LLC v Pyett, </em>556 US 247, 280; 129 S Ct 1456; 173 L Ed 2d 398 (2009) (Souter, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b426-9\"> <em>Arizona v Rumsey, </em>467 US 203, 212; 104 S Ct 2305; 81 L Ed 2d 164 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b426-10\"> <em>Seminole Tribe of Florida v Florida, </em>517 US 44, 66; 116 S Ct 1114; 134 L Ed 2d 252 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b426-11\"> Any of these approaches to stare decisis can be valid depending on the issues before the court.

I dissent. In one fell swoop, the majority permits unlimited interference by courts in the local educational process and rewrites the entire constitutionally based legal doctrine governing stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>ing in Michigan. Contrary to the majority\u2019s decision, the lower courts correctly concluded that the plaintiff teachers here have no statutory right to demand the permanent expulsion of four particular children, and potentially innumerable other children, from all Michigan schools. Under any meaningful test for standing, plaintiffs cannot enlist the courts to compel locally elected school boards to expel students under the circumstances presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The majority reverses the lower courts\u2019 rulings, however, by creating a vague new standing \u201ctest\u201d\u2014 which is really no test at all \u2014 that violates the constitutional separation of powers mandate and gives courts unbounded discretion to overturn the decisions of other branches of government. In its haste to overrule this Court\u2019s standing jurisprudence, instead of addressing the issues framed by the parties, the majority asks and answers a question solely of its own making: whether Lee <em>v Macomb Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>464 Mich 726; 629 NW2d 900 (2001), was correctly decided.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In doing so, the majority jettisons years of binding precedent on the basis of four justices\u2019 current estimation that the public would be better served by opening the courts to all manner of challenges to acts of the legislative and executive branches. In overruling numerous cases, the majority throws into question the analyses and results in <em>no fewer than eight </em>significant, precedent-setting disputes including: <em>Manuel v Gill, </em>481 Mich 637; 753 NW2d 48 (2008); <em>Rohde v Ann Arbor Pub Sch, </em>479 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>336; 737 NW2d 158 <em>(2007);Mich Chiropractic Council v Comm\u2019r of the Office of Fin &amp; Ins Servs, </em>475 Mich 363; 716 NW2d 561 (2006); <em>Associated Builders &amp; Contractors v Dep\u2019t of Consumer &amp; Indus Servs Dir, </em>472 Mich 117; 693 NW2d 374 (2005); <em>Mich Citizens for Water Conservation v Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America Inc, </em>479 Mich 280; 737 NW2d 447 (2007); <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Federation v Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co, </em>471 Mich 608; 684 NW2d 800 (2004); <em>Crawford v Dep\u2019t of Civil Serv, </em>466 Mich 250; 645 NW2d 6 (2002); and, of course, <em>Lee </em>itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Moreover, in concluding that plaintiffs have standing here, the majority illustrates the fundamental problem with its approach: it adopts no meaningful limitations for a binding doctrine that applies in <em>every </em>civil lawsuit brought in this state. Here it opens the courthouse doors for any school teacher, volunteer, contractor or student to demand that a court expel children from their schools even though a local school board has concluded that expulsion was inappropriate. The majority thus authorizes courts not only to invade the provinces of school districts and the state board of education, but also to deprive children of their rights to public education without affording them any due process protections or legal representation. Indeed, none of the children targeted for expulsion are even named as parties in this suit. It is unfathomable that a court nonetheless has the power to permanently expel them from school \u2014 yet the majority so holds.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Critically, in overruling the entire body of Michigan\u2019s existing standing jurisprudence, the majority eschews the clear understanding of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d held by the framers of our state constitution. It also eliminates our workable, principled standing test, which mirrors that of the federal courts and of many state courts <em>with constitutions similar to our own. </em>Indeed <em>no </em>state in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>union incorporates explicit \u201ccase or controversy\u201d language into its constitution, yet many states explicitly employ the federal test \u2014 which is rooted in the traditional case or controversy requirement \u2014 that we adopted in <em>Lee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Finally, in effecting these unprecedented changes to Michigan\u2019s standing jurisprudence, the majority ignores the doctrine of stare decisis while paying lip. service to it. The majority inexplicably concludes that <em>Lee </em>was clearly wrongly decided, and that <em>\u201cLee </em>and its progeny departed dramatically from historical jurisprudence,\u201d although each member of the current majority who served on this Court during the relevant time period \u2014 Justice CAVANAGH, Chief Justice KELLY, and Justice WEAVER \u2014 adopted <em>Lee </em>as the correct test at some point in the past.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">For each of these reasons, I vigorously dissent. I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals, which faithfully and appropriately applied the law of this state in concluding that plaintiffs did not have standing to pursue this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">I. THE QUESTION PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">This case, brought by four Lansing teachers and their union, originally presented a straightforward question: can a teacher sue a school board for its failure to expel a student who allegedly assaulted that teacher? To be clear, this case does not ask whether the public has an interest in the welfare of its teachers; our desire for their safety is indisputable. Nor does the case ask whether \u00a7 1311a of the Revised School Code, MCL 380.1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number><em>et seq., </em>requires a school board to expel a student who \u201ccommits a physical assault at school against a person employed by or engaged as a volunteer or contractor by the school board,\u201d MCL 380.1311a(l); the parties do not dispute the unambiguous language of this provision. Further, the defendant school board and school district do not argue that they may ignore this mandate despite their conclusion following a student disciplinary proceeding that a student committed a physical assault as defined by the code. Rather, the parties dispute whether plaintiffs have standing to intervene, by way of a collateral civil suit, when they disagree with defendants\u2019 underlying decision that the acts of the students at issue did not constitute physical assaults for purposes of applying the mandatory expulsion provision of MCL 380.1311a(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Accordingly, this case specifically asks whether the <em>courts </em>may decide, at the behest of a particular teacher, that a school board <em>must </em>permanently expel a particular student without any notice to the student or his parents. The plaintiff teachers argued that they should be empowered to seek a court order directing permanent expulsion of students under MCL 380.1311a(l). The majority agrees and holds, under its broad new standard, that plaintiffs have standing to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">This holding is contrary both to settled principles of law regarding when a party has statutory and constitutional standing to bring a claim, as well as to the result demanded by the particular facts and circumstances of this case. The school code itself clearly establishes that the mandate in MCL 380.1311a(l) is to be enforced by the state executive branch and the locally elected school boards. Moreover, it is for the school districts \u2014 not the courts or individual teachers \u2014 to decide whether a particular student committed an assault requiring ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>pulsion. Plaintiffs offer no justification for the judicial branch to usurp these powers, which are specifically delegated to other branches of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Finally, plaintiffs have <em>never </em>described how the courts could successfully intervene. Their analysis fails to account for the fact that a board\u2019s decision to expel a student occurs only after a disciplinary proceeding where the <em>student\u2019s </em>constitutional rights are protected and where the board must make a careful, discretionary, factual decision concerning whether the student had the requisite intent to commit a \u201cphysical assault\u201d as defined by the school code. According to the Michigan Association of School Boards, more than 100,000 such disciplinary proceedings occur in Michigan each school year. Yet plaintiffs seek to intervene after the fact in a case where the students are not represented, asking the Court to revisit and overrule innumerable decisions of the elected school boards. Moreover, plaintiffs never explain why other enforcement mechanisms \u2014 including not only the explicit statutory enforcement provisions, but also negotiations with the school board under their collective bargaining agreement \u2014 are inadequate to ensure appropriate enforcement of the applicable statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Thus, like the lower courts, I cannot conclude that teachers have standing to obtain court orders compelling expulsion of students in contravention of a school board\u2019s decision that the students\u2019 acts did not require expulsion. Perhaps most significantly, by choosing to overrule this Court\u2019s constitutional standing doctrine <em>sua sponte, </em>the majority gives the courts carte blanche to invade the school board\u2019s decision-making province, depriving those boards of their constitutionally delegated responsibilities and depriving students of their rights to public education without affording them due process. This case thus illustrates the absolutely unten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>able nature of the majority\u2019s new approach \u2014 an approach that, unfortunately, is characteristic of the majority\u2019s assault on the rule of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">A. LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE REVISED SCHOOL CODE</p>\n<p id=\"AAf\">1. GENERAL POWERS AND DUTIES OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The Revised School Code, originally enacted in 1976,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> describes the \u201crights, powers, and duties\u201d of school districts. MCL 380.11a(3). The powers and duties originate from the Michigan Constitution, which established that the \u201clegislature shall maintain and support a system of free public elementary and secondary schools . . . .\u201d Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 2. Consistent with this mandate, the Legislature enacted the school code and provided that school districts would be governed by locally elected school boards. MCL 380.11a(5), (7). The constitution also vested \u201c[Leadership and general supervision over all public education\u201d in the elected members of the state board of education. Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Significantly, both the constitution and the school code make plain that school districts\u2019 central purposes are the education and protection of students. Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 2, requires a system of free public schools and states simply: \u201cEvery school district shall provide for the education of its pupils without discrimination as to religion, creed, race, color or national origin.\u201d The school code, in turn, defines district functions to include \u201c[ejducating pupils,\u201d MCL 380.11a(3)(a), and \u201c[providing for the safety and welfare of pupils while at school or a school sponsored activity or while en route to or from school or a school sponsored activity,\u201d MCL 380.11a(3)(b). A district\u2019s functions with regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>employees, however, center on \u201c[h]iring, contracting for, scheduling, supervising, or terminating employees, independent contractors, and others to carry out school district powers.\u201d MCL 380.11a(3)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">2. DISCIPLINARY POWERS AND DUTIES OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">School districts\u2019 powers and duties with regard to students include disciplinary measures subject to varying degrees of discretion by the board and its employees. For example, a district has discretion to suspend or expel a student who is \u201cguilty of gross misdemeanor or persistent disobedience if, in the judgment of the school board or its designee, as applicable, the interest of the school is served\u201d by suspension or expulsion. MCL 380.1311(1). A school board must permanently expel<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a student under certain circumstances, including possession of a weapon (subject to some exceptions), arson, or criminal sexual conduct on school grounds. MCL 380.1311(2). Even under these circumstances, however, the student or his parent may petition for reinstatement to public education when a period of up to 180 days has elapsed after his expulsion. MCL 380.1311(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The statutory provision at issue in this case, MCL 380.1311a(l), was added to the school code by the Legislature in 1999 as one of several bills \u2014 including the safe schools and communities law, 1999 PA 23\u2014 addressing school safety and student discipline.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The 1999 bills mandated a statewide school safety information policy to be collaboratively adopted by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Attorney General, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>and the director of the Department of State Police. MCL 380.1308(1). The bills also enacted guidelines for student discipline under various circumstances and established strict discipline academies, MCL 380.1311b, for particular students, including those expelled from their regular public schools, MCL 380.1311g(3)(b) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">MCL 380.1311a(l) requires permanent expulsion \u201c[i]f a pupil enrolled in grade 6 or above commits a physical assault at school against a person employed by or engaged as a volunteer or contractor by the school board\u201d and the assault is properly reported to school officials. For purposes of this section, \u201cphysical assault\u201d means \u201cintentionally causing or attempting to cause physical harm to another through force or violence.\u201d MCL 380.1311a(12)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">3. ENFORCEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The school code\u2019s provisions are enforced by several mechanisms. First, school board members, school officials, and any \u201cother person who neglects or refuses to do or perform an act\u201d required by the code, or \u201cwho violates or knowingly permits or consents to a violation\u201d of the code, is subject to misdemeanor prosecution. MCL 380.1804. Second, under MCL 380.1806, a school board \u201cmay dismiss from employment and cancel the contract of a superintendent, principal, or teacher who neglects or refuses to comply\u201d with the code. Third, because the members of school boards and the state board of education are elected officials, their acts and policies are regularly reviewed \u2014 and accepted or rejected \u2014 by the electorate.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">It is also significant that the Legislature has enacted a comprehensive, carefully monitored scheme to address safety within our schools. For example, the statewide school safety information policy requires school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>officials to report various school incidents to law enforcement agencies for investigation. MCL 380.1308(2)(a) and (3). Incidents that require reporting under this section are defined by members of the executive branch, MCL 380.1308(1), \u201ctaking into account the intent of the actor and the circumstances surrounding the incident,\u201d MCL 380.1308(2)(b). School boards are required to submit reports that state the number of students expelled during each year and the reasons for expulsion, MCL 380.1310a(l), and list crimes, including those \u201cinvolving physical violence,\u201d committed at schools, MCL 380.1310a(2). These reports are ultimately intended, in part, to help policymakers, school districts, communities, and law enforcement officials \u201cidentify the most pressing safety issues confronting their school communities,\u201d \u201cenhance campus safety through prevention and intervention strategies,\u201d \u201cprevent further crime and violence and. . . assure a safe learning environment for every pupil.\u201d MCL 380.1310a(2)(c) and (d). Finally, it is noteworthy that many school districts are now empowered to create law enforcement agencies within their school systems. MCL 380.1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">B. TEACHERS\u2019 STANDING TO SUE UNDER SECTION 1311a OF THE REVISED SCHOOL CODE</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">1. STANDING AND GROUNDS FOR COURT INTERVENTION</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Despite the Legislature\u2019s comprehensive system, through which executive branch officials and local districts set evolving policies and monitor responses to school safety, the plaintiff teachers here ask the courts to intervene and dictate the Lansing School District\u2019s responses to four past incidents \u2014 and potentially innumerable future incidents \u2014 involving student misbehavior. Each of the named plaintiffs alleges that she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>physically assaulted by a middle school student<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, therefore, that the court should order permanent expulsion of each student under MCL 380.1311a(l). Plaintiffs further asked the court to: permanently enjoin defendants from violating MCL 380.1311a in the future; find school officials and board members guilty of misdemeanors for violating the school code under MCL 380.1804; and cancel the contracts of the superintendent and any principal for failing to comply with the school code under MCL 380.1806.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Plaintiffs sought this relief by requesting a declaratory judgment under MCR 2.605, which permits a court to \u201cdeclare the rights and other legal relations of an interested party seeking a declaratory judgment.. . .\u201d MCR 2.605(A)(1). They also sought a writ of mandamus under MCR 3.305, which requires a plaintiff to prove \u201cit has a clear legal right to performance of the specific duty sought to be compelled and the defendant has a clear legal duty to perform such act.\u201d <em>Baraga Co v State Tax Comm, </em>466 Mich 264, 268; 645 NW2d 13 (2002) (quotation marks and citations omitted). Defendants moved for summary dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, arguing that plaintiffs did not have standing to seek either remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Traditional standing principles apply to plaintiffs seeking declaratory relief, <em>Associated Builders, </em>472 Mich at 125, or writs of mandamus, e.g. <em>Detroit Fire Fighters Ass\u2019n v Detroit, </em>449 Mich 629, 633; 537 NW2d 436 (1995). As this Court explained <em>in Associated Builders, </em>addressing declaratory actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">\u201c[I]f a court would not otherwise have subject matter jurisdiction over the issue before it or, if the issue is not justiciable because it does not involve a genuine, live controversy between interested persons asserting adverse claims, the decision of which can definitively affect existing legal relations, a court may not declare the rights and obligations of the parties before it.\u201d <em>[Associated Builders, </em>472 Mich at 125, quoting <em>Allstate Ins Co v Hayes, 442 Mich </em>56, 66; 499 NW2d 743 (1993).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Accordingly, <em>Associated Builders </em>explicitly held, in an opinion authored by Justice WEAVER, that the test enunciated in <em>Lee, </em>464 Mich 726, governs standing in declaratory actions and, as here, in actions where a plaintiff seeks to enforce an alleged statutory right but the statute does not confer standing by its own terms. <em>Associated Builders, </em>472 Mich at 127 n 16. Therefore, until today, plaintiffs bore the burden of establishing each of the following elements of standing in order to invoke court jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">First, the plaintiff must have suffered an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d \u2014 an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) \u201cactual or imminent, not \u2018conjectural\u2019 or \u2018hypothetical.\u2019 \u201d Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of \u2014 the injury has to be \u201cfairly. .. trace [able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not.. . th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.\u201d Third, it must be \u201clikely,\u201d as opposed to merely \u201cspeculative,\u201d that the injury will be \u201credressed by a favorable decision.\u201d <em>[Lujan v Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 US 555, 560-561; 112 S Ct 2130; 119 L Ed 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>351 (1992) (citations omitted); quoted and adopted by Lee, 464 Mich at 739; quoted and applied to declaratory actions in <em>Associated Builders, </em>472 Mich at 126-127.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Here plaintiffs have not established a legally protected interest in, or clear legal right to, expulsion of students under MCL 380.1311a(l). Plaintiffs also have not shown that defendants had a clear legal duty to expel the students under the facts presented or that plaintiffs\u2019 interests can be addressed by a favorable court decision. Therefore, they cannot establish standing to seek relief against the school board under MCL 380.1311a(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">2. THE ALLEGED RIGHT TO RELIEF ASSERTED BY PLAINTIFFS</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Plaintiffs argue that the text of MCL 380.1311a(l) creates an enforceable right in teachers and a corresponding duty owed by school districts to teachers. To determine whether a plaintiff has standing created by a statute, the court begins by considering \u201cthe statutory language to determine legislative intent.\u201d <em>Miller v Allstate Ins Co, </em>481 Mich 601, 610; 751 NW2d 463 (2008). As an initial matter, many of the cases cited by plaintiffs on this point are inapposite because they address whether a statute creates or implies a right of action for damages against a <em>private </em>party.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The inquiry is different when, as here, a governmental agency is involved. Because governmental agencies are generally immune <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>from suit under the governmental tort liability act, MCL 691.1407,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a plaintiff may sue a governmental agency for damages only when the Legislature <em>expressly </em>so authorizes. <em>Lash v Traverse City, </em>479 Mich 180, 194; 735 NW2d 628 (2007); <em>Mack v Detroit, </em>467 Mich 186, 195-196; 649 NW2d 47 (2002). These cases do not establish that a plaintiff may infer a private cause of action for damages against a governmental agency. Rather, in a suit against a governmental agency, a plaintiff generally may seek only injunctive or declaratory relief upon showing that the particular plaintiff has a clear, legally enforceable right that the particular defendant had a duty to protect. <em>Lash, </em>479 Mich at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Some of the relief requested by plaintiffs is clearly unavailable because they improperly ask the court to require the executive branch and the school district to make discretionary decisions <em>in a particular manner. </em>Although a plaintiff may seek to compel the <em>exercise </em>of discretion through a writ of mandamus, he may <em>not </em>compel the exercise of discretion <em>\u201cin a particular manner.\u201d State Bd of Ed v Houghton Lake Community Sch, </em>430 Mich <em>658, 666; 425 </em>NW2d 80 (1988) (emphasis added). Courts are not empowered to require the school board to cancel an employee\u2019s contract for fading to comply with the school code. Rather, MCL 380.1806 clearly establishes that a decision to terminate an employee under these circumstances lies within the board\u2019s discretion because the statute states that the board \u201cmay\u201d dismiss an employee for violating the code. A statute\u2019s use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in this context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>conveys discretion to act; it does not <em>require </em>the act. See <em>Warda v Flushing City Council, </em>472 Mich 326, 332; 696 NW2d 671 (2005). Similarly, a court has no power to find individual officials guilty of misdemeanors under MCL 380.1804 in this civil case. \u201cThe power to determine whether to charge a defendant [with a criminal offense] and what charge should be brought is an executive power, which vests exclusively in the prosecutor.\u201d <em>People v Gillis, </em>474 Mich 105, 141 n 19; 712 NW2d 419 (2006); Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, not only is this a civil case, but plaintiffs failed to name any individual defendants, so no potentially liable individuals are even parties against whom relief may be sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">Accordingly, the only obtainable relief sought by plaintiffs depends on their argument that they have a clear, legally protected right to the expulsion of the four students described in the complaint and, potentially, to innumerable future students. They stress that MCL 380.1311a(l) addresses assaults on a specific, circumscribed group of people \u2014 any \u201cperson employed by or engaged as a volunteer or contractor by the school board\u201d \u2014 that includes teachers like themselves. But nothing in the code suggests that the statute therefore creates an enforceable right in, or a duty to, this group of people. As explained above, the text of the 1999 statutory amendments is aimed at creating a comprehensive, statewide program of student discipline governed by the state board of education and the local districts. There is no indication of a legislative intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>create new rights in teachers beyond their explicit statutory and contract rights.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Plaintiffs cite two cases in which courts entertained suits brought by teachers who sought interpretation of school code provisions: <em>Detroit Federation of Teachers v Detroit Bd of Ed </em>396 Mich 220; 240 NW2d 225 (1976) (addressing the former code that predated the 1976 revised code), and <em>Roek v Chippewa Valley Sch Dist, </em>122 Mich App 76; 329 NW2d 539 (1982). In <em>Detroit Federation of Teachers, </em>this Court agreed with the circuit court\u2019s declaratory decision stating that the defendant board \u201cshall enter into a written, individual contract with each \u2018duly qualified\u2019 teacher in its employ\u201d because written contracts with teachers were required by former MCL 340.569, but we concluded that the lower courts erred by directing the kind of contract individual teachers would receive. 396 Mich at 222, 226. In <em>Roek, </em>the Court resolved the parties\u2019 dispute over language in MCL 380.1236(2), concluding on the basis of undisputed facts that the plaintiff qualified, as a matter of law, as a teacher employed as a substitute teacher for 120 days or more during a school year and thus had the basic right to be given first opportunity to accept or reject a contract under certain circumstances. 122 Mich App at 78-79. Neither of these cases supports plaintiffs\u2019 claim for standing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">These cases were concerned with teachers seeking judicial action with regard to <em>teacher </em>contracts. Thus, the cases addressed issues germane to teachers as <em>direct </em>parties to statutorily specified employment relationships. Moreover, because the cases involved the defendants\u2019 duties to teachers in the employment context, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the subject matter fell directly within the scope of specified district functions with regard to employees, which include \u201ccontracting.\u201d MCL 380.11a(3)(d). More importantly, <em>Detroit Federation of Teachers, </em>in particular, is most significant for what it did <em>not </em>do. Although <em>Detroit Federation of Teachers </em>confirmed the mandatory requirement for written contracts under the school code, it reversed the circuit court\u2019s writ of mandamus \u201cdirecting the kind of contract particular teachers would receive.\u201d 396 Mich at 224. It concluded that the \u201cright protected by the code is the right to a written contract evidencing the employment relationship, not to a particular kind of contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227. Accordingly, the court had no power to govern the details of the parties\u2019 contractual powers and duties, which the statute left to be determined through their collective bargaining process or the grievance procedure provided by their collective bargaining agreement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The case before us does not arise from the parties\u2019 request for the court to interpret, as a matter of law, mandatory statutory language addressing teacher contracts. Rather, the parties agree that the statutory language is unambiguous and needs no further interpretation. Instead, plaintiffs asked the court to revisit a school board\u2019s discretionary <em>factual </em>decision as it relates to a disciplinary scheme governing defendants\u2019 responses to <em>student </em>behavior in <em>student </em>disciplinary proceedings. Thus, instead of supporting plaintiffs\u2019 argument, the holdings of <em>Detroit Federation of Teachers </em>and <em>Roek </em>depend on contrasting facts and illustrate that this case does <em>not </em>involve a statute creating a clear right in plaintiffs or a clear duty on defendants\u2019 part as their employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Crucially, plaintiffs\u2019 reasoning is by no means limited to teachers. Upon accepting plaintiffs\u2019 claim that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>have an enforceable right under MCL 380.1311a(l), the majority establishes that <em>every </em>person mentioned in the student disciplinary statutes now has standing to challenge a decision of a school board declining to expel a student who is accused of assault. As previously discussed, MCL 380.1311a(l) addresses disciplinary measures with regard to students who assault school employees, volunteers, and contractors. MCL 380.1310(1), in turn, addresses disciplinary measures when a \u201cpupil enrolled in grade 6 or above commits a physical assault at school against another pupil.\u201d The two provisions are similarly worded and, therefore, the majority\u2019s conclusion that the teachers have standing to sue here applies with equal force not only to other school employees, volunteers and contractors, but to every student who alleges he was physically assaulted by another student. Yet nothing in the school code indicates that the Legislature intended to create a new right in <em>all </em>school volunteers, contractors, employees, or students to compel the expulsion of students, thus opening the floodgates for \u2014 and overwhelming the courts with\u2014 collateral litigation whenever one such person is dissatisfied with a board\u2019s resolution of a student disciplinary proceeding. For these reasons, plaintiffs simply have not met their burden to show that the Legislature intended to create a legally protected right in teachers when it enacted MCL 380.1311a(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">3. PLAINTIFFS\u2019 REMEDIES</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claims fail primarily for the above reason: the Revised School Code does not clearly create legal rights in teachers to compel expulsion of students under MCL 380.1311a(l). But plaintiffs have also failed to show that the Legislature intended to authorize private suits to enforce MCL 380.1311a(l) or that the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>statutory enforcement mechanisms are not exclusive under these circumstances. These latter failures independently defeat plaintiffs\u2019 claim that judicial relief is available to them in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">With regard to plaintiffs\u2019 mandamus complaint, relief is available <em>only </em>if \u201cthe law has established no specific remedy\u201d for a duty created by law. <em>Houghton Sch, </em>430 Mich at 667. The cases cited by plaintiffs similarly hold that, when a right or duty is imposed by statute, \u201cthe remedy provided for enforcement of that right by the statute for its violation and nonperformance is exclusive.\u201d <em>Pompey, </em>385 Mich at 552. As already discussed, the Legislature clearly vested enforcement of the code and its provisions in the executive branch, through misdemeanor prosecutions under MCL 380.1804, and local school districts, which have discretionary power to terminate employees and officials who violate the terms of the code, MCL 380.1806. With regard to school safety, the code provides an additional layer of local and executive branch monitoring and enforcement through the statewide school safety information policy, MCL 380.1308, and reporting requirements, MCL 380.1310a. Thus, the code\u2019s express terms provide particular remedies applicable to MCL 380.1311a. This should end the inquiry; these remedies generally should be deemed exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Plaintiffs argue, nonetheless, that they may still seek declaratory or mandamus relief if the statutory remedies are inadequate. This Court has never accepted the argument that courts may create new remedies for the violation of statutory duties on the basis of a party\u2019s claim that existing statutory remedies are inadequate. In <em>Lash, </em>this Court rejected the argument \u2014 which is rooted in dictum from <em>Pompey, </em>385 Mich at 552 n 14 \u2014 that an additional remedy might be permitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>supplement a statutory remedy if the statutory remedy is \u201cplainly inadequate\u201d; we noted that this dubious principle \u201chas never since been cited in any majority opinion of this Court\u201d and \u201cappears inconsistent with subsequent caselaw.\u201d <em>Lash, </em>479 Mich at 192 n 19. Plaintiffs nonetheless suggest that the principle was followed in a Court of Appeals case, <em>Lane, </em>230 Mich App 696, which cited <em>Pompey </em>and <em>Long v Chelsea Community Hosp, </em>219 Mich 578, 583; 557 NW2d 157 (1996), for the proposition that \u201ca cause of action can be inferred from the fact that the statute provides no adequate means of enforcement of its provisions.\u201d Yet <em>Lane </em>itself concluded that the plaintiff could <em>not </em>bring suit in part because the act at issue \u2014 the child care organizations act, MCL 722.111 <em>et seq. </em>\u2014 \u201cadequately provides for enforcement of its provisions\u201d through provisions similar to those present <em>in </em>the school code, including criminal penalties and proceedings instituted by the Attorney General. <em>Lane, </em>231 Mich at 696. Notably, the comparable statutory remedies available in this case are ignored by the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">In any event, plaintiffs certainly have not shown that the available enforcement mechanisms are inadequate. In addition to the statutory mechanisms discussed above \u2014 and in addition to the fact that school board members, as elected officials, must answer to the public for their acts and policies \u2014 plaintiffs never address why their contractual bargaining process is inadequate to address their safety concerns. Indeed, plaintiffs <em>concede </em>that their bargaining agreement with defendants includes provisions to protect the workplace safety of its members.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, consistent with the code\u2019s acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>edgment of the contract-based relationship between a teacher and a school district, it appears clear that plaintiffs not only have an enforcement mechanism at hand but \u2014 as in <em>Detroit Federation of Teachers </em>with regard to the non-justiciable contract terms \u2014 may make use of their bargaining process or grievance procedure to address alleged violations of their alleged rights to workplace safety. Defendants also reasonably argue that plaintiffs are clearly empowered to protect themselves by reporting alleged student assaults to their local prosecutor for criminal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Finally, in light of the broad powers the school code establishes in executive branch officials and local school boards, permitting individual plaintiffs to enforce MCL 380.1311a could violate both the terms of the code and the Michigan Constitution. Although this Court continues to debate the constitutional ramifications of our standing doctrine, we do not disagree about the constitutionally mandated separation of powers among our three branches of government: \u201cNo person exercising powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly belonging to another branch except as expressly provided in th[e] constitution.\u201d Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2. Thus, it is clear that the courts cannot exercise powers expressly allocated to other branches of government. Here, the constitution expressly granted the power to create and supervise public schools to the state board of education, Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 3, and the Legislature, Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 2, which has delegated governance of the schools in part to the local school boards, MCL 380.11a(5) and (7). Accordingly, the constitution itself supports the conclusion that courts may not compel acts of the local school boards without express, constitutionally sound authorization to do so. The trial court made this very point in its decision granting summary disposition:</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Basically, the premise here is that this Court in some fashion or another has the right to look behind the exercise of discretion by the Lansing School District. I don\u2019t think we have any more right to do that than we have to [sic] the Lansing City Council. The Lansing City Counsel [sic] is another branch of government. It\u2019s not our prerogative. That\u2019s not \u2014 that\u2019s not something for the Court to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">4. REDRESSABILITY AND THE EFFECTS ON STUDENTS\u2019 CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">On a related significant point, plaintiffs offer no workable means by which a court could enforce their alleged rights to expulsion of students under MCL 380.1311a(l) even if the court had some power to intervene through declaratory relief or a mandamus order. Plaintiffs\u2019 failure in this regard informs and strengthens the conclusion that the statute does not create legally enforceable rights in, or duties to, plaintiffs at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint depends entirely on their allegation that the four named students committed \u201cphysical assaults\u201d as defined by the code. Plaintiffs tacitly proceed as if this allegation were undisputed or could be decided by the court. To the contrary, the parties agree that the factual determination whether a student committed a physical assault for purposes of the school code is a discretionary one for the school board. Although no authority suggests that a teacher has standing to appeal a school board\u2019s disciplinary decision with regard to a particular student, the Court of Appeals has concluded that when a <em>student </em>appeals such a decision, \u201cin reviewing the disciplinary orders of a school administration, the courts of this state are bound by that administration\u2019s factual findings so long as they are supported by competent, material and substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Birdsey v Grand Blanc Community Sch, </em>130 Mich App 718, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>723-724; 344 NW2d 342 (1983). Thus the courts have imported the highly deferential standard applicable to administrative agencies under Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28. <em>Id. </em>at 723. <em>Birdsey </em>also relied on <em>Wood v Strickland, </em>420 US 308, 325; 95 S Ct 992; 43 L Ed 2d 214 (1975), which concluded that a court is bound to accept a school administration\u2019s finding of fact if there is any evidence in the record to support it. Despite this deferential standard for <em>direct </em>appeals of administrative decisions, both the plaintiffs and the majority would accord <em>no </em>deference <em>in a collateral appeal </em>to the school board\u2019s apparent determination that the four named students did not commit physical assaults as defined by MCL 380.1311a(12)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Although we accept as true the <em>facts </em>alleged by a plaintiff in a complaint for purposes of a defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(8), <em>Kuznar v Raksha Corp, </em>481 Mich 169, 176; 750 NW2d 121 (2008), plaintiffs\u2019 characterization of each event as a \u201cphysical assault\u201d as defined by MCL 380.1311a(12)(b) is a <em>conclusion </em>drawn from the statutory terms \u2014 not a fact.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, a court cannot simply accept this allegation as true or presume that, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>the case proceeds, it can be resolved in plaintiffs\u2019 favor by a finder of fact at trial. Rather, the allegation has apparently already been resolved <em>to the contrary </em>by the entity that plaintiffs concede is the proper forum \u2014 the school board. Under these circumstances, plaintiffs could achieve relief only if they can show, first, that the school board abused its discretion when it determined that the four students\u2019 acts did not constitute physical assaults and, second, that the court has the power to conclude that the board erred and then to overturn the board\u2019s determination <em>in a suit brought by teachers. </em>But plaintiffs never explain whether or how the court could review or overturn the board\u2019s determinations in student disciplinary proceedings that have long since concluded, let alone by way of this collateral suit in which the students at issue are not even represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Indeed, all other issues aside, plaintiffs\u2019 claims with regard to the four named students appear moot <em>in any event </em>because the disciplinary proceedings concluded years ago. The alleged assaults occurred in January 2007, September 2006, May 2006, and October 2005. Even if some of the students are still enrolled in the district, plaintiffs provide no authority suggesting that they could be expelled <em>now, </em>had they been expelled at the time of the incidents, by now each of them could have petitioned for reinstatement to public school under MCL 380.1311a(5)(b) (a court may grant a petition for reinstatement beginning 180 days after the date of expulsion).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">With regard to future students, plaintiffs do not explain how a declaratory judgment requiring defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>dants to comply with MCL 380.1311a(l) would have any effect whatsoever. Whether a student committed a physical assault is determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the particular facts and in accordance with the student\u2019s constitutional rights. Therefore, the most a court could do would be to redundantly repeat the undisputed terms of the statute itself: \u201cIf a pupil enrolled in grade 6 or above commits a physical assault at school against a person employed by or engaged as a volunteer or contractor by the school board . . . , then the school board. . . <em>shall </em>expel the pupil from the school district permanently, subject to possible reinstatement . . . .\u201d MCL 380.1311a(l) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed relief thus supports defendants\u2019 suggestion that what plaintiffs really desire is for the court \u2014 or the plaintiffs themselves \u2014 to determine whether a \u201cphysical assault\u201d occurred for purposes of applying MCL 380.1311a(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">Finally, as noted, permitting plaintiffs\u2019 complaint to proceed here permits <em>any </em>person who alleges he is the victim of student misbehavior to independently sue the board when the board concludes that the student\u2019s acts did not qualify for mandatory suspension or expulsion. That is, under the majority\u2019s analysis, any employee, volunteer, or contractor of the school may now collaterally sue on the basis of assault allegations under MCL 380.1311a(l). And any student may sue, seeking suspension or expulsion of a fellow student, on the basis of assault allegations under MCL 380.1310(1). And these suits may be filed although the student disciplinary proceeding is over and although the accused student\u2019s rights are not represented because he is not a party to the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Crucially, neither the majority nor plaintiffs <em>ever </em>address the rights of the accused students. Students <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>have a property interest in their entitlement to public education that cannot be \u201ctaken away for misconduct without adherence to the minimum procedures required by [the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment],\u201d US Const, Am XIV <em>Goss v Lopez, </em>419 US 565, 574; 95 S Ct 729; 42 L Ed 2d 725 (1975);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> see also <em>Birdsey, </em>130 Mich App at 726 (applying <em>Goss). </em>Accordingly, plaintiffs certainly cannot seek expulsion of students in the present proceeding, where the students are not represented and have no opportunity to contest plaintiffs\u2019 allegations against them. <em>Goss, </em>419 US at 579. Yet the majority permits plaintiffs to proceed, thereby rendering <em>additional </em>lawsuits \u2014 brought by the expelled students claiming violation of <em>their </em>rights\u2014 inevitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">5. CONCLUSION: PLAINTIFFS CLEARLY LACK STANDING AND THE MAJORITY\u2019S CONCLUSION TO THE CONTRARY ILLUSTRATES THE FATAL PROBLEMS WITH ITS NEW APPROACH TO STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Plaintiffs have not borne their burden to show that they satisfy <em>any </em>of the applicable requirements for standing under <em>Lee, </em>as both lower courts correctly concluded. Plaintiffs have not shown that MCL 380.1311a(l) creates a legally protected and redressable interest <em>in teachers </em>for which the courts may provide relief, particularly in a case involving only the teachers and the school district, but not the students at issue. Further, the foregoing discussion shows that plaintiffs could not satisfy <em>any </em>meaningful standing test.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Indeed, plaintiffs could not assert standing even under the former tests the majority cites with approval. Significantly, the parties essentially agree that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>outcome here would be the same whether standing is analyzed under <em>Lee, Detroit Fire Fighters, </em>449 Mich 629, or <em>House Speaker v Governor, </em>443 Mich 560; 506 NW2d 190 (1993). We agree. First, as discussed above, we see no indication that the Legislature intended to create a right or \u201csubstantial interest\u201d in <em>plaintiffs, </em>see <em>House Speaker, </em>443 Mich at 572, by enacting MCL 380.1311a(l). Further, to the extent plaintiffs refer to their general interest in their personal safety while at work, this interest is separate and independent from the student discipline provisions of the Revised School Code; plaintiffs can protect this interest through all the normal channels, including contract negotiations and complaints to local law enforcement. Second, plaintiffs\u2019 general interest in a safe school environment is analogous to the safety interests claimed by the plaintiffs in <em>Detroit Fire Fighters, </em>where Justice WEAVER agreed that the plaintiff firefighters and their collective bargaining unit did not have standing to challenge an alleged violation of the Detroit City Charter. <em>Detroit Fire Fighters, </em>449 Mich at 631-632. Justice WEAVER concluded that the firefighters did not have a \u201csubstantial interest\u201d that \u201cwill be detrimentally affected in a manner different from the public at large\u201d although they claimed that lack of funding for additional firefighters subjected them to increased risk of injury, among other things. <em>Id. </em>at 633 (opinion by WEAVER, J.). Specifically, she opined that the plaintiffs could not show \u201cinjury distinct from the general citizenry\u201d because a lack of firefighters also threatened injury to members of the general public who occupied buildings that catch fire. <em>Id. </em>at 638. The Legislature\u2019s purported interests in ensuring safe and effective learning environments similarly benefit the public at large. Safe schools, and the removal of violent students when appropriate, benefit not only all employees, volunteers, contractors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>students, but also parents, families, and any other member of the public who has occasion to enter a school. Indeed, the <em>entire community </em>that supports a school system has \u201can interest\u201d in school safety: safe school environments benefit taxpayers, who fund all aspects of school functions. Although not every member of the public is affected <em>equally </em>by school environments, the same was true in <em>Detroit Fire Fighters-, </em>clearly not every member of the public frequently finds himself at risk inside a burning building, and clearly firefighters find themselves inside burning buildings more often than other individual citizens.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Yet the majority rejects this Court\u2019s standing test and concludes, without any examination of the school code or the ramifications for students\u2019 constitutional rights, that plaintiffs \u2014 and, by necessary analogy, all school employees, contractors, volunteers and fellow students \u2014 have standing. As I have explained, the school code is replete with clear indications that the Legislature did not intend to create a right of action in teachers under MCL 380.1311a(l) and intended for the school code to be enforced under MCL 380.1804 and MCL 380.1806. The majority concludes otherwise by simply observing that MCL 380.1311a <em>\u201csuggests </em>that plaintiffs have a substantial and distinct interest.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Then, without citation and contrary to the most essential tenet of statutory interpretation, the majority expressly departs from the statutory text and states that, although the Legislature has not unambiguously expressed an intent to confer standing, a court may confer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>standing by consulting legislative history at will.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This assertion is indisputably erroneous. The proper interpretation of a statute <em>always </em>begins with the unambiguous statutory text. As this Court recently affirmed in a unanimous opinion authored by Chief Justice KELLY, the \u201cfirst step\u201d in discerning the intent of the Legislature \u201cis to review the language of the statute.\u201d <em>Briggs Tax Service, LLC v Detroit Public Schools, </em>485 Mich 69, 76; 780 NW2d 753 (2010). \u201c[W]e consider both the plain meaning of the critical word or phrase as well as \u201c \u2018its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em>460 Mich 230, 237; 596 NW2d 119 (1999) (citation omitted). If the statutory language is unambiguous, we presume that the Legislature intended the meaning expressed in the statute. <em>Briggs Tax Service, </em>485 Mich at 76. Accordingly, as Justice CAVANAGH himself stated in <em>In re MCI Telecom Complaint, </em>460 Mich 396, 411; 596 NW2d 164 (1999), \u201cjudicial construction is neither required <em>nor permissible.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Further, there has simply never been any question that, to determine whether the Legislature intended to confer standing under a particular statute, we employ the normal rules of statutory interpretation and proceed by \u201canalyzing] the statutory language.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>481 Mich at 607, 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Therefore, as in all cases requiring us to interpret an unambiguous statute, resort to legislative history is inappropriate. <em>In re Certified Question from the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, </em>468 Mich 109, 115 n 5; 659 NW2d 597 (2003). Further, even when reference to legislative history is appropriate, staff analyses created within the legislative branch \u201care entitled to little judicial consideration\u201d because \u201c[i]n no way can a \u2018legislative analysis\u2019 be said to officially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>summarize the intentions of those who have been designated by the Constitution to be participants in this legislative process, the members of the House and the Senate and the Governor.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Indeed, the legislative analysis cited here expressly states: \u201cThis analysis was prepared by nonpartisan Senate staff for use by the Senate in its deliberations <em>and does not constitute an official statement of legislative intent.\u201d </em>Senate Legislative Analysis, SB 0183, SB 0206, HB 4240, and HB 4241, July 21, 1999 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Thus, the majority grants plaintiffs standing in direct derogation of the Legislature\u2019s text and without any attention to the actual rights and remedies at stake, which include the constitutional rights of the unrepresented students. The majority\u2019s application of its vague new test demonstrates the test\u2019s unprincipled nature and far-reaching consequences. This Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Lee </em>was aimed precisely at avoiding such consequences by acknowledging that courts do not have unfettered discretion to grant or deny standing at will, but should adhere to a common standard. A common standard prevents the expansion of the judicial power beyond its constitutional bounds which, in turn, protects both the rights of citizens and the separate purviews of the other branches of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">II. <em>LEE </em>WAS CORRECTLY DECIDED AND ITS ARTICULATION OF STANDING IS A NECESSARY COMPONENT OF THIS STATE\u2019S CONSTITUTIONAL JURISPRUDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Relying on decades of developments in federal courts, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Lujan </em>set forth three elements so basic to the concept of what is needed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>for any party to bring a lawsuit that it labeled this standard the \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum\u201d of federal standing jurisprudence. <em>Lujan, </em>504 US at 560. First, a party wishing to bring a suit must have suffered a concrete and actual or imminent <em>injury. </em>Second, there must be a fairly traceable <em>causal connection </em>between the injury and the defendant\u2019s conduct. And third, a legal decision in favor of the party must be likely to <em>redress </em>the harm. <em>Id. </em>at 560-561. By a nearly unanimous vote, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lee </em>expressly incorporated this \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum\u201d into our state\u2019s existing standing jurisprudence, <em>Lee, </em>464 Mich at 740, in an effort to identify when the courts have the authority to exercise \u201c[t]he judicial power of the state,\u201d Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1. Because the doctrine of standing touches every civil lawsuit brought in this state, it is a doctrine of the utmost importance, with serious constitutional and practical implications.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Unfortunately, none of these considerations has deterred the majority in this case from <em>reducing </em>Michigan\u2019s standing requirements from the clear, developed standards articulated in <em>Lee </em>and its progeny to a broad and amorphous principle that promises to be nearly impossible to apply in a society that operates under the rule of law. The majority does so by relying on arguments and legal theories that have been considered and rejected as inconsistent with Michigan\u2019s constitutional requirements. The majority also does so notwithstanding that <em>Lee </em>and its progeny provided Michigan with a clear, well-understood standing framework that clarified the law for the better by identifying the proper scope of judicial authority. The majority today upends and reverses this entire body of Michigan law in vindication of the personal views of the majority justices, but to the detriment of this state\u2019s constitutional jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>A. STANDING <em>IS </em>A CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT IN MICHIGAN</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The Michigan Constitution both separates the powers of the various branches of government and limits the power of the judicial branch to hear cases when actual disputes exist. Thus, standing <em>is </em>a constitutional requirement. Because the Constitution vests \u201c[t]he judicial power of the state .. . exclusively in one court of justice,\u201d Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1, the source and boundary of this power is constitutional in nature. <em>Lee </em>therefore properly held that federal constitutional standards regarding standing may serve as a benchmark in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Perhaps the most fundamental doctrine in American political and constitutional thought is the separation of powers of government into a tripartite system. This principle has been explicitly incorporated in Michigan\u2019s constitutions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The importance of distribution of power is reaffirmed explicitly in our current Constitution, which states: \u201cThe powers of government are divided into three branches: legislative, executive and judicial. No person exercising powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly belonging to another branch except as expressly provided in this constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2. There can be no doubt, then, that the scope of the judiciary\u2019s power is both created and constrained by Michigan\u2019s Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>The <em>Lee </em>Court did not newly create this constitutional principle out of whole cloth. Contrary to the majority\u2019s belief, and inconvenient to the majority\u2019s conclusion, Michigan has- consistently acknowledged that the state\u2019s constitution limits the judicial power to hearing disputes involving <em>actual </em>cases or controversies. Understanding this most basic of principles is imperative to defining what, precisely, this state\u2019s doctrine regarding \u201cstanding\u201d should be because there is a clear link between the doctrine of standing and the separation of powers. The United States Supreme Court made this clear in <em>Allen v Wright, </em>468 US 737; 104 S Ct 3315; 82 L Ed 2d 556 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\">The requirement of standing ... has a core component derived directly from the Constitution. .. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">...

[Qluestions. .. relevant to the standing inquiry must be answered by reference to the Art. Ill notion that federal courts may exercise power only \u201cin the last resort, and as a necessity,\u201d and only when adjudication is \u201cconsistent with a system of separated powers and [the dispute is one] traditionally thought to be capable of resolution through the judicial process.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 751-752, quoting <em>Chicago &amp; G T R Co v Wellman, </em>143 US 339, 345; 12 S Ct 400; 36 L Ed 176 (1892), and <em>Flast v Cohen, </em>392 US 83, 97; 88 S Ct 1942; 20 L Ed 2d 947 (1968).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">The Court reaffirmed this principle in <em>Lewis v Casey, </em>518 US 343, 349; 116 S Ct 2174; 135 L Ed 2d 606 (1996), stating that \u201cthe doctrine of standing [is] a constitutional principle that prevents courts of law from undertaking tasks assigned to the political branches.\u201d In applying these principles as articulated in the Michigan Constitution, we have previously explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>As part of this endeavor to preserve separation of powers, the judiciary must confine itself to the exercise of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d and the \u201cjudicial power\u201d alone. \u201cJudicial power\u201d is an undefined phrase in our constitution, but we noted in <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife </em>that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">\u201c [t]he judicial power has traditionally been defined by a combination of considerations: the existence of a real dispute, or case or controversy; the avoidance of deciding hypothetical questions; the plaintiff who has suffered real harm; the existence of genuinely adverse parties; the sufficient ripeness or maturity of a case; the eschewing of cases that are moot at any stage of their litigation; the ability to issue proper forms of effective relief to a party; the avoidance of political questions or other non-justiciable controversies; the avoidance of unnecessary constitutional issues; and the emphasis upon proscriptive as opposed to prescriptive decision making.\u201d [471 Mich at 614-615.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">We went on in <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife </em>to distill this litany of considerations arising from the proper exercise of the \u201cjudicial power,\u201d and we determined that \u201cthe most critical element\u201d is \u201cits requirement of a genuine case or controversy between the parties, one in which there is a real, not a hypothetical, dispute.\u201d <em>[Nestl\u00e9 Waters, </em>479 Mich at 292-293 (brackets in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Moreover, these basic principles have been affirmed time and again by Michigan courts, as this Court traced in <em>Lee:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\">Concern with maintaining the separation of powers, as in the federal courts, has caused this Court over the years to be vigilant in preventing the judiciary from usurping the powers of the political branches. Early on, the great constitutional scholar Justice THOMAS M. COOLEY discussed the concept of separation of powers in the context of declining to issue a mandamus against the Governor in <em>Sutherland v Governor, </em>29 Mich 320, 324 (1874):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-10\">\u201cOur government is one whose powers have been carefully apportioned between three distinct departments, which emanate alike from the people, have their powers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>alike limited and defined by the constitution, are of equal dignity, and within their respective spheres of action equally independent. One makes the laws, another applies the laws in contested cases, while the third must see that the laws are executed. This division is accepted as a necessity in all free governments, and the very apportionment of power to one department is understood to be a prohibition of its exercise by either of the others. The executive is forbidden to exercise judicial power by the same implication which forbids the courts to take upon themselves his duties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">This position followed from the even earlier iteration of the standing doctrine by Justice Campbell in 1859 when, speaking for this Court, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">\u201cBy the judicial power of courts is generally understood the power to hear and determine <em>controversies </em>between adverse parties, and questions in litigation.\u201d <em>[Daniels v People, </em>6 Mich 381, 388 (1859) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Later, in <em>Risser v Hoyt, </em>53 Mich 185, 193; 18 NW 611 (1884), this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">\u201cThe judicial power referred to is the authority to hear and decide <em>controversies, </em>and to make binding orders and judgments respecting them.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">More recently, <em>Johnson v Kramer Bros Freight Lines, Inc, </em>357 Mich 254, 258; 98 NW2d 586 (1959), reaffirmed this concept by quoting this portion of <em>Risser. [Lee, </em>464 Mich at 737-738 (brackets in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">And this history is certainly not exhaustive. For example, in 1920 this Court relied on the separation of powers and the development of judicial power in declaring unconstitutional a statute that would have conferred standing upon citizens to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts \u201cnot in the determination of actual controversies where rights have been invaded and wrongs have been done, but in the giving of advice to all who may seek it.\u201d <em>Anway v Grand Rapids R Co, </em>211 Mich 592, 606; 179 NW 350 (1920). The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>This court and the court from which this case came by-appeal draw their power from the Constitution. The power given to both under the Constitution was judicial power.... This act confers powers not judicial and requires performance of acts non-judicial in character. For these reasons it is void in its entirety. <em>[Id. </em>at 622.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Following the decision in <em>Anway, </em>the Legislature amended the act to remove the offending provisions that had allowed courts to exercise powers outside of the case and controversy context, and this Court upheld the revised act in <em>Washington-Detroit Theatre Co v Moore, </em>249 Mich 673; 229 NW 618 (1930). Notably, the Court found significant that the act had been amended to apply \u201conly to \u2018cases of actual controversy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 676. It concluded that \u201c[t]here must be an actual and <em>bona fide </em>controversy as to which the judgment will be <em>res adjudicata. </em>Such a case requires that all the interested parties shall be before the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In <em>House Speaker v State Admin Bd, </em>441 Mich 547, 556; 495 NW2d 539 (1993), this Court again recognized the indisputable relationship between standing and the separation of powers, holding that \u201c[i]t would be imprudent and violative of the doctrine of separation of powers to confer standing upon a legislator simply for failing in the political process.\u201d More recently, in <em>Federated Publications, Inc v City of Lansing, </em>467 Mich 98; 649 NW2d 383 (2002), we reaffirmed and explicitly declared that the \u201cprincipal duty of this Court is to decide actual cases and controversies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, citing <em>Anway, </em>211 Mich at 610, and <em>In re Midland Publishing Co, Inc, </em>420 Mich 148, 152 n 2; 362 NW2d 580 (1984). As this history makes clear, Michigan has consistently acknowledged that our state constitution limits the judicial power to hearing cases involving actual cases or controversies.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>This is true notwithstanding the lack of an explicit \u201ccase or controversy\u201d requirement in the Michigan Constitution. Indeed, exceptions to the general \u201ccase or controversy\u201d limitation on judicial power have been explicitly made in the text of our Constitution itself, thereby recognizing the rule that a case or controversy is otherwise required. For example, Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 32, confers upon \u201cany taxpayer of the state\u201d standing to bring suit to enforce the provisions of the Headlee Amendment. Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5, empowers \u201cany citizen of the state\u201d to bring injunctive or mandamus proceedings to enforce the civil service laws of the state. Perhaps most significantly, Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 8, allows either house of the Legislature to request that this Court issue an advisory opinion on the \u201cconstitutionality of legislation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Indeed, the delegates\u2019 discussion of this last section, when it was ratified at the Constitutional Convention, eliminates any doubt about the framers\u2019 understanding of the judicial power in Michigan and directly confirms the <em>Lee </em>Court\u2019s interpretation of the judicial power.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In considering whether the Court should have the power to issue advisory opinions in nonadversarial proceedings at the request of other branches of government, the delegates\u2019 entire discussion was clearly premised on the <em>unquestioned assumption </em>that the judicial power, generally, was rooted in a case or controversy requirement. At the outset, Delegate Harold Norris explicitly asked with regard to the proposed section: \u201cDoes that mean that as far as this committee is concerned, they do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>not wish to preserve <em>the traditional notion that there must be a case or controversy presented before the court may exercise its judicial power!\u201d </em>1 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 1544 (emphasis added). When the question was raised whether the power to issue an advisory opinion would be equivalent to the courts\u2019 preexisting power to issue declaratory judgments, Delegate Eugene Wanger similarly specified that the courts\u2019 preexisting power, even in the arena of declaratory judgments, distinctly required \u201can actual controversy between individuals . ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1545. Delegate Raymond King may have expressed the understanding most clearly when he remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\"><em>We are indeed contemplating a very serious change in what I think to be the history and the tradition of justice in this country. </em>Mr. Wanger has pointed out the troubles that the Massachusetts supreme court got into when they allowed themselves <em>to leave the theory of case and controversy. [Id. </em>at 1546 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Indeed, even with regard to the limited expansion<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> of judicial power represented by the proposed advisory opinion provision, delegates were expressly concerned that it would \u201cadversely affeet[] the separation of powers doctrine ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1545 (Delegate Wanger); see also <em>id. </em>at 1546 (Delegate Jack Faxon indicating that the convention \u201cshould be wary of any violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>separation of powers\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 1547 (Delegate King stating: \u201cI think we have established through the English common law and our adherence thereto a system of justice, a system of separation of powers which has proven itself, and I think we ought to be very reluctant at this time to try something new.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">The framers\u2019 discussion on these points reinforces the <em>Lee </em>Court\u2019s understanding of the judicial power and presaged the critical problems \u2014 which I express here and which have been expressed by my colleagues in the past \u2014 with expanding the judicial power beyond its traditional limit. It also reinforces our conclusion, in <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife, </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">[t]o the extent that the people of Michigan, through their constitution, have chosen to confer upon the judiciary three specific authorities potentially beyond the traditional \u201cjudicial power,\u201d it seems unlikely that the people intended that any other such nontraditional authority could simply be incorporated as part of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d by a simple majority of the Legislature. [471 Mich at 625.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">In sum, it is clear that the framers of Michigan\u2019s constitution believed, first, that the judicial power is generally circumscribed by the case or controversy requirement and, second, that the only way to expand judicial power beyond the traditional case or controversy limitation was through affirmative amendment of the constitution. In accord, this Court has held that the constitutional standing test articulated in <em>Lee </em>must not be applied to limit judicial power otherwise expressly conferred in the Michigan Constitution. See <em>Mich Coalition of State Employee Unions v Mich Civil Serv Comm, </em>465 Mich 212, 217-219; 634 NW2d 692 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Yet, since the decision in <em>Lee, </em>several members of the current majority have advanced the view that, because the Michigan Constitution does not expressly use the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>words \u201ccase\u201d and \u201ccontroversy\u201d like the federal constitution, Michigan has no constitutional standing requirement. This argument fundamentally misunderstands both the Michigan and federal constitutions and misapprehends the constitutional standing theory. In <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife </em>we explained that the provisions of the federal constitution describing the limited \u201ccases\u201d and \u201ccontroversies\u201d that federal courts have the power to hear</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">is not a definitional provision that seeks to give meaning to the \u201cjudicial power.\u201d Rather, art III, \u00a7 2 is a provision defining the <em>limited </em>judicial power of the federal judiciary, in contrast to the <em>plenary </em>judicial power of the state judiciary. The respective legislative articles of the two constitutions are analogous to the judicial articles: the legislative article of the Michigan Constitution does not purport to define the authority of its Legislature (for example, nothing is said therein concerning its authority over marriage, divorce, child custody, child support, alimony, or foster care), while the legislative article of the federal constitution <em>does </em>affirmatively confer authority upon the Congress, article I, \u00a7 8. The state judicial power, as with the state legislative power, is plenary, requiring no affirmative grant of authority in the state Constitution. The federal judicial power, on the other hand, as with the federal legislative power, is limited. Such power is exclusively a function, or a creation, of the federal constitution, and, therefore, must be affirmatively set forth. In similar fashion, the federal judicial power must also be affirmatively set forth, for it is also a function, or creation, of the federal constitution. Thus, US Const, art III, \u00a7 2 does not <em>define </em>the \u201cjudicial power;\u201d rather it defines what <em>part </em>of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d within the United States belongs to the federal judiciary, with the remaining part belonging exclusively to the state judiciary. That art III, \u00a7 2 variously employs the terms \u201ccases\u201d or \u201ccontroversies\u201d is not to confer a particular meaning upon the \u201cjudicial power,\u201d but merely is to employ words that are necessary to the syntax of allocating the \u201cjudicial power\u201d between the federal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>state governments. The concurrence/dissents would confuse the allocation of a power with its definition, and would thereby define the federal \u201cjudicial power\u201d in the narrowest possible manner by limiting it through reference <em>alone </em>to the existence of a \u201ccase.\u201d Even from the perspective of the concurrence/dissents, is there <em>no </em>more permanent aspect of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d than that it pertain to a \u201ccase\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\">In fact, the \u201cjudicial power\u201d in the Michigan Constitution, with the several exceptions enumerated [explicitly in the Constitution], is the same \u201cjudicial power\u201d as in the federal constitution, and it is the same \u201cjudicial power\u201d that has informed the practice of both federal and state judiciaries for centuries. These historical principles were recognized by <em>Lee, </em>and we continue to adhere to them today. <em>[Nat\u2019l Wildlife, </em>471 Mich at 626-628.]<footnotemark>[22]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Yet this argument that Michigan does not have a constitutional basis for its standing test \u2014 based on \u201ccaricatured textualism\u201d that has been handily rejected \u2014 persists nonetheless.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In particular, Justice WEAVER has championed this dubious theory, which \u2014 given Chief Justice Kelly\u2019s and Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s recent metamorphoses on the issue of standing, and Justice HATHAWAY\u2019s election to the Court \u2014 presents a convenient argument as the majority grasps at straws to explain why <em>Lee </em>and its progeny should be overruled. The fact remains that in neither the majority opinion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>this case, nor any of the majority justices\u2019 concurring or dissenting opinions in prior cases, has a member of the majority ever articulated a sufficient response to these serious criticisms. This case has greater significance than prior cases, however, because the majority proceeds on these false understandings in order <em>to remove altogether the limits imposed by our Constitution.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">The proposition that Michigan courts are limited by an actual case or controversy requirement is beyond reproach. Michigan\u2019s case or controversy requirement is not drawn from the federal \u201ccase or controversy\u201d language, but rather the parallel limitations imposed in Michigan\u2019s own constitution. This fact has been recognized by more than a century worth of <em>Michigan </em>caselaw, and thus it formed the basis for this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lee </em>to incorporate a standing test that reflected this reality. The majority\u2019s author need only read his own opinions to realize as much. For example, in <em>People v Richmond, </em>this Court recently reaffirmed that \u201cit is the \u2018principal duty of this <em>Court... to decide actual cases and controversies\u2019 </em>That is, \u2018 \u201c[t]he judicial power... is the right to determine <em>actual controversies </em>arising between adverse litigants, duly instituted in courts of proper jurisdiction.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>People v Richmond, </em>486 Mich 29, 34; 782 NW2d 187 (2010) (majority opinion by Cavanagh, J.) (citations omitted, emphasis added, ellipsis and brackets in original), citing <em>Federated Publications, </em>467 Mich at 112, and <em>Anway, </em>211 Mich at 610, 616.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>principles apply with as much force in ensuring that this Court does not hear moot cases, or controversies that are not yet ripe.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> More generally, one has to wonder whether the majority may also wish to overrule all Michigan cases that rely on federal precedent involving standing\u2019s sister doctrines of mootness and ripeness? If not, the majority is left in the intellectually inconsistent position of defending those bodies of case-law, which have the same constitutional foundation regarding justiciability as the standing principles articulated in <em>Lujan </em>and <em>Lee. </em>Indeed, these doctrines are based <em>exclusively </em>on the very case or controversy requirement, implicit in the Michigan Constitution, that the majority here rejects.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Like this Court in <em>Lee, </em>other courts have rejected the majority\u2019s imprecise and overly broad analysis regarding the constitutional basis for standing on similar grounds. For example, in <em>Bennett v Napolitano, </em>the Arizona Supreme Court recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\">Article VI of the Arizona Constitution, the judicial article, does not contain the specific case or controversy requirement of the U.S. Constitution. But, unlike the federal constitution in which the separation of powers principle is implicit, our state constitution contains an express mandate, requiring that the legislative, executive, and judicial powers of government be divided among the three branches and exercised separately. This mandate underlies our own requirement that as a matter of sound jurisprudence a litigant seeking relief in the Arizona courts must first establish standing to sue. <em>[Bennett v Napolitano, </em>206 Ariz 520, 525; 81 P3d 311 (2003).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The majority\u2019s flawed constitutional analysis allows it to advance the false dichotomy that this state\u2019s standing jurisprudence must be based either on prudential concerns or on constitutional underpinnings, but not both. As the above analysis demonstrates, however, the constitutional separation of powers constraints explicitly provided in Michigan\u2019s constitution give rise to minimal constitutional standing requirements, which this Court may augment when additional, prudential concerns arise.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus, the interpretation of Michigan\u2019s constitution \u2014 in particular, its explicit limitations on judicial power and requirements of an actual case or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>controversy \u2014 provides a direct basis for applying the prudent and well-defined federal test.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">B. <em>LEE </em>AND ITS PROGENY: CREATING CERTAINTY IN MICHIGAN JURISPRUDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Although the concept of \u201cstanding\u201d touches every civil action filed in this state, prior to the adoption of the <em>Lujan </em>standard in Michigan this Court had only produced a general description of the principles governing standing. The most recent description that garnered support from a majority of this Court is found in <em>House Speaker v State Admin </em>Bd,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">Standing is a legal term used to denote the existence of a party\u2019s interest in the outcome of litigation that will ensure sincere and vigorous advocacy. However, evidence that a party will engage in full and vigorous advocacy, by itself, is insufficient to establish standing. Standing requires a demonstration that the plaintiffs substantial interest will be detrimentally affected in a manner different from the citizenry at large. <em>[House Speaker, </em>441 Mich at 554.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Unsurprisingly, such a general proposition for a doctrine as important and far-reaching as standing proved difficult to apply. This fact became all too obvious in <em>Detroit Fire Fighters, </em>when this Court next examined Michigan\u2019s standing doctrine. <em>Detroit Fire Fighters </em>resulted in a split decision in which no majority could be found to explain what elements were essential to standing in Michigan.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Indeed, although all four opinions cited the same boilerplate language from <em>House Speaker </em>in support of their respective positions, the justices did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>not agree on such fundamental questions as what standing is in Michigan, what test should govern standing, and whether the plaintiffs had standing in that particular case.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> This hodgepodge of disparate opinions compelled the Court to reach the merits of the case without a clear consensus on the threshold question whether the plaintiffs even had standing to bring the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">This background formed the context in which this Court again confronted this state\u2019s standing principles in <em>Lee </em>where, by a vote of six to one, this Court adopted and incorporated <em>Lujan </em>into our standing jurisprudence. As we stated then:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">In our view, the <em>Lujan </em>test has the virtues of articulating clear criteria and of establishing the burden of demonstrating these elements. Moreover, its three elements appear to us to be fundamental to standing; the United States Supreme Court described them as establishing the \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum\u201d of standing. We agree. <em>[Lee, </em>464 Mich at 740.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Consistent with this Court\u2019s constitutional obligations, the nearly unanimous majority in <em>Lee </em>correctly noted that the <em>Lujan </em>test provides a practical and workable framework for addressing what was previously an amorphous and often difficult concept. In its most basic form, the doctrine of standing can be properly reduced to the <em>Lujan </em>factors. What is standing if not the requirement that a plaintiff either has suffered or is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>imminent danger of suffering an actual harm, that the harm is allegedly caused by the defendant, and that the result of the court\u2019s action can redress the wrong or injury? While the federal and state constitutions are not coterminous, they have developed on a parallel track, and the interpretation of federal constitutional law may inform state constitutional law when they share common elements. Although the majority has littered its opinion with instinctive repetitions that this state\u2019s standing jurisprudence is \u201cprudential,\u201d the majority cannot explain what is imprudent about the \u201cirreducible\u201d and traditional description of the standing doctrine articulated in <em>Lujan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">By introducing an objective framework based on three well-developed and readily understandable criteria \u2014 injury in fact, causation, and redressability\u2014 the <em>Lee </em>decision simplified and made more practical the doctrine of standing in this state. As is evidenced by how justices on <em>this Court </em>could not previously agree about what, exactly, standing meant in Michigan under <em>House Speaker, </em>443 Mich 560, the <em>Lee </em>framework provides certainty. The progeny of <em>Lee </em>bear this out: in a decade\u2019s worth of cases, Michigan trial and appellate courts have consistently and appropriately applied Michigan\u2019s standing doctrine.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Indeed, during this time the doctrine itself has not changed. Only the personal views of justices on this Court \u2014 and only those who now overrule a decade\u2019s worth of cases \u2014 have changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>As a matter of simple prudence and proper exercise of this Court\u2019s constitutional authority, this Court is empowered to create clear rules that are easily accessible and applicable in the future. Aside from ensuring that Michigan courts only hear genuine cases and controversies in accord with its constitutionally mandated judicial powers, adopting the well-defined <em>Lujan </em>test provides the additional benefit of ensuring that Michigan\u2019s standing doctrine is guided by clearly articulated and well-developed rules. A well-understood and practical standing test serves to uphold the separation of powers and promote the sound administration of justice. Indeed, only such a framework can ensure that courts will be governed by the rule of law, which itself ensures equality of treatment under the law. Inexplicably, the majority apparently celebrates that, prior to <em>Lee, </em>Michigan\u2019s standing doctrine suffered from inconsistent application, and, in some cases, was not analyzed or applied at all.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Unfortunately, the majority\u2019s test can promise no better in the future; this is particularly true since, by its explicit terms, standing can now be determined at the \u201cdiscretion\u201d of trial courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Notably, <em>Lee </em>did not supplant or \u201csacrifice\u201d this Court\u2019s standing jurisprudence, as the majority in this case erroneously states. Eather, it adopted the <em>Lujan </em>test as a means of <em>\u201csupplementing </em>the holding in <em>House Speaker </em>[441 Mich 547], as well as this Court\u2019s earlier standing jurisprudence, e.g., <em>Daniels </em>and <em>Risser.\u201d Lee, </em>464 Mich at 740 (emphasis added). The majority today is not so kind. Characteristic of its reckless treatment of this Court\u2019s precedent and its willingness to rewrite entire areas of the law rather than letting them develop over time, the majority today jettisons a decade of this state\u2019s caselaw, which itself was based on nearly a century of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>rules and principles developed by the United States Supreme Court. And it does so in favor of what? A general, one paragraph articulation of \u201cprudential\u201d standing that proved so utterly unworkable a mere fifteen years ago under <em>House Speaker, </em>443 Mich 560. Michigan citizens deserve better from their highest court.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Reliance on the accessible and well-understood federal test was a proper and prudent course of action for this Court to take in <em>Lee. </em>Indeed, this Court has often affirmed the principle that it is not questioned that the \u201cpowers of Michigan\u2019s judiciary ... are modeled after the federal judiciary ....\u201d <em>Charles Reinhart Co v Winiemko, </em>444 Mich 579, 592 n 24; 513 NW2d 773 (1994) (opinion by Riley, J.); see also <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife, </em>471 Mich at 627-628. This is particularly true in the context of standing where \u201cMichigan courts previously have relied upon federal authority when deciding standing questions.\u201d <em>House Speaker, </em>441 Mich at 560 n 21. And Michigan is not alone. Because states\u2019 judicial powers are plenary whereas federal judicial power is limited, <em>no </em>state in this country has an explicit \u201ccase or controversy\u201d requirement in its constitution analogous to that of the federal constitution. Nonetheless, nearly half the states have adopted the <em>Lujan </em>test or its equivalent as their own in accordance with their state constitutional requirements regarding standing.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Like this Court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>Lee, </em>these states realize the wisdom behind the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>standing test and how it provides a practical and workable standing framework that operates within the bounds of their similar constitutional separation of powers requirements by giving <em>meaning </em>to those requirements. Moreover, <em>no </em>state\u2019s highest court has adopted the federal standing test as its own only to decide, a few short years later, to abandon the doctrine and return to a prior amorphous test that parties and the courts found difficult to apply. Although Justice WEAVER repeatedly calls the test established by <em>Lee </em>\u201cunprecedented,\u201d clearly it is the majority\u2019s decision today \u2014 not <em>Lee </em>\u2014 that defies precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Ultimately, the majority\u2019s decision today redounds only to the benefit of those who wish to use the courts \u2014 the least politically accountable branch of government \u2014 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>legislate and regulate increasingly larger spheres of Michigan life and politics.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> In this regard, we are quite sure the majority opinion suffers from a typographical error when it states that \u201c[w]e hold that Michigan standing jurisprudence should be restored to a limited, prudential doctrine,\u201d because what the majority gives us today is anything but a \u201climited\u201d doctrine. Indeed, with this case, the majority overrules those principles and rules that ensured that the doctrine would have articulated and meaningful limits in Michigan. Writing for the Court in <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife, </em>Justice MARKHAM foreshadowed the unfortunate turn of events altering Michigan\u2019s standing jurisprudence that today has come to pass:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\">By their diminishment of a traditional check and balance upon the exercise of the \u201cjudicial power,\u201d the concurring/dissenting Justices [CAVANAGH, KELLY, and WEAVER] would, if their position were ever to gain a majority, inflict considerable injury upon our system of separation of powers and the rule of law that it has produced. <em>[Nat\u2019l Wildlife, </em>471 Mich at 628.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Justice HATHAWAY has now provided those justices with their fourth vote, and with it surely will come the inevitable breakdown of the rule of law in the domain of standing that only <em>Lee </em>and its progeny had stood athwart.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">III. THE MAJORITY\u2019S SELF-SERVING AND INCONSISTENT APPROACH TO THE DOCTRINE OF STARE DECISIS</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Finally, the far-reaching, deleterious impact of the majority\u2019s decision in this case is equally inherent in its methods for overruling significant, precedential opinions of this Court. The majority\u2019s claim that it has good reason to overrule <em>Lee </em>and its progeny, in contravention of the doctrine of stare decisis, is bankrupt and self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>serving. Most significantly, in jettisoning <em>Lee, </em>the four justices constituting the majority fail to apply <em>any </em>agreed-upon test to examine whether this change in law is justified. The only clear commonality is their shared conclusion that <em>Lee </em>was clearly wrongly decided. This conclusion is mystifying because it is directly counter to the past positions of three members of the current majority, <em>who supported Lee </em>\u2014 and <em>the case or controversy requirement underpinning Lee </em>\u2014 in <em>previous cases. </em>Finally, the majority\u2019s determination that overruling <em>Lee </em>will benefit the public depends entirely on circular, self-serving reasoning; the majority simply concludes that its preferred regime would better serve the public without any attention to the actual desires of the Michigan public \u2014 as expressed, for example, in the Michigan Constitution \u2014 or to the commonplace conclusion of courts throughout the nation that the test articulated in <em>Lujan </em>well serves the nation\u2019s courts and citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">A. THE MAJORITY\u2019S STANDARDLESS APPROACH TO OVERRULING PRECEDENT</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">In <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), this Court articulated several factors for consideration before a court should overrule established precedent. \u201cThe first question, of course, should be whether the earlier decision was wrongly decided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464. But \u201cthe mere fact that an earlier case was wrongly decided does not mean overruling it is invariably appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465. Rather, \u201c[cjourts should also review whether the decision at issue defies \u2018practical workability,\u2019 whether reliance interests would work an undue hardship, and whether changes in the law or facts no longer justify the questioned decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The majority\u2019s conclusion that <em>Lee </em>was wrongly decided is untenable. The test <em>Lee </em>enunciated is loyal to the Michigan Constitution, is consistent with our jurisprudence, and has been adopted and successfully applied throughout the nation by states with constitutions similar to our own. Next, there is no indication that the <em>Lee </em>test \u201cdefies \u2018practical workability,\u2019 \u201d that \u201creliance interests would work an undue hardship,\u201d or that \u201cchanges in the law or facts no longer justify\u201d it. <em>Robinson, </em>462 Mich at 464. To the contrary, in standardizing factors for standing throughout the state based on the well-established and accepted federal test, <em>Lee </em>created a predictable analytic tool. It thus enhanced workability for courts and parties and protected parties\u2019 interests from potentially unanticipated discretionary decisions of individual courts, which did not have the benefit of concrete, guiding principles before <em>Lee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">In jettisoning this Court\u2019s constitutional standing jurisprudence, however, Justice CAVANAGH chooses not to rely on the <em>Robinson </em>factors. Instead, he cites Chief Justice Kelly\u2019s analysis in <em>Petersen v Magna Corp, </em>484 Mich 300; 773 NW2d 564 (2009). There, the Chief Justice expressed her disapproval of Robinson.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 316-317. She thus articulated her own preferred standard, albeit while \u201cneglecting] even to apply her new stare decisis standard to determine whether <em>Robinson </em>itself should be overruled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388 n 42 (Markman, J., dissenting). <em>Only </em>Justice CAVANAGH concurred in the Chief Justice\u2019s stare decisis analysis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>Petersen, </em>and only the Chief Justice expressly joins Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s reliance on <em>Petersen </em>here.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">In declining to join Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s discussion of stare decisis, Justices WEAVER and HATHAWAY go one step further. In their concurrences, they expressly advocate <em>no </em>standardized approach to overruling precedent. Concluding that \u201c[tjhere is no need for this Court to adopt any standardized test regarding stare decisis,\u201d Justice WEAVER advocates for a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d analysis based on undefined notions of \u201cjudicial restraint, common sense, and fairness.\u201d Her application of these notions to this case exemplifies the unprincipled nature of her position. She simply advances the empty, circular conclusion: \u201cIn serving the rule of law and applying judicial restraint, common sense, and a sense of fairness to the case at hand, I agree with and join the majority opinion\u2019s holding that <em>Lee </em>and its progeny are overruled.\u201d Justice HATHAWAY describes a judge\u2019s duty when deciding whether to overrule precedent as a \u201cpolicy determination\u201d that \u201cwill be dependent upon the facts and circumstances presented.\u201d Like Justice WEAVER, she votes to overrule <em>Lee </em>based on an empty, unexplained conclusion: \u201cthe reasons for overruling <em>Lee </em>are paramount to any articulated test and the special and compelling justifications to do so are overwhelming in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Justices WEAVER and Hathaway have each espoused their troubling views that reviewing whether a case should be overruled is merely a \u201cpolicy\u201d determination that need not be guided by any standard in several other recent cases, including <em>Univ of Mich Regents v Titan Ins Co, </em>487 Mich 289; 791 NW2d 897 (2010), and <em>McCormick v Carrier, </em>487 Mich 180; 795 NW2d 517 (2010). Their professed approaches rely entirely on their personal, subjective views of the law. As Justice YOUNG <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>noted in his dissent to <em>Univ of Mich Regents, </em>their approaches are \u201cthe very antithesis of the \u2018rule of law\u2019. . . <em>Univ of Mich Regents, </em>487 Mich at 325 (Young, J., dissenting). He observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">The rule of law, by definition, requires judges to decide cases on the basis of principles, announced in advance, rather than on a personal or subjective preference for or against a party before them. This ensures stability in the law despite the diversity of judges\u2019 personal beliefs. Whether we, as judges, \u201clike\u201d the outcome is, quite simply, <em>irrelevant </em>to whether it reflects a correct conclusion of law. It is harrowing that Justices WEAVER and HATHAWAY either do not understand this concept or refuse to subscribe to it, preferring to base their decisions on subjective \u201cpolicy consideration[s].\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 327.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Justice MARKMAN also warned that the primary problem with this approach is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">\u201clitigants will, of coruse, have no notice beforehand of which [\u2018analytical approach\u2019] will be employed, for the justices themselves will not know this beforehand.\u201d <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 380 (Markman, J., dissenting). Under the concurring justices\u2019 \u201canalytical approaches,\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-9\">\u201cthere [would be] no consistently applied . . . process with which the judge promises beforehand to comply. He or she may promise to be \u2018fair,\u2019 and he or she may seek to be fair, but there are no rules for how this fairness is to be achieved. There is only the promise that the judge will address each [precedent] on a case-by-case basis, using whatever [\u2018policy considerations\u2019] he or she believes are required in that instance. And the suspicion simply cannot be avoided that these varying and indeterminate [\u2018policy considerations\u2019] may be largely a function of the outcome preferred by the judge and by his or her personal attitudes toward the parties and their causes.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 340 n 10 (Markman, J., dissenting), quoting <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 381-382 (Markman, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">These warnings have come full circle in this case where the majority overrules an entire body of law without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>relying on any agreed-upon factors to decide whether overruling precedent is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">B. AFTER SUPPORTING <em>LEE </em>IN THE PAST, THE MAJORITY NOW INEXPLICABLY CONCLUDES THAT IT WAS WRONGLY DECIDED</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Significantly, the majority\u2019s decision to overrule <em>Lee </em>under the various \u201cstandards\u201d espoused individually by each justice depends, of course, on its threshold conclusion that <em>Lee </em>was wrongly decided. But this conclusion itself is belied by the reliance of Chief Justice KELLY, Justice WEAVER, and Justice CAVANAGH on the wisdom of <em>Lee. </em>Chief Justice KELLY and Justice CAVANAGH <em>expressly joined </em>the Court\u2019s adoption of the <em>Lujan </em>test in <em>Lee. Lee, </em>464 Mich at 750 (Kelly, J., joined by CAVANAGH, J., dissenting but \u201cagree[ing] with the majority\u2019s adoption of the <em>Lujan </em>test\u201d).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Indeed, Justice CAVANAGH was the <em>first </em>justice of this Court to propose adopting the <em>Lujan </em>test; he expressly employed and advocated for adoption of the <em>Lujan </em>test in concluding that the plaintiffs had standing in the fractured <em>Detroit Fire Fighters </em>decision. See 449 Mich at 651-652 (Cavanagh, J, dissenting in part). Justice WEAVER herself accepted <em>Lee </em>in <em>Associated Builders, </em>472 Mich at 127 &amp; n 16, where she explicitly held that <em>Lee </em>governs standing in declaratory actions and in cases where a plaintiff seeks to enforce an alleged statutory right but the statute does not confer standing by its own terms. These justices have also explicitly affirmed their agreement with the concept that the judicial power in Michigan is bounded by a case or controversy requirement. E.g., <em>Richmond, </em>486 Mich at 34 (Cavanagh, J., joined by Kelly, C.J., and Markman and Hathaway, JJ.) (stating that \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]he judicial power ... is the right to determine actual controversies arising between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>adverse litigants, duly instituted in courts of proper jurisdiction\u201d \u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted; ellipsis and brackets in original); <em>In re Certified Question from the United States Dist Court for Eastern Dist of Mich, </em>622 NW2d 518, 519 (2001) (Weaver, J., dissenting) (\u201c \u2018[judicial power\u2019 \u201d is \u201c \u2018the power to hear and determine controversies between adverse parties, and questions in litigation.\u2019 \u201d) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">In light of these justices\u2019 former positions, I am mystified at their current conclusions that <em>Lee </em>was not only wrongly decided, but was <em>so </em>misguided that we should now throw Michigan\u2019s standing jurisprudence into turmoil in order to overrule <em>Lee. </em>Indeed, their result has every appearance of a mere power grab intended to ascribe broad, unconstitutional authority to the Court as it is <em>now </em>configured with this new majority at the helm. Ironically, Justice Weaver\u2019s dissenting comments in <em>In re Certified Question from the Fourteenth Dist Court of Appeals of Texas, </em>479 Mich 498; 740 NW2d 206 (2007), are apropos. There, she reiterated her lack of support for MCR 7.305(B), which permits this Court to entertain requests for advisory opinions from foreign courts, because the subrule \u201clacks any limiting language on when the Court may answer a certified question ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550 (Weaver, J, dissenting). A lack of express limits, she opined, \u201cleav[es] the door and the docket open to the whims of the majority.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">As if to illustrate her point, the majority underpins its supposed consideration of the doctrine of stare decisis with its conclusion that our constitutional standing doctrine is \u201cat the expense of the public interest. .. because it may prevent litigants from enforcing public rights, despite the presence of adverse interests and parties, and regardless of whether the Legislature in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>tended a private right of enforcement to be part of the statute\u2019s enforcement scheme.\u201d But this self-serving, rhetorical formulation of the \u201cpublic interest\u201d is entirely of the majority\u2019s own making.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> It ignores that, in this case, there is <em>no </em>indication that the Legislature intended that plaintiffs have a private right to enforce the statute at issue. Most significantly, it ignores the public\u2019s interest <em>as expressed in our constitution, </em>and explained in depth above, in courts that do not have unlimited power and, absent exceptions expressly provided by the constitution, should not exceed the traditional judicial power by intruding on the powers of the executive and legislative branches.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">C. MICHIGAN JURISPRUDENCE IN TURMOIL: THE MAJORITY\u2019S INCREASING WILLINGNESS TO OVERRULE PRECEDENT WITH WHICH IT DISAGREES</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Thus the majority continues to exhibit its absolute disregard for precedent inconvenient to its aims without regard to the consequences. As Justice MARKMAN emphasized in his dissent to the majority opinion in <em>McCormick, </em>487 Mich at 265-266:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">Even a cursory analysis of the majority\u2019s treatment of precedent since it ascended to power in January 2009 reveals a lack of sufficient regard for recent precedents that is directly contrary to their own previous assertions of the need not to needlessly overrule cases on account of stare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>decisis. Past complaints on their part that cases should not be overruled when the only thing that has changed is the membership of the Court have gone by the wayside.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u201c[A]ll the justices who comprise the majority . .. should more clearly recognize the consequences of what they are doing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265 (emphasis omitted). Indeed, in overruling numerous significant cases of this Court\u2014 the growing list of which is catalogued in <em>McCormick </em>by Justice MARKMAN, <em>id. </em>at 266-273 \u2014 in the brief period since the current majority came to power in January 2009, I find the majority\u2019s feigned adherence to the doctrine of stare decisis here hard to swallow. Nothing about the majority\u2019s decision today \u201c \u2018promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, [or] contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 367, quoting <em>Payne v Tennessee, </em>501 US 808, 827; 111 S Ct 2597; 115 L Ed 2d 720 (1991). Rather, the majority throws into turmoil a well-accepted and constitutionally sound standing doctrine <em>applicable to every civil suit filed in this state </em>that this Court adopted to rectify the total uncertainty in this area that was evident in cases such as <em>Detroit Fire Fighters, </em>449 Mich 629. Accordingly, I am nonplussed by Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s ironic lip service to Alexander Hamilton\u2019s warning that, \u201cto \u2018 \u201cavoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that [courts] should be bound down by strict rules and precedents which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them ....\u201d\u2019\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 366, quoting <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 314-315 (opinion by Kelly, J.), quoting The Federalist No. 78, p 471 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed, 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Finally, as Justice MARKMAN has also illustrated, this case presents yet another troubling element of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>majority\u2019s current unbounded disregard for precedent. Here as in several other recent cases, see <em>McCormick, </em>487 Mich at 273-274, instead of accepting the issues as framed and argued by the parties throughout the case, the majority instead directed the parties to brief whether a decision by the former majority should be overruled. Yet, as noted, the parties to this case have <em>always </em>argued that <em>Lee </em>governs their dispute. Even plaintiffs \u2014 for whom the majority renders a favorable decision here \u2014 never challenged the correctness and applicability of <em>Lee </em>to their case. Further, although other groups and members of the public have participated in this case by filing briefs amicus curiae at the majority\u2019s invitation, not a <em>single </em>brief supports plaintiffs\u2019 argument that they have standing <em>here.</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">IV FURTHER RESPONSE TO THE MAJORITY</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Rather than ash, the majority\u2019s stare decisis analysis should taste like bile in their mouths: like a bulimic after a three day bender, the majority justices now <em>purge </em>a decade\u2019s worth of vigorous protestations that they are committed to the principle of stare decisis. As Justice YOUNG demonstrates at length in <em>Univ of Mich Regents, </em>487 Mich at 321-323 (Young, J., dissenting), members of the majority stridently defended stare decisis for many years when past cases supported their dissenting positions. Then-Justice KELLY summed up their posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>tion in <em>Pohutski v City of Allen Park, </em>465 Mich 675, 712; 641 NW2d 219 (2002) (Kelly, J., dissenting), stating: \u201c[I]f each successive Court, believing its reading is correct and past readings wrong, rejects precedent, then the law will fluctuate from year to year, rendering our jurisprudence dangerously unstable.\u201d Yet here they overrule <em>Lee, </em>most notably without <em>ever </em>addressing their former adherence to the <em>LeelLujan </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">As the Court established in <em>Lee </em>and as I recount here, <em>Lee </em>was built on this Court\u2019s historical concepts of standing. By reversing the line of post-Lee cases here, the majority claims that it \u201cbrings this Court back to the <em>status quo ante.\u201d </em>Unfortunately, the pre-Lee status quo resulting from <em>House Speaker, </em>443 Mich 560, was confusion and bitter division regarding rules that provided no clear guidance regarding Michigan\u2019s constitutional standing requirements.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> It is this state to which the majority returns Michigan law. Lee did not sacrifice Michigan standing jurisprudence, as the majority persists in repeating, nor did Lee conclude that federal standing jurisprudence was expressly binding in Michigan. Rather, Lee favored the commonly accepted federal test which brought consistency to Michigan courts in light of our lack of a clearly articulated, workable test. Further, as members of the majority have recognized, there simply is no constitutional \u201cconflict\u201d that would prevent Michigan\u2019s continued use of the <em>Lujan/Lee </em>test for standing.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> These truths \u2014 as well as the overall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>reasonableness of the <em>Lee </em>test \u2014 are evident in the near-unanimous acceptance of the test in <em>Lee </em>itself. How is it possible that the majority now rejects the very test suggested by Justice CAVANAGH himself in <em>Detroit Fire Fighters, </em>accusing the <em>Lee </em>Court of adopting a test that \u201ccasually displaced decades of inconsistent precedent,\u201d \u201cis likely to result in serious detriment to the public interest,\u201d and is \u201ccontrary\u201d to Michigan law? As Justice YOUNG has observed in a similar context,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia may have best described our concerns about the majority\u2019s recent about-face with regard to stare decisis as well as its new approach to standing with the following observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">Evidently, the governing standard is to be what might be called the unfettered wisdom of a majority of this Court, revealed to an obedient people on a case-by-case basis. This is not only not the government of laws that the Constitution established; it is not a government of laws at all. <em>[Morrison v Olson, </em>487 US 654, 712; 108 S Ct 2597; 101 L Ed 2d 569 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Finally, although the majority criticizes me for actually addressing the questions presented in this case, my analysis is necessary <em>precisely because </em>the majority applies an unworkable, amorphous approach to standing. The lower courts had little trouble agreeing, in relatively brief decisions, that plaintiffs do not have standing under the principles enunciated in <em>Lee. </em>But the majority\u2019s approach so obscures the reasons courts impose standing requirements <em>in the first place </em>that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>leaves the dissent in a position akin to one who must \u201cprove a negative\u201d; thus, I attempt to show why the lower courts\u2019 conclusions that plaintiffs clearly could not proceed are indisputably correct under the terms of the statute invoked by plaintiffs to establish standing. Indeed, in light of the express terms of the school code, its enforcement procedures, and its disciplinary provisions, I am baffled by the majority\u2019s conclusion, under its own new discretionary approach, that the trial court abused its discretion by concluding that plaintiffs could not proceed here. How is the majority\u2019s new non-test for standing anything but a proclamation that <em>it </em>will decide, on the basis of personal policy considerations, whether a plaintiff may maintain a suit against a particular defendant?</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">The majority essentially concludes that plaintiffs have standing because their safety might have been one aim of MCL 380.1311a(l) without any regard to the Legislature\u2019s actual intent or to the ramifications of this suit. For example, although <em>no one </em>in this suit represents students\u2019 rights \u2014 and thus no one may consider their rights as the suit proceeds or in an eventual settlement \u2014 the majority presumes that the right result will simply come out in the wash after the complaint is authorized on standing grounds. Indeed, under the majority\u2019s approach, what prevents <em>anyone </em>with a proclaimed \u201csubstantial interest\u201d from suing a defendant such as the school board here in an attempt to trample on the rights of an unrepresented third party?<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Because a plaintiff no longer needs to show a concrete and particularized injury, or that the court actually has the power to grant relief <em>to me </em>from <em>that defendant, </em>or that the legislative body <em>intended to create a cause of action, </em>presumably any such plaintiff can proceed. Particularly by permitting plaintiffs to sue to enforce a governmental agency\u2019s <em>statutory </em>duties with no attention to whether the Legislature <em>intended </em>to create a cause of action, the majority utterly ignores separation of powers principles including the Legislature\u2019s sole purview to legislate such duties and to define the. proper mechanisms for their enforcement.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Consistent with the majority\u2019s deconstruction of Michigan\u2019s guiding legal principles over the last two years, the result boils down to this: in this state, anyone has standing to sue anyone else, any time. As in <em>McCormick, </em>487 Mich 180, for example, where the majority significantly lowered the threshold for suits against Michigan drivers under our automobile no-fault insurance scheme,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> the majority continues to encourage litigation at a high cost to individuals, the courts, local governments and local officials. This complete destabilization of established law benefits no one.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">For each of these reasons, I dissent. I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals, which reached the correct result and properly applied the law of this state. The majority\u2019s conclusion that plaintiffs have standing here is devoid of any analysis and incorrect under any meaningful test. Its decision to grant standing here under an amorphous new test of its own making is unprincipled and opportunistic; in its haste to overrule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>yet another precedent of this Court, it grants teachers the right to sue for expulsion of children from our public schools without any regard for the students\u2019 rights. Finally, its choice to eschew the well-established <em>Lee </em>test aggregates limitless power in the courts, is contrary to our constitution, and will only damage the rule of law in our state.</p>\n<judges id=\"b494-4\">YOUNG and MARKMAN, JJ., concurred with CORRIGAN, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-7\"> The parties addressed this issue only after the majority directed them to do so in this Court\u2019s order granting plaintiffs\u2019 application for leave to appeal. <em>Lansing Sch Ed Ass\u2019n v Lansing Bd of Ed, </em>485 Mich 966 (2009).
