This appeal concerns the prosecutor\u2019s exercise of a peremptory challenge to remove the only African-American venireman from the jury panel. Linsey contends that the trial court erred in ruling that he failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of purposeful discrimination under <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79 (1986), and in refusing to require the prosecutor to explain his reasons for striking the venireman. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>A defendant has \u201ca constitutional right to be tried by a jury selected pursuant to racially neutral and nondiscriminatory guidelines.\u201d <em>Winfield </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 446, 448, 404 S.E.2d 398, 399 (1991), <em>aff'd en banc, </em>14 Va. App. 1049, 421 S.E.2d 468 (1992). A defendant may establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of purposeful discrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment solely on the prosecutor\u2019s exercise of peremptory challenges. <em>Taitano v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va. App. 342, 346, 358 S.E.2d 590, 592 (1987). To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, a defendant must first show that he is a member of a cognizable racial group and that the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges to remove members of the defendant\u2019s race from the jury pool.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 96. Second, a defendant may rely on the fact that peremptory challenges permit \u2018\u201cthose to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Third, a defendant must show that these facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor acted to exclude members of the jury because of their race. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u201cIn <em>Batson, </em>the Supreme Court did not specify the quantum of proof necessary to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of purposeful discrimination.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 176, 182, 380 S.E.2d 1, 4, <em>aff\u2019d en banc, 9 </em>Va. App. 169, 384 S.E.2d 343 (1989). However, the Court identified two relevant circumstances to be considered by the trial court in determining whether a <em>prima facie </em>case has been proven: (1) a \u201cpattern\u201d of strikes against persons of the cognizable racial group in the venire, and (2) the prosecutor\u2019s questions and statements during <em>voir dire </em>and in exercising his peremptory challenges. <em>Id. </em>at 183, 380 S.E.2d at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The record shows that Linsey is an African-American and the prosecutor exercised one of his peremptory challenges to remove from the venire a member of Linsey\u2019s race. Additionally, Linsey is entitled to rely on the fact that the exercise of peremptory challenges permits \u201c\u2018those to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate.\u2019\u201d <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 96. Therefore, the first two prongs of the <em>Batson </em>test have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Moreover, these facts and other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor excluded the African-American juror because of her race. Only one African-American was on the venire of twenty persons. The African-American juror who was struck from the panel was one of six veniremen who did not respond to any questions during <em>voir dire.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Of these six persons who were silent during <em>voir dire </em>questioning, the prosecutor struck only the African-American juror. Here, the prosecutor excused the African-American juror without questioning during <em>voir dire. See Jackson, </em>8 Va. App. at 184, 380 S.E.2d at 5. However, the remaining white jurors who were not questioned by the prosecutor on <em>voir dire </em>were not removed from the venire.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Although the act of striking from the venire the only person of the same race as the defendant does not always, standing alone, establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of purposeful discrimination, <em>see id. </em>at 183, 380 S.E.2d at 4 (citing <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 101 (White, J., concurring)), \u201ca single act of invidious discrimination may form the basis for an equal protection violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 380 S.E.2d at 5. Indeed, in a recent civil case, the Virginia Supreme Court held that a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination was established where the plaintiff exercised a peremptory strike to exclude the only African-American venireman from the panel. <em>Faison v. Hudson, </em>243 Va. 397, 402, 417 S.E.2d 305, 308 (1992)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. In <em>Faison, </em>the plaintiff contended that the evidence was insufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. Although the Court held that this issue was waived when counsel \u201cundertook to articulate reasons for striking [the juror] without first raising the procedural issue whether a <em>prima facie </em>case had been established,\u201d the Court also addressed, and rejected, plaintiff\u2019s contention that no <em>prima facie </em>case of purposeful discrimination had been proven. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">[W]e agree that Faison presented sufficient facts to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. Faison is a black man, and the [plaintiff] removed from the venire the only member of Faison\u2019s race. Additionally, Faison was entitled to rely on the fact, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>cannot be disputed, that peremptory challenges constitute a practice that permits \u2018\u201cthose to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">We hold that Linsey established a <em>prima facie </em>case of purposeful discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cOnce the defendant makes the requisite showing, the burden shifts to the Commonwealth to come forward with a racially neutral explanation for removing persons of defendant\u2019s race from the panel.\u201d <em>See Jackson, </em>8 Va. App. at 181, 380 S.E.2d at 3. In stressing the importance of providing a complete record for appeal of a <em>Batson </em>challenge, we have recognized that \u201c[a] trial court\u2019s finding that no <em>prima facie </em>case has been made cannot operate to short-circuit appellate inquiry into <em>a Batson </em>claim.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>16 Va. App. at 124 n.5, 428 S.E.2d at 39 n.5. Consequently, because Linsey established a <em>prima facie </em>case, the trial court erred in refusing to require the prosecutor to offer a race-neutral explanation for striking the only African-American individual from the venire. Therefore, we reverse and remand for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b82-12\"> When the case was argued, Judge Koontz presided.

Commonwealth, </em>16 Va. App. 118, 123 n.4, 428 S.E.2d 34, 39 n.4 (1993) (quoting <em>Powers v.

Moreover, we do not hold, as the dissent states, that \u201cthis prosecutor\u201d is one of those who is of a mind to discriminate against African-Americans, nor do we infer that he is guilty of invidious discrimination. Neither of these matters is at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b85-9\">Baker, X,</author>\n<p id=\"ADO\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s finding that this record establishes that the prosecutor has been shown or is presumed to be guilty of racial discrimination or misconduct that required the trial court to sustain appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial based upon the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory strike of a black female juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">The majority declares that, \u201cTo establish a <em>prima facie </em>case [requiring a race-neutral explanation for using the peremptory strike], a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>defendant must first show that he is a member of a cognizable racial group and that the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges to remove members of the defendant\u2019s race from the jury pool....

Third, a defendant must show that these facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor acted to exclude members of the jury because of their race.\u201d I concur with those legal propositions; however, I would hold that, as asserted by the prosecutor, \u201ctaking into account [of] the entire totality of the circumstances that this ... issue shouldn\u2019t have been raised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">In response to the argument that striking a black female juror required a race-neutral explanation, the prosecutor expressed indignation at the charge that race was a factor in his strike, and in fact noted that, \u201cin this particular setting being a black male myself... I am offended by the whole inquiry and... I think that taking into account... the . .. totality of the circumstances that this whole issue shouldn\u2019t have been raised.\u201d The prosecutor is clearly explaining that as \u201ca black male [him]self,\u201d he did not consider the juror\u2019s race as his reason for striking her. I cannot join in an opinion that states, as the majority does, that this prosecutor is one of those who is of a mind to discriminate against blacks or that, as the opinion infers, is guilty of \u201cinvidious discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">I would hold that under the totality of the circumstances shown by this record, the trial court did not err when it overruled appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
