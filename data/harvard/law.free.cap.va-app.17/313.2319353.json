This stolen property was discovered in his possession when a car in which he was a passenger was stopped for failure to display proper license tags. On appeal, he argues (1) that he had standing to object to the search of the vehicle and shopping bag, and (2) that the trial court erred in concluding that the search of the shopping bag was a valid inventory search rather than a pretext for an investigatory search, thereby denying his motion to suppress. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">On April 25, 1992, Officer Craig stopped the car in which appellant and two others were traveling because the car displayed no rear license tags. At Craig\u2019s request, the driver produced a rental agreement which showed that the car had been rented the previous day in Georgia, but he produced no driver\u2019s license, stating that his license had expired. Although Craig requested it, the passengers produced no identification. Craig also testified that the two people who had signed the rental agreement were not in the car, but he did not explain how he arrived at this conclusion. The record contains no affirmative evidence that appellant and the other occupants unlawfully possessed the car. Craig testified that, based on the information available to him at that time, he decided to arrest the driver and impound the vehicle be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>cause it was obstructing traffic and neither of the car\u2019s passengers had produced a driver\u2019s license entitling him to move the car to another location.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Craig then asked the driver if the car contained any contraband, drugs, or stolen property. The driver responded that Craig would have to ask appellant. Appellant said Craig would have to ask the driver. During that time, while checking the car\u2019s vehicle identification number, Craig noticed a plastic Hecht\u2019s shopping bag in the rear passenger seat next to appellant. Based on the manner in which the bag was folded and his experience in retail security, Craig concluded that the bag might be lined with foil, a method used by shoplifters to disable the anti-theft tags commonly placed on clothing. Craig testified that, in his experience, \u201ca plastic . . . bag,\u201d after being folded down or rolled up, \u201cwill tend to open back up on its own.\u201d If a bag is foil-lined, by contrast, \u201cit\u2019s as if you fold up a piece of foil, tin foil, into a roll, it stays that way. It . . . keeps its rigidity. It doesn\u2019t open back up.\u201d Craig also knew that possession of such a device is a Class 3 misdemeanor in Virginia. Craig then touched the bag, which \u201cfelt like it was lined with some type of rigid material.\u201d Upon searching the bag, Craig found that it contained six dresses still on the hangers with security tags on them. During the subsequent inventory search, Craig found other stolen items and related paraphernalia in the vehicle. Although Craig asserted that the search at the scene was an inventory search, he admitted that he did not actually prepare a written inventory at the scene. Craig learned later that the vehicle\u2019s license tags were valid under Georgia law.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Based on Officer Craig\u2019s testimony (neither of the defendants testified), the trial court concluded that the search was proper as an inventory search. The Commonwealth never challenged the motion based on lack of standing, and the trial court did not discuss standing in ruling on the motion. Appellant then entered a plea of guilty conditioned on the preservation of his right to appeal the denial of the motion to suppress. Neither the parties nor the court specifically addressed the issue of standing at the trial level.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">We consider first whether appellant had standing to contest the search of the vehicle and shopping bag. This Court has not had occasion to consider this precise issue before. In <em>Josephs </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 87, 91-98, 390 S.E.2d 491, 493-97 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>(1990) (en banc), and <em>McCoy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Va. App. 309, 311, 343 S.E.2d 383, 385 (1986), we discussed some of the overriding legal principles, noting that \u201c[t]he test is whether the appellant objectively had a reasonable expectation of privacy at the time and place of the disputed search. In making the analysis the court looks to the totality-of-the-circumstances.\u201d <em>McCoy, 2 </em>Va. App. at 311, 343 S.E.2d at 385 (citing <em>Rawlings </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>448 U.S. 98, 104 (1980); <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 143 (1978)). Under that test, we concluded in <em>Josephs </em>that a passenger in a stolen vehicle, whose presence was unlawful, had no legitimate expectation of privacy and therefore lacked standing to contest the stop of the vehicle. 10 Va. App. at 98, 390 S.E.2d at 497. Central to the discussion and holding in <em>Josephs </em>was that the car was stolen, and the Court implied that the result might have been different if \u201cthe defendant had permission of the owner to be in the vehicle as a passenger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96, 390 S.E.2d at 495-96. In this case, by contrast, the Commonwealth does not contend that the possession of the automobile was unlawful or that appellant was not lawfully present in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">We conclude that appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the shopping bag located at his feet and, therefore, under the test enunciated above, had standing to contest Officer Craig\u2019s search of the bag. Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s assertions, the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128 (1978), does not compel a different result. In <em>Rakas, </em>the question was \u201ca narrow one: Did the search of their friend\u2019s automobile after they had left it violate any Fourth Amendment right of the petitioners?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151 (Powell, J., concurring), <em>cited with approval </em>in 4 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 11.3(e), at 324 (2d ed. 1987). In addition, in <em>Rakas, </em>the defendants asserted no interest in the property seized. 439 U.S. at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">In this case, by contrast, appellant was present in the car at the time of the search, and the bag was clearly within his reach. The issue here is not so much appellant\u2019s legitimate expectation of privacy in the vehicle itself as it is in the closed shopping bag and its contents. <em>See </em>LaFave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 11.3(e), at 331. This is precisely the issue addressed by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salazar, </em>805 F.2d 1394 (9th Cir. 1986). The Court held in that case that a passenger lawfully present in a vehicle had standing to contest the search of a closed shopping bag found on the floor at his feet. <em>Id. </em>at 1396. This was so, said the court, because \u201c[the defendant] demonstratefd] a[n] [objectively] justifiable expectation of privacy\u201d in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>closed container<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and \u201cone that society is \u2018prepared to recognize as legitimate.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 526 (1984)) (other citations omitted); <em>see also Massachusetts </em>v. <em>King, </em>449 N.E.2d 1217, 1222-23 (Mass. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Although the Commonwealth cites <em>United States v. Hargrove, </em>647 F.2d 411, 412 (4th Cir. 1981), for the proposition that \u201c[a] person who cannot assert a legitimate claim to a vehicle cannot reasonably expect that the vehicle is a private repository for his personal effects, whether or not they are enclosed in some sort of a container, such as a paper bag,\u201d it takes that statement out of context. In <em>Hargrove, </em>the police had a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest, and the evidence showed that he was driving a stolen car and disclaimed ownership of the bag. <em>Id. </em>Because the vehicle was stolen, the court concluded that he had no legitimate expectation of privacy in either the vehicle or its contents, including the paper shopping bag. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress on the ground that the search of the shopping bag violated his fourth amendment rights. On appeal, the burden is on appellant to show, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, that the denial of the motion to suppress constituted reversible error. <em>See Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731, <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1017 (1980). The trial court held that the search was constitutionally permissible as an inventory search conducted pursuant to the valid impoundment of the vehicle. The Commonwealth argues alternatively that the search and seizure were also valid under the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the search was valid under the plain view exception and do not resolve the issue of the validity of the inventory search.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The officer\u2019s actions were supported by probable cause developed pursuant to the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>The theory of the plain view doctrine is that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in items that are in plain view. <em>Horton v. California, </em>496 U.S. 128, 133 (1990). In order to invoke this exception, an officer must meet two requirements: first, he must be lawfully in position to \u201cperceive\u201d a suspicious object, and second, he must have probable cause to believe it to be contraband. <em>Ruffin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 206, 208-09, 409 S.E.2d 177, 179 (1991) (citations omitted). Officer Craig was lawfully present when he observed the bag, for he had stopped the vehicle for a possible license violation. The issue in this case is \u201cwhether it was \u2018immediately apparent\u2019 [to Officer Craig] that the object which he detected . . . was evidence of a crime, contraband or otherwise subject to seizure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This test is satisfied by a showing of probable cause to believe that the item was contraband. <em>See Horton, </em>496 U.S. at 133. We conclude that Officer Craig had probable cause to believe the bag was or contained evidence of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">This case is controlled by the reasoning of <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730 (1983) (plurality opinion), and <em>Carson v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 497, 404 S.E.2d 919, <em>on reh\u2019g, </em>13 Va. App. 280, 410 S.E.2d 412 (1991) (en banc), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>244 Va. 293, 421 S.E.2d 415 (1992), in which the courts applied the plain view exception to the warrant requirement to uphold appellants\u2019 convictions. In <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>an officer conducting a routine driver\u2019s license checkpoint observed a motorist who \u201chad an opaque green party balloon, knotted about one-half inch from the tip[,] \u2018between the two middle fingers of his right hand.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 146, 153, 400 S.E.2d 191, 195 (1991) (quoting <em>Brown, </em>460 U.S. at 734). When asked for his license, the motorist opened the glove compartment, in which the officer saw \u201cseveral small plastic vials, quantities of loose white powder, and an open bag of party balloons.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>460 U.S. at 734. The Supreme Court held that the plain view doctrine allowed the officer to seize and search the balloon because he had probable cause to believe it contained an illegal substance. <em>Id. </em>at 742. In so ruling, it noted that \u201cthe distinctive character of the balloon itself spoke volumes as to its contents\u2014particularly to the trained eye of the officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">We applied this same reasoning in <em>Carson </em>to uphold the seizure of a cut-off straw seen between a motorist\u2019s legs. 12 Va. App. at 502, 404 S.E.2d at 922. Based on the officer\u2019s testimony that it was \u201cthe type straw that people use to ingest cocaine through their noses,\u201d we held that \u201c[t]he distinctive character of the straw coupled with the officer\u2019s experience \u2018would warrant a man of reasonable caution\u2019 to believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>that the straw might be useful as evidence of a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Brown, </em>460 U.S. at 742).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">The uniqueness of the straw\u2019s size distinguishes it from straws one would usually encounter for legitimate purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">Although possible, it is highly unlikely that a straw this size would have a legitimate use. Even assuming a legitimate use exists . . ., probable cause to believe the straw is evidence of a crime may nonetheless be established. Even the uninflated, tied-off balloon in <em>Texas v. Brown </em>may have been simply a remnant of a birthday party and not an item used for carrying narcotics. However, an investigating officer does not have to \u201cdeal with hard certainties, but with probabilities,\u201d and is permitted to make \u201ccommon-sense conclusions about human behavior\u201d in assessing a situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The holding in <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>in which the Virginia Supreme Court held that the officer did not have probable cause to believe that the object detected was \u201cevidence of a crime, contraband or otherwise subject to seizure,\u201d does not require a different result. In <em>Harris, </em>a police officer conducting a lawful patdown search detected a film canister in the motorist\u2019s pocket. 241 Va. at 148, 152, 400 S.E.2d at 192, 194. Because the officer knew from his personal experience as a narcotics officer that film canisters are frequently used to carry narcotics and other drugs, he removed and opened the canister, finding cocaine inside. <em>Id. </em>at 154, 400 S.E.2d at 196. In reversing Harris\u2019 conviction, the Court held that the officer did not have probable cause, as required under the plain view exception, to believe that the film canister contained contraband:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">It is true that [the officer] knew from his personal experience . . . that certain people kept their narcotics and drugs in film canisters and \u201cthings of that nature.\u201d However, law-abiding citizens, on a daily basis, also use film canisters to store film, which is a legitimate use. At best, [the officer] had a \u201chunch\u201d and a report from an [unreliable] informant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 154, 400 S.E.2d at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">Although none of the aforementioned cases is precisely on point, we think the information available to Officer Craig was sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>provide him with probable cause to believe that the shopping bag was evidence of a crime, contraband or otherwise subject to seizure. Although as in <em>Harris, </em>the shopping bag in this case was of the sort that law-abiding citizens put to legitimate use on a daily basis, Officer Craig testified that the manner in which the bag was folded led him to suspect, based on his training and experience, that it was lined with aluminum foil for use as a shoplifting aid. We hold therefore, under the reasoning of <em>Brown </em>and <em>Carson, </em>that the seizure and search of appellant\u2019s bag did not violate the fourth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Moon, C.J., and Duff, S.J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b351-9\"> The United States Supreme Court has held that</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">a constitutional distinction between \u201cworthy\u201d and \u201cunworthy\u201d containers would be improper.
