However, on motion of the parties, the trial court expressly retained jurisdiction to \u201cadjudicate the remedy\u201d provided by Code \u00a7 20-107.3 and subsequently awarded the wife ten percent of the husband\u2019s monthly retirement benefits \u201cfor as long as such benefit is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>paid.\u201d Both parties find this determination in error, and it is jointly challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Pursuant to the earlier divorce decree, the trial court \u201cre-referred\u201d the \u201cmatters of equitable distribution\u201d to a commissioner in chancery (commissioner) \u201cto take testimony and report its findings to [the] court.\u201d Consistent with the evidence presented during the subsequent <em>ore tenus </em>hearing, the commissioner reported that the parties had been married fifteen years at the time of final separation in 1987, during which time both were, and remained, fully employed participants in the Virginia Supplemental Retirement System (VSRS). Husband was employed as a municipal real estate assessor, serving at the pleasure of an elected council and earning $50,446 annually, and wife was a \u201ctenured\u201d public school teacher, earning $29,606. Both were under forty years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Each party asserted a marital interest in the pension of the other, and, in considering these claims, the commissioner was governed by the provisions of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G) which, at the time this action was commenced,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">In addition to the monetary award made pursuant to subsection D, and upon consideration of the factors set forth in subsection E, the court may direct payment of a percentage of the marital share of any pension, profit-sharing or deferred compensation plan or retirement benefits, . . . which constitutes marital property ... . However, the court shall only direct that payment be made as such benefits are payable. No such payment shall exceed fifty percent of the marital share of the cash benefits actually received by the party against whom such award is made. \u201cMarital share\u201d means that portion of the total interest, the right to which was earned during the marriage and before the last separation of the parties. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">The commissioner reported to the trial court that \u201c15/X is the marital share of both pensions,\u201d the numerator, \u201c15,\u201d representing the years of marriage during which the pensions were \u201cearned,\u201d and the denominator, \u201cX,\u201d being the \u201ctotal number of years each worked respectively at their jobs . . . covered by [VSRS],\u201d and recommended that both \u201creceive one-half of the marital share of the other parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>[sic] pension when the other party actually receives same.\u201d Husband excepted to this award, contending that only \u201cpension rights\u201d \u201cearned . . . up to the date of separation\u201d constituted \u201cmarital property\u201d properly included in the marital share, with any later benefits accruing as \u201cseparate property,\u201d free of any marital interest whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Following argument on this exception, the trial judge approved the commissioner\u2019s \u201cformula\u201d but decided to \u201cmodify its effect.\u201d Seeking to equitably reconcile the disparate job security and projected pensions of the parties, the court applied \u201cincome amounts supplied by counsel,\u201d assumed \u201celigibility to receive each pension at age 55,\u201d and then \u201coffset\u201d the recommended pension award for husband \u201cagainst\u201d that recommended for wife, thereby merging the competing claims into a net, \u201cproper offset\u201d of ten percent of the husband\u2019s pension to wife, \u201cat such time as [he] receives same.\u201d The record does not disclose the trial court\u2019s rationale for selecting \u201cage 55\u201d pension values as conclusive of the parties\u2019 interests or detail its \u201coffset\u201d methodology. <em>See Artis v. Artis, </em>4 Va. App. 132, 137, 354 S.E.2d 812, 815 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">On appeal, husband argues that this resolution also allotted to wife ' a share of his pension \u201cearned\u201d as \u201cseparate property\u201d because the \u201cendloaded\u201d VSRS plan determines benefits based upon the highest 36 months of salary and total years of service. Hence, he reasons that the \u201cgreater benefits\u201d of his pension are likely to accrue during the \u201clater [post separation] years\u201d of employment. In response, wife argues that each party is entitled to participate in the \u201cnatural appreciation\u201d attributable to the full marital share of the other\u2019s entire pension, a result assured through the percentage awards recommended by the commissioner. Thus, she also challenges the decree because it determined the mutual pension interests projected, and limited, to age fifty-five.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">A pension, by definition, is \u201ca retirement benefit paid regularly, with the amount of such based generally on length of employment and amount of wages or salary of pensioner. It is deferred compensation for services rendered.\u201d <em>Robinette v. Robinette, </em>10 Va. App. 480, 485, 393 S.E.2d 629, 632 (1990). Pensions constitute an \u201cunusual type of property in that, in most cases, the pension benefits \u00e1re \u2018future oriented\u2019\u201d and not \u201creadily susceptible to valuation or distribution at the time of an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Gamble v. Gamble, </em>14 Va. App. 558, 565-66, 421 S.E.2d 635, 640 (1992). Thus, \u201c[retirement and pension plans, by their nature and diversity, present unique problems\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>in a \u201cdivision of marital wealth,\u201d <em>Keyser </em>v. <em>Keyser, </em>7 Va. App. 405, 412, 374 S.E.2d 698, 702 (1988), and the \u201ctask of the trial court in making an equitable distribution\u201d of such benefits is \u201cnot an easy one.\u201d <em>Steinberg v. Steinberg, </em>11 Va. App. 323, 326, 398 S.E.2d 507, 509 (1990); <em>see also Gamble, </em>14 Va. App. at 566, 421 S.E.2d at 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Nevertheless, when pension benefits comprise a \u201cportion of the pool of marital assets,\u201d they are clearly contemplated by the \u201cscheme\u201d of Code \u00a7 20-107.3, which is intended to justly distribute the \u201cmarital wealth of the parties.\u201d <em>Gamble, </em>14 Va. App. at 569, 421 S.E.2d at 642; <em>see also Robinette, </em>10 Va. App. at 485, 393 S.E.2d at 632. Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G) authorizes the trial court, \u201c[i]n addition to the monetary award made pursuant to subsection D\u201d of the statute, to \u201cdirect payment of a percentage of the marital share of any pension ... or retirement benefits, . . . which constitutes marital property.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(1), (2). Like the monetary award, a pension award must be based \u201cupon consideration of the factors set forth in subsection E\u201d of the statute. Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The \u201cmarital share\u201d of a party\u2019s pension is \u201cthat portion of the total interest, the right to which was earned during the marriage and before the last separation of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Any award from the marital share is limited to that portion which \u201cconstitutes marital property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This is consistent with the marital/separate property dichotomy of Code \u00a7 20-107.3. \u201c[WJhether . . . property is separate or marital is determined by the statutory definition and . . . not ... by legal title.\u201d <em>Garland v. Garland, </em>12 Va. App. 192, 195, 403 S.E.2d 4, 6 (1991). Thus, pension or retirement interests embraced within the statutory marital share are presumptively marital property and the party claiming otherwise must present evidence sufficient to overcome this presumption. <em>See Stroop </em>v. <em>Stroop, </em>10 Va. App. 611, 614-15, 394 S.E.2d 861, 863 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">In <em>Zipf v. Zipf, </em>8 Va. App. 387, 382 S.E.2d 263 (1989), we rejected limitation of a pension award, payable in the future, to a \u201cpresent value calculation\u201d because it denied the benefit of \u201cfuture earnings and adjustments that are attributable to the . . . deferred share\u201d and its \u201cfuture appreciation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 397, 382 S.E.2d at 268-69. \u201cIt is only fair that both parties share in the increased value of the pension,\u201d or one will be \u201creceiving the increase in value\u201d over time which is attributable to the other\u2019s marital interest. <em>Primm </em>v. <em>Primm, </em>12 Va. App. 1036, 1038, 407 S.E.2d 45, 47 (1991). Contrary to husband\u2019s view, such enhancement is clearly a part of the \u201ctotal [pension] interest\u201d component of the marital share equation and obviously distinguish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>able from a judicial award of interest on a deferred share of a pension. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G); <em>Kaufman v. Kaufman, </em>12 Va. App. 1200, 1211-12, 409 S.E.2d 1, 7-8 (1991); <em>Pledger </em>v. <em>Pledger, 6 </em>Va. App. 627, 632, 371 S.E.2d 43, 45 (1988); <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>2 Va. App. 463, 472, 346 S.E.2d 535, 539 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Once the marital share of a pension is ascertained through application of the statutory formula, any percentage award of the marital property constituting such marital share must promote a just allocation of the entire marital estate. <em>See Gamble, </em>14 Va. App. at 570-71, 421 S.E.2d at 642-43. In pursuit of this result, the trial court may order distribution of a portion of a pension benefit as well as a monetary award pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3(D) which \u201cconsiders] the value ... of the marital share of a party\u2019s retirement or pension plan.\u201d <em>Gamer </em>v. <em>Gamer, </em>16 Va. App. 335, 343, 429 S.E.2d 618, 624 (1993). Generally, we defer to the chancellor\u2019s \u2018\u201cresolution of the conflict in the equities\u2019\u201d and will not upset an equitable distribution decree unless he or she \u201c\u2018abused his [or her] discretion, . . . has not considered or has misapplied [a] statutory mandatef],\u201d\u2019 or has acted without support in the evidence. <em>Robinette, </em>10 Va. App. at 486, 393 S.E.2d at 633 (quoting <em>Smoot v. Smoot, </em>233 Va. 435, 443, 357 S.E.2d 728, 732 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Although the trial court correctly approved the marital share equation recommended by the commissioner, it departed from the statutory scheme in an effort to equitably address the particular circumstances of the parties by limiting the marital share of their VSRS pension benefits to values at age fifty-five. This result denied to each party a full participation in the statutory marital share of the other\u2019s entire pension and, though well intentioned, \u201ccannot withstand appellate review.\u201d <em>Hodges </em>v. <em>Hodges, </em>2 Va. App. 508, 517, 347 S.E.2d 134, 139 (1986). To ensure an equitable distribution of the marital wealth in accordance with Code \u00a7 20-107.3, the marital share of the pension must be initially determined in accordance with the statute and any award thereof \u201cconditioned upon the specific limitations\u201d and considerations of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E), as well as any \u201cSubsection (D) monetary award.\u201d <em>Gamble, </em>14 Va. App. at 570-71, 421 S.E.2d at 642-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Accordingly, we reverse the pension awards and remand the case to the trial court for redetermination of these interests consistent with Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G) and this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Willis, J., and Elder, X, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-11\"> <em>See Gaynor v.
