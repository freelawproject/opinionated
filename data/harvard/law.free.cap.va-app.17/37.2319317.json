Smith, Jr., contends that the trial court erred in refusing an instruction permitting the jury to find him guilty of a traffic infraction under Code \u00a7 46.2-613(2) either (1) as a lesser-included offense, or (2) as a \u201csubstantially charged\u201d lesser offense pursuant to Rule 3A:17. We find no error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">On June 17, 1991, Virginia State Trooper Davis stopped Smith, who was driving a tractor trailer on Virginia Route 29. Smith produced a registration card that had been altered. When Trooper Davis asked who had altered the card, Smith replied that he was going to take responsibility for changing the card and that he had done it. Trooper Davis charged Smith with violating Code \u00a7 46.2-605. A jury found Smith guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">Code \u00a7 46.2-605 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-11\">Any person who . . . (iv) holds or uses any certificate, registration card, or assignment, knowing the same to have been altered, forged, or falsified, shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">Code \u00a7 46.2-613 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-13\">No person shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-14\">2. Display ... or have in possession any registration card . . . which he knows is fictitious or which he knows has been canceled, revoked, suspended, or altered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-15\">The violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-613 is a traffic infraction.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-16\">Smith tendered an instruction that would have permitted the jury to find him guilty of violating Code \u00a7 46.2-613(2). He argued that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>statute defined a lesser offense included within Code \u00a7 46.2-605 or, alternatively, that the charge specified under Code \u00a7 46.2-605 substantially charged a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-613(2), and his conviction of the lesser offense was authorized by Rule 3A:17. Refusing this proffered instruction, the trial court held that the two Code sections defined the same offense, that neither was included within the other, that the choice of the offense charged was a matter of prosecutorial discretion, and that the issue on trial was simply whether the offense charged had been proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">I. <em>LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">An accused on trial before a jury is entitled to instructions permitting the jury to convict him of lesser offenses included within the specified charge and proved by the evidence. <em>Miller v. </em>Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 22, 24, 359 S.E.2d 841, 842 (1987); <em>see also Harrison v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 581, 583, 405 S.E.2d 854, 856 (1991).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">A lesser included offense is an offense which is composed entirely of elements that are also elements of the greater offense. Thus, in order for one crime to be a lesser included offense of another crime, every commission of the greater offense must also be a commission of the lesser offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-8\"><em>Kauffmann v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 400, 409, 382 S.E.2d 279, 283 (1989) (citation omitted). Thus, proof of the greater offense necessarily proves the lesser.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">The parties agree that the elements of intent found in Code \u00a7 46.2-605 and in Code \u00a7 46.2-613 are the same, and that the element \u201cholds\u201d (Code \u00a7 46.2-605) and the element \u201chave in possession\u201d (Code \u00a7 46.2-613) are synonymous. Accepting these positions, we focus our inquiry on whether the \u201cuses\u201d element of Code \u00a7 46.2-605 includes the \u201cdisplay\u201d element of Code \u00a7 46.2-613, or whether the two terms are synonymous. We find neither to be the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\"><em>Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary </em>(1977) defines \u201cuse\u201d as follows, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-11\">To accustom, habituate, to put into action or service, avail oneself of, to consume or take regularly, to carry out a purpose or action by means of, utilize, to extend or consume by putting to use, to behave toward, act with regard to, treat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The same dictionary defines \u201cdisplay\u201d as follows, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">To put or spread before the view in display, to make evident, to exhibit ostentatiously.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">While certain conduct might be construed to fall within the definitions of both \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cdisplay,\u201d the two words are not synonymous. The definition of neither necessarily includes the definition of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Code \u00a7 46.2-605 and Code \u00a7 46.2-613 contain the overlapping elements \u201cholds\u201d and \u201chave in possession.\u201d Thus, proof of \u201cholds\u201d or \u201chave in possession\u201d will satisfy either statute. Likewise, conduct which may be construed to constitute either \u201cuse\u201d or \u201cdisplay\u201d will satisfy those elements of either statute. However, because \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cdisplay\u201d are not synonymous, proof of an offense based on one of those terms as an element will not necessarily prove the offense based on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">The Code \u00a7 46.2-605 violation may be proven by proof of \u201cuses.\u201d This would not necessarily prove the offense defined by Code \u00a7 46.2-613 (display or have in possession). Code \u00a7 46.2-613 may be proven by proof of \u201cdisplay.\u201d This would not necessarily prove the elements of Code \u00a7 46.2-605 (holds or uses). Thus, proof of either offense does not necessarily prove the other, and neither is included within the other. Therefore, we hold that Code \u00a7 46.2-613 does not define a lesser offense included in the proscription of Code \u00a7 46.2-605, or vice versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">II. <em>RULE 3A: 17</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">Rule 3A:17, captioned JURY VERDICTS, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-12\">(c) Conviction of Lesser Offense. The accused may be found not guilty of an offense charged but guilty of any offense ... that is substantially charged or necessarily included in the charge against the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-13\">Because of the disparity of specified elements, an accusation under Code \u00a7 46.2-605 neither substantially charges nor necessarily includes a charge under Code \u00a7 46.2-613.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>III. <em>PROSECUTORIAL ELECTION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Where the evidence supports prosecution under either of two parallel statutes, the Commonwealth has the right to elect under which statute to proceed. Where the circumstances surrounding an offense permit prosecution under either of two statutes, the selection of the statute under which to proceed is a matter of prosecutorial election. <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 321, 323-24, 228 S.E.2d 683, 684 (1976). We cannot gainsay the exercise of that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Moon, C.X,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and Coleman, X, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b75-9\">On May 1, 1993, Judge Moon succeeded Judge Koontz as Chief Judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
