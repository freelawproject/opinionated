Burrows alleges that the Commonwealth failed to disclose relevant information concerning a prosecution witness pursuant to a <em>Brady </em>discovery motion and thereby deprived him of due process and his right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we find that the Commonwealth failed in its duty to disclose exculpatory information under the <em>Brady </em>rule, we reverse Burrows\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">Beverly and Joan Burrows, husband and wife, lived in Hanover County. Mrs. Burrows worked at Crestar Bank and developed a friendship with Edward Snowdon, a co-worker. On May 29, 1991, Snowdon received a phone call from Mrs. Burrows; sounding upset, she told Snowdon that they could not speak any more because she loved her husband. A man\u2019s voice broke into the conversation, saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to blow your ass away for talking to my wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">On July 7, 1991, Burrows went to a neighbor\u2019s house and said that his wife had shot herself. Burrows told the neighbor conflicting stories about the incident and made inconsistent statements to the investigating officers. Mrs. Burrows had abrasions on her knees \u201cwhere you would get them if you were kneeling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Prior to trial, the trial court granted Burrows\u2019s <em>Brady </em>discovery motion. Burrows later asked for a continuance so that he could investigate the background of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses. In his motion, Burrows noted that the continuance was necessary in order to procure by independent means information withheld by the Commonwealth. At the hearing on his motion, Burrows stated that he required the continuance to investigate the background and criminal records of individuals he believed would testify for the Commonwealth. Burrows conceded that the Commonwealth did not have to reveal the names of its witnesses prior to trial but noted that the Commonwealth had stated that it would present two witnesses who were \u201cunknown.\u201d Burrows suspected the identity of those witnesses and stated that it would take time to gather the background information. The trial court stated that a continuance on such ground would be at best speculative.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">At trial, the Commonwealth called numerous witnesses, including Theodore Fore. Fore testified that while in jail together, he and Burrows became friends. Fore stated that Burrows admitted planning and carrying out his wife\u2019s murder and spoke about the crime \u201cvirtually every day.\u201d During his testimony, Fore related intimate details of Mr. and Mrs. Burrows\u2019s life and the events that led up to the murder. On cross-examination, Fore admitted that he had previously been convicted of several felonies and was awaiting trial on a charge of breaking and entering. Fore denied that he was testifying against Burrows in exchange for leniency on the pending charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">After his conviction, Burrows moved to set aside the verdict, alleging that Fore had failed to disclose convictions for robbery and Dyer Act violations. Burrows further alleged that numerous other charges against Fore had been \u201cnolle pressed\u201d in exchange for his testimony as a \u201cprofessional witness for the Commonwealth.\u201d Burrows argued that the Commonwealth should have disclosed Fore\u2019s previous relationship with the Commonwealth under the <em>Brady </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Fore\u2019s criminal transcript was presented at the hearing on the motion to set aside the verdict. Beginning in 1974 and continuing over the next eighteen years, that transcript reflects that at least forty-three felony charges against Fore were nolle pressed by the Commonwealth and that seven additional charges brought in Virginia were dismissed. Burrows asserted that the unusual number of charges that were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>pursued was relevant to Fore\u2019s motivation to testify as it indicated his propensity to cooperate with the Commonwealth as a witness in return for leniency. The transcript also showed fourteen felony arrests without disposition from neighboring jurisdictions, arguably indicating that these charges were also dismissed or not pursued under some bargain Fore had made with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">During the hearing, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney stated that, although he would not characterize Fore as a \u201cjailhouse snitch,\u201d he was aware that prosecutors in Chesterfield County had used or attempted to use Fore in that capacity. Prior to calling Fore as a witness, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney admitted that he obtained a copy of Fore\u2019s criminal transcript and had it available at the trial. Burrows argued that even if Fore was not one of the \u201cunknown\u201d witnesses, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney was nonetheless obliged to disclose Fore\u2019s criminal record when it became apparent that Fore would testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">II. COMMONWEALTH\u2019S DUTY TO DISCLOSE EXCULPATORY INFORMATION IN CRIMINAL CASES</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The suppression or withholding by the prosecution of evidence favorable to the accused after a <em>Brady </em>request violates due process when that evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith of the prosecution. <em>Lowe v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 670, 679, 239 S.E.2d 112, 118 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 930 (1978); <em>see Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963). Although reversal is not required whenever \u201ca combing of the prosecutors\u2019 files after the trial has disclosed evidence possibly useful to the defense,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Keogh, </em>391 F.2d 138, 148 (2d Cir. 1968), reversal is the proper remedy when that evidence clearly tends to exculpate the defendant or otherwise depreciates the value of testimony or evidence central to the prosecution\u2019s case. When the \u201creliability of a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence,\u201d evidence affecting the credibility of that witness should not be concealed by the prosecution. <em>Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 269 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The Commonwealth does not suffer an unreasonable burden in providing the criminal background of its witnesses to the defense if required to do so after a <em>Brady </em>motion. <em>Fitzgerald v. Bass, </em>6 Va. App. 38, 51-52, 366 S.E.2d 615, 623 (1988) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 945 (1989). A general request for <em>Brady </em>material and subsequent specific requests for the opportunity to investigate the criminal background of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses entitles a defendant to full disclosure of the criminal record of a witness who has shown a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>propensity for avoiding prosecution by testifying for the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In this case, we see no reason why the Commonwealth could not have provided Burrows with information it readily obtained for its own purposes. Here, the Commonwealth, which was in the best position to know of Fore\u2019s criminal past and his apparent long standing relationship with various Commonwealth\u2019s Attorneys, failed to disclose this information to Burrows despite an implicit request for just such information.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">We do not retreat from the well established rule that there is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case in this Commonwealth. <em>Stotler </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va. App. 481, 483, 346 S.E.2d 39, 40 (1986); <em>see also Watkins v. Commonwealth, 229 </em>Va. 469, 479, 331 S.E.2d 422, 430 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1099 (1986). Rather, we recognize that when a request for discovery is made, the Commonwealth has a duty to deal fairly with an accused.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">Although there is, of course, no duty to provide defense counsel with unlimited discovery of everything known by the prosecutor, if the subject matter of such a request is material, or indeed if a substantial basis for claiming materiality exists, it is reasonable to require the prosecutor to respond either by furnishing the information or by submitting the problem to the trial judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-8\"><em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 106 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Where the criminal record of a witness for the Commonwealth indicates a real possibility of bias or a lack of credibility for that witness, the Commonwealth should take reasonable steps to facilitate defense inquiries into that record. For these reasons, the convictions are reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">Benton, X, and Willis, X, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-14\"> Burrows further alleges that perjury by this same witness during trial requires vacating his convictions and ordering a new trial; however, as resolution of his first issue mandates reversal of his conviction, we do not reach this latter matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-8\"> The record is unclear as to the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion. At one point the court appeared to overrule the motion, but later indicated that it might \u201cgrant your continuance\u201d after hearing Burrows\u2019s suppression motion on the trial date. The court did not enter an order addressing the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b507-12\"> The Commonwealth as much as conceded the relevance of this information during the post-trial hearing when it suggested that Burrows\u2019s trial counsel should have asked Fore specific questions concerning his prior role as a witness for the Commonwealth. This suggests, in essence, that as an alternative to adequate discovery, the burden should be on the defense to \u201ctake shots in the dark,\u201d hoping to expose the bias of a Commonwealth\u2019s witness\u2014a tactic both inefficient to the administration of justice and procedurally improper.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
