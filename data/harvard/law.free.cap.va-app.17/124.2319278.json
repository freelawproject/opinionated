He contends on appeal that the evidence does not support the conviction because the offending pistol was not a weapon carried \u201cabout his person.\u201d We disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">The facts are not in dispute. On July 20, 1991, Officer Lucas of the Suffolk Police Department stopped a vehicle for an \u201cequipment violation.\u201d Defendant was the driver, and a routine license check disclosed that his operator\u2019s license was \u201csuspended.\u201d In such instances, local police policy required that the vehicle be towed to a secure area and, in a related procedure, Officer DeBusk inventoried the contents of the car. DeBusk discovered a \u201cfully loaded\u201d pistol \u201cunder the driver\u2019s floor mat,\u201d \u201ccompletely out of sight,\u201d and \u201cseized the weapon.\u201d Defendant was subsequently \u201ctaken to headquarters and charged\u201d with a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">On cross-examination, DeBusk testified that the gun \u201cwas placed underneath the floor mat on the lower left hand corner, close to the door\u201d of the \u201cdriver\u2019s compartment\u201d and near the edge of the mat. He recalled that \u201c[y]ou could reach your left hand down and pull the weapon out\u201d while \u201csitting in the driver\u2019s seat\u201d without \u201ctoo abrupt a movement.\u201d DeBusk described the location as \u201ceasily accessible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">It is well established that \u201c[t]he judgment of the court sitting without a jury will not be set aside unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. However, a trial court\u2019s conclusion based on evidence that is \u2018not in material conflict\u2019 does not have this bind<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>ing effect on appeal.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 666, 669, 418 S.E.2d 346, 348 (1992) (quoting <em>Hankerson </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>229 Va. 270, 274-75, 329 S.E.2d 791, 794 (1985)). A \u201ctrier of fact . . . \u2018may not arbitrarily disregard uncontroverted evidence of unimpeached witnesses which is not inherently incredible and not inconsistent with facts in the record,\u2019\u201d and a finding under such circumstances presents a question of law, reviewable by this Court on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 669-70,418 S.E.2d at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[i]f any person carries about his person, hidden from common observation, (1) any pistol, revolver, or other weapon ... he shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\u201d \u201cThe purpose of the statute was to interdict the practice of carrying a deadly weapon about the person, concealed, and yet so accessible as to afford prompt and immediate use.\u201d <em>Sutherland v. Commonwealth, </em>109 Va. 834, 835, 65 S.E. 15, 15 (1909); <em>Schaaf v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 429, 430, 258 S.E.2d 574, 574-75 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The Supreme Court has twice addressed the intendment of the statutory language \u201cabout his person.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308. In <em>Sutherland, </em>the Court reasoned that \u201c \u2018[ajbout the person\u2019 must mean that it is so connected with the person as to be readily accessible for use or surprise if desired\u201d and found that a pistol in a \u201cscabbard,\u201d carried in a \u201cpair of saddle-bags, with the lids down,\u201d did not violate the statute. 109 Va. at 835-36, 65 S.E. at 15. Later, in <em>Schaaf, </em>the court revisited the issue and, citing with approval the <em>Sutherland </em>definition of \u201cabout the person,\u201d affirmed the conviction of a woman for carrying a gun in her \u201czippered\u201d handbag. 220 Va. at 430, 258 S.E.2d at 574. Though noting that <em>Sutherland </em>could be distinguished on its facts, the <em>Schaaf </em>court expressly overruled the earlier decision \u201cto the extent that there may be a conflict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432, 258 S.E.2d at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Defendant argues that both <em>Sutherland </em>and <em>Schaaf </em>instruct that an analysis of accessibility turns upon \u201cthe motion required to bring the weapon to bear.\u201d \u201cIf significant body motion ... is required, then . . . the weapon is not readily accessible,\u201d because the movement would displace any element of surprise. Defendant acknowledges on brief that the weapon in issue was \u201c[s]urely ... \u2018accessible\u2019 \u201d but not \u201creadily\u201d so due to the \u201cbody movement required ... to reach the pistol.\u201d This view, however, ignores the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of Code \u00a7 18.2-308 and attendant case law and urges an impermissibly \u201cnarrow and strained\u201d construction of the statute. <em>Crews </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>App. 531, 535-36, 352 S.E.2d 1, 3, <em>appeal refused, </em>360 S.E.2d 715 (Va. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Accessibility of a concealed weapon for \u201cprompt and immediate use\u201d is clearly the evil proscribed by the statute. <em>Sutherland, </em>109 Va. at 835, 65 S.E. at 15; <em>Schaaf </em>220 Va. at 430, 258 S.E.2d at 574-75. Judicial use of the term \u201creadily\u201d simply recognizes that the availability contemplated by the statute means \u201cin a ready manner\u201d or \u201cwithout much difficulty.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>980 (1989). Doubtless, the location of a weapon is a significant circumstance for the court to consider in weighing accessibility. However, a weapon is not, as defendant urges, inaccessible \u201cas a matter of law\u201d if available only upon noticeable \u201cbody motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Here, the loaded pistol was a weapon \u201creadily accessible\u201d to defendant with only the slightest movement and, thus, \u201ccarrie[d] about his person\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308. It was, as the trial judge concluded, \u201cmore accessible . . . than even if [defendant] had had it in his pocket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Accordingly, the trial court correctly construed and applied the statute to the evidence, and we affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Baker, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
