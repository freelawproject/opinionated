(Mister Kleen) and its insurer appeal from an award by the Worker\u2019s Compensation Commission (the commission) of permanent and total disability benefits to Ernest Elmer Clark (Clark) pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.1-56(18), in effect in 1985. Clark cross-appeals on various collateral issues arising out of the commission\u2019s findings, chiefly the determination that Clark \u201cis not entitled to a conclusive presumption of permanent total disability in that his physical and mental condition may improve.\u201d Finding our decision in <em>Barnett v. D.L. Bromwell, Inc., </em>6 Va. App. 30, 366 S.E.2d 271 (1988) (en banc), dispositive to the main issues presented in these appeals, we affirm the findings of the commission in part, reverse in part, and remand the case to the commission for final action.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">On January 25, 1985, doctors diagnosed Clark as suffering from cryptococcal meningitis caused by massive exposure to a fungus found in dried pigeon droppings. The parties do not dispute that Clark contracted the disease in the course of his employment. Clark received temporary total disability benefits beginning February 4, 1985. A deputy commissioner approved Clark\u2019s November 27, 1991 application for permanent total disability benefits. On review, the commission affirmed the finding of permanent total disability, but the commission also found that Clark\u2019s condition might improve, rendering him ineligible for a conclusive finding of permanent total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">The medical evidence shows that as a result of brain damage Clark suffers short-term and long-term memory loss, depression, suicidal ideation, fatigue and that he has unexplained, sometimes violent, outbursts. Numerous medical experts have stated that Clark\u2019s level of mental ability would never improve to the point that he could actively pursue gainful employment. Only Dr. Ignacio Rodriguez opined that Clark might perform some form of manual labor that did not require operating heavy machinery or climbing at unprotected heights. Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Rodriguez\u2019s evaluation of Clark\u2019s condition and its etiology varied markedly from that of the other physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">At the time of Clark\u2019s initial disability claim, Code \u00a7 65.1-56(18) provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">[A]n injury to the brain resulting in incurable imbecility or insanity, shall constitute total and permanent incapacity, to be compensated according to the provisions of \u00a7 65.1-54.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">In <em>Barnett, </em>the claimant suffered severe brain damage as a result of a head injury. The commission initially declined to award permanent total disability, reasoning that the claimant, though no longer employable, did not meet the technical definition of the outdated term \u201cimbecility.\u201d We disagreed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">[T]he legislature intended a non-technical meaning of the term imbecility which is consistent with the functional approach of <em>[Virginia Oak Flooring Co. </em>v. <em>Chrisley, </em>195 Va. 850, 80 S.E.2d 537 (1954)] and the humane purposes of the Act. In that context an irreversible brain injury which renders the employee <em>permanently unemployable </em>and so affects the non-vocational quality of his life by eliminating his ability to engage in a range of usual cognitive processes is the functional equivalent, and meets the intended statutory definition, of incurable imbecility contemplated by Code \u00a7 65.1-56(18) and is compensable pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.1-54.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-9\"><em>Barnett, </em>6 Va. App. at 36, 366 S.E.2d at 274 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">The facts of the present case clearly fall within the definition set out in <em>Barnett. </em>The effects of meningitis have rendered Clark permanently unemployable. Contrary to assertions made by the employer, the record contains ample evidence of irreversible and severe limitations and reductions of the non-vocational quality of Clark\u2019s life, eliminating his ability to engage in many usual cognitive processes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While the record may contain a limited amount of conflicting medical testimony, the resolution of that conflict rests firmly with the commission and we will not disturb its finding on appeal. <em>Penley </em>v. <em>Island Creek Coal Co., </em>8 Va. App. 310, 318, 381 S.E.2d 231, 236 (1989). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the commission to award permanent total disability pursuant to the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.1-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">We now turn to the issues raised by the claimant\u2019s cross-appeal. Clark first contends that the commission erred in not finding that his condition gives him a conclusive presumption of permanent disability. The provisions of Code \u00a7 65.1-54, in effect on the date of Clark\u2019s initial claim, provide for lifetime benefits without limit as to the total amount for permanent total incapacity as defined by Code \u00a7 65.1-56(18), in clear distinction from other types of permanent impairment. <em>Barnett, </em>6 Va. App. at 36, 366 S.E.2d at 274. Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.1-54 and 65.1- 56(18) read together can admit no other interpretation than that the legislature intended a determination of incapacity under Code \u00a7 65.1- 56(18) to raise a conclusive presumption of eligibility for benefits under Code \u00a7 65.1-54. <em>See Barnett, </em>6 Va. App. at 36-37, 366 S.E.2d at 274. Accordingly, we reverse the commission\u2019s finding that Clark should not receive the benefit of a conclusive presumption of permanent total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Lastly, Clark raises two issues relating to the reduction of attorney\u2019s fees by the commission and the commission\u2019s decision not to assess the burden of that award to the employer and insurer. Because the award and assessment of attorney\u2019s fees rest within the sound discretion of the commission, we will not disturb these findings absent a showing of abuse of that discretion. <em>Jensen Press </em>v. <em>Ale, </em>1 Va. App. 153, 159, 336 S.E.2d 522, 525-26 (1985). Finding none here, we affirm the ruling of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">For the reasons stated above, the decision of the commission is affirmed in all respects except as to the determination of the conclusive presumption of permanent total disability. On this issue, the finding of the commission is reversed and the case remanded to the commission for final action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">Barrow, X, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-11\"> For example, the record reflects that Clark is unable to \u201cengage in recreational activities such as fishing. He cannot remember to take his prescription medication and from time to time forgets to read reminder notes as to medication.\u201d He is not able to recall a telephone call within moments after completing it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b511-11\">Coleman, X,</author>\n<p id=\"AXW\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">In my opinion, the evidence is insufficient to support the commission\u2019s finding that Clark comes within the <em>Barnett </em>definition of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>\u201cimbecile\u201d entitling him to lifetime benefits under former Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.1-56(18) and 65.1-54. In the <em>Barnett </em>case, we stated, \u201can irreversible brain injury <em>which renders the employee permanently unemployable and so affects the non-vocational quality of his life by eliminating his ability to engage in a range of usual cognitive processes </em>is the functional equivalent... of incurable imbecility.\u201d 6 Va. App. at 36, 366 S.E.2d at 274 (emphasis added). The majority\u2019s holding that \u201cthe facts of the present case clearly fall within the definition set out in Barnett\u201d is incorrect, in my opinion. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Under the <em>Barnett </em>definition for \u201cincurable imbecility,\u201d an employee\u2019s injury must not only render him unemployable, but must also affect the quality of his life by \u201celiminating\u201d his ability to use his \u201cusual cognitive processes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cCognition\u201d is defined as \u201can intellectual process by which knowledge is gained about perceptions or ideas; distinguished from affection and conation.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>440 (3d ed. 1981). \u201cAffection\u201d in the psychological sense is defined as \u201cthe feeling aspect of consciousness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35. \u201cConation\u201d is \u201cthe conscious drive to perform apparently volitional acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468. Simply put, cognition involves thinking. Affection involves emotion, and conation involves instinctive volitional acts. In the <em>Barnett </em>case, Mrs. Barnett\u2019s quality of life was essentially \u201celiminat[ed]\u201d by her lack of \u201ccognitive\u201d ability. She did not have basic cognitive skills, such as the ability to speak, write, read with understanding or follow instructions, that are critical to a person\u2019s quality of life. <em>Id. </em>at 32-33, 366 S.E.2d at 272. While Mrs. Barnett\u2019s situation may have been to the extreme and may not be representative of the threshold standard for a compensable brain injury, nevertheless, the quality of the person\u2019s life must be so diminished by the elimination of one\u2019s ability to engage in usual cognitive functions that one is rendered the equivalent of an incurable imbecile.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The mental and psychological deficits afflicting Mr. Clark are very different from a mental defect affecting a person\u2019s ability to reason and understand. Mr. Clark suffers from \u201cmemory loss, depression, suicidal ideation, fatigue and . . . has violent outbursts.\u201d His injury does not \u201caffectf] the non-vocational quality of his life by <em>eliminating </em>his ability to engage in a range of usual cognitive processes\u201d so as to render him the functional equivalent of an incurable imbecile. <em>Barnett, </em>6 Va. App. at 36, 366 S.E.2d at 274 (emphasis added). Although he suffers severe mental and psychological problems, Mr. Clark possesses a variety of mental functions and skills. While some of his residual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>skills might arguably be marketable, certainly Clark\u2019s injury has not \u201celiminat[ed] his ability to engage in a range of usual cognitive processes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He is able to drive his car, and he possesses a valid operator\u2019s license. He remembers the names and location of all of his doctors. He has memorized his own telephone number and area code. He remembers his own birthday and that of his wife. He is aware of his surroundings and understands the events that occur around him. He has the ability to read and understand the newspaper and is able to watch television. While Mr. Clark\u2019s abilities are limited, they belie the majority\u2019s conclusion that he is the equivalent of an \u201cincurable imbecile\u201d as defined by Code \u00a7 65.1-56(18).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">I am not unsympathetic to the severity of Mr. Clark\u2019s injury and his inability to control his depression and the fact that he has violent outbursts and suicidal tendencies. Nevertheless, his mental and emotional problems do not come within the purview of Code \u00a7 65.1-56(18) as defined by <em>Barnett. </em>The legislature did not intend by virtue of Code \u00a7 65.1-56(18) to compensate an employee for life who receives a serious brain injury, except when the injury is so severe as to render the employee the equivalent of an incurable imbecile. The mere fact that the commission entered an award which could be modified if and when Clark\u2019s condition improved recognized that his condition was not that of an \u201cincurable imbecile.\u201d For these reasons, I disagree with the majority that Mr. Clark\u2019s condition fits within the definition of his being an \u201cincurable imbecile\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.1-56(18). I would reverse the commission and dismiss the claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
