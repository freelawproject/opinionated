We hold that the defendant\u2019s communication to the attorney was privileged and was not admissible into evidence without the defendant\u2019s waiver of the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">During a search of the accomplice\u2019s apartment, the police found the defendant, the accomplice and a third person in the kitchen. When found, the accomplice was trying to stuff a paper bag behind a washing machine. The bag contained money and heroin. The defendant, who was standing five feet from the accomplice, was searched and found to have heroin in his coat pocket. The police charged the defendant with possession of heroin with the intent to distribute. The police also charged the accomplice, who later pleaded guilty to possession of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">After a public defender was appointed to represent the defendant, the accomplice\u2019s attorney requested that the defendant meet with him and the accomplice. The defendant went, without his appointed attorney, to the office of the accomplice\u2019s attorney.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant testified that he went to the meeting voluntarily and with the expectation that the accomplice\u2019s attorney and his own attorney would be working on the case together. At trial, the attorney testified that during the meeting the defendant admitted that the heroin in the bag belonged to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>An attorney may not divulge a professional confidence made to him by his client. <em>Commonwealth v. Edwards, </em>235 Va. 499, 508-09, 370 S.E.2d 296, 301 (1988). This privilege extends to communications among co-defendants and their attorneys when engaged in consultation about their defense. <em>Chahoon v. Commonwealth, </em>62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 822, 836-42 (1871). It is \u201cnatural and reasonable, if not necessary, that . . . parties, . . . charged with the same crimes, should meet together in consultation with their counsel, communicate to the latter all that might be deemed proper for them to know, and to make all necessary arrangements for the defence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 839. \u201c[I]t follows as a necessary consequence, that all the information, derived by any of the counsel from such consultation, is privileged, and the privilege belongs to each and all of the clients, and cannot be released without the consent of all of them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 842. This rule applies even to a defendant present at such a conference without his attorney. <em>See id. </em>at 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">This privilege has not been overruled or discarded; on the contrary, it has been reaffirmed. In a recent case arising in Virginia, the Fourth Circuit recognized the continued vitality of the \u201ccommon interest rule.\u201d <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, 89-3 and 89-4, John Doe 89-129, </em>902 F.2d 244, 249 (4th Cir. 1990). Whether an action is civil or criminal, potential or actual, whether the commonly interested parties are plaintiffs or defendants, \u201cpersons who share a common interest in litigation should be able to communicate with their respective attorneys and with each other to more effectively prosecute or defend their claims.\u201d <em>Id.; see also In the Matter of Bevill, Bresler &amp; Schulman Asset Management Corp., </em>805 F.2d 120, 126 (3d Cir. 1986); <em>United States v. Bay State Ambulance &amp; Hosp. Rental Serv., Inc., </em>874 F.2d 20, 28 (1st Cir. 1989); <em>United States </em>v. <em>McPartlin, </em>595 F.2d 1321, 1336 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 833 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Although the defendants in <em>Chahoon </em>were charged with a conspiracy and had been indicted jointly, the principle recognized in <em>Chahoon </em>is not limited to prosecutions for conspiracies or to persons charged in a joint indictment. The court did not rest its decision on either of these circumstances. <em>Chahoon, </em>62 Va. (21 Gratt.) at 841 (defendant appealed convictions for forging and uttering for which the defendants were severally indicted). Instead, the court spoke of the need for such a privilege among persons charged with the same crime and grounded its decision on the need of such persons to consult together about their defense and the futility of such consultation without the protection of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>fered by the privilege. <em>Id. </em>at 842. <em>See also In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, </em>902 F.2d at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The police charged the defendant and the accomplice with the same crime and each was represented by counsel. The defendant, having not been advised otherwise, reasonably may have thought that he, the accomplice and their attorneys were mutually engaged in the defense of both him and his accomplice. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s communications to his accomplice\u2019s attorney were shielded by the attorney-client privilege, even though they were not charged with a conspiracy and were not jointly indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The presence of another, unrepresented third party at the meeting does not waive the defendant\u2019s privilege in this case. Here, the third party, though ultimately not charged, was with the defendant and the accomplice in the apartment with the drugs when the police searched. Thus, she was a potential co-defendant and shared an interest in a common defense effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The defendant\u2019s objection to the admissibility of the attorney\u2019s testimony, although failing to refer the trial judge to any specific authority or to expressly articulate the problem as one of attorney-client privilege, was sufficient to permit our review of the issue on appeal. An objection \u201cis sufficient . . . if \u2018at the time the ruling or order of the court is made or sought, [a party] makes known to the court the action which he desires the court to take or his objections to the actions of the court and his grounds therefor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 476, 480, 405 S.E.2d 1, 2 (1991) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The Attorney General attacks only the adequacy of the defendant\u2019s description of his grounds for the objection. The defendant objected before the attorney testified, asking that he not be permitted to testify concerning what the defendant said to him at the meeting. Thus, the objection was made timely, and the action the defendant sought and the basic grounds for the action were clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">The defendant\u2019s attorney based the objection on \u201cthe policy under the <em>Miranda </em>rulings and under the ethical canons that address this kind of issue.\u201d While she did not expressly state that the objection was based on the attorney-client privilege, the objection concerned the professional role of the accomplice\u2019s attorney and the defendant\u2019s need to consult with his attorney, concerns that also underlie the application of the attorney-client privilege. The application of the privi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>lege infrequently occurs in this context, as is demonstrated by the absence of any reported appellate decision in Virginia concerning this issue in over one hundred years. The trial judge understood what was being asked of him and knowingly ruled on the issue. We hold that the objection of the defendant\u2019s attorney sufficiently preserved the issue for consideration on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Finally, this error was not harmless. Prejudice is evident from the trial judge\u2019s explicit statement that he disbelieved the defendant\u2019s testimony insofar as it conflicted with the attorney\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court erred in admitting the evidence of the defendant\u2019s statement to his accomplice\u2019s attorney. The judgment of conviction is, therefore, reversed, and the proceeding is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Benton, X, and Coleman, X, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-11\"> A lawyer is prohibited from communicating \u201cwith a party he knows to be represented by a lawyer . . . unless he has the prior consent of the lawyer representing such other party or is authorized by law to do so.\u201d DR 7-103. We are unable to determine in this case if the accomplice\u2019s attorney violated this disciplinary rule, nor are we required to do so. However, our failure to so conclude should not be construed as approval of the attorney\u2019s action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
