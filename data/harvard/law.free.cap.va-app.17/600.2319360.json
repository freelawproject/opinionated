The trial court convicted Thomas upon his pleas and ordered a presentence report pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-299. After receipt of that report and a hearing, the trial court sentenced Thomas to fifteen years in the penitentiary and a five year suspended sentence. On appeal, Thomas contends that, in fixing sentence, the trial court erred in considering offenses and conduct for which he was not on trial. A majority of the panel holds that the trial court erred in considering, as part of the \u201chistory of the accused\u201d Thomas\u2019 prior acquittal on another criminal charge. For the reasons set forth in Part II, I disagree and dissent from that holding. However, because another member of the panel further holds that the error was harmless under the circumstances of the case, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">On September 17, 1991, a grand jury indicted Thomas on two charges of solicitation to commit a felony in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-29 and on four charges of receiving stolen property in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-108 and 18.2-95. On January 21, 1992, a grand jury indicted Thomas on twenty-one additional charges of receiving stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">On February 24, 1992, pursuant to a plea agreement, Thomas pled guilty to the charge of solicitation to commit a felony and to three charges of grand larceny by receiving stolen goods. The agreement provided that the other twenty-two charges of receiving stolen property would be dismissed. The agreement further provided that on the charges to which he pled guilty, Thomas would receive sentences to be fixed by the trial court but not to exceed twenty years in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">The trial court convicted Thomas of the four charges to which he had pled guilty. It dismissed the other twenty-two charges, ordered a presentence report pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-299, and continued the case for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">At the April 27, 1992 sentencing hearing, Thomas\u2019 counsel objected to introduction of the presentence report because it referred to a 1976 charge resulting in a not guilty verdict, to a 1973 charge show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>ing no disposition, and to evidence of the two year sting operation and investigation that resulted in all twenty-six charges brought against Thomas. Overruling this objection, the trial court stated: \u201c[T]he record in this case is clear on the day of the entering of the pleas that there were four charges and the rest of the information is for the Court\u2019s purposes only .... [T]he Court has the right to ask its probation officer to furnish it all the information that it can acquire so that the Court will have a full view in the sentencing process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">After considering the presentence report, other evidence, and argument of counsel, the trial court sentenced Thomas to a five year suspended sentence on the solicitation conviction and to consecutive five year sentences on the three receiving stolen property convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Upon finding an accused guilty of a felony,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">the court may, or on motion of the defendant shall, before imposing sentence direct a probation officer of such court to thoroughly investigate and report upon the history of the accused, including a report of the accused\u2019s criminal record as an adult and available juvenile court records, and all other relevant facts, to fully advise the court so the court may determine the appropriate sentence to be imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Code \u00a7 19.2-299(A). The phrase \u201chistory of the accused\u201d includes, but is not restricted to, the defendant\u2019s history of criminal convictions. <em>See LeVasseur v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 593-94, 304 S.E.2d 644, 660 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1063 (1984). A sentencing judge may consider hearsay contained in a probation report. <em>O\u2019Dell </em>v. Commonwealth, 234 Va. 672, 701, 364 S.E.2d 491, 508, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 871 (1988). He may rely upon a defendant\u2019s criminal record. <em>See Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 721, 725, 292 S.E.2d 362, 364 (1982) (Russell, J., dissenting). He may consider prior juvenile adjudications, <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>234 Va. at 701-02, 364 S.E.2d at 506-07, dismissed juvenile charges and pending charges, <em>United States v. Madison, </em>689 F.2d 1300, 1312 (7th Cir. 1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1117 (1983), charges for which the accused has been indicted, but not convicted, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bowdach, </em>561 F.2d 1160, 1175 (5th Cir. 1977), offenses for which the defendant has been convicted but not sentenced, <em>People v. Madonna, </em>651 P.2d 378, 387 (Colo. 1982) (en banc), convictions on appeal, <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 289, 297-98, 302 S.E.2d 520, 525-26, <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 865 (1983), and evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>of unadjudicated criminal activity, <em>Beaver v. </em>Commonwealth, 232 Va. 521, 529, 352 S.E.2d 342, 347, <em>cert. denied, </em>483 U.S. 1033 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Thomas relies upon <em>Callahan v. </em>Commonwealth, 8 Va. App. 135, 379 S.E.2d 476 (1989), and <em>Brown </em>v. Commonwealth, 8 Va. App. 126, 380 S.E.2d 8 (1989). In my opinion, these cases are inapposite. <em>Callahan </em>dealt not with the permissible content of a presentence report under Code \u00a7 19.2-299, but with the scope of evidence that may be presented before a jury. <em>Brown </em>dealt with the imposition of sentence for a crime other than the one for which the accused had been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">So long as a sentence falls within the statutory limits for the crime, it lies within the discretion of the trial judge to \u201cconsider a criminal record as bearing upon a tendency to commit offenses, the probabilities of rehabilitation, and similar factors.\u201d <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>458 F.2d 704 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 880 (1972); <em>see Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 540, 413 S.E.2d 661 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">The recitation of Thomas\u2019 personal and criminal history in the presentence report was, in my opinion, proper for the trial court\u2019s consideration. The trial judge\u2019s remarks from the bench affirm that he considered that information in the proper context. The sentences imposed were within the limits imposed by law and were consistent with the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b637-12\">Koontz, X,</author>\n<p id=\"A7R\">concurring in result.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">In my view, the phrase \u201chistory of the accused\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 19.2-299(A) does not contemplate the inclusion of a \u201cnot guilty\u201d finding in a prior criminal case in a presentence report prepared for a defendant\u2019s sentencing on a current, unrelated criminal conviction. In the context of a trial court\u2019s consideration of a defendant\u2019s presentence report, such an acquittal is distinctly different from criminal charges unresolved, dismissed, or never prosecuted. <em>Cf. Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 736, 273 S.E.2d 784 (1981) (distinguishing a dismissal pursuant to a legal defense and one pursuant to a factual defense for double jeopardy purposes). When preparing a presentence report pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-299(A), an acquittal on the merits of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>prior criminal charge should be considered an unambiguous determination of innocence and excluded from the report. To do otherwise would allow an inference of an adverse contact with the criminal justice system, rendering the American verdict \u201cnot guilty\u201d analogous to the Scots verdict, \u201cnot proven.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Fundamental fairness dictates that once acquitted, a defendant should not have to defend further his or her innocence. The fact of a prior acquittal is simply not relevant information for the judge to consider in appropriately determining the fate of the defendant. Whatever the rule may be in other jurisdictions, the rule in this Commonwealth should be clear. Accordingly, I would hold that it was error to permit the inclusion of Thomas\u2019 1976 acquittal of a criminal charge in his 1992 presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">In Thomas\u2019 case, however, the error of including the prior acquittal in his presentence report was clearly harmless error. Thomas entered guilty pleas to the current charges, and the trial judge sentenced him within the limits imposed by law and consistent with the plea agreement. The record supports the conclusion that the trial judge did not impose an increased penalty upon consideration of Thomas\u2019 prior acquittal of the 1976 criminal charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-10\"> The Soots verdict \u201cnot proven\u201d allowed the jury to assert that the evidence was insufficient, but that they nonetheless possessed a belief in the defendant\u2019s guilt. Though discharged from custody, the verdict left the defendant under a cloud of suspicion. Such a notion is anathema to the presumption of innocence. Although it may be true that society views with suspicion those acquitted of crimes, that prejudice should not be used by the state to justify enhanced punishment for a subsequent conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b638-8\">Benton, X,</author>\n<p id=\"AgE\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">The trial judge considered Thomas\u2019 acquittal to be an adverse contact with the criminal justice system for purposes of sentencing and, thus, an incident \u201cof the accused\u2019s criminal record.\u201d Nothing in Code \u00a7 19.2-299(A) permits a Virginia trial judge at sentencing to consider the fact that a defendant was tried and acquitted in a criminal case. Decisions of federal courts and courts of other states are irrelevant to the question whether Code \u00a7 19.2-299(A) permits a Virginia judge to consider an acquittal on a criminal charge as a negative indication of character because it establishes that the defendant had contact with the criminal justice system. I find no basis to conclude that under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Code \u00a7 19.2-299(A) the fact of an acquittal may be considered as a part of a presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Recently, in a case arising from a sentencing in this same trial court, this Court rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the trial judge may consider at the sentencing phase improper information. <em>See Craddock v. </em>Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 402, 429 S.E.2d 889 (1993). There, we reversed the sentence and remanded the case for resentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 407, 429 S.E.2d at 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">I would reverse the sentencing order in this case and remand this case for resentencing on a probation report that excludes from the \u201ccriminal record\u201d references to the fact of acquittal and references to cases that indicate \u201cno disposition located.\u201d For these reasons, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
