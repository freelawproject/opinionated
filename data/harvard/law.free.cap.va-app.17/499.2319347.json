East\u2019s (claimant) condition and consequent disability is a compensable ordinary disease of life; (2) claimant received a communication of an occupational disease; (3) claimant\u2019s last injurious exposure was with this employer; (4) claimant\u2019s condition was totally disabling; and (5) a deposition of claimant taken in a prior claim was properly excluded. Finding no error, we affirm the commission\u2019s award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Claimant suffers from de Quervain\u2019s disease, which manifests itself by severe pain in her left hand. Claimant worked for employer, a maker of tire valves, for twenty-four years. Her job as a \u201cproduction machine operator\u201d involved the repetitive use of her left hand to inspect and handle small components. Claimant sought benefits for an occupational disease, specifically, de Quervain\u2019s tenosynovitis. She worked for employer from December 5, 1966 until November 9, 1990, when she resigned because she was moving from the area. At the time of her resignation, she did not report to employer that she was experiencing pain in her hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">After claimant resigned from her job with employer, she had two relatively short-term jobs as a sewing machine operator. First, she worked for Amelia Dress Company from November 12, 1990 until February 28, 1991. Thereafter, she worked for Courtland Manufacturing Company d/b/a \u201cBrandy Ann\u201d from April 15, 1991 until May 23, 1991. These jobs also required repetitive wrist movements. Prior to claimant\u2019s employment with Brandy Ann, her symptoms of severe hand and wrist pain increased in early April 1991, prompting her to seek treatment from Dr. Haney on May 6, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Throughout claimant\u2019s employment with Piedmont she experienced wrist pain and underwent three operations for carpal tunnel syndrome. After claimant\u2019s last carpal tunnel release in May 1979, she was released to return to work. The commission found that claimant continued to have pain in her left hand. She again sought treatment for the condition on June 8, 1989, with Dr. von Oesen and, at that time, had a \u201cpositive Finklestein test,\u201d which is indicative of de Quervain\u2019s disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">On May 6, 1991, claimant sought treatment with Dr. Haney, another orthopedist. In an addendum to the May 6, 1991 office visit, Dr. Haney diagnosed claimant as having \u201cDeQuervain\u2019s [tenosynovitis] of the left hand and wrist.\u201d Dr. Haney described this condition as \u201csecondary to overuse syndrome or repetitive trauma syndrome, [and specifically attributed it to claimant\u2019s] previous employment [with Piedmont] where she had to use her hand repetitively over a long period of time.\u201d According to Dr. Haney, claimant\u2019s condition was so pronounced that she could \u201cno longer perform the type of work she [had] been doing in the past\u201d and was \u201cdisabled from any work\u201d requiring \u201crepetitive motion of her hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">On June 24, 1991, Dr. von Oesen confirmed that claimant had \u201cde Quervain\u2019s disease\u201d affecting her left hand. Dr. von Oesen referred claimant to Dr. Dunstan as a possible surgical candidate. Dr. Dunstan, however, did not agree with the diagnosis of de Quervain\u2019s, and attributed claimant\u2019s symptoms to degenerative arthritis. Dr. Dunstan could not ascribe that condition solely to the claimant\u2019s exposure at \u201cthe work place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The commission, in affirming the award of the deputy commissioner, found that claimant suffered from de Quervain\u2019s tenosynovitis, a disease. The commission considered claimant\u2019s condition an ordinary disease of life pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-401, and found that claimant\u2019s evidence was sufficient to meet the requirements of Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-400 and 65.2-401.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">The commission found that claimant suffered her last injurious exposure to the causative hazards of the disease while working at Piedmont. This finding was based on the additional finding that claimant\u2019s symptoms predated her employment with Amelia or Brandy Ann and that claimant\u2019s treating physician specifically identified claimant\u2019s work at Piedmont as the cause of her condition. The commission also found that claimant was totally disabled because no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>medical evidence indicated that the claimant had any remaining capacity to work. Lastly, claimant\u2019s deposition was excluded by the commission because \u201ctwo of the parties to the current claim, i.e., Amelia and Brandy Ann, were not parties to the earlier proceeding and, therefore, had no notice of the deposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">CLAIMANT\u2019S CONDITION IS A \u201cDISEASE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">As a threshold matter, employer argues that de Quervain\u2019s tenosynovitis is not a disease, but, rather, a repetitive trauma injury. As our Supreme Court recently explained in <em>Merillat Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Parks, </em>246 Va. 429, 436 S.E.2d 600 (1993), the Act \u201crequires that the condition for which compensation is sought as an occupational disease must first qualify as a disease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432, 436 S.E.2d at 601. A disease is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">any deviation from or interruption of the normal structure or function of any part, organ, or system (or combination thereof) of the body that is manifested by a characteristic set of symptoms and signs and whose etiology, pathology, and prognosis may be known or unknown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-8\"><em>Sloane-Dorland Ann. Medical-Legal Dictionary </em>209 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Claimant\u2019s specific condition, de Quervain\u2019s disease, is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">[Pjainful tenosynovitis due to relative narrowness of the common tendon sheath of the abductor pollicis longus and the extensor pollicis brevis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">The medical evidence proves that on June 8, 1989, claimant was seen by Dr. von Oesen for \u201ca swollen and painful left hand . . . [with] a significant area of tenderness.\u201d At that time, claimant had \u201ca <em>positive Finklestein test, </em>normal neurologic otherwise.\u201d (emphasis added). The evidence is uncontroverted that a positive Finklestein test is indicative of de Quervain\u2019s disease. On June 24, 1991, Dr. von Oesen completed an \u201cAttending Physician Report,\u201d wherein he diagnosed claimant\u2019s condition as \u201cde Quervain\u2019s disease.\u201d On October 18, 1991, Dr. Haney, claimant\u2019s primary treating physician, opined that claimant\u2019s condition \u201cis degenerative joint disease of the carpometacarpal joint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>We conclude from the medical evidence in the record that credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding \u201cthat the claimant\u2019s evidence establishes that she suffers from DeQuervain\u2019s tenosynovitis, a disease.\u201d This case is distinguishable from <em>Merillat, </em>a case involving a rotator cuff tear, because in that case there was no determination that the tear to claimant\u2019s rotator cuff was a disease. In addition, the Supreme Court noted that \u201call the testifying physicians except one described the rotator cuff tear as an injury. . . . [and] [b]ased on this record, the rotator cuff tear suffered by Parks must be classified as an injury, not a disease.\u201d <em>Merillat, </em>246 Va. at 433, 436 S.E.2d at 602 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">COMPENSABLE ORDINARY DISEASE OF LIFE</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The commission noted that some medical evidence in the record indicated that de Quervain\u2019s disease could be caused by any repetitive hand or wrist motion. Accordingly, the commission considered claimant\u2019s condition an ordinary disease of life within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.2-401.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As such, claimant had the burden of producing clear and convincing evidence that her ordinary disease of life was employment related. Code \u00a7 65.2-401 provides that an ordinary disease of life, which is a disease that the general public is exposed to outside of employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">may be treated as an occupational disease . . . if it is established by clear and convincing evidence, to a reasonable medical certainty, that it arose out of and in the course of employment as provided in \u00a7 65.2-400 with respect to occupational diseases and did not result from causes outside of the employment, and that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">3. It is characteristic of the employment and was caused by conditions peculiar to such employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Under familiar principles, on appellate review, the court will construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>Crisp v. Brown's Tysons Corner Dodge, Inc., </em>1 Va. App. 503, 504, 339 S.E.2d 916, 916 (1986). Further, \u201c\u2018[w]hether a disease is causally related to the employment and not causally related to other factors is ... a finding of fact.\u2019 When there is credible evidence to support it, such a finding of fact is \u2018conclusive and binding\u2019 on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Court.\u201d <em>Ross Labs. v. Barbour, </em>13 Va. App. 373, 377-78, 412 S.E.2d 205, 208 (1991) (quoting <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Breeding, </em>6 Va. App. 1, 12, 365 S.E.2d 782, 788 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In the case at bar, Dr. Haney, claimant\u2019s treating physician, opined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">After review of [claimant\u2019s] work history it is my opinion to within a reasonable degree of medical probability that this diagnosis [tendinitis of the left hand] originates with her 24 year employment at Piedmont Manufacturing where she worked as a machinist sustaining repetitive trauma syndrome of the left hand and wrist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">It has been documented in numerous publications that carpal tunnel syndrome and subsequent other wrist and hand syndromes are a result of repetitive motion such as that of a machinist. It is not uncommon for subsequent degenerative processes to surface years after the original occupation as I believe is the case with Ms. East.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">We find that Dr. Haney\u2019s opinion provides the credible evidence necessary to support the commission\u2019s finding that claimant satisfied her burden of proof under Code \u00a7 65.2-401.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Employer relies heavily upon the deposition testimony of Dr. Dunstan, who did not believe that claimant suffered from de Quervain\u2019s. He diagnosed claimant\u2019s condition as trapezial metacarpal joint arthritis. It is well settled, however, that \u201c[questions raised by conflicting medical opinions must be decided by the commission.\u201d <em>Penley v. Island Creek Coal Co., </em>8 Va. App. 310, 318, 381 S.E.2d 231, 236 (1989) (citations omitted). In accepting Dr. Haney\u2019s opinion, the commission noted that Dr. von Oeson, an orthopedic surgeon, agreed with Dr. Haney\u2019s diagnosis of de Quervain\u2019s tenosynovitis. Further, the record shows that Dr. Dunstan examined claimant on only one occasion for this condition and, at the time he was deposed, did not appear to be completely familiar with claimant\u2019s prior medical history.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">For an ordinary disease of life to be treated as a compensable occupational disease, claimant\u2019s evidence must also satisfy the six requirements of Code \u00a7 65.2-400, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>A. As used in this title, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term \u201coccupational disease\u201d means a disease arising out of and in the course of employment....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">B. A disease shall be deemed to arise out of the employment only if there is apparent to the rational mind, upon consideration of all the circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">1. A direct causal connection between the conditions under which work is performed and the occupational disease;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">2. It can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">3. It can be fairly traced to the employment as the proximate cause;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">4. It is neither a disease to which an employee may have had substantial exposure outside of the employment, nor any condition of the neck, back or spinal column;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">5. It is incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of employer and employee; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-11\">6. It had its origin in a risk connected with the employment and flowed from that source as a natural consequence, though it need not have been foreseen or expected before its contraction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">The evidence proved that claimant\u2019s treating physician unequivocally opined that claimant\u2019s condition \u201coriginated] with her 24 year employment at Piedmont Manufacturing.\u201d In addition, claimant described the extent of her duties with employer and the repetitive hand movements that were required to perform her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">Credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that there was no substantial exposure to the causes of claimant\u2019s condition outside of her employment. While there is some evidence in the record that several years ago claimant engaged in cake decorating as a hobby, there is no evidence to suggest that this activity was a <em>substantial </em>or even partial cause of her present condition. Claimant is not required to \u201cprove that the occupational activity caused her tendinitis to the complete exclusion of any other contributing outside factor. \u2018Reasonable degree of medical certainty\u2019 requires only that \u2018it is at least <em>more probable than not </em>that the disease arose out of and in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>employment.\u2019\u201d <em>The Greif Cos. v. Sipe, </em>16 Va. App. 709, 715, 434 S.E.2d 314, 318 (1993) (quoting <em>Barbour, </em>13 Va. App. at 377, 412 S.E.2d at 208). Accordingly, we conclude that the commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s evidence satisfied the requirements of both Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-400 and 65.2-401 is supported by credible evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">COMMUNICATION TO CLAIMANT OF DIAGNOSIS OF AN OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\u201cUnder our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, an occupational disease is not compensable until a diagnosis of such has been communicated to the employee. The date of the first communication of the diagnosis is treated as \u2018the happening of an injury by accident.\u2019 \u201d <em>Breeding, </em>6 Va. App. at 9-10, 365 S.E.2d at 787 (quoting former Code \u00a7 65.1-49).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThe diagnosis need not contain precise medical terminology as long as the diagnosis is definite and informs the claimant in clear and understandable language that he or she is suffering from a disease that arises out of and in the course of employment.\u201d <em>Via v. Citicorp Mortgage, Inc., </em>10 Va. App. 572, 576, 394 S.E.2d 505, 507 (1990) (citation omitted). Employer argues that claimant is not entitled to benefits because she failed to prove that she \u201creceived a communication of a diagnosis of [an occupational disease] . . . caused by her work at Piedmont Manufacturing Company.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">At the hearing before the deputy commissioner, the claimant testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">Q. When or were you ever told that your condition was caused by your employment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">A. In May the 6th when I went to Dr. Haney\u2019s office. The first time that I ever saw Dr. Haney, he didn\u2019t ask me where I worked or what I was doing. What he said was you have ruined your hands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-10\">Q. Did he tell you what you had on May 6th and did he relate it to you at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-11\">A. Yes, he told me that I had carpal tunnel\u2014whatever it is he called it carpal something. He said that the bones in my hand had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>deteriorated and it was due to the fact that I had done the same thing year after year and day after day and used my hand in a repetitive motions and that was before he asked me what it was I was doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\">Q. Did you then tell him where you worked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">A. I told him that I had worked at Piedmont Manufacturing for twenty-four years and that I had worked at Amelia Dress Company but I had been laid off. And he didn\u2019t want \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">\n<em>MR.

Well, what did you tell him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-11\">A. Well, I was told not to go back to work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">Claimant\u2019s testimony was corroborated by Dr. Haney\u2019s office notes of May 6, 1991, which indicate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-13\">[Claimant] is being seen for [tendinitis] of the left hand which began several years ago but became somewhat severe about two weeks ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-14\">Diagnosis is [de Quervain\u2019s tenosynovitis] of the left hand and wrist secondary to overuse syndrome or repetitive trauma syndrome which has been chronic through the years from her previous employment where she had to use her hand repetitively over a long period of time. . . . The multiple cumulative trauma syndrome is effecting [sic] both of her hands and progressed to the point that she can no longer perform the type of work that she has been doing in the past and she is indeed disabled from any work now that would require repetitive motion of her hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-15\">We find that this uncontradicted evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that claimant received communication of a diagnosis of an occupational disease on May 6,1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>LAST INJURIOUS EXPOSURE</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Employer contends that the commission erred in finding that claimant received her last injurious exposure at Piedmont. Code \u00a7 65.2-404 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">A. When an employee has an occupational disease that is covered by this title, the employer in whose employment he was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of the disease and the employer\u2019s insurance carrier, if any, at the time of the exposure, shall alone be liable therefor, without right to contribution from any prior employer or insurance carrier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">B. For the purposes of this section, \u201cinjurious exposure\u201d means an exposure to the causative hazard of such disease which is <em>reasonably calculated </em>to bring on the disease in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Employer argues that all of claimant\u2019s jobs have involved repetitive hand motion, and that it was not until claimant\u2019s employment at Brandy Ann that she allegedly could no longer work as a result of her condition. As such, employer contends that Brandy Ann was \u201cthe employer in whose employment [claimant] was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of the disease\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.2-404(A).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-10\">\u201cInjurious exposure\u201d to an occupational disease, as the term is used in Code [65.2-404], means \u201can exposure to the causative hazard of such disease which is reasonably calculated to bring on the disease in question.\u201d A claimant can meet the statutory standard either <em>\u201cby establishing actual causation </em>or aggravation of the disease or by showing that the exposure was of such duration and intensity that it generally causes the disease in question, even though actual causation or aggravation cannot be established in the claimant\u2019s case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-11\"><em>Fairfax County v. Espinola, </em>11 Va. App. 126, 131, 396 S.E.2d 856, 860 (1990) (emphasis added) (citations omitted); <em>see also Caudle-Hyatt, Inc. v. Mixon, </em>220 Va. 495, 260 S.E.2d 193 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">It is well settled that liability under the Act \u201cattaches to the employer in whose employment a claimant was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of an occupational disease prior to \u2018first communication of the diagnosis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cooper v. Mary E. Coal Corp., </em>215 Va. 806, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>809, 214 S.E.2d 162, 165 (1975). In this case, the record establishes that claimant received her first communication of an occupational disease on May 6, 1991. If statutory liability was simply imposed upon the last employer prior to a diagnosis of an occupational disease, Brandy Ann would be responsible for any award of benefits in this case. This is not the rule in Virginia. The last injurious exposure rule requires not only the establishment of the date of the first communication of the diagnosis, but also a factual determination that claimant suffered \u201can exposure to the causative hazard of such disease which is reasonably calculated to bring on the disease in question.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-404(B). In this case, the evidence proved that claimant\u2019s condition had become apparent <em>prior to </em>her employment with Brandy Ann. Further, the diagnosis of an occupational disease was based in large part on X rays taken before her employment with Brandy Ann. The only reason she received communication of the diagnosis after her employment began at Brandy Ann was due to her physician\u2019s appointment schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The commission properly considered the level of repetitive hand motion required of claimant to perform her jobs, the amount of claimant\u2019s exposure and the duration of her employment with each employer. <em>See Mixon, </em>220 Va. at 500, 260 S.E.2d at 196 (\u201cAlthough the statutory definition [of injurious exposure] is broader than [the common law] definition ... it nevertheless does not extend an employer\u2019s liability to exposures not \u2018reasonably calculated to bring on the disease in question\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also Todd Pac. Shipyards Corp. v. Director, </em>914 F.2d 1317 (9th Cir. 1990) (\u201cminimal exposure\u201d may not support a determination of last injurious exposure); <em>Stoots v. Great Barrier Insulation Co., </em>71 O.W.C. 179, 183 (1992) (\u201cinjurious exposure\u201d requires a factual basis as to how much exposure occurred). In addition, the commission considered the conflicting medical evidence, which included the treating physician\u2019s opinion that claimant\u2019s condition was caused by her twenty four years of employment with Piedmont. From this evidence, the commission found that claimant proved <em>actual </em>causation and that her last \u201cinjurious exposure\u201d was with employer. Ample credible evidence in the record supports this finding. Accordingly, the commission\u2019s finding of fact is binding on appeal. <em>Blue Diamond Coal Co. v. Pannell, </em>203 Va. 49, 53, 122 S.E.2d 666, 670(1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>TOTAL DISABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Employer contends that no credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that claimant is totally disabled. We disagree. Claimant testified about her condition and its continuing impact on her ability to work. In addition, claimant\u2019s education, vocational history and medical evidence corroborate her assertion of total disability. On June 10, 1991, Dr. Haney certified claimant\u2019s total disability and noted that the \u201c[l]ength of probable future disability [was] undetermined.\u201d On July 8, 1991 and on January 24, 1992, Dr. Haney again certified claimant\u2019s condition to be totally disabled and noted that probable future total disability was \u201csix months or more.\u201d This evidence is uncontradicted. Accordingly, we find employer\u2019s appeal of this issue without merit. Because we affirm the commission\u2019s finding of total disability, we do not reach employer\u2019s argument that claimant failed adequately to market her remaining capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">EXCLUSION OF DEPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Lastly, employer argues that the deputy commissioner abused his discretion by failing to allow for impeachment purposes the use of a discovery deposition from an earlier claim. At the beginning of the hearing, Deputy Commissioner Costa stated that he would consider all the medical reports, \u201cbut I will not consider the deposition, I believe it was taken earlier when some of the parties were not involved.\u201d No objection was made to this ruling. Thereafter, during cross-examination of the claimant by employer\u2019s counsel, the following exchange transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">Q. Okay. Now, do you remember when you gave a deposition in this case back in November of 1991?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-9\">A. I think it was when I gave at Scott\u2019s office. I gave one to someone in Scott\u2019s office. I don\u2019t remember exactly what the date was, but I did give one to someone in Scott\u2019s office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-10\">A. And this was last year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-11\">\n<em>DEPUTY COMMISSIONER COSTA:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0-\">Go ahead, Mr. Daniel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-13\">\n<em>MR. DANIEL:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-14\">On behalf of my employer, we would object to the use of the deposition. I thought you had already said it was not going to be used. All parties were not present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>\n<em>MR. OAKEY:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">I would also (Inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">\n<em>DEPUTY COMMISSIONER COSTA:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">I did for obvious reasons. It would be inappropriate to use deposition transcript when not all the present parties participated. So, that is what I indicated at the outset and it\u2019s still my position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">\n<em>MS. MACON:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">And you will not allow it to be used even for impeachment purposes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-11\">\n<em>DEPUTY COMMISSIONER COSTA:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-12\">No, no, not for any purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-13\">\n<em>MS. MACON:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-14\">If you could please note my objection for the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-15\">Employer\u2019s counsel made no proffer of the relevant portions of the deposition that she wanted to use for impeachment either to the deputy commissioner or in the application for review to the full commission. Likewise, she did not explain why such testimony was relevant and material.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-16\">\u201cWhen cross-examination is limited by the court and [a party] challenges the court\u2019s ruling on appeal, he or she must make a proper proffer of the excluded testimony.\u201d <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 563, 568, 394 S.E.2d 509, 512 (1990) (citations omitted). Further, \u201c[a]n appellant must demonstrate that the excluded evidence is relevant and material and that the party was entitled to have it introduced in order to establish on appeal that the trial court erred in excluding it.\u201d Toro v. <em>City of Norfolk, </em>14 Va. App. 244, 254, 416 S.E.2d 29, 35 (1992) (citation omitted). From the record before us, we have no way of knowing what point employer\u2019s counsel was going to make or what relevance claimant\u2019s deposition from an earlier claim had on the claim at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-17\">Notwithstanding the lack of an evidentiary proffer, the Act contemplates broad discretion in the commission regarding the admissibility of evidence. Code \u00a7 65.2-704 directs that the commission \u201cshall hear the parties at issue, their representatives, and witnesses; [and] shall decide the issues in a summary manner.\u201d Further Rule 1 of the Rules of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>The Commission is not bound by statutory or common law rules of pleading or evidence, nor by technical rules of practice, but will conduct such hearings and make such investigations into the questions at issue in such manner as in its judgment are held adapted to ascertain and determine expeditiously and accurately the substantial rights of the parties and to carry out the spirit of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act; and to that end, hearsay evidence may be received.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">From the record before us, we cannot say that the deputy commissioner abused his discretion in refusing to allow the deposition from an earlier claim to be used at the hearing below.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Koontz, I, and Elder, X, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-10\"> We express no opinion as to whether claimant\u2019s condition should have been considered an occupational disease within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.2-400.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b541-12\"> Former Code \u00a7 65.1-49 was recodified as Code \u00a7 65.2-403.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
