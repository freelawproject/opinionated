Defendant argues on appeal that the trial court erred in (1) permitting the Commonwealth to impeach her testimony on a collateral issue, (2) failing to give the jury a cautionary instruction after ruling certain testimony inadmissible, and (3) instructing the jury on the definition of felony-murder. Defendant also contends that punishment for both the drug and felony-murder offenses violates the prohibition against double jeopardy. We agree that the jury was improperly instructed on felony-murder and reverse that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va. App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987), the record discloses that on July 19, 1988, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>fendant was \u201chandling the sale\u201d of a townhouse and had engaged Daniel Strohkirch and the victim, Fred Green, to effect certain repairs to the property. Defendant instructed Strohkirch to \u201ctake [a] bag of cocaine\u201d to the townhouse and \u201cgive it to [Green]\u201d after the \u201cwork was finished.\u201d Contrary to this instruction, however, Strohkirch delivered the drug to Green \u201cright away,\u201d receiving $275 in exchange, which he later gave to defendant. Once in possession of the cocaine, Green immediately closed himself in the bathroom, and Strohkirch \u201cleft to run some errands.\u201d When he returned, Green was still \u201coccupying the bathroom\u201d but assured Strohkirch that he \u201cwould be out in a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Shortly thereafter, defendant \u201cshowed up\u201d and Strohkirch advised her that Green was in the bathroom, \u201cdoing the drugs.\u201d Defendant decided that Green \u201chad to leave,\u201d and Strohkirch \u201cknocked on the bathroom door.\u201d Green, who \u201clooked in pretty bad shape,\u201d \u201ccame out after about a minute\u201d but quickly returned and \u201clocked the door,\u201d claiming to have seen a policeman. Strohkirch then heard a \u201cloud thud from inside,\u201d \u201ckick[ed] the door in\u201d and discovered Green on the floor, \u201cgasping for air.\u201d Despite medical attention, Green later died from \u201ccocaine poisoning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In pretrial defense motions, the trial court ruled that evidence of \u201cprior distributions [of drugs] by the defendant to the alleged victim in the three months preceding [the date of Green\u2019s death was] ... inadmissible.\u201d Nevertheless, Green\u2019s wife testified at trial, over defendant\u2019s objection, that defendant assured her \u201ca few weeks\u201d before Green\u2019s death that Green \u201ccould get the best from [defendant] in this town, the best cocaine.\u201d When the Commonwealth asked if defendant had also mentioned \u201canything . . . about customer satisfaction,\u201d the court sustained defendant\u2019s objection, noting that the inquiry \u201csuggests, obviously, an on-going sort of commercial enterprise on [defendant\u2019s] part, and ... the probative value of that particular question is well-exceeded by the prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Testifying in her own behalf, defendant denied that she had directed Strohkirch to deliver cocaine to Green. She described the events following her arrival at the townhouse and responded to several questions related to her absence from Virginia during a period prior to the homicide. On cross-examination, the Commonwealth questioned defendant\u2019s employment and \u201csources of income\u201d on the date of Green\u2019s death.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Q: You had what as your source of employment on July 19th?. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">Q: What other sources of income did you have on that day? . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">Q: Did you have any sources of income from the sale of cocaine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">A: No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">Q: Did you ever tell anyone that you did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">A: I don\u2019t recall having said anything like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">Q: Let me show you this document ma\u2019am and ask you if you recognize it as a pre-sentence report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">A: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-12\">Q: Did you provide a statement as part of that pre-sentence report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-13\">A: Yes sir.. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-14\">Q: Didn\u2019t you say in this statement \u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-15\">Defendant\u2019s objection to the question was overruled, and the Commonwealth continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-16\">Q: Ms. Talbert, isn\u2019t it true that you told the probation officer on this report that you had a source of income, an illegitimate source of income from the sale of cocaine, and it terminated on the date of Fred Green\u2019s death, July 19,1988?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-17\">A: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-18\">Relying upon <em>Simpson v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 604, 414 S.E.2d 407 (1992), defendant challenges this examination as improper impeachment of her previous \u201canswer on a collateral issue.\u201d In <em>Simpson, </em>we held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-19\">[a] witness may not be cross-examined regarding any fact irrelevant to the issues on trial when that cross-examination is for the mere purpose of impeaching his credit by contradicting him. If such a question is inadvertently asked and answered, the witness\u2019s answer is conclusive. Furthermore, the witness may not be asked about any collateral independent fact \u201cmerely with a view to contradict him afterwards. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>A subject is collateral to the issues on trial unless the party cross-examining the witness is entitled to prove the subject in support of his or her own case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 606-07, 414 S.E.2d at 409 (citations omitted). Stated differently, if cross-examination of defendant relative to her employment and income was irrelevant and inadmissible as a part of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, it was collateral and her responses were not subject to impeachment. Defendant argues that such evidence was not admissible because it prejudiced her case with the suggestion that she \u201chad been selling drugs for a long time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">It is \u201cwell established that in a criminal prosecution, proof which shows or tends to show that the accused is guilty of. . . other crimes and offenses at other times,... is incompetent and inadmissible for the purpose of showing the commission of the particular crime charged.\u201d <em>Kirkpatrick v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 269, 272, 176 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1970). This rule was created to protect the defendant from the \u201cunfair prejudice resulting from the consideration of prior criminal conduct in determining guilt.\u201d <em>Sutphin v. Commonwealth, </em>1 Va. App. 241, 245, 337 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">Alert to this danger, the trial court specifically excluded evidence of prior drug dealings between defendant and Green. <em>See Curtis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 636, 638-39, 352 S.E.2d 536, 538 (1987) (whether the probative value outweighs the prejudicial effect is a decision for the trial judge). Consistent with this ruling, the Commonwealth examined defendant only with respect to her \u201cemployment on July 19th, [1988],\u201d the offense date, and her \u201csources of income ... on <em>that </em>day.\u201d (emphasis added). These inquiries followed Strohkirch\u2019s testimony and defendant\u2019s denial on direct that she had requested him to deliver drugs to Green on \u201cthe day in question.\u201d Clearly, evidence of money received by defendant from Green in exchange for the drugs was relevant to the distribution offense and could have been developed during the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief through proofs related to defendant\u2019s income at that time. It was, therefore, not a collateral matter and was a proper object of cross-examination and impeachment once defendant offered herself as a witness. Code \u00a7 19.2-268; <em>see Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>136 Va. 773, 777-78, 118 S.E. 107, 109 (1923).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erroneously failed to give the jury a cautionary instruction, <em>sua sponte, </em>after ruling that the question to Green\u2019s wife and her response were inadmissible is also without merit. The record reflects that defendant neither requested the instruction nor moved for a mistrial when the Commonwealth recalled the testimony during closing argument to the jury. <em>See Martinez </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 664, 670, 395 S.E.2d 467, 471 (1990), <em>aff\u2019d as modified, </em>241 Va. 557, 403 S.E.2d 358 (1991); Rule 5A:18. \u201cWhen a defendant . . . does not request [a cautionary] instruction . . . any error which may have been committed otherwise is waived.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 397, 409, 399 S.E.2d 623, 629 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Defendant next complains that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on felony murder through Commonwealth\u2019s instruction \u201c5-A\u201d* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rather than defense instruction \u201cC\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 4She argues that this error permitted the jury to convict without proof \u201cof some act by either Strohkirch or [herself] in furtherance of the felony which caused Green\u2019s death,\u201d a necessary element of felony murder. Our</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">responsibility in reviewing jury instructions is \u201cto see that the law has been clearly stated and that the instructions cover all issues which the evidence fairly raises.\u201d It is elementary that a jury must be informed as to the essential elements of the offense; a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>correct statement of the law is one of the \u201cessentials of a fair trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\"><em>Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 485, 488, 370 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1988) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">By statute, felony murder includes \u201c[t]he killing of one accidentally, contrary to the intention of the parties, while in the prosecution of some felonious act\u201d as \u201cmurder of the second degree.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-33. The doctrine originated in the common law</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">to elevate to murder a homicide committed during the course of a felony by imputing malice to the killing. The justification for imputing malice was the theory that the increased risk of death or serious harm occasioned by the commission of a felony demonstrated the felon\u2019s lack of concern for human life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-8\"><em>King v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 351, 354, 368 S.E.2d 704, 705-06 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">While the felonious distribution of drugs is obviously embraced by the statute, it will suffice as the predicate \u201cinitial felony\u201d necessary to felony murder only \u201cwhere the killing is so closely related ... in time, place, and causal connection as to make it a part of the same criminal enterprise.\u201d <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 1033, 1044, 243 S.E.2d 477, 483 (1978). The homicide must be \u201cwithin the <em>res gestae \u201d </em>of the underlying felony <em>and </em>\u201can emanation thereof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1041, 243 S.E.2d at 482; <em>King, 6 </em>Va. App. at 355, 368 S.E.2d at 706. Thus, the death must be \u201ctemporally related to the commission of the felony,\u201d and the \u201cfelony or acts in furtherance thereof must contribute to cause\u201d it. <em>King, </em>6 Va. App. at 357, 368 S.E.2d at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">The instruction in issue required the Commonwealth to prove, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[t]hat the cocaine which was the subject of this distribution was ingested by Fred Green and his death resulted therefrom.\u201d This language sufficiently identified and defined for the jury the necessary causal connection between the predicate felony and the homicide as an element of the felony murder offense. Flowever, felony-murder also requires that the homicide occur within the <em>res gestae </em>of the predicate offense, and the fact finder must determine in each case if the underlying felony has been completed, terminated, or abandoned for purposes of this element. <em>Haskell, </em>218 Va. at 1043, 243 S.E.2d at 483. If the initial felony and the homicide were separated by time, place or other circumstances, they were not \u201cparts of one continuous transac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>tion,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1041, 243 S.E.2d at 482, and the killing did not occur \u201cin the prosecution of some felonious act\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-33. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In <em>Hickman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>the defendant was convicted of felony murder after assisting the deceased procure and consume cocaine. 11 Va. App. 369, 398 S.E.2d 698 (1990), <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>242 Va. 263, 410 S.E.2d 88 (1991). There, the jury was instructed that, to convict of felony-murder, the Commonwealth must prove \u201c[tjhat the defendant was <em>then committing </em>the felonies of distribution of cocaine or possession of cocaine . . . which caused the death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373 n.1, 398 S.E.2d at 700 n.l (emphasis added). This instruction clearly required a finding that the killing had occurred within the <em>res gestae </em>of the predicate felony and was approved by the court. <em>Id. </em>at 373, 398 S.E.2d at 700.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">In contrast, the instruction in dispute did not properly admonish the jury that second degree felony-murder must be a part of the <em>res gestae </em>of the predicate felony. Instead, it required only that the Commonwealth prove that defendant \u201chad committed\u201d the underlying felony, distribution of cocaine, at some previous time, perhaps transactionally distinct from the death, and, therefore, erroneously stated the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Lastly, defendant contends that convictions of both the drug and murder offenses violated her \u201cconstitutional rights under the double jeopardy clause\u201d of the Constitution of the United States. Though defendant did not raise this issue before the trial court, she relies on <em>Darnell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 948, 408 S.E.2d 540 (1991), to save the argument for appeal. In <em>Darnell, </em>we held that \u201cRule 5A:18 does not bar an appeal of an issue where the law has changed between trial and appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 953, 408 S.E.2d at 542. However, the law applicable to defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim did not change between her trial and this appeal. <em>See Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 615, 292 S.E.2d 798 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1228 (1983); <em>Spain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va. App. 385, 373 S.E.2d 728 (1988). Therefore, defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Darnell </em>is misplaced, and we may not consider this issue on appeal. Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed with respect to the murder conviction only, and this case is remanded for such further proceedings as the Commonwealth deems appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Baker, I, and Fitzpatrick, X, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-10\"> However, even if collateral, defendant\u2019s denial of the offense on <em>direct </em>examination exposed the income aspects of the transaction to cross-examination and related impeachment. <em>See Santmier v.
