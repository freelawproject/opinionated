Defendant argues (1) that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress evidence discovered as a result of an unlawful seizure, and (2) that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">In accordance with well established principles, we assess the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction upon a review of the record \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. The judgment of a trial court sitting without a jury is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va. App. 438, 443, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987) (citing Code \u00a7 8.01-680). \u201cThe weight which should be given to evidence and whether the testimony of a witness is credible are questions which the fact finder must decide.\u201d <em>Bridgeman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 523, 528, 351 S.E.2d 598, 601 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Similarly, in considering a trial court\u2019s ruling on a suppression motion, we view the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable to . . . the prevailing party below,\u201d the Commonwealth in this instance, and the decision of the trial judge will be disturbed only if plainly wrong. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grimstead, </em>12 Va. App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991). Our review of the record includes evidence adduced at both the trial and the suppression hearing. <em>DePriest v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va. App. 577, 583, 359 S.E.2d 540, 542-43 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 985 (1988). To prevail on appeal, the defendant must \u201cshow . . . that the denial of [his] motion . . . constitute^] reversible error.\u201d <em>Motley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>17 Va. App. 439, 440-41, 437 S.E.2d 232, 233 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">On September 28, 1990, Officer S. Mills, Special Agents Craig Wiesner and Wilbur Ladison, Investigator Earl Killmon and Trooper Powers were assigned to a \u201cDrug Interdiction Team\u201d at the Norfolk International Airport. All were dressed in \u201ccasual street clothes\u201d and did not display their weapons. At approximately 10:15 a.m., Mills, Wiesner and Ladison observed passengers deplane a flight from New York, a city described by Mills as \u201cone of the primary sources for narcotics.\u201d When defendant passed through the \u201cjetway,\u201d Mills noticed an \u201cunnatural bulge in the crotch area\u201d of defendant\u2019s trousers, \u201cmaybe the size of a tennis ball.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Mills \u201cmotioned to the others ... as to what [he] had observed\u201d and followed defendant into the restroom. Although defendant closed himself in a \u201cstall,\u201d he did not use the \u201cfacilities\u201d and exited shortly thereafter. After speaking with someone from a public phone, defendant took a seat at \u201cone of the gates\u201d and appeared to \u201cnap.\u201d While Agent Ladison and Investigator Killmon waited at a nearby gate, Mills and Wiesner approached defendant. With Mills \u201cdirectly to [defendant\u2019s] side\u201d and Agent Wiesner standing \u201cfive or six feet\u201d to Mills\u2019 right, Mills initiated contact with the defendant, saying, \u201cExcuse me, sir, can I talk with you?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">After defendant agreed to speak with Mills, Mills inquired \u201cif he just flew from La Guardia.\u201d When defendant answered \u201cno,\u201d Mills <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>displayed his \u201cDEA credentials,\u201d and defendant \u201carose\u201d to examine them. Mills then questioned defendant\u2019s identity and travel plans and requested that he produce his airline ticket. While complying, defendant remarked that he \u201cfelt [his] rights were being violated\u201d and asked Mills, \u201cWhat is the problem?\u201d Mills explained that \u201c[they] were narcotics officers . . . attempting to stem the flow of narcotics into the area.\u201d When defendant again complained that \u201chis rights were being violated,\u201d Mills reminded him that he had consented to speak with the officers but asked defendant no further questions. Mills testified that defendant was free to \u201cwalk away ... at that point in time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Defendant then \u201crequested\u201d access to a nearby pay telephone, and Mills \u201cmoved away\u201d to allow defendant unrestricted \u201cpassage.\u201d While defendant used the phone, Mills and Wiesner stood \u201c[p]robably ten, fifteen feet\u201d distant, and Ladison was \u201c20 to 30 yards\u201d away. During the telephone conversation, Killmon and Ladison joined Mills and advised him that defendant had flown from Atlanta to La Guardia the previous day, had \u201cjust\u201d arrived from La Guardia and was ticketed for return to Atlanta. Killmon added that defendant \u201chad some baggage claim stubs attached to his ticket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">As the officers discussed this information, Mills heard the \u201cphone slam down,\u201d \u201clooked\u201d and saw \u201csomething,\u201d which \u201cappeared to be white,\u201d in defendant\u2019s \u201ccrotch area where he was unzipping his pants.\u201d Defendant then ran toward the restroom, and Mills \u201cgave chase.\u201d Weisner was also \u201cright on [defendant\u2019s] heels\u201d and pursued him into the first stall. There, defendant \u201cdropped to his knees, . . . pulled something from his crotch area . . . and tried shoving it up the commode and flushing the commode with his other hand in the process.\u201d Weisner suspected that the material was cocaine, and a struggle ensued as the officers attempted to retrieve it and take defendant into custody. Investigator Killmon testified that during the tussle, defendant stated that \u201che ran . . . because he wanted to get rid of the dope.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Once defendant was in custody, Killmon remained in the restroom until the toilet was removed \u201cfrom the wall,\u201d and he recovered a plastic package containing a white powder, later determined to be cocaine, from \u201cthe trap.\u201d The package was \u201cprobably two to three inches thick, . . . five inches long, [and] maybe three and-a-half to four inches wide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Defendant first argues that he was \u201cseized in his person\u201d from the inception of the encounter by oppressive and coercive police conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>in violation of the fourth amendment. He asserts that \u201cthe facts reveal a sinister and manipulative psychological game,\u201d during which the officers \u201ccontrolled\u201d him \u201cunder circumstances such that he reasonably thought he was not free to leave.\u201d Because this unlawful seizure preceded defendant\u2019s flight and subsequent discovery of the cocaine, he urges that the evidence \u201cbe suppressed as . . . the product of illegal police conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The constitutional guarantee which defendant invokes secures citizens in their persons and property against unreasonable seizures. <em>Baldwin v. </em>Commonwealth, 243 Va. 191, 195, 413 S.E.2d 645, 647 (1992). However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">[t]he purpose of the Fourth Amendment is not to eliminate all contact between the police and the citizenry, but \u201cto prevent arbitrary and oppressive interference by enforcement officials with the privacy and personal security of individuals.\u201d As long as the person to whom questions are put remains free to disregard the questions and walk away, there has been no intrusion upon that person\u2019s liberty or privacy as would under the Constitution require some particularized and objective justification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-7\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 553-54 (1980) (citation omitted). Thus, a consensual encounter between police and an individual has no fourth amendment implications unless accompanied by such \u201ccoercion or show of force or authority by the officer . . . that would cause a person . . . reasonably to have believed that he or she was required to comply\u201d and \u201cnot free to leave.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Satchell, </em>15 Va. App. 127, 131, 422 S.E.2d 412, 414 (1992); <em>Motley, </em>17 Va. App. at 442, 437 S.E.2d at 234. Acquiescence in \u201ca police request, which most citizens will do, does not negate \u2018the consensual nature of the response.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grinton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 846, 849, 419 S.E.2d 860, 862 (1992) (quoting <em>I.N.S. </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>466 U.S. 210, 216 (1984)); <em>see Baldwin, </em>243 Va. at 197, 413 S.E.2d at 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, a seizure does not occur whenever an individual senses that police activity has restrained his liberty but occurs \u201conly if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a <em>reasonable person </em>would have believed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>he was not free to leave.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 554 (emphasis added); <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Chesternut, </em>486 U.S. 567, 573 (1988). This objective standard \u201clook[s] to the reasonable man\u2019s interpretation of the conduct in question,\u201d thus \u201censur[ing] that the scope of the Fourth Amendment protection does not vary with the state of mind of the particular individual being approached.\u201d <em>Chesternut, </em>486 U.S. at 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">We have acknowledged that the <em>\u201cMendenhall </em>test \u2018is necessarily imprecise\u2019 and \u2018flexible\u2019 \u201d in order to accommodate \u201c \u2018consistent application from one police encounter to the next,\u2019 \u201d irrespective of individualized reactions. <em>Satchell, </em>15 Va. App. at 130, 422 S.E.2d at 414 (quoting <em>Chesternut, </em>486 U.S. at 573-74). It \u201cinvolves factual determinations\u201d by the trial court \u201cwhich bear upon whether a reasonably prudent person would feel that he or she is not free to leave.\u201d <em>Satchell, </em>15 Va. App. at 130, 422 S.E.2d at 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">In overruling defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the trial judge noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">1 think that [defendant] was free to leave anytime he wanted to .... He panicked. He ran. They had a right to follow him .... I don\u2019t think that [the officers] did anything that a reasonable person wouldn\u2019t expect.... A reasonable person out traveling expects to go through the meters that check whether or not you\u2019ve got weapons. A reasonable person expects when you go through there they will say, May I look at your ticket? I think a reasonable person expects that .... <em>And I don\u2019t think that his rights were violated. </em>They had a right to talk with him. They didn\u2019t harass him, and if he hadn\u2019t panicked, you [defense counsel] and I wouldn\u2019t be here, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">These conclusions are clearly supported by the record. Officer Mills engaged defendant in \u201cconsensual\u201d conversation in an open, public place, free of threat or intimidation. Only two officers approached defendant; no uniforms or weapons were displayed and defendant was treated courteously. He was not touched, detained or threatened during the encounter. Though several agents were in the vicinity while defendant spoke over the phone, their presence suggest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>ed only a possible interest in further conversation with him. Such circumstances would not communicate restraint or coercion to a reasonable person.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Although defendant was surely \u201cseized\u201d in the men\u2019s room, it is well established that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">[a] law enforcement officer may lawfully arrest, without a warrant, for a felony or upon \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that a felony has been committed by the arrested person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">The test of constitutional validity is whether at the moment of arrest the arresting officer had knowledge of sufficient facts and circumstances to warrant a reasonable man in believing that an offense has been committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-8\"><em>Bryson v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 85, 86-87, 175 S.E.2d 248, 250 (1970) (citations omitted); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-81. Defendant arrived on a flight from a city reputed to be a source of narcotics with an \u201cunnatural bulge\u201d in the crotch of his pants. He proceeded immediately to the privacy of a closed stall in an airport restroom but did not otherwise use the facilities. He was untruthful during the initial encounter with Officer Mills. Later, and after learning that the police were narcotics agents, defendant abruptly dropped the telephone, and a white material was observed hidden in the unzipped crotch area of his pants as he raced to a nearby restroom. Once again in a stall, defendant dropped to his knees and frantically attempted to discard suspected cocaine into the toilet. These facts presented an array of circumstances sufficient to provide trained law enforcement officers with probable cause to arrest defendant. <em>See DePriest, 4 </em>Va. App. at 584-85, 359 S.E.2d at 543-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Defendant\u2019s contention that the evidence failed to establish a \u201csufficient nexus\u201d between the article \u201cflushed\u201d by him and the cocaine \u201cfound in the toilet plumbing\u201d is also without merit. During the struggle at the time of arrest, defendant confessed \u201cthat the only reason he ran was because he wanted to get rid of the dope.\u201d Moreover, as the trial judge noted, \u201c[t]he agent saw [the package of cocaine] come out of the crotch and into the toilet. He retrieved it from the toilet and he got it. . . . This is five or six thousand dollars of cocaine. Most people don\u2019t flush this down the toilet unless they [have] ... the police hot on their tail.\u201d The inference that the cocaine recovered by the po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>lice was previously possessed by defendant naturally and reasonably flows from the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Defendant, therefore, was not wrongfully seized, and the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Baker, X, and Coleman, X, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-10\"> \u201cCircumstances to be considered in determining whether a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave include \u2018the threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer\u2019s request might be compelled.\u2019 \u201d <em>Satchell, </em>15 Va.
