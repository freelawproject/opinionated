On appeal, Kemph asserts that his retrial following mistrial was barred by the double jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. Kemph argues that the mistrial resulted from intentional misconduct by the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, thereby placing the retrial within the double jeopardy bar. Kemph also challenges the trial judge\u2019s refusal to allow additional testimony during a pre-trial hearing to determine the double jeopardy implications and the judge\u2019s refusal to recuse himself from making that determination. Because we find that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in Kemph\u2019s first trial did not rise to the level of intentional misconduct and that the trial judge acted properly in making that determination, we affirm Kemph\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In this appeal, Kemph does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence. Accordingly, we recount only those facts relevant to the appeal and present them in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Traverso v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 172, 176, 366 S.E.2d 719, 721 (1988). In December 1991, the police observed Kemph and another man leaving a four-door pickup truck towing a horse trailer. As the two men crossed the street toward a closed business, Kemph was carrying a brown paper bag from which a triple beam scale protruded. After Kemph and his companion entered the building, officers approached and directed them to place their hands against the wall. Kemph reached inside his coat and refused to remove his hand. Upon further command from the police, Kemph removed his hand and in the same motion dropped a plastic bag between his feet. The bag contained 24.5 grams of methamphetamine and cutting agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">In Kemph\u2019s first trial, the defense called Donald Foutz as a character witness. On direct examination, Foutz testified as to Kemph\u2019s reputation for truth and veracity. The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney then asked the court for leave \u201cto make an argument out of the absence (sic) of the jury, so we won\u2019t step on anything here.\u201d Out of the presence of the jury, the attorneys and the judge discussed the Commonwealth\u2019s proposed cross-examination of Foutz. The trial judge ruled that the witness\u2019 testimony had put Kemph\u2019s character in issue and that the Commonwealth had the right to cross-examine and impeach on that issue. The prosecutor asked the court if he could ask the witness the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">1. If the witness has heard that Kemph was an admitted user of methamphetamine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">2. Whether it would change the witness\u2019 opinion if Kemph has admitted to using methamphetamine on at least one occasion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">3. Whether it would affect the witness\u2019 opinion or has the witness heard that Kemph had $1,100 worth of methamphetamine drop from his hand in Vinton, and whether the witness has heard that Kemph had marijuana in his pocket when arrested;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">4. Whether the witness has heard that Kemph is a major methamphetamine distributor from Virginia Beach;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>5. Whether the witness has heard that Kemph is a supplier of methamphetamine from Virginia Beach;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">\u20186. Whether the witness has heard that Kemph has sold marijuana in the past.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The trial judge refused all of these proffered questions.</p>\n<p id=\"ACr\">The following exchange then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">By the Court: What you want to do is you want to tell the jury that he has\u2014this man has a record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">By [Prosecutor]: No, sir, I don\u2019t. I am not saying are you aware that [he] has been convicted of, no. I\u2019m not saying that, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">By the Court: See, I think you\u2019re permitted to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">By [Prosecutor]: Well, then I\u2019ll ask that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-15\">Following a discussion on the remoteness of the prior crimes, the trial judge ruled, \u201cI do not find [the evidence of prior crimes] to be so remote that it [would] not have . . . some bearing on . . . what the witness may have thought the reputation was. So I will permit [the prosecutor] to ask [Foutz] if he had heard of these convictions for these drug violations at the time, whatever they were alleged to [be].\u201d When defense counsel objected and asserted that the Commonwealth could not discuss the details of the prior offenses, the trial judge said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s limited to just the type of felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-16\">The trial judge then stated, \u201cI will permit this part of the questioning to go,\u201d and asked the prosecutor if \u201cthere [is] anything else you\u2019re going to ask him in regard to that?\u201d The prosecutor responded that he would \u201cjust ask him about the two drug related offenses.\u201d The trial judge advised the prosecutor to be sure to ask his questions in terms of whether the witness has heard about them.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-17\">When Foutz returned to the stand, the prosecutor asked whether Foutz had heard that Kemph had been convicted twice in the City of Chesapeake for selling marijuana. Defense counsel objected and asked for a mistrial. Foutz indicated that he had not heard this. The prosecutor next asked whether the witness had heard that Kemph had been <em>charged </em>with distribution of phencyclidine; again, defense coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>sel objected. The prosecutor responded that he had a good faith basis for the question. The prosecutor then asked the witness whether he had heard that Kemph had been convicted of possession of phencyclidine. The witness responded no. After further questioning, cross-examination was concluded and defense counsel redirected the witness. When the jury had retired to the jury room, the court recognized that defense counsel had made a motion for a mistrial. Defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">I need to ask for the mistrial on the basis of the fact that my understanding of the Court\u2019s ruling was that he can ask about the convictions for drug offenses and give the dates. [The prosecutor] elicited information about the dates and times and types of offenses, drug offenses, including possession and distribution, and types of drugs. I think that goes far beyond what was ever intended to test the validity of a person\u2019s statement about what they have indicated as the defendant\u2019s reputation for truth and veracity in the community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The prosecutor responded that he had asked \u201cspecific instances of misconduct.\u201d He then stated, \u201cI have a good faith basis, I have a CCRE right here that says charged with distribution of phencyclidine, felony, convicted; possession of phencyclidine, misdemeanor; distribution of marijuana, felony, conviction; distribution of marijuana, felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The trial judge granted the mistrial, stating \u201cI do not find any misconduct on [the prosecutor\u2019s] part; I don\u2019t think he\u2019s done anything wrong.\u201d Defense counsel responded, \u201cI understand that.\u201d The trial judge stated he had \u201cgotten deeper and deeper into unclear areas of admissibility of evidence.\u201d He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">I think that the court has, in this instance, has failed to set down a proper guideline for the admissibility of all this evidence and because of that it has caused the attorneys and the courts substantial problems with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">So, under the circumstances, I have decided that the better position to take is to grant the defendant\u2019s mistrial and order that all of these issues that we have been wrestling with be briefed and that we have some substantial pretrial arguments and hearings with regard to the limitations on [the prosecutor\u2019s] evidence and with regard to how the defendant\u2019s character can be presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>The Commonwealth elected to re-try Kemph. At the beginning of his second trial on December 10, 1992, Kemph moved to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds, asked the judge to recuse himself from determining the double jeopardy issue, and requested a hearing to present evidence on the prosecutor\u2019s intent. The judge ruled that he was the appropriate fact finder and that he could determine the double jeopardy issue without hearing additional evidence. The trial judge stated that <em>\u201cmy ruling was so nebulous that I don\u2019t see how [the prosecutor] could have possibly understood what my ruling was, because I wasn\u2019t sure what my ruling was.\u201d </em>The court found that the prosecutor\u2019s actions were not intentional, and that the prosecutor had acted in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">II. STANDARD FOR APPLYING DOUBLE JEOPARDY TO PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The United States Supreme Court has held that jeopardy attaches in a criminal case once a defendant is placed on trial before the trier of the facts. <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 479 (1971). However, in <em>Wade v. Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684 (1949), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">The double-jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment, however, does not mean that every time a defendant is put to trial before a competent tribunal he is entitled to go free if the trial fails to end in a final judgment. Such a rule would create an insuperable obstacle to the administration of justice in many cases in which there is no semblance of the type of oppressive practices at which the double-jeopardy prohibition is aimed. There may be unforeseeable circumstances that arise during a trial making its completion impossible, such as the failure of a jury to agree on a verdict. In such event the purpose of law to protect society from those guilty of crimes frequently would be frustrated by denying courts power to put the defendant to trial again .... What has been said is enough to show that a defendant\u2019s valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal must in some instances be subordinated to the public\u2019s interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 688-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Thus, although jeopardy attaches in a criminal case once the jury is sworn, there are circumstances in which the trial court may abort the proceedings and the defendant can be re-tried without violating the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment. When the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>fendant\u2019s actions cause the mistrial, or when a mistrial is declared at the defendant\u2019s behest, he is not permitted to claim the protection of the double jeopardy bar. <em>United States v. Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 611 (1976). However, when a defendant requests a mistrial because of intentional prosecutorial misconduct, the double jeopardy bar will apply. <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 676 (1982). The Commonwealth cannot use its own misconduct to gain an advantage any more than can the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u201cThe standard applied in <em>Kennedy </em>is that prosecutorial conduct, even if viewed as [harassing] or overreaching and sufficient to justify a mistrial, does not bar retrial absent proof of intent on the part of the prosecutor to subvert the protection afforded by the double jeopardy clause.\u201d <em>MacKenzie v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 236, 240, 380 S.E.2d 173, 175 (1989).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">Only where the governmental conduct in question is intended to \u201cgoad\u201d the defendant into moving for a mistrial may a defendant raise the bar of double jeopardy to a second trial after having succeeded in aborting the first on his own motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\"><em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U. S. at 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">III. SUFFICIENCY OF THE RECORD TO DETERMINE PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">We look first to the issue of whether the trial court erred in refusing to hear additional evidence before ruling on Kemph\u2019s motion to bar his retrial. Kemph relies on a statement from the Sixth Circuit to the effect that a defendant can never demonstrate prosecutorial bad faith if the trial court restricts its inquiry to the record made at the aborted trial. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>534 F.2d 76, 82 (6th Cir. 1976). We believe reliance on <em>Wilson </em>is misplaced. In <em>Wilson, </em>the appellate court specifically referred to the \u201cscant trial record\u201d of the first trial. <em>Id. </em>at 81. Here, we have no dearth of evidence as to the events that led up to the mistrial. The record of the first trial contains the finding of the judge that the prosecutor had done nothing wrong, a finding in which Kemph\u2019s counsel acquiesced. We do not see how additional findings of fact would have benefitted the trial court\u2019s determination of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>IV RECUSAL ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Kemph also asserts that the trial judge should have recused himself because he \u201cwould naturally assume some responsibility for the mistrial.\u201d The import of this argument seems to be that because the trial judge recognized that the lack of clarity in his ruling, rather than intentional misconduct by the prosecutor, caused the mistrial, he was not competent to determine the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The trial judge determined that he was competent to make an unbiased determination and that no further evidence was required to determine the issue of prosecutorial misconduct. We see no reason why a judge, fully aware of all facts relevant to an issue, should recuse himself from determining that issue simply because he may be called upon to question his own prior judgment or because he is familiar with the parties and the issues in question. <em>See Helen W. </em>v. <em>Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Human Dev., </em>12 Va. App. 877, 888, 407 S.E.2d 25, 31-32 (1991); <em>Terrell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 285, 293, 403 S.E.2d 387, 391 (1991). Here, the candid concession of the trial judge that his ruling lacked clarity speaks well of his ability to remain unbiased.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">V NO PROFFER OF EVIDENCE MADE</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Kemph asserts in his brief that the trial court erred in refusing to permit a proffer of additional evidence concerning the prosecutor\u2019s conduct. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hylton, </em>14 Va. App. 354, 358, 416 S.E.2d 712, 715 (1992). Contrary to Kemph\u2019s assertion, the record does not reflect that any proffer was refused; rather, the court merely refused Kemph\u2019s request for a separate hearing. Because the defendant never requested an opportunity to proffer the rejected testimony, his reference to <em>Smith </em>is misplaced. It is clear from the full context of <em>Smith </em>that the proffer must be affirmatively made, not merely implied. 14 Va. App. at 357-58, 416 S.E.2d at 715; <em>see also Speller </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Va. App. 437, 440, 345 S.E.2d 542, 545 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">VI. PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT IN KEMPH\u2019S CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">Having determined that the trial court properly considered the issue of prosecutorial misconduct, we now review its resolution of that issue. The trial judge admitted that he had rendered a nebulous ruling. <em>Cf. MacKenzie v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 236, 240, 380 S.E.2d 173, 175 (1989) (holding that where prosecutor made improper remarks in opening statement after being warned that these remarks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>were unacceptable, trial court\u2019s finding that prosecutor did not exercise good judgment was supported by the evidence). The prosecutor, in asking Foutz about charges that had resulted in a conviction, could have reasonably believed that he was acting within the judge\u2019s instructions. The prosecutor also opposed the granting of a mistrial, suggesting that he lacked a purposeful intent to bring about the mistrial. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>977 F.2d 972, 975 (5th Cir. 1992) (if there is no evidence that the prosecutor intended to terminate the first trial, there is no double jeopardy bar), <em>cert. denied, </em>114 S. Ct. 106 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The record fully supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the prosecutor\u2019s action was not intentional and that he acted in good faith. \u201cThe court\u2019s finding concerning the prosecutor\u2019s intent is, of course, a factual one which we must accept unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Borromeo, </em>954 F.2d 245, 247 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>112 S. Ct. 3012 (1992). The trial court properly denied the motion to dismiss under double jeopardy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the conviction appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Elder, X, and Fitzpatrick, X, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-9\"> Kemph asserts for the first time on appeal that the double jeopardy clause of the Virginia constitution protects him from retrial even if the United States Constitution does not. This claim is barred by Rule 5A:18; nonetheless, as this Court has ruled that resolution of such a double jeopardy claim is controlled by <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, MacKenzie, </em>8 Va. App. at 239, 308 S.E.2d at 175, his argument lacks merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
