App. 354, 429 S.E.2d 615 (1993), a majority of a panel of this Court reversed the judgment of the trial court as it pertained to Case No. CR91002806-02. Appellee\u2019s petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>was granted and argued on September 10, 1993. Upon consideration whereof, we reverse the judgment of the trial court for those reasons set forth in the panel\u2019s majority opinion. Accordingly, the stay of this Court\u2019s May 11, 1993 mandate is lifted, and the mandate is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-18\">Chief Judge Moon, Judges Baker and Elder would affirm the judgment of the trial court for those reasons set forth in the dissenting opinion of the panel\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-19\">It is ordered that the trial court allow court-appointed counsel for the appellant an additional $200 for services rendered on the rehearing portion of this appeal, in addition to counsel\u2019s costs and necessary direct out-of-pocket expenses.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
