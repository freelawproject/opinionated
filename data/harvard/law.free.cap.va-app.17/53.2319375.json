We affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">On March 21, 1990, claimant was employed with employer as an aircraft refueler. Claimant\u2019s job was to connect the fuel hose and then look at the fuel gauges directly overhead to determine when the aircraft was completely fueled. On this date, claimant was looking up at the gauge, heard a pop in his neck and sustained an injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Relying on <em>County of Chesterfield </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>237 Va. 180, 376 S.E.2d 73 (1989), and <em>Plumb Rite Plumbing Service </em>v. <em>Barbour, </em>8 Va. App. 482, 382 S.E.2d 305 (1989), the deputy commissioner dismissed the case, holding that the claimant did not prove an accident arising out of his employment. The deputy commissioner held that looking upward is an activity that is \u201ctoo common to the public at large to be considered a peculiar risk of his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">The commission reversed the deputy commissioner. It found that \u201cclaimant\u2019s work requires that he tilt his head back to an angle that allows him to look directly overhead at the . .. fuel gauges .. . and to do so on a regular basis.\u201d The commission found that because this task placed the claimant in \u201can unusual or awkward position in which to work,\u201d the injury that the claimant received as a consequence of this activity arose out of his employment. We affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">A claimant must \u201cshow that the conditions of the workplace or that some significant <em>work related exertion </em>caused the injury. The mere happening of an accident at the workplace, not caused by any work related risk or significant work related exertion, is not compensable.\u201d <em>Barbour, </em>8 Va. App. at 484, 382 S.E.2d at 306 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">Claimant testified that \u201cthe prolonged looking up at the fuel gauges is what caused it\u201d and that he had to look up \u201cgenerally fifteen to twenty minutes.\u201d Claimant further testified that while he was looking up at the fuel gauges on the airplane, he would fill out paperwork and that \u201c[i]t\u2019s a constant up and down process doing paperwork and watching the fuel gauges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>In addition to describing the length of time he spent looking up and down, the claimant testified as to the specific physical act of looking up that is required to view the fuel gauges. \u201cIt\u2019s almost straight up and down when you have to look at the gauges . . . [t]hey\u2019re immediately over your head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">We hold that the repeated act of looking straight up to view the fuel gauges, as the claimant testified, supported the commission\u2019s finding that the claimant performed this task in \u201can unusual or awkward position,\u201d and, as a consequence, the injury to his neck was related to exertion peculiar to his employment. Accordingly, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Willis, X, concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b89-8\">Moon, C.X,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"A3O\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">I disagree with the majority that credible evidence supports the award of the commission. At the deputy commissioner\u2019s hearing, claimant\u2019s testimony was ambiguous as to the cause of his injury. At one point, he said, \u201cI think that prolonged looking up at the fuel gauges is what caused it. I felt it like a pop in my neck, and ... I knew right then that something was wrong. And after about an hour it was pretty tight, I couldn\u2019t hardly move it.\u201d He also stated that, \u201cto watch the gauges with the door panel open, you can\u2019t look at a small angle. Its almost straight up and down when you have to look at the gauges. They are immediately over your head . . . approximately eight feet. . . I\u2019m six foot, I\u2019m only looking two feet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">After that testimony, William Roberson, a witness for the employer, testified that \u201cthe average fueler fuels six to eight airplanes.\u201d He further testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-11\">Q. Can you . . . you\u2019ve heard the testimony where [claimant] said that he looked up or to the right. The action of looking up to look at fuel gauges, is that an unusual action or would that be the same as you\u2019d look up at the light or look up at something on the ceiling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-12\">A. It would be exactly the same as just looking up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Q. You have just shown us that you tilted your head back so that your eyes would ... a gaze would go higher up in the air, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The deputy commissioner then recalled the claimant and the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">Q. Sir, you\u2019ve heard the testimony of Mr. Roberson as to approximately how many times per day that you\u2019d be lifting\u2014 reviewing the gauges. Is that accurate to the best of your knowledge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">A. I would say so. That\u2019s pretty close.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-9\">Q. And you heard him describe the motion of looking up, and is that essentially\u2014Would you agree that that\u2019s the motion that you engage in to look at these gauges and were on March 21, 1990?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">A. Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-11\">Q. Is there anything different about the motion than what\u2019s already been described up to this point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-12\">A. The motion of looking at the gauges was correct. It\u2019s sometimes a little bit different when you\u2019re hooking up to a plane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-13\">Q. Was the motion that Mr. Roberson just did to look up, which we all saw, is\u2014can you remember whether that\u2019s the motion you were involved in at the time that your neck popped?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-14\">A. It was\u2014It was watching the gauges at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-15\">Q. Is that looking straight up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-16\">A. Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-17\">The deputy commissioner saw this action and made certain findings of fact in her opinion. After observing the activity, she stated: \u201c[HJere the claimant merely looked upward to review the gauge, an activity that is too common to the public at large to be considered a peculiar risk of his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-18\">Not only did the deputy commissioner have the benefit of seeing and hearing witnesses, but she was able to see the demonstration of the witness Roberson which was observed by the claimant and agreed to by the claimant as the action he was making at the time his neck popped. We have held that observations at a hearing made by the deputy may not be arbitrarily disregarded. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 9 </em>Va. App. 120, 384 S.E.2d 333 (1987). Not only may an individual\u2019s neck flex but an individual\u2019s eyes are capable of looking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>both up and down. One can see even directly overhead without having to flex or tilt the neck in some extraordinary manner by merely focusing his or her eyes upwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The full commission found that \u201c[t]he claimant\u2019s work required that he tilt his head back at an angle that allows him to look directly overhead at the hose connection and fuel gauges which apparently are in the aircraft wing, and do so on a regular basis. While this, in itself, is not strenuous, we find upon review that it is an unusual or awkward position in which to work. He described an audible 'pop\u2019 in his neck followed immediately by tightness which became progressively worse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">I do not believe these findings are supported by credible evidence. I do not believe the commission, without arbitrarily disregarding the observations of the deputy, could find this to have been an injury by accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Because, in her finding of fact, the deputy commissioner described the type of movement made by the claimant as \u201cclaimant merely looked upward to view the gauge, an activity that is too common to the public at large to be considered a peculiar risk of the employment,\u201d I would hold on this record that claimant did not prove that the activity causing his accident was not one \u201ctoo common to the public at large to be considered a peculiar risk of his employment.\u201d <em>County of Chesterfield v. Johnson, </em>237 Va. 180, 376 S.E.2d 73 (1989).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b89-13\">On May 1,1993, Judge Moon succeeded Judge Koontz as Chief Judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
