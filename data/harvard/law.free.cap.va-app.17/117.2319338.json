Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The panel majority concluded that this case was controlled by our <em>en banc </em>decision in <em>Bethea </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 474, 419 S.E.2d 249 (1992), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>245 Va. 416, 429 S.E.2d 211 (1993), and a panel decision in <em>Hatcher </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 487, 419 S.E.2d 256 (1992), which was based in substantial part on <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Citing <em>Lansdown </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 204, 209, 308 S.E.2d 106, 110 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1104 (1984), the Virginia Supreme Court stated in <em>Bethea:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">[W]e need not determine whether the <em>de minimis </em>rationale utilized in <em>Mimms </em>is applicable to a passenger in a vehicle when the initial vehicle stop is predicated solely on matters pertaining to the driver. The facts of this case only require the application of the more general principle that Fourth Amendment interests are not violated when a police officer can \u201cpoint to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">245 Va. at 419, 429 S.E.2d at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">The record before us discloses that two members of the City of Richmond Police Strike Force lawfully stopped a vehicle being driven by Arthur Lee Coleman, whom they knew to be a drug dealer with a reputation for violence involving firearms. The officers had information that Coleman was being \u201cprotected,\u201d considered him dangerous and believed that he might be carrying a firearm. They arrested him for driving after his license had been suspended and, incident to that arrest, began to search his car. To complete the search, they asked appellant, who was a front-seat passenger, to step out of the car. Appellant appeared nervous and indicated a desire to leave the scene. Officer Talbert, a member of the Police Strike Force, believed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>these circumstances required a pat-down search for weapons for safety reasons. During the search, he discovered a .44 Magnum \u201ctucked in front of [appellant\u2019s] pants\u201d and arrested him for unlawfully carrying a concealed weapon. Incident to that arrest, a thorough search of appellant was conducted and approximately twenty-seven packets containing heroin were found in appellant\u2019s pants pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Without accepting or rejecting the reasons expressed in our decisions in <em>Bethea </em>and <em>Hatcher, </em>and the cases cited therein, we find that upon the totality of the circumstances shown by the evidence in the case before us, the officers did not violate appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Moon, C.J., Barrow, X, Coleman, X, Willis, X, Elder, X, Bray, X, and Fitzpatrick, X, concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b153-8\">Benton, X, with whom Koontz, X,</author>\n<p id=\"AST\">joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">At 3:00 p.m., two police officers drove onto a residential street and observed a vehicle stopped in the travel lane. The officers approached the vehicle to speak to the driver, and, as they approached the vehicle, the officers recognized the driver as a person whose license had been suspended. They removed the driver from the vehicle, searched him, and arrested him for driving on a suspended operator\u2019s license. The officers testified that after they arrested the driver, the passengers in the vehicle wanted to exit the vehicle and leave. However, the officers required them to stay in the vehicle. The officers then began to search the inside of the vehicle while the three passengers were required to remain in the vehicle. As the officer who was searching the inside of the vehicle moved near Pryor\u2019s seat, he made Pryor exit the vehicle. Another police vehicle was present when the officer approached the vehicle and before Pryor was removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Pryor was searched. The officer who searched Pryor testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-11\">Q You don\u2019t know, or you didn\u2019t know Mr. Pryor at that time, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-12\">A No, ma\u2019am, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-13\">Q You were not aware of any outstanding warrants for his arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>A No, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">Q You were not aware of any illegal activity that he had engaged in at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">A No, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">Q You did not see him do anything that looked illegal to you when he was sitting out in the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">A No, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">Q You said that for your protection you had him get out of the car and you patted him down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">A Well, I asked him to step out of the car to make room for Officer Vickers since he was performing a search of the vehicle. At that point for our own protection I wanted to pat him down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-11\">Q The only reason you removed him from the car was so Vickers could continue his search?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-12\">A Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-13\">Q With him out of the car you decided for your protection to be patted down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-14\">A Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-15\">When the officer began to search the back seat of the vehicle, the passengers on the back seat were also made to exit the vehicle. Those passengers were then searched for \u201csafety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-16\">It has long been established that \u201c[b]efore [a police officer] places a hand on the person of a citizen in search of anything, [the officer] must have constitutionally adequate, reasonable grounds for doing so.\u201d <em>Sibron v. New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 64 (1968). A police officer who searches an individual \u201cmust be able to point to particular facts from which [the officer] reasonably inferred that the individual was armed and dangerous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he authority to conduct a pat-down search does not automatically accompany an investigative detention.\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va. App. 53, 66, 354 S.E.2d 79, 86 (1987). \u201cThe detaining officer \u2018must have a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the <em>particular </em>person stopped of criminal activity.\u2019\u201d <em>Zimmerman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 609, 612, 363 S.E.2d 708, 709 (1988) (quoting <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417-18 (1981)) (emphasis added). Moreover, it long has been established that \u201ca person\u2019s mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity does not, without more, give rise to probable cause to search that person.\u201d <em>Ybarra </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>444 U.S. 85, 91 (1979) (citing <em>Sibron, 392 </em>U.S. at 62-63).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>The arresting officer testified that he searched Pryor simply because he believed Pryor might want to leave and because Pryor seemed nervous. The arresting officer testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">Q You know [the driver] and you believe him to be a dangerous person or possibly carry a firearm?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">A Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">Q You don\u2019t know Mr. Pryor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">A No, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\">Q You don\u2019t have any reason to think that Mr. Pryor would be carrying a firearm from your own independent knowledge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\">A There are a lot of people that carry guns out there, but, no. No specific knowledge that he was carrying a gun, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-12\">Q Or that he might be dangerous?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-13\">A Not specific knowledge, no, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-14\">Q The only thing that you observed was he seemed to be nervous?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-15\">A Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-16\">These reasons did not justify the detention and search of Pryor.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-17\">It is not abnormal behavior for a passenger in an automobile, or any other person, to be nervous when confronted by police officers. \u201cWhen confronted with a traffic stop, it is not uncommon for drivers and passengers alike to be nervous and excited and to turn to look at an approaching police officer.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schlosser, 774 </em>P.2d 1132, 1138 (Utah 1989). In <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 404, 404 S.E.2d 77 (1991), this Court addressed the practice of searching citizens who appear to be nervous when confronted by the police.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-18\">[T]he sole fact upon which the officer based his justification for the pat-down search was that Moore appeared \u201cvery nervous.\u201d This nervousness was reflected by Moore\u2019s hands shaking and the stuttering and stammering of his words when he spoke to the officer. Other than this appearance of nervousness, the facts reflect a routine stop by the police for a speeding violation. The stop took place in the early afternoon and Moore was alone in his car. Moore made no attempt to evade the police. He made no unusual gestures to suggest that he might have a weapon on his person or within the car. Though the officer was aware Moore was under surveillance, the officer conceded he did not know why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Moore was being watched and he did not know of any other reason to believe Moore might have been armed or dangerous. Finally, the officer admitted that it is common for a person to be nervous when stopped by the police. In short, the officer based the pat down on his subjective evaluation of the severity of Moore\u2019s nervousness. Based on this record, we hold that the officer lacked sufficient justification to conduct the pat-down search.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 406-07, 404 S.E.2d at 78. To permit a police officer to frisk a person because of nervousness is simply to allow \u201can individual\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy [to be] subject to arbitrary invasions solely at the unfettered discretion of officers in the field.\u201d <em>Brown v. Texas, </em>443 U.S. 47, 51 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The officer also expressed a concern because Pryor wanted to leave after the driver was arrested. In the absence of \u2018\u201ca reasonable suspicion, based on objective facts, that [Pryor was] involved in criminal activity,\u201d\u2019 <em>Zimmerman, </em>234 Va. at 611, 363 S.E.2d at 709 (quoting <em>Brown, </em>443 U.S. at 51), Pryor had a right to leave. Pryor\u2019s desire to leave after the driver was arrested was \u201cin accord with his Fourth Amendment rights and affords no basis for the officers\u2019 fear for their safety. [Furthermore,] . . . such desire [to leave] . . . tends to negate any basis for any intention on the part of [Pryor] to harm the officers.\u201d <em>United States v. Miller, </em>546 F.2d 251, 254 (8th Cir. 1976). A police officer\u2019s observation that a person manifested an \u201ceagerness to leave\u201d a place once the officer arrived does not establish \u201cconstitutionally adequate, reasonable grounds\u201d for conducting a search of that person. <em>Lett v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va. App. 191, 195, <em>372 </em>S.E.2d 195, 197 (1988) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Our case law affirmatively and unequivocally establishes that neither of these circumstances constitutes a basis upon which the officer could reasonably infer dangerousness. <em>See id. </em>at 195-96, 372 S.E.2d at 197-98; <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, 6 </em>Va. App. 384, 389, 369 S.E.2d 423, 425 (1988) (en banc).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">Nothing is more clear than that the Fourth Amendment was meant to prevent wholesale intrusions upon the personal security of our citizenry, whether these intrusions be termed \u201carrests\u201d or \u201cinvestigatory detentions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-9\"><em>Davis v. Mississippi, </em>394 U.S. 721, 726-27 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Because this record provides no justification for either the detention or the search of Pryor, I would reverse the conviction and dismiss the indictment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
