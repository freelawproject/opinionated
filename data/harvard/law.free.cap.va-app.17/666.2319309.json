For that reason, we reverse and remand that charge. We also find that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury as to the punishment provided for a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-1209. For that reason, we vacate the sentence and remand that charge for re-sentencing. We find no merit in the appellant\u2019s other assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">On November 29, 1991, Virginia State Trooper Robert Boice found an unoccupied car stopped with all four tires on the paved surface of Route 627 in Essex County. One of the car\u2019s tires was flat. Because the car was in a no passing zone on a two-lane road and was, thus, a highway hazard, Trooper Boice called for a tow truck to remove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Boice testified that fifteen minutes after he arrived, Keith Davis, Andrew Rouzie, and the appellant drove up. Boice asked who owned the unoccupied car. The appellant stated that it belonged to his girlfriend. When Boice asked who was driving the car when the tire went flat, the appellant stated that he was. The appellant produced the car\u2019s registration. Boice again asked who was driving, and the appellant again admitted that he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Boice requested the appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license. The appellant stated that he did not have it with him. Boice asked for his social security number. When Boice radioed this number into headquarters, the dispatcher informed him that that license was suspended. The appellant said that \u201cthe judge\u201d had taken his license. He then said that he had not been driving. Boice issued the appellant two Virginia Uniform Summonses charging violations of Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-301 and 46.2-1209. No warrants were ever obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">Before trial, the appellant\u2019s attorney moved to dismiss the driving on a suspended license charge on the ground that the trooper had arrested the appellant without a warrant for a misdemeanor not committed in the trooper\u2019s presence. The trial court denied the motion. It held that the unattended vehicle offense was a continuing offense and was, thus, committed in the trooper\u2019s presence. It distinguished between an arrest and the issuance of a summons within the context of Code \u00a7 19.2-81, which authorizes certain arrests without a warrant. The trial court further held that, assuming a violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-81 occurred, it was not of constitutional dimension and, therefore, did not bar the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">At trial, Keith Davis, Andrew Rouzie and the appellant each testified that Keith Davis was driving when the tire went flat. The appellant denied driving the car and denied telling the trooper that he was the driver. Keith Davis testified that the trooper approached the group and asked for the car\u2019s registration. He said that the appellant, who was closest to the passenger door, reached in and got the registration. When the trooper asked who owned the car, the appellant said, \u201cmy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>[girlfriend].\u201d All three men said that the trooper never asked who was driving the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The appellant offered the following jury instructions which the trial court refused.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">INSTRUCTION NO. A</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">The <em>corpus delicti </em>is the fact that the crime charged has been actually perpetrated. It is the body or substance of the crime and consists not merely of an objective crime but of the defendant\u2019s agency in the crime. It means proof that the crime occurred and that somebody\u2019s criminality was the source of the crime, as distinguished from accident or natural causes. In every prosecution for crime the Commonwealth must prove the <em>corpus delicti </em>as a material element of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">INSTRUCTION NO. B</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">The uncorroborated extrajudicial confessions of one accused of crime, standing alone, are not sufficient to establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>in any case. When the commission of the crime has been fully confessed by the accused, only slight corroborative evidence is necessary to establish the <em>corpus delicti. </em>However, the coincidence of circumstances tending to indicate guilt, however strong and numerous they may be, avails nothing unless the <em>corpus delicti, </em>the fact that the crime has been actually perpetrated, has been first established.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-10\">INSTRUCTION NO. C</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-11\">A police officer may not arrest a misdemeanant without a warrant except when an officer has personal knowledge acquired by his personal senses that an offense was committed in his presence, unless the arrest is one within the statutory exceptions. An offense is committed within the presence of an officer when he has direct personal knowledge through his sight, hearing, or other senses that it is then and there being committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-12\">The trial court gave Instruction No. 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-13\">Instruction No 6</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-14\">Defendant is charged with the crime of abandoning or leaving a motor vehicle unattended on the public highways constituting a hazard in the use of the highway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>To find the defendant guilty, you must find the motor vehicle was unattended or abandoned and that it constitutes a hazard in the use of the highway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of this offense, then you shall find the defendant guilty and fix his punishment at:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">A fine of a specific amount but not more than $250.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">If you find that the Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt either or both of the elements, then you shall find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and at the conclusion of all the evidence, the appellant moved to strike the evidence as insufficient to prove violations of Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-301 and 46.2-1209 beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court denied those motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">Process for arrest may be issued by the judge or clerk of a trial court or by a magistrate. Code \u00a7 19.2-71. Upon satisfactory evidence that probable cause exists, such officer shall issue a warrant. Code \u00a7 19.2-72. The warrant is the normal process upon which arrest is to be effected. However, this general requirement is subject to certain exceptions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-11\">Members of the State Police force of the Commonwealth . . . may arrest, without a warrant, any person who commits any crime in the presence of such officer and any person whom he has reasonable grounds or probable cause to suspect of having committed a felony not in his presence.. ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-12\">Any such officer may, at the scene of any accident involving a motor vehicle, watercraft ... or motorboat, or any hospital or medical facility to which any person involved in such accident has been transported, or in the apprehension of any person charged with the theft of any motor vehicle, on any of the highways or waters of the Commonwealth, upon reasonable grounds to believe . . . that a crime has been committed by any person then and there present, apprehend such person without a warrant of arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Code \u00a7 19.2-81. This Code section sets forth other exceptions to the warrant requirement not applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">An officer making an arrest on a warrant, unless he issues a summons pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-74 or 46.2-936, shall, without unnecessary delay, bring the arrested person before an official having authority to grant bail. Code \u00a7 19.2-80. An officer arresting a person without a warrant shall bring that person forthwith before an issuing authority who, upon examining the charge and finding probable cause, shall issue a warrant or a summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">In certain cases, the law makes provision for the expeditious release of an arrested person without appearance before an issuing authority and a bail determination.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">Whenever any person is detained by or in the custody of an arresting officer, including an arrest on a warrant, for a violation of any provision of this title punishable as a misdemeanor, the arresting officer shall . . . take the name and address of such person and the license number of his motor vehicle and issue a summons or otherwise notify him in writing to appear at a time and place to be specified in such summons or notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">Code \u00a7 46.2-936.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">The Commonwealth argues that, with respect to violations of Title 46.2, Code \u00a7 46.2-936 permits the employment of a summons in lieu of a warrant as arrest process for a misdemeanor not committed in the arresting officer\u2019s presence. Such is not the case. The summons is a post-arrest document which facilitates prompt release upon a promise to appear. It shortcuts the requirement that the accused be returned before the issuing authority for the purpose of setting bail, thus minimizing imposition and inconvenience both to the accused and to the arresting officer. This position in the structure of arrest is borne out by the language of the statutes authorizing arrest and the language of Code \u00a7 46.2-936. Code \u00a7 46.2-936 applies when an accused \u201cis detained by or in the custody of an arresting officer\u201d and refers specifically to an arrest on a warrant. The seizure of the person and the lodging of a charge against him comprise the arrest. The accomplishment of these acts brings into consideration the issuance of a summons. The summons is thereafter prepared and issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Both charges against Davis were misdemeanors. Trooper Boice\u2019s right to arrest him on those charges was prescribed and limited by Code \u00a7 19.2-81.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">An offense is committed within the presence of an officer . . . when he has direct personal knowledge through his sight, hearing, or other senses that it is then and there being committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-6\"><em>Durant v. City of Suffolk, 4 </em>Va. App. 445, 447, 358 S.E.2d 732, 733 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">The trial court ruled correctly that the violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-1209 was committed in the presence of the trooper. The hazardous presence of the car on the highway, observed by the trooper on his arrival, was a continuing violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-1209. Therefore, the trooper acted properly in issuing Davis a summons for the Code \u00a7 46.2-1209 violation, and that charge was properly before the court for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">The offense of operating a motor vehicle on a suspended license ended when the appellant stopped driving the car and did not continue thereafter. Although the trooper developed evidence of the commission of that offense, no part of the offense was committed in his presence. Therefore, he lacked authority to arrest the appellant on that charge without a warrant. The arrest was unlawful, and the summons issued on that charge was not a valid process to present that charge for trial. The trial court erred in trying that charge without a valid process.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">The appellant next contends that his confession of driving on a suspended license was uncorroborated and was, thus, insufficient to prove the <em>corpus delicti </em>of that offense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">\u201cIn Virginia an extrajudicial confession of an accused that he committed the offense with which he is charged is not, alone and uncorroborated, adequate proof of the <em>corpus </em>delicti.\u201d <em>Jefferson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 421, 424, 369 S.E.2d 212, 214 (1988) (citation omitted). <em>See also Campbell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 825, 833, 75 S.E.2d 468, 473 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>\u201cThe purpose of the corroboration rule is to reduce the possibility of punishing a person for a crime which was never, in fact, committed.\u201d Jefferson, 6 Va. App. at 424, 369 S.E.2d at 214. \u201cWhere \u2018the commission of the crime has been fully confessed by the accused, only <em>slight </em>corroborative evidence is necessary to establish the <em>corpus delicti. </em>\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The presence of the car on the highway and the dispatched information that Davis\u2019 operator\u2019s license was suspended corroborated his confession and, together with that confession, proved the <em>corpus delicti.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The appellant next contends that the trial court erred in refusing his tendered Instructions A, B and C and in refusing to instruct the jury on the meaning of the term \u201cabandonment.\u201d He correctly argues that, upon request, a trial court is required to give a correct, non-redundant, jury instruction that is supported by the evidence. Furthermore, an otherwise correct instruction, relating to a question to be decided by the jury, \u201cshall not be withheld from the jury solely for its non-conformance with model jury instructions.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-263.2. However, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s refusal of the instructions sought by Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">The definition of abandonment played no role in the decision of this case. The evidence disclosed that the car was left on the highway unattended and constituting a hazard. This satisfied the elements of Code \u00a7 46.2-1209. An issue of abandonment was not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">The issues of corroboration of the appellant\u2019s confession and of statutory arrest procedure requirements were matters of law for the trial judge to decide. They were not matters to be submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">The appellant next contends that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that the penalty for violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-1209 was a fine not exceeding $250. We agree. This offense is a traffic infraction. Prior to July, 1992, the maximum punishment for a traffic infraction was a fine not exceeding $100. The appellant\u2019s offense occurred on November 29, 1991. Although defense counsel failed to object to this incorrect instruction, which would normally invoke the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>bar of Rule 5A.T8, we find that the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception of Rule 5A:18 applies. <em>See Campbell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 988, 421 S.E.2d 652 (1992) <em>(en banc), aff\u2019d in part, </em>246 Va. 174, 431 S.E.2d 648 (1993). The $175 fine imposed for the Code \u00a7 46.2-1209 violation is excessive and, therefore, invalid. We remand that charge for resentencing. <em>See Bell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 530, 534, 399 S.E.2d 450, 453 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The appellant next contends that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cOn appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Josephs v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 87, 99, 390 S.E.2d 491, 497 (1990) <em>(en banc). </em>Whether the appellant confessed was a credibility issue for the jury. The trooper\u2019s testimony concerning the confession, together with the presence and location of the car on the highway and the dispatched information concerning his license, abundantly supports the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">The appellant finally contends that thirteen allegedly <em>sua sponte </em>comments by the trial judge prejudiced him before the jury and denied him a fair trial. Four of the statements occurred outside the jury\u2019s presence. The remaining nine statements are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">Is that the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">I think that is a legal conclusion for the jury to reach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-11\">That has been asked and answered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-12\">He charged him with the offense. That is in the record, Mr. Sebren.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-13\">We are discussing the issues here for the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-14\">Trooper Boice, when you got there, were the lights on this ve^ hide. [Boice responds \u201cNo.\u201d] All right, sir. Is there anything further?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-15\">No. There is concern that the defendant\u2019s witnesses are saying that Keith said something to him, to the trooper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>[T]he trooper knows nothing except what he was told. He does not know that there was an unattended car in the middle of the road, and based on that factor, I\u2019ll overrule your motion. All right, gentlemen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\">You have three more minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">We have got two charges, we have two forms. And you need to find that the defendant is guilty of either or both of them. And you put down the punishment that you agree on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The appellant failed to object to any of the foregoing comments. The ends of justice do not require that we address them. Therefore, we will not consider them on appeal. Rule 5A:18; <em>see Neal v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va. App. 416, 422-23, 425 S.E.2d 521, 525 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed. The charge of operating a motor vehicle with a suspended operator\u2019s license is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings on a proper process, if the Commonwealth be so advised. The conviction of leaving an unattended motor vehicle in a highway such as to constitute a hazard is remanded to the trial court for resentencing under the statute in force at the time of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">Koontz, X, concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b709-10\">Benton, X,</author>\n<p id=\"AHS\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">I concur in the portion of the opinion that reverses the conviction for driving on a suspended license. In addition, however, I would reverse the conviction for leaving an unattended motor vehicle on the roadway, and I would dismiss both convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">I agree that when the officer arrived on the scene the motor vehicle was unattended on the highway. However, the statute states that \u201c[n]o person shall leave any motor vehicle . . . unattended on . . . any roadway if it constitutes a hazard in the use of the highway.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-1209. Once Davis exited the automobile and departed, he left the automobile unattended. The offense was then complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">The evidence did not prove that Davis departed from the disabled vehicle in the presence of the officer. The presence of the automobile, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>standing alone, did not prove that Davis, rather than one of the other occupants of the automobile, left the automobile unattended on the roadway. Thus, the officer\u2019s testimony did not prove that Davis committed the offense in the officer\u2019s presence. <em>See, e.g., Penn </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 399, 412 S.E.2d 189 (1991) (although individual discarded a bottle, the officer could not arrest without a warrant for littering because the officer did not see the individual discard the bottle), <em>aff'd, </em>244 Va. 218, 420 S.E.2d 713 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Both convictions should be dismissed because of the improper arrests and prosecution on improper process.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
