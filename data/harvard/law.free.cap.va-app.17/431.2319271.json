Hill, </em>15 Va. App. 567, 425 S.E.2d 546 (1993). The Court stayed the mandate of that decision and granted a rehearing en banc. Upon rehearing, we affirm the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">Viewed in the light most favorable to Hill, who prevailed before the commission, <em>see Crisp </em>v. <em>Brown's Tysons Corner Dodge, Inc., </em>1 Va. App. 503, 504, 339 S.E.2d 916, 916 (1986), the evidence at the evidentiary hearing proved that Hill was director of photography for Marketing Profiles, Inc., a portrait photography business located in Richmond. As a part of his duties as director of photography, Hill was required to travel at least once each week to other states to take photographs to be used in church directories. Hill used his personal auto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>mobile when travelling to his assignments, and he received an expense allowance based upon the number of miles that he travelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">On July 14, 1990, Hill travelled in his automobile to Milford, Delaware, to take photographs at a church. When Hill completed his assignment, he telephoned a friend in Richmond and left a message that he was leaving Milford to return to Richmond. While Hill was driving his automobile on Route 301 in Maryland, \u201cthe shortest way\u201d from Milford to Richmond, he was injured in an automobile accident. The hospital records report that Hill was \u201ctrapped in car after he was hit on passenger side\u201d and that he suffered massive facial and dental injuries and trauma to the brain. Hill was unable to remember the period between three and four weeks before and after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The deputy commissioner concluded that Hill\u2019s inability to recall the details of the accident was \u201cnot a basis for finding that the evidence fails to establish a causal relationship between his employment and the accident.\u201d The deputy commissioner applied this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Helmes </em>v. <em>Pinkerton\u2019s, Inc., </em>11 Va. App. 196, 397 S.E.2d 402 (1990), which was later reversed by the Supreme Court, <em>Pinkerton\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Helmes, </em>242 Va. 378, 410 S.E.2d 646 (1991), and awarded Hill benefits. Although the commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s award, it based its decision not on <em>Helmes </em>but on its finding that \u201csufficient credible circumstantial evidence [existed] to allow an inference that the claimant suffered an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d A panel of this Court reversed the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">\u201cIn order to recover compensation for a work-related injury under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, one must satisfy the requirements of Code [\u00a7 65.2-101] which prescribe the nature of compensable injuries.\u201d <em>Hill City Trucking, Inc. v. Christian, </em>238 Va. 735, 738, 385 S.E.2d 377, 379 (1989). Injury\u2019 means . . . injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101. The concepts \u201carising out of\u201d and \u201cin the course of\u201d employment are not synonymous and both conditions must be proved before compensation will be awarded. <em>Bradshaw v. Aronovitch, </em>170 Va. 329, 335-36, 196 S.E. 684, 686 (1938). The burden rests upon claimant \u201cto prove them by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Baggett Transp. Co. v. Dillon, </em>219 Va. 633, 637, 248 S.E.2d 819, 822 (1978). Whether Hill\u2019s injury was an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d is not at issue on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>The evidence proved that Hill\u2019s injury occurred \u201cin the course of the employment\u201d because at the time the accident occurred Hill was on his employer\u2019s mission. Credible evidence in the record proved that Hill\u2019s injury occurred while he was returning to Richmond from the photography assignment. That assignment was an integral part of his employment duties. He was injured on a highway that was the shortest and most direct route between his employer\u2019s headquarters and the place where he performed his assigned duties. The commission\u2019s findings of these factual issues are supported by credible evidence. <em>See James v. Capitol Steel Constr. Co., </em>8 Va. App. 512, 517, 382 S.E.2d 487, 490 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Furthermore, any doubt whether Hill was in the course of his employment is dispelled by proof that Hill\u2019s employer reimbursed Hill for travel and mileage expenses related to Hill\u2019s use of his own automobile. The rule long has been established that \u201cinjuries sustained during the course of travel are compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act whenever the employer, for [the employee\u2019s] own convenience or because of the location of the workplace or places, agrees ... to reimburse the employee expenses incurred in the operation of [the employee\u2019s] own vehicle in the performance of [the employee\u2019s] duties.\u201d <em>Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Barnard, </em>236 Va. 41, 47, 372 S.E.2d 369, 372-73 (1988). Thus, the' commission\u2019s findings support the conclusion that Hill\u2019s injuries arose in the course of Hill\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">To satisfy the \u201carising out of\u201d prong of the compensability test, Hill had to prove that \u201cthere is apparent to the rational mind upon consideration of all the circumstances, a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury.\u201d <em>Bradshaw, </em>170 Va. at 335, 196 S.E. at 686. When an employee\u2019s presence on the streets is shown to be in the course of employment, \u201cVirginia, following the majority rule, has adopted what is known as the \u2018actual risk test,\u2019 under which, in the words of Larson, \u2018it is immaterial even whether the degree of exposure is increased, if in fact the employment subjected the employee to the hazards of the street, whether continuously or infrequently.\u2019 \u201d <em>Immer &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Brosnahan, </em>207 Va. 720, 725, 152 S.E.2d 254, 257 (1967) (quoting 1 Arthur Larson, <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 9.10 (1993)). Credible evidence proved that, at the time Hill was injured in the automobile accident, his travel on the highway directly linking Richmond and Milford was travel \u201cwhich he was authorized and obligated to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>\u00a1^therefore,] the hazards of highway travel thus became necessary incidents of his employment.\u201d <em>Immer, </em>207 Va. at 728, 152 S.E.2d at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The evidence proved and the commission found that Hill\u2019s injuries were caused by an automobile accident. Hill was in his automobile when he was injured. He was in transit from Milford to Richmond on the most direct highway route. Nothing in the record establishes that Hill was engaged in activities unrelated to his employment or that he was on the road as a result of a personal mission. The commission found from the evidence that when Hill sustained his injury, he \u201cwas at a place where the employer could expect him to be.\u201d Credible evidence supports that finding. Consequently, Hill carried his \u201cburden of supplying evidence from which the inference can be legitimately drawn that the injury arose out of . . . employment.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Suffolk Peanut Co., </em>171 Va. 439, 443, 199 S.E. 504, 506 (1938). \u201cIf there is evidence, or reasonable inferences can be drawn from the evidence, to support the Commission\u2019s findings, they will not be disturbed on review, even though there is evidence in the record to support a contrary finding.\u201d <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Badger Powhatan/Figgie Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>3 Va. App. 276, 279, 348 S.E.2d 876, 877 (1986). No evidence in this record supports a contrary finding. Hill\u2019s employer offered no evidence contradicting Hill\u2019s evidence that his automobile was hit on the passenger side while he was travelling on Route 301 in Maryland in the course of his employment. Under the actual street-risk rule, \u201cif the employment occasions the employee\u2019s use of the street, the risks of the street are the risks of the employment.\u201d 1 Arthur Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 9.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The employer argues that the panel decision in this case properly applied <em>Helmes </em>to reverse the commission\u2019s decision. <em>See Hill, </em>15 Va. App. at 571, 425 S.E.2d at 548. We disagree. The commission decision did not rely upon <em>Helmes </em>precisely because the principles addressed in <em>Helmes </em>are inapposite. Hill did not rely upon a presumption to prove that his injuries arose out of his employment. <em>Cf. Helmes, </em>242 Va. at 380, 410 S.E.2d at 647-48. The evidence in this case proved that Hill was injured in a vehicular accident when his automobile was hit on the passenger side. The accident occurred while Hill was on a mission for his employer that required him to be in his automobile at the place and time when he was injured. Because Hill\u2019s employer sanctioned Hill\u2019s use of his automobile as a means of transportation to his assignments, \u201c[t]he hazards of highway travel. . .became necessary incidents of his employment.\u201d <em>Immer, </em>207 Va. at 728, 152 S.E.2d at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>For these reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Moon, C.J., Barrow, J., Coleman, I, Willis, J., Elder, J., and Fitzpatrick, X, concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b470-7\">Bray, X, with whom Baker, X and Koontz, X</author>\n<p id=\"Am\">join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Because the majority construes the \u201cactual risk test\u201d to support an award of workers\u2019 compensation benefits for all unexplained injuries suffered in the course of employment on a street or highway, we respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">In order to recover, Hill must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, (1) an injury by accident,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) arising out of and (3) in the course of his employment. <em>Baggett Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Dillon, </em>219 Va. 633, 636, 248 S.E.2d 819, 821 (1978); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-101. Employer\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of Hill\u2019s evidence to establish his claim presents \u201ca mixed question of law and fact . . . properly reviewable on appeal\u201d to this Court. <em>Sentara Leigh Hosp. v. Nichols, </em>13 Va. App. 630, 633, 414 S.E.2d 426, 428 (1992) (en banc). Thus, \u201cwe must determine whether the Commission\u2019s findings from the facts presented are sufficient in law to justify the award of compensation.\u201d <em>Baggett, </em>219 Va. at 637, 248 S.E.2d at 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">The \u201carising out of\u201d proof, indispensable to Hill\u2019s recovery, must establish \u201ca causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury\u201d that is \u201capparent to the rational mind upon consideration of all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Bradshaw </em>v. <em>Aronovitch, </em>170 Va. 329, 335, 196 S.E. 684, 686 (1938) (quoting <em>In re McNicol, </em>215 Mass. 497, 499, 102 N.E. 697, 697 (1913)); <em>see also United Parcel Serv. v. Fetterman, </em>230 Va. 257, 258-59, 336 S.E.2d 892, 893 (1985). The injury must have \u201cfollowed as a natural incident of the work\u201d and resulted from an \u201cexposure occasioned by the nature of the employment.\u201d <em>United Parcel, </em>230 Va. at 258, 336 S.E.2d at 893. The evidence must show \u201csomething more\u201d than the occurrence of an \u201caccident . . . during the period of the employment,\u201d <em>Norfolk &amp; Washington Steamboat Co. v. Holladay, </em>174 Va. 152, 158, 5 S.E.2d 486, 489 (1939), and the \u201cpeculiar circumstances of each case are crucial,\u201d especially when, \u201cas here, the injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>. . . occurs at a place other than the employer\u2019s premises.\u201d <em>Sentara, </em>13 Va. App. at 633, 414 S.E.2d at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">However, \u201cpresence on the street or highway\u201d necessitated by employment poses a risk to the employee which generally has not required evidence of an \u201cincreased hazard peculiar to the work and not common to the public.\u201d <em>Immer &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Brosnahan, </em>207 Va. 720, 725, 152 S.E.2d 254, 257 (1967). Recognizing the inherent dangers of the highway to anyone whose \u201cwork necessitates\u201d such exposure, an \u201cactual risk test\u201d has developed in \u201cstreet cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 725-26, 152 S.E.2d at 257-58; <em>see also Norfolk &amp; Washington Steamboat Co., </em>174 Va. at 159, 5 S.E.2d at 489; <em>Cohen v. Cohen\u2019s Dep\u2019t Store, </em>171 Va. 106, 110, 198 S.E. 476, 477-78 (1938); <em>Railway Express Agency v. Lewis, </em>156 Va. 800, 809-10, 159 S.E. 188, 191 (1931); <em>Dreyfus &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Meade, </em>142 Va. 567, 574, 129 S.E. 336, 338 (1925). Injury under these circumstances is deemed to arise \u201cin the course of the employment,\u201d provided (1) the employee\u2019s \u201cduties . . . require ... [a] presence upon the public streets,\u201d <em>and </em>(2) the \u201cinjury arose from an actual risk of that presence upon the streets.\u201d <em>Sentara, </em>13 Va. App. at 634, 414 S.E.2d at 428. We find the second element of the test dispositive of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">While the \u201cactual risk test\u201d assists Hill in proving the requisite nexus between employment and the myriad threats of the highway, his evidence must, nevertheless, relate his injury to a street risk which is compensable, thereby eliminating the \u201cpossibility\u201d of causes \u201ctotally unrelated\u201d to the street risks of employment. <em>Park Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Parham, </em>1 Va. App. 166, 170, 336 S.E.2d 531, 534 (1985); <em>see Hill City Trucking, Inc. v. Christian, </em>238 Va. 735, 739, 385 S.E.2d 377, 379-80 (1989); <em>Baggett, </em>219 Va. at 643-44, 248 S.E.2d at 825. The necessity of such proof distinguishes the \u201cactual risk\u201d concept from the \u201cpositional risk doctrine,\u201d long disfavored in Virginia. <em>Baggett, </em>219 Va. at 640, 248 S.E.2d at 823; <em>Hill City Trucking, </em>238 Va. at 739, 385 S.E.2d at 379; <em>Dreyfus &amp; Co., </em>142 Va. at 573-74, 129 S.E. at 337-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">We do not disagree with the conclusion that Hill adequately established an injury by accident during the course of his employment. However, his evidence fails to \u201cexplain the circumstances of the accident\u201d sufficiently to connect the occurrence to a compensable street risk. <em>Pinkerton\u2019s, Inc. v. Helmes, </em>242 Va. 378, 380, 410 S.E.2d 646, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>648 (1991).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We indulge no presumption or inference that dispenses with proof that an unexplained highway accident \u201carose out of\u201d employment. <em>See id. </em>at 381, 410 S.E.2d at 648.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe burden of supplying evidence from which the inference can be legitimately drawn that the injury arose out of. . . employment, rests upon the claimant,\u201d and \u201c[a]n award based upon surmise or conjecture will be set aside.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Suffolk Peanut Co., </em>171 Va. 439, 443, 199 S.E. 504, 506 (1938); <em>see Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Hairston, 2 </em>Va. App. 677, 682, 347 S.E.2d 527, 529 (1986). Hill urges us not only to imagine causation but to exclude all noncompensable possibilities from the fantasy.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">We are mindful that factual findings of the commission, based on credible evidence, are conclusive and binding upon this Court. <em>Fairfax Hosp. v. DeLaFleur, </em>221 Va. 406, 410, 270 S.E.2d 720, 722 (1980); Code \u00a7 65.2-706 (former Code \u00a7 65.1-98). If \u201creasonable inferences\u201d may be drawn from credible evidence, \u201cthey will not be disturbed by this Court on appeal.\u201d <em>Hawks </em>v. <em>Henrico County Sch. Bd., </em>7 Va. App. 398, 404, 374 S.E.2d 695, 698 (1988). However, before circumstantial evidence \u201c\u2018may serve as the basis from which further inference of fact may be drawn,\u2019\u201d it first \u201cmust establish a fact,\u201d reliance upon which is not to be \u201cextremely attenuated.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va. App. 73, 77, 422 S.E.2d 593, 595 (1992) (citations omitted). While the record may establish Hill\u2019s injury in an automobile accident in the course of employment, this evidence does not support factual inferences in explanation of the accident, proof of which is essential to an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">We recognize that the Act \u201cshould be liberally construed to carry out . . . [its] humane and beneficial purposes,\u201d- but the General Assembly has not \u201cauthorize[d] the amendment, alteration or extension of its provisions\u201d by either the commission or this Court. <em>Baggett, </em>219 Va. at 637, 248 S.E.2d at 822. Hill simply failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his injuries arose from employment, and we would, therefore, reverse the decision of the commission.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-11\"> Hill\u2019s proof of injury by accident is not a substantive issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\"> Contrary to the majority opinion, the commission noted that it \u201cdid not base [its] decision\u201d in the instant case on <em>Helmes </em>because that case was then \u201cpending before the Supreme Court of Virginia.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b472-8\"> The vehicular accident in <em>Pinkerton's </em>did not occur on a <em>public </em>roadway.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
