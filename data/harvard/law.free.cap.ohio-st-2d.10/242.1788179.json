Co., </em>171 Ohio St. 405, 371 N. E. 2d 518, were properly applied by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">The <em>Cantor case </em>stands for the general proposition that, where an employee has complied with the conditions of his contract of employment, benefits have been promised and conferred on him by his employer as an inducement for the continuance of his service to the employer, and such employee reaches the specified retirement age, he acquires, by the promise and agreement of his employer, a vested right to those benefits, and, in the absence of good and sufficient causes for forfeiture, he may not be deprived thereof, notwithstanding a proviso in the contract of employment to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">We likewise agree with the Court of Appeals that the employer may change the insurer from the existing one to another, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>and that it may cancel insurance as to those of its employees who are still working and have not retired.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">In accordance with the views expressed, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b266-6\">Zimmerman, Matthias, O\u2019Neill, Herbert, Schneider and Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b266-7\">Schneider, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AyJ\">concurring. The <em>Cantor case </em>(171 Ohio St. 405) was stronger than the court indicates. The individual written contract of employment there specifically provided that the disputed benefits were <em>nonnested </em>and that it (the contract) was cancelable at the will of either party without cause.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
