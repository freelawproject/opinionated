The defendant violated the ordinance. In her confession she said: \u201c* * * I called the police and told them a man had broken into my apartment and robbed and beat me. The police and detectives came and questioned me about the robbery and I told them a lie about how it happened. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">At an earlier point in her confession, the defendant stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b98-14\">\u201c * * * Billy asked me what I was going to do about the $1,200 [the money which she had previously stolen from her father]. I said I didn\u2019t know. He figured that if all of the money was taken from my father\u2019s room and we made it look like a robbery that I wouldn\u2019t get bounced (trouble) from my father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-15\">The defendant gave a false report to the police when she called them on the telephone to summon an officer, and she gave a false report to the police when they came to her apartment in answer to her call. She made these false reports to the police with \u201cintent to mislead * * * such officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-16\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is, therefore, reversed, as contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-17\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b98-18\">Taut, C. J., Zimmerman, Matthias, Herbert, Schneider and Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
