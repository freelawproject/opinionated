In no case shall such a building be considered to be located in more than one area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The purpose of this section is to resolve boundary-line questions, where, because of the geographical location of a customer, there is a question as to whether such customer falls into the service area of one public utility or another.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The Public Utilities Commission interpreted \u201centrance\u201d as used in this rule relating to the furnishing of a public utility service as the driveway leading to the doorway which opens into the lobby of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">The determination as to what constitutes the principal entrance to a building in relation to the rendering of a public utility service is a question of fact. Such determination lies primarily within the judgment of the Public Utilities Commission, and we will not substitute our judgment therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">An examination of the record leads to the conclusion that the order of the Public Utilities Commission is neither unreasonable nor unlawful, and it is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b268-12\">Taet, C.
