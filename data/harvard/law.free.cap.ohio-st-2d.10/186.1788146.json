This is exemplified from the record as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"ARG\">\u201cDefendant: If I plead guilty, that\u2019s the only way to get the thing over with and get it done because I don\u2019t have the money to get a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">\u201cCourt: As I said, at the proper time I would furnish you with a lawyer. I want it fully understood; however, you know in your own mind whether you are guilty or not. If you are guilty, it\u2019s one thing, then maybe you are sick and you should go to Lima State Hospital. If you are not guilty of the offense, that\u2019s a different story. You know whether or not you are guilty yourself, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">\u201cDefendant: I know, but fighting it is another thing, you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>know, because it takes a lot of money to get a lawyer here, even to start it, any of them in town here wants five hundred. I don\u2019t know, my dad says he\u2019d---</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u201cCourt: Your father thinks you\u2019re guilty, doesn\u2019t he?</p>\n<p id=\"Ak3\">\u201cDefendant: I don\u2019t know, to tell you the truth, I really don\u2019t know. He said he\u2019d help me all he could on the money part. I got a lot of bills going that I can\u2019t pay and I can\u2019t get the lawyer, so the best thing to do is go ahead and plead guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Afm\">Two other times in the record appellant said he did not have money for an attorney. It is clear that he never understood that if he was indigent the court would appoint counsel for Mm at the expense of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">The motion to certify is allowed and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed. The appellant\u2019s conviction is vacated and the cause is remanded to the Court of Common Pleas for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b209-10\">Taut, C. J., Zimmerman, Matthias, O\u2019Neill, Hbrbbrt, Schneider and Brown, JJ., coneur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
