The notice was then out of the control of the appellant. Due to the delay occasioned by the adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>trative processes of the prison it did not reach the Court of Appeals until the filing date was past.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Section 2953.23, Revised Code, provides that an order denying postconviction relief \u201cmay be appealed pursuant to Chapter 2505 of the Revised Code.\u201d Section 2505.07, Revised Code, provides that \u201cthe period of time within which\u201d an appeal to the Court of Appeals shall be perfected is \u201cwithin 20 days.\u201d Section 2505.04, Revised Code, states that \u201can appeal is perfected when written notice of appeal is filed with the lower court,\u201d and that thereafter \u201cno step required to be taken * * <em>* </em>is jurisdictional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">In our opinion, a defendant incarcerated in prison and acting without the aid of counsel files his notice of appeal in time, if, within the 20-day period specified in Section 2505.07, Revised Code, he delivers such notice to the proper prison authorities for forwarding to the court. In such a case, the jailer in effect represents the lower court within the meaning of Section 2505.04, Revised Code. We believe that such a conclusion is required by <em>Fallen </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1964), 378 U. S. 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The motion to certify is allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Court of Appeals for a hearing upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b218-9\">Taft, C.
