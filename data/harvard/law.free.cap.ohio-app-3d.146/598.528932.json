The principal issue on appeal is whether McDonald was denied his due process right to a hearing when his salary was discontinued without a hearing after he had previously been suspended with pay. The trial court held that a subsequent arbitration proceeding that ordered McDonald restored to his position satisfied the due process requirement. We do not agree. Therefore, the summary judgment rendered on the claim for relief in which the issue arises, which is a claim for violation of McDonald\u2019s civil rights, will be reversed, and the matter will be remanded for further proceedings on that claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">{\u00b6 2} Dayton Police Officer Michael McDonald was on duty during the evening hours of February 17, 1998. He went to a Wendy\u2019s restaurant to order his dinner. After placing his order and paying for it, McDonald and the order clerk got into a dispute over the amount of change she gave him, which McDonald claimed was too little. The dispute escalated and McDonald decided to arrest the clerk. When she refused to submit, McDonald used his pepper spray to disable her. These events were observed by other people at the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">{\u00b6 3} McDonald is white. The female employee is African American. McDonald\u2019s use of pepper spray produced considerable commotion and protest, both at the restaurant that night and during the ensuing weeks in the Dayton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>community, where organized opposition was voiced to police conduct in general vis-a-vis race and with respect to McDonald\u2019s actions in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">{\u00b6 4} McDonald\u2019s supervisor was called to the restaurant on the night of the incident and decided to send McDonald home. The following day, February 18, 1998, McDonald was ordered to attend a \u201cshow cause hearing\u201d concerning allegations of misconduct and any discipline that might be imposed. On that same date McDonald was suspended from active duty with pay, conditioned on the positive results of a psychological examination he was ordered to undergo.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">{\u00b6 5} The report of McDonald\u2019s psychological examination indicated that he was fit for duty. On February 25, 1998, McDonald was assigned to a clerical job in the Dayton Police Division. However, McDonald was removed from that position and was again sent home on February 26, 1998. His pay was continued during the ensuing suspension, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">{\u00b6 6} On March 18,1998, one month after McDonald was first suspended with pay, criminal charges arising from the Wendy\u2019s incident were filed against him in Dayton Municipal Court. McDonald was charged with four misdemeanors: assault, attempted assault, criminal trespassing, and disorderly conduct. As a direct result of these charges, McDonald\u2019s salary was discontinued by the city of Dayton during his suspension. The city conducted no form of hearing prior to its decision to discontinue McDonald\u2019s salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">{\u00b6 7} The criminal charges against McDonald were prosecuted on the city\u2019s behalf by a special prosecutor from another jurisdiction. The case was heard by a visiting judge, who dismissed three of the charges against McDonald and acquitted him on the remaining charge in June 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">{\u00b6 8} In July 1998, the Internal Affairs Division of the Dayton Police Department began an investigation of the Wendy\u2019s incident. As a result of its investigation, Internal Affairs served charges and specifications on McDonald. On July 21, 1998, Chief of Police Ronald Lowe conducted a predisciplinary hearing on the matter. Chief Lowe terminated McDonald on July 24, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">{\u00b6 9} The Fraternal Order of Police, which is the organized labor bargaining agent for Dayton police officers, filed two grievances on McDonald\u2019s behalf. Each grievance was submitted to an arbitrator pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. Regarding the first grievance, which contested McDonald\u2019s March 18, 1998 suspension without pay, the arbitrator found that McDonald\u2019s suspension without pay from March 18 through his termination on July 24, 1998, was improper and sustained the grievance. The second grievance pertained to McDonald\u2019s July 24, 1998 termination. The arbitrator found that McDonald should be reinstated effective July 15, 1999, but without back pay, subject to certain conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>{\u00b6 10} The city appealed the second arbitrator\u2019s decision to reinstate McDonald, arguing that the arbitrator had exceeded her powers. The court upheld the arbitrator\u2019s decision, and we later affirmed. See <em>Dayton v. F.O.P., Capt. John C. Post Lodge No. 44 </em>(June 2, 2000), Montgomery App. No. 18158, 2000 WL 706829.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">{\u00b6 11} McDonald filed the action underlying this appeal on July 21, 1999, alleging that the city, the Dayton Police Department, and Chief Lowe had deprived McDonald of his due process rights in violation of Section 1988, Title 42, U.S. Code. McDonald also alleged libel and slander by Chief Lowe, both individually and in his official capacity, and libel and slander by <em>Rev. </em>Raleigh Trammell, the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Council, both individually and in his official capacity, and reverse discrimination in violation of R.C. 4112.02 by the city and the Dayton Police Department. The trial court granted summary judgment to all defendants on all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">{\u00b6 12} McDonald appeals only the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the civil rights claims against the city and Chief Lowe. McDonald presents three assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment on the due process claims because the predisciplinaxy hearing did not satisfy due process requirements in that the decision was predetermined prior to the beginning of the hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">{\u00b6 14} Summary judgment may not be granted unless the entire record demonstrates that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is, on that record, entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Civ.R. 56. The burden of showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists is on the moving party. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\"> {\u00b6 15} In reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, an appellate court must view the facts in a light most favorable to the party who opposed the motion. <em>Osborne v. Lyles </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 326, 587 N.E.2d 825. \u201cBecause a trial court\u2019s determination of summary judgment concerns a question of law, we apply the same standard as the trial court in our review of its disposition of the motion; in other words, our review is <em>de novo.\u201d Am. States Ins. Co. v. Guillermin </em>(1996), 108 Ohio App.3d 547, 552, 671 N.E.2d 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">{\u00b6 16} McDonald\u2019s due process violation claims undergird his claims for relief alleging a deprivation of his civil rights. In that regard, McDonald argues that because Chief Lowe had decided to terminate him before the July 21, 1998 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>hearing that resulted in his termination, McDonald was deprived of his rights of due process. Therefore, according to McDonald, the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment for the city and Chief Lowe on McDonald\u2019s civil rights claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">{\u00b6 17} Title 42, Section 1983, U.S.Code provides a remedy for violations of substantive rights created by the United States Constitution or federal statute and is limited to deprivations of those rights. <em>Brkic v. Cleveland </em>(1997), 124 Ohio App.3d 271, 706 N.E.2d 10. Section 1983 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">{\u00b6 19} A plaintiff who commences a Section 1983 action must allege that some person has deprived him of a federal right and that the person acted under color of law. <em>Gomez v. Toledo </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 635, 100 S.Ct. 1920, 64 L.Ed.2d 572. For the purposes of Section 1983, municipalities and other local government units may be found to have acted under color of law. <em>Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Serv. </em>(1978), 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611. However, a municipality may not be held liable on a Section 1983 claim under a theory of respondeat superior; rather, an execution of a government\u2019s policy or custom must inflict the injury for which the government as an entity is responsible under Section 1983. Id. Recovery from a municipality is limited to acts that the municipality has officially sanctioned or ordered. <em>Brkic, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">{\u00b6 20} The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment states that no state shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\u201d A two-step analysis is used when considering a claim that due process rights were violated. First, a court must determine whether the claimant has a right or interest that is entitled to due process protection. Second, if the claimant was deprived of such a right or interest, the court must determine what process is due. <em>Cleveland Bd. of Edn. v. Loudermill </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 532, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">{\u00b6 21} Regarding the first question, whether McDonald possessed a Fourth Amendment property interest in continued employment with the city police department, property rights \u201care created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law \u2014 rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>support claims of entitlement to those benefits.\u201d <em>Leary v. Daeschner </em>(C.A.6, 2000), 228 F.3d 729, 741, quoting <em>Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548. A contract, such as a collective bargaining agreement, may create a property interest. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">{\u00b6 22} McDonald possessed a property interest in his employment as a police officer for the city of Dayton that arose from his position as a \u201cclassified\u201d employee pursuant to R.C. 124.11. In addition, the collective bargaining agreement between the FOP and the city established his property right. Therefore, the first prong of the due process inquiry is satisfied with respect to and on the basis of his deprivation of a property interest or some right associated with it. Therefore, we next turn to the second prong of <em>Loudermill, </em>what process McDonald was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">{\u00b6 23} Generally, when a plaintiff is deprived of a protected property interest, a predeprivation hearing of some sort is required to satisfy the dictates of due process. <em>Loudermill, </em>supra. The predeprivation process need not be elaborate, depending upon the importance of the interests at stake. Id. When determining the amount of process due, a balance must be struck between the private right in retaining the property interest, the governmental interest in swift removal of unsatisfactory employees and avoidance of administrative burdens, and the risk of an erroneous decision. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">{\u00b6 24} Here, a predeprivation hearing was held on July 21, 1998, before McDonald was terminated from his position on July 24. McDonald argues that the hearing was nevertheless insufficient to satisfy due process requirements because the decisionmaker, Chief Lowe, had determined prior to the hearing to terminate McDonald. In other words, McDonald argues that the July 21, 1998 predeprivation hearing was a sham.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">{\u00b6 25} Though it confers only a limited \u201cright of reply,\u201d a predeprivation hearing is designed \u201c\u2018to invoke the employer\u2019s discretion,\u2019 his sense of fairness and mutual respect, his willingness to reconsider. It is not designed or well-adapted to uncover the employer\u2019s bias or corrupt motivation.\u201d <em>Duchesne v. Williams </em>(C.A.6, 1988), 849 F.2d 1004, 1008, quoting <em>Loudermill, </em>supra In addition, predeprivation hearings do not require the kind of neutral and independent decisionmaker that independent, quasi-judicial appeals from the deprivation would require. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">{\u00b6 26} In <em>Wagner v. Memphis </em>(W.D.Tenn.1997), 971 F.Supp. 308, the district court found that it was clear from the evidence that the outcome of a police officer\u2019s predeprivation hearing was predetermined, regardless of the proof presented at the hearing. Therefore, the court found that the hearing failed to satisfy the concerns and goals of <em>Loudermill.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>{\u00b6 27} There was evidence that Chief Lowe had condemned and repudiated McDonald\u2019s use of pepper spray in the Wendy\u2019s incident. Also, there was evidence that Chief Lowe and the city were under considerable public pressure to avoid such conduct, which was alleged to arise from a racial bias and poor management. This evidence portrays the possibility of bias. However, it does not portray a resolve to terminate McDonald\u2019s employment that was so fixed and absolute as to render McDonald\u2019s hearing before Chief Lowe on July 21, 1998, a sham. <em>Wagner, supra. </em>Therefore, no genuine issue of material fact exists concerning whether McDonald\u2019s due process rights were violated in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">{\u00b6 28} The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cThe court erred in finding that plaintiffs suspension without pay on March 18, 1998, was not a violation of his procedural due process rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">{\u00b6 30} Focusing on a different grounds alleged in support of his civil rights claim for relief, the city\u2019s action discontinuing his salary during his previously imposed suspension after criminal charges were subsequently filed against him, McDonald argues that the city\u2019s failure to conduct a form of hearing required by <em>Loudermill, </em>supra, before it discontinued his salary violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">{\u00b6 31} The city responds that no predeprivation hearing was required before it discontinued McDonald\u2019s salary because he was then suspended from his position, and as his employer, the city was justified in discontinuing his salary until the criminal charges were resolved. The city argues that the show cause hearing held one month earlier on February 18, 1998, resulting in McDonald\u2019s suspension with pay, was all that was required when his salary was later discontinued during the suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">{\u00b6 32} The issue is not whether the city was justified in discontinuing McDonald\u2019s salary but whether the loss he suffered as a result was a deprivation of his property interests that required a hearing. McDonald had a property interest in his salary; he had been employed by the city as a police officer since 1986. Furthermore, the deprivation he suffered was not a product or feature of McDonald\u2019s earlier suspension with pay because the questions it presented concerning the criminal charges and the loss of pay involved were not embraced by the hearing that was held when he was suspended. Therefore, the prior February 18, 1998 hearing cannot serve to satisfy McDonald\u2019s due process rights to a hearing on the deprivation of his property interests in his salary that took place a month later on March 18,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>{\u00b6 33} The trial court, which essentially took the same position on the lack of a predeprivation hearing, found that McDonald\u2019s due process rights were nevertheless protected by procedures following his termination on July 24, 1998. Stated otherwise, the trial court found that the <em>measure </em>of process that McDonald was due with respect to the loss of his salary was afforded McDonald by those \u201cpost-deprivation\u201d procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">{\u00b6 34} As noted above, courts have traditionally balanced three factors to determine what process is constitutionally due: \u201cFirst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>Gilbert v. Homar </em>(1997), 520 U.S. 924, 932-933, 117 S.Ct. 1807, 138 L.Ed.2d 120, quoting <em>Mathews v. Eldridge </em>(1976), 424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">{\u00b6 35} The amount of post-deprivation procedures available impacts the amount of predeprivation procedure required. <em>Leary, </em>supra. In some cases, post-deprivation review may be sufficient and no predeprivation process is required. <em>Gilbert, </em>supra; Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Mallen (1988), 486 U.S. 230, 108 S.Ct. 1780, 100 L.Ed.2d 265; <em>Ramsey v. Whitley Cty. Bd. of Edn. </em>(C.A.6, 1988), 844 F.2d 1268.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">{\u00b6 36} In <em>FDIC, </em>supra, a bank president who was indicted on felony charges was suspended without a predeprivation hearing on the authority of a federal statute that authorized the FDIC to suspend an indicted official of a federally insured bank. The court recognized that the governmental interest girding the statute was to protect the interests of depositors and maintain public confidence. See 486 U.S. at 240-241, 108 S.Ct. 1780, 100 L.Ed.2d 265. The court noted that \u201can important governmental interest, accompanied by a substantial assurance that the deprivation is not baseless or unwarranted, may in limited cases demanding prompt action justify postponing the opportunity to be heard until after the initial deprivation.\u201d Id. at 240, 108 S.Ct. 1780, 100 L.Ed.2d 265. The court found that the independent grand jury determination of probable cause to believe that the bank president had committed a felony was sufficient to support the bank president\u2019s suspension before a suspension hearing was held. See id. at 240-241, 108 S.Ct. 1780, 100 L.Ed.2d 265. The court further emphasized that the post-deprivation hearing took place without undue delay. See id. at 241-242, 108 S.Ct. 1780, 100 L.Ed.2d 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">{\u00b6 37} In <em>Gilbert, </em>supra, the Supreme Court built upon the <em>FDIC </em>precedent. There a university police officer was arrested and charged by state police with felony drug charges. The university immediately suspended the officer without pay, and he brought a due process claim against the university for failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>conduct a predeprivation hearing. The court found that an employee charged with a felony could be suspended without pay without a predeprivation hearing. See 520 U.S. at 933-934, 117 S.Ct. 1807, 138 L.Ed.2d 120. The court emphasized that temporary suspension without pay was not as severe as termination, and therefore less deserving of a predeprivation hearing, as long as the post-termination procedure was sufficiently prompt. See id. at 932, 117 S.Ct. 1807, 138 L.Ed.2d 120. The court noted that fringe benefits, such as health and life insurance, are often not affected by a suspension without pay. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">{\u00b6 38} Taken together, these cases present several variables that determine whether predeprivation process is necessary: (1) the nature of the interest deprived (the loss of employment versus some benefit that the employment offers); (2) the promptness of the post-deprivation hearing; (3) the public interest to be protected; and (4) the existence of objective corroboration of the alleged offense leading to the administrative action. <em>FDIC, </em>supra; <em>Gilbert, </em>supra. See, also, <em>Mathews, </em>supra. Applying these factors to the matter before us, we find that McDonald was denied a predeprivation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">{\u00b6 39} First, the property interest McDonald lost when he was deprived of his pay was substantial. Although he was not terminated until July 24, 1998, a loss of pay for more than three months is substantial, even where fringe benefits continue. Therefore, we find that this factor weighs in McDonald\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">{\u00b640} Regarding the second factor, the promptness of the post-deprivation hearing, the trial court found that the labor arbitration procedure that McDonald invoked under the collective bargaining agreement between the FOP and the city amounted to effective post-deprivation relief. However, the requirements of procedural due process are not necessarily satisfied by a post-deprivation hearing of a public employee. <em>Ohio Assn. of Pub. School Emp., AFSCME, AFL-CIO v. Lakewood City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 175, 624 N.E.2d 1043. An arbitration hearing may be sufficient to satisfy due process if the grieving party is provided \u201cmeaningful opportunity to challenge the adverse evidence.\u201d Id. at 179, 624 N.E.2d 1043. Nevertheless, the post-deprivation hearing must be sufficiently prompt. See <em>Gilbert, </em>supra; FDIC, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">{\u00b6 41} Here, the arbitration proceeding regarding McDonald\u2019s first grievance, his suspension without pay from March 18 through July 24, 1998, continued until March 12, 1999, almost a year after McDonald was suspended without pay. Therefore, even if the arbitration procedure amounted to a post-deprivation hearing, it was not sufficiently prompt.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">{\u00b6 42} The city argues that any lack of promptness in the arbitration proceeding should not prevent it from meeting the requirements of due process because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>McDonald himself created the delay when he sought arbitration through the FOP and its labor agreement with the city. McDonald\u2019s alternative was a civil service appeal, but there is no reason to believe that it would have been substantially more prompt. The argument, which apparently found favor in the trial court, misses the point, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">{\u00b6 43} It was the city\u2019s burden and duty to offer McDonald a prompt post-deprivation hearing if no predeprivation hearing was held. It was not McDonald\u2019s burden to create that relief himself through the prosecution of his own claim. In any event, his options in that regard were open to him only after he was terminated from his position on July 24, 1998, more than four months after his salary had been discontinued during his suspension. That passage of time prevented the arbitration from being reasonably prompt in relation to the discontinuation of his salary on March 18, 1998, as well as the relatively simple and straightforward grounds on which the city relied to justify that discipline. Therefore, the lack of promptness prevents the arbitration from being a sufficient post-deprivation proceeding for purposes of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">{\u00b6 44} Regarding the third factor, the public interest involved, we find no compelling public interest that required altering McDonald\u2019s paid suspension to a suspension without pay. McDonald was not on duty when he was suspended without pay, having been sent home with pay on February 26, 1998. While the city might as a matter of policy not wish to pay someone whom it was prosecuting, the damage to the public interest in continuing a suspended employee\u2019s pay until the charges are resolved is negligible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">{\u00b6 45} The city suggests that it was compelled by its own rules to discontinue McDonald\u2019s salary after the criminal charges were filed. The record does not support that claim. No rule or regulation of the city or its police department imposed such a requirement. . Indeed, the arbitrator found that other Dayton police officers charged with misdemeanor criminal offenses have been suspended with pay, consistently. The fact that McDonald\u2019s alleged violations arose from performance of his official duties instead of from private conduct may present a difference but not one that permits the city to wholly dispense with the required hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">{\u00b6 46} Finally, McDonald also carries the fourth factor, the lack of objective corroboration of the alleged offense leading to the administrative action. The cause of the suspension was the filing of criminal charges, but the charges were founded on a criminal complaint filed by the city of Dayton, McDonald\u2019s employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>er, not by an independent agency or in the form of an indictment by a grand jury. We find that the city\u2019s filing of misdemeanor charges against McDonald does not amount to the kind of objective determination that was found in <em>FDIC </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>to corroborate the actions taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">{\u00b6 47} The distinction between the misdemeanor charges brought by the city in this case and felony charges in <em>Gilbert </em>and <em>FDIC </em>is significant, not because of the seriousness of the crime charged but because of the procedure used to bring the charges. In <em>Gilbert, </em>the employee was arrested pursuant to a probable cause determination and charged with a felony by the state police. In <em>FDIC, </em>a grand jury indicted the bank president. Here, the charges were brought by the city of Dayton, the same agency that imposed McDonald\u2019s suspension without pay as a result. See R.C. 1901.34(A). While a special prosecutor brought the charges on behalf of the city, it can hardly be said that this action amounts to an independent determination. See <em>Gilbert, </em>520 U.S. at 924, 117 S.Ct. 1807, 138 L.Ed.2d 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">{\u00b6 48} It may be that a predeprivation hearing would have had little effect in avoiding McDonald\u2019s suspension without pay on May 18, 1998. The criminal charges filed against McDonald, though they were brought by the same agency that suspended him, were nevertheless an objective fact the existence of which was beyond dispute. Applying the second prong of <em>Gilbert v. Homar, </em>supra, there was little if any \u201crisk of an erroneous deprivation,\u201d at least to the extent that the deprivation turned on the fact that criminal charges had been filed. However, we believe that view both defines the issue too narrowly and imposes an unduly restrictive value on the hearing that McDonald was denied. He was entitled to that forum to invoke Chief Lowe\u2019s discretion, his sense of fairness and mutual respect, and his willingness to reconsider. <em>Loudermill, </em>supra. None of those considerations is avoided because the factual basis of a deprivation is undisputed. Indeed, the outcome of the subsequent criminal prosecution might indicate that a hearing could have been productive for McDonald. The lack of any precedent to impose that discipline may also have worked in McDonald\u2019s favor had a hearing been held.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">{\u00b6 49} We find, for the reasons stated above, that reasonable minds could find that the city of Dayton violated rights afforded McDonald by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment when it failed to conduct a predeprivation hearing before it discontinued McDonald\u2019s pay during his continuing suspension on May 18, 1998. Subsequent proceedings before the arbitrator that resulted in back pay for this deprivation were not an effective substitute. <em>McDonald v. W. Branch </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 284, 104 S.Ct. 1799, 80 L.Ed.2d 302. Therefore, the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment for the city on McDonald\u2019s civil rights claims for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">{\u00b6 50} The second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cThe court erred in finding that the city\u2019s failure to reinstate plaintiff immediately after the arbitration award, and placing him in the status of leave without pay, was not a violation of plaintiffs procedural due process rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">{\u00b6 52} McDonald argues that the city should have reinstated him on July 15, 1999, the date ordered by the second arbitrator. Instead, the city sought judicial review in the court of common pleas, which upheld the arbitrator\u2019s decision. The city then sought review of the trial court\u2019s decision by this court, and we too upheld the decision. See <em>Dayton, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">{\u00b6 53} R.C. 2711.10 allows for an appeal of an arbitrator\u2019s decision on narrow grounds. The city sought judicial review of the arbitrator\u2019s decision pursuant to R.C. 2711.10(D), which states that the court of common pleas may vacate an arbitration award if \u201cthe arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d Specifically, the city contested the arbitrator\u2019s decision that the level of discipline imposed upon McDonald was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">{\u00b6 54} Due process claims look not to the result that was reached but to the process that was followed, and whether that process denied the claimant some right to which he was entitled. McDonald\u2019s right to reinstatement arising from the arbitrator\u2019s decision was a benefit that was subject to the right afforded the city of Dayton by R.C. 2711.10 to pursue an appeal. The fact that the city\u2019s attack on the arbitrator\u2019s decision was unsuccessful does not demonstrate a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">{\u00b6 55} The third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">{\u00b6 56} Having sustained the second assignment of error, we will overrule the summary judgment of the trial court and remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b654-13\">Fain, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b654-14\">Brogan, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-9\">. We note that in a recent instance the city of Cincinnati continued the salary of an officer who was likewise charged with misdemeanor offenses, but which arose from a far more grave situation in which an arrestee was shot and killed, while those charges were pending.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b654-15\">Brogan, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AJ4\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-16\">{\u00b6 57} I concur in part and dissent in part from the majority opinion. I agree with the city\u2019s position that the February 18, 1998 \u201cshow cause\u201d hearing provided appellant with an adequate suspension hearing. The fact that the city waited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>until criminal charges were filed to suspend appellant without pay did not mean that appellant was not provided an adequate predeprivation hearing. The criminal charges involved the same events that prompted the \u201cshow cause\u201d hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">{\u00b6 58} In <em>Gilbert v. Homar, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that a police officer who was suspended had a significant private interest in the uninterrupted receipt of his paycheck. The court recognized on the other side of the balance that the state has a significant interest in immediately suspending, when felony charges are filed against them, employees who occupy positions of great public trust and high public visibility, such as police officers. Justice Scalia wrote on behalf of the Supreme Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cRespondent contends that this interest in maintaining public confidence could have been accommodated by suspending him <em>with </em>pay until he had a hearing. We think, however, that the government does not have to give an employee charged with a felony a paid leave at taxpayer expense. If his services to the government are no longer useful once the felony charge has been filed, the Constitution does not require the government to bear the added expense of hiring a replacement while still paying him. ESU\u2019s interest in preserving public confidence in its police force is at least as significant as the State\u2019s interest in preserving the integrity of the sport of horse racing, see <em>Barry v. Barchi, supra </em>[443 U.S. 55] at 64 [99 S.Ct. 2642, 61 L.Ed.2d 365 (1979)], an interest we \u2018deemed sufficiently important ... to justify a brief period of suspension prior to affording the suspended trainer a hearing,\u2019 <em>Mallen, </em>486 U.S. at 241 [108 S.Ct. 1780, 100 L.Ed.2d 265].\u201d (Emphasis and ellipsis sic.) 520 U.S. at 932-933, 117 S.Ct. 1807, 138 L.Ed.2d 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">{\u00b6 60} The Supreme Court noted in <em>Gilbert v. Homar </em>that the purpose of any presuspension hearing would be to assure that there are reasonable grounds to support the suspension without pay. The court noted that the reasonable grounds were assured by the arrest of the police officer and the filing of the criminal charges. 520 U.S. at 934, 117 S.Ct. 1807, 138 L.Ed.2d 120. Appellant was provided an adequately prompt post-suspension hearing after the criminal charges were resolved. I would overrule the appellant\u2019s second assignment of error and affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">{\u00b6 61} In all other respects I concur with the majority opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
