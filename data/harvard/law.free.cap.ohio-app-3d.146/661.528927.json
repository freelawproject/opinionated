For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-19\">{\u00b6 2} The facts of this case are not in dispute. On June 2, 1999, Justin Reinbolt was seriously injured while a passenger in a motor vehicle. At the time of the accident, Reinbolt was employed by Northwest Landscape Service, a sole proprietorship owned and operated by Ronald Foor. Reinbolt was occupying a friend\u2019s vehicle and was not acting in the scope of his employment during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>accident. Appellee, Westfield Insurance Company, pursuant to the terms of policy number CWP 8706693, provided commercial insurance coverage to Rein-bolt\u2019s employer, including business auto, uninsured/underinsured motorist, and umbrella coverage. The named insured under the policy is \u201cRonald Foor dba Northwest Landscape Service.\u201d Appellant joined appellee in the underlying action, asserting that Reinbolt is an insured under the policy and is entitled to the policy limits of the uninsured/underinsured coverage to the extent of his damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">{\u00b6 3} Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment on February 15, 2001, asserting that Reinbolt was not an insured under the terms of the policy. Appellant submitted a memorandum in opposition and a cross-motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of coverage. On March 15, 2001, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion and granted appellee\u2019s motion. A nunc pro tunc entry was filed on March 27, 2001, making the previous judgment a final appealable order. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant presents the following single assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cUnder Ohio law, the trial court erred when it denied Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s cross-motion for partial summary judgment and granted Defendant-Appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment finding that Plaintiff-Appellant, Justin Reinbolt, did not qualify as an insured pursuant to the terms of his employer, Northwest Landscape Service\u2019s, policy of insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant argues that pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>infra, Justin Reinbolt is an insured under appellee\u2019s commercial insurance policy. Appellee contends that this case is factually distinguishable and coverage should not be extended to Reinbolt.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">{\u00b6 7} As a threshold matter, we set forth the standard of review. In considering an appeal from a summary judgment, we review the summary judgment independently and without giving deference to the trial court\u2019s determination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Instead, we apply the same standard for summary judgment used by the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">{\u00b6 8} Summary judgment is appropriate when, looking at the evidence as a whole, (1) no genuine issue of material fact remains to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) construing the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, it appears that reasonable minds could only conclude in favor of the moving party.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The initial burden lies with the movant to inform the trial court of the basis for the motion, identifying the portions of the record, including the pleadings and discovery, which demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Once the movant has satisfied this burden, the burden shifts to the nonmovant to set forth specific facts demonstrating that a genuine issue of fact indeed exists for trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">{\u00b6 9} The outcome of the case at bar is dependent upon the interpretation of the terms of the insurance contract. It is well settled that an insurance policy is a contract and that the relationship between the insured and the insurer is purely contractual in nature.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Insurance coverage is determined by reasonably construing the contract \u201cin conformity with the intention of the parties as gathered from the ordinary and commonly understood meaning of the language employed.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cWhere provisions of a contract of insurance are reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation, they will be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, where the intent of the parties to a contract is evident from the clear and unambiguous language used, a court must not read into the contract a meaning not contemplated or placed there by an act of the parties to the contract.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">{\u00b6 10} <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>involved a commercial insurance coverage policy issued to a corporation, Superior Dairy, Inc., by Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiff, Kathryn Scott Pontzer, asserted a right to underinsured motorist coverage under the Liberty Mutual policy after her husband, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>employee of Superior Dairy, died in an automobile accident.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Liberty Mutual policy defined the insured as \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cif you are an individual, any family member.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Liberty Mutual argued that \u201cyou\u201d referred only to the named insured, Superior Dairy, and not to Superior Dairy\u2019s employees including plaintiffs husband.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, based on the fact that the insured was a corporation, the Ohio Supreme Court found the term \u201cyou\u201d to be ambiguous.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court stated that \u201c[i]t would be nonsensical to limit protection solely to the corporate entity, since a corporation, itself, cannot occupy an automobile, suffer bodily injury or death, or operate a motor vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Therefore, confronted with ambiguous insurance policy language, the court \u201cconstrued [the language] most favorably to the insured\u201d and found that the plaintiffs husband was an insured under his employer\u2019s policy.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">{\u00b6 11} Upon concluding that the plaintiffs husband was an \u201cinsured\u201d under the Liberty Mutual policy, the court turned to the question of whether he would still be entitled to coverage despite the fact that he was not acting within the scope of his employment at Superior Dairy when he was killed in the automobile accident.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The court noted that the Liberty Mutual policy did not contain any language that made coverage contingent upon employees acting within the scope of their employment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Quoting a previous decision, the court stated that \u201c \u2018[in] the construction of insurance contracts, \u201c[w]here exceptions, qualifications or exemptions are introduced into an insurance contact, a general presumption arises to the effect that that which is not clearly excluded from the operation of such contract is included in the operation thereof.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Ohio Supreme Court held that in the absence of contract language restricting coverage to employees who were acting within the scope of their employment, no such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>restriction would be read into the policy.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Therefore, the plaintiff was entitled to the underinsured motorist benefits under the Liberty Mutual policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant argues that <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>stands for the proposition that underinsured motorist coverage \u201cis included in the commercial automobile insurance policies issued to <em>any type of employer </em>which defines its insureds as \u2018you\u2019 or \u2018if you are an individual, any family member.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">{\u00b6 13} A scrupulous reading of the <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>decision reveals nothing that mandates automatic coverage where a business insurance policy incorporates the aforementioned definition of \u201cyou.\u201d In fact, the court\u2019s rationale was based upon several interdependent analytical steps. Only in the face of an ambiguity permitting inclusion of the plaintiff as an insured was the court able to reach the coverage terms of the policy. To find that ambiguity, the court specifically compared the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cyou\u201d with Ohio\u2019s definition of corporate entities. Therefore, we must first determine whether Justin Reinbolt is an insured under the subject policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">{\u00b6 14} In this case, appellee\u2019s Commercial Insurance Coverage Policy number CWP 3706693 contains commercial auto, including uninsured/underinsured motorist coverages, and umbrella coverage. Appellant contends that Reinbolt is an insured under both policies and is entitled to the policy limits of the uninsured/underinsured coverage to the extent of his damages. The named insured throughout the policies is \u201cRonald Foor dba Northwest Landscape Service.\u201d \u201cNamed insured\u201d is further defined in the common policy declarations as an \u201cindividual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">{\u00b6 15} Relying in part upon the recent case of <em>Leeann Johnson v. State Farm Ins. Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>an unreported decision from the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County, appellant asserts that naming the insured, \u201cRonald Foor dba Northwest Landscape Service,\u201d when the insured is designated an \u201cindividual,\u201d created an ambiguity as to who is an insured under appellee\u2019s policy. Appellant further contends that Ronald Foor and Northwest Landscape Service should be considered separate insureds. In spite of the fact that <em>Leeann </em>is of no precedential value to this court, the facts of <em>Leeann </em>and the authority cited therein are distinguishable in that partnerships and corporations were the named insured in those underlying policies.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Furthermore, while a partnership analysis is analo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>gous to a corporate analysis, it is not analogous to a proprietorship analysis. Our research discloses no other court having considered the identical issue presented herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">{\u00b6 16} In making the determination of whether the policy language is ambiguous, we must generally give words and phrases their plain, ordinary, natural, or commonly accepted meaning.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Furthermore, it is well settled that insurance contracts incorporate existing law.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>Patterson v. V. &amp; M Auto Body, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio defined a sole proprietorship as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cA sole proprietorship has no legal identity separate from that of the individual who owns it. It may do business under a fictitious name if it chooses, but * * [d]oing business under another name does not create an entity distinct from the person operating the business. The individual who <em>does business as </em>a sole proprietor under one or several names <em>remains one person </em>* * *\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">{\u00b6 19} This definition is straightforward. Unlike a corporation, partnership, or other entities, Ronald Foor and Northwest Landscape Service \u201cremain one person\u201d even though Ronald Foor \u201cdoes business as\u201d Northwest Landscape Service. Northwest Landscape Service is a legal nonentity, merely the name under which Ronald Foor does business, having no separate legal identity from, and being synonymous with, Ronald Foor. Therefore, we proceed to determine whether an ambiguity arises when the term is considered in conjunction with other provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">{\u00b6 20} Appellee\u2019s commercial auto policy defines \u201cwho is insured\u201d for purposes of medical payments coverage under paragraph B:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-10\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c1. You while \u2018occupying\u2019 or, while a pedestrian, when struck by any \u2018auto.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-11\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c2. If you are an individual, any \u2018family member\u2019 while \u2018occupying\u2019 or, while a pedestrian, when struck by an \u2018auto.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>{\u00b6 23} \u201c3. Anyone else \u2018occupying\u2019 a covered \u2018auto\u2019 or a temporary substitute for a covered \u2018auto.\u2019 The covered \u2018auto\u2019 must be out of service because of its breakdown, repair, servicing, loss or destruction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">{\u00b6 24} The commercial umbrella policy defines \u201cwho is an insured\u201d under Section II:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c1. If you are designated in the declarations as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">{\u00b6 26} \u201ca. An individual, you and your spouse are insureds but only in connection with the conduct of the business of which you are the sole owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-8\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cb. A partnership or joint venture, you are an insured. Your members, your partners and their spouses are also insured but only in connection with the conduct of your business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-9\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cc. A limited liability company, you are insured. Your members are also insureds, but only with respect to the conduct of your business. Your managers are insureds, but only with respect to their duties as your managers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-10\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cd. An organization other than a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company, you are insured. Your \u2018executive officers\u2019 and directors are insureds, but only with respect to their duties as your officers or directors. Your stockholders are also insureds, but only with respect to their liability as shareholders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">{\u00b6 30} Inasmuch as Ohio law does not recognize a sole proprietorship as a separate legal entity, but as a single individual, no ambiguity arises when the declaration page is read in conjunction with the provisions contemplating coverage for an individual. The named insured is entirely consistent with the definitions of \u201cwho is an insured\u201d in both the business auto and umbrella coverage provisions. We therefore find that the intent of the parties is evident from the policy\u2019s clear and unambiguous language and will not read into the contract a meaning not contemplated or placed therein by the parties. Justin Reinbolt is clearly excluded from coverage under the insurance contract provisions. As a result of the foregoing, appellant\u2019s assignment of error is not well taken and is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">{\u00b6 31} Having found no error prejudicial to the appellant herein, in the particulars assigned and argued, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b710-14\">Shaw and Hadley, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-12\">. <em>Schuch v.
