Because we conclude that the effect of a pharmacy\u2019s later-occurring negligence is a question of fact, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee, Steven M. Dosick, M.D., is a vascular surgeon. In 1994, appellee performed surgery on Jerry C. Austermiller. Following a brief post-surgical hospitalization, appellee released Austermiller with instructions that he should take daily doses of the prescription drug Coumadin. Coumadin inhibits blood clotting and, improperly administered, can cause uncontrolled internal bleeding. Appellee ordered a followup examination to monitor the effects of the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">{\u00b6 3} It is uncontested that Austermiller failed to attend his followup appointment or again consult with appellee. What is disputed is an allegation that during the next eighteen months, appellee, or someone in appellee\u2019s office, telephoned refill prescriptions for Coumadin to Austermiller\u2019s pharmacy. The last of these refills was for a one-year supply. It was dated March 11, 1996, and was phoned in to a Bowling Green, Ohio pharmacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">{\u00b6 4} On December 20, 1996, Austermiller transferred this prescription to the Napoleon, Ohio branch of the same pharmacy chain. The Napoleon pharmacist erroneously recorded the date of the prescription as the date of the transfer. This resulted in the Napoleon pharmacy continuing to refill the Coumadin prescription beyond the anniversary date upon which the prescription would have ordinarily expired. Austermiller received Coumadin refills on April 22, 1997, and August 14, 1997. On September 19, 1997, Jerry Austermiller died from internal bleeding. On May 20, 1998, the executor of Jerry Austermiller\u2019s estate, appellant John W. Austermiller (\u201cappellant\u201d) brought a medical negligence suit against appellee and the pharmacy that filled Jerry Austermiller\u2019s prescription. Follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>ing a settlement with the pharmacy, the matter proceeded to a jury trial solely against appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">{\u00b6 5} At trial, appellant introduced Jerry Austermiller\u2019s autopsy report, which set the cause of death as \u201cgastrointestinal exsanguination\u201d and listed among significant conditions relating to death as \u201clong-term Coumadin use.\u201d Appellant\u2019s medical expert testified that it was his opinion that Jerry Austermiller died of \u201cuncontrolled bleeding secondary to Coumadin toxicity.\u201d The expert also testified that a physician who continues to prescribe Coumadin without appropriate monitoring \u201cdepart[s] from accepted standards of care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">{\u00b6 6} On cross-examination, appellant\u2019s medical expert was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cQ. Is it still your opinion [that] Coumadin which was taken in the weeks before Jerry Austermiller\u2019s death was the cause of the gastrointestinal bleed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cA. Oh, yes, * * * absolutely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">{\u00b6 9} In his defense, appellee testified that he had not prescribed Coumadin for Jerry Austermiller after he left the hospital in 1994. He also testified that it was against office policy to call in Coumadin prescription renewals absent appropriate monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">{\u00b6 10} At the conclusion of the evidence, appellee moved for a directed verdict, contending that the nonparty pharmacy was guilty of negligence per se when it continued to refill Jerry Austermiller\u2019s Coumadin prescription beyond the one-year period allowed by the Ohio Administrative Code. Since appellant\u2019s own medical expert testified that it was the Coumadin taken \u201cin the weeks before\u201d that caused Austermiller\u2019s death, appellee argued, the pharmacy\u2019s negligence constituted an intervening and superseding cause which absolved appellee of liability. The trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion, directing a verdict against appellant and dismissing the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant now brings this appeal, setting forth the following single assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting a directed verdict to the appellee as it based its holding on questions of fact that are to be determined by the trier of fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-13\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c* * * Civ.R. 50(A)(4) provides, \u2018When a motion for a directed verdict has been properly made, and the trial court, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, finds that upon any determinative issue reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted and that conclusion is adverse to such party, the court shall sustain the motion and direct a verdict for the moving party as to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>issue.\u2019 In <em>Wagner v. Roche Laboratories </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 116, 671 N.E.2d 252, we stated further, \u2018 \u201cWhen a motion for a directed verdict is entered, what is being tested is a question of law, that is, the legal sufficiency of the evidence to take the case to the jury. This does not involve weighing the evidence or trying the credibility of witnesses.\u201d \u2019 Id. at 119, 671 N.E.2d at 255, quoting <em>Ruta v. Breekenridge-Remy Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 66, 68-69, 23 O.O.3d 115, 116-117, 430 N.E.2d 935, 938.\u201d <em>Wagner v. Midwestern Indemn. Co. </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 287, 294, 699 N.E.2d 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">{\u00b6 14} At trial, and here, appellee argues that even if he or his office did continue to prescribe Coumadin without proper observation of its effects, he is legally absolved of liability for this negligence by the per se negligence of the decedent\u2019s pharmacy in refilling the prescription twice after its one-year expiration date. The pharmacy\u2019s negligence was intervening and superseding, according to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">{\u00b6 15} Appellant concedes that the pharmacy was per se negligent, but vociferously denies that this negligence was sufficient to wholly negate appellee\u2019s negligence. Moreover, appellant insists that the question is one of proximate cause and causation is ordinarily a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cWe have recognized that the existence of intervening and superseding causes of injury can be a defense to actions brought under theories of both negligence and strict liability in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u2018We have also repeatedly recognized that the issue of intervening causation generally presents factual issues to be decided by the trier of fact. <em>Cascone v. Herb Kay Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 155, 160, 6 OBR 209, 214, 451 N.E.2d 815, 820[.] The determination of intervening causation \u2018involves a weighing of the evidence, and an application of the appropriate law to such facts, a function normally to be carried out by the trier of the facts.\u2019 <em>Cascone, supra, </em>6 Ohio St.3d at 160, 6 OBR at 214, 451 N.E.2d at 820. In <em>Cascone </em>we established the test to be used to determine whether the intervening act was foreseeable and therefore a consequence of the original negligent act or whether the intervening act operates to absolve the original actor. \u2018The test * * * is whether the original and successive acts may be joined together as a whole, linking each of the actors as to the liability, or whether there is a new and independent act or cause which intervenes and thereby absolves the original negligent actor.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 160, 6 OBR at 214, 451 N.E.2d at 819[.]\u201d <em>Leibreich v. A.J. Refrigeration, Inc. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 266, 269, 617 N.E.2d 1068 (some citations omitted). See, also, Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts (5th Ed.1984), 301 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">{\u00b6 18} Appellee premised his motion for a directed verdict on the pharmacy\u2019s per se negligence and the \u201cadmission\u201d of appellant\u2019s expert witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>that death was caused by Coumadin taken in \u201cthe weeks before\u201d Jerry Austermiller\u2019s death. Whether negligence is \u201cper se\u201d is of no legal significance. The issue is whether the pharmacy\u2019s negligence is \u201cnew and independent\u201d of appellee\u2019s alleged negligence. Pursuant to <em>Leibreich </em>and <em>Cascone, </em>this is a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">{\u00b6 19} With respect to the expert\u2019s \u201cadmission,\u201d nowhere in his cross-examination was the term \u201cweeks before\u201d defined. Whether this \u201cadmission\u201d involved two weeks or fifty-two weeks would make a substantial difference in interpreting the expert\u2019s statement. Moreover, even had the expert laid blame on Coumadin taken recently, a question exists as to whether this would be testimony contradictory to the autopsy reference to death related to \u201clong-term Coumadin use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">{\u00b6 20} On whole, these are questions which must be resolved by the trier of fact; therefore, granting a directed verdict here was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">{\u00b6 21} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">{\u00b6 22} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is reversed. This matter is remanded to said court for proceedings consistent with this decision. Costs to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b774-10\">Mark L. Pietrykowski, P.J., and Melvin L. Resnick, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
