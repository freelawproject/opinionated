Friemoth, Administrator of the estate of Robert W. Friemoth, appeals the October 2, 2000 judgment of the Allen County Court of Common Pleas granting summary judgment on her claim for declaratory relief to appellee Travelers Indemnity Insurance Company of Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">{\u00b6 2} On September 2, 1998, appellant filed a complaint in the Allen County Court of Common Pleas, alleging that her husband Robert W. Friemoth had been killed in the course and scope of his employment for Fruehauf Trailer Corporation (\u201cFruehauf\u2019). Appellant\u2019s complaint alleged that Mr. Friemoth had been killed by the continued use of an automated overhead assembly line that Fruehauf knew was substantially certain to cause harm to its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">{\u00b6 3} On August 8, 1996, Fruehauf had received a revised \u201cbinder of insurance\u201d from appellee. The binder provided Fruehauf with temporary insurance coverage for automobile, general commercial liability, and worker\u2019s compensation claims until appellee\u2019s insurance policy was prepared and delivered to Fruehauf. The binder did not contain language describing its specific coverages or exclusions, but did contain the following clauses:</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cThis Company binds the kind(s) of insurance stipulated on the first page of this form. The Insurance is subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of the policy(ies) in current use by the Company. * * * This binder may be cancelled by the Company by notice to the insured in accordance with the policy conditions. This binder is cancelled when replaced by a policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">{\u00b6 5} On September 4, 1996, prior to the delivery of insurance policy to Fruehauf, Mr. Friemoth was killed at Fruehauf s Delphos plant. On September 11, 1996, appellee issued a commercial general liability policy including several endorsements to Fruehauf. The main policy contains the following exclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cCOMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE FORM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-11\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-12\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cSECTION I \u2014 COVERAGES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-13\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cCOVERAGE A.

The exclusions in paragraph 2 of SECTION I-COVERAGE A. are replaced by the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-15\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThis insurance does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-16\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-17\">{\u00b6 28} \u201ce. \u2018Bodily injury\u2019 intentionally caused or aggravated by you, or \u2018bodily injury\u2019 resulting from an act which is determined to have been committed by you with the belief that an injury is substantially certain to occur}.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-18\">{\u00b6 29} On August 3, 1999, after receiving notice that Fruehauf had gone into bankruptcy, appellant amended her complaint to implead the appellee and sought a declaration that based on its insurance policy with Fruehauf, appellee was contractually obligated to defend and indemnify Fruehauf on her claim. On September 16, 1999, appellee filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the coverage it extended to Fruehauf excluded liability for bodily harm to employees that was substantially certain to occur. On October 2, 2000, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the appellee, and on October 27, 2000, the trial court journalized a nunc pro tunc entry adding Civ.R. 54(B) language to its summary judgment order. This appeal followed, and appellant asserts a single assignment of error with the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>{\u00b6 30} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law when it granted the summary-judgment motion of defendant appellant Travelers Indemnity Company of Illinois.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">{\u00b6 31} Appellate courts review summary judgment determinations de novo and do not grant deference to the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>Schuch v. Rogers </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 718, 720, 681 N.E.2d 1388. Accordingly, we apply the same standard for summary judgment as the trial court. <em>Midwest Specialties, Inc. v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1988), 42 Ohio App.3d 6, 8, 536 N.E.2d 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c[Summary judgment is proper] when, looking at the evidence as a whole, (1) no genuine issue of material fact remains to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence, construed most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that reasonable minds could only conclude in favor of the moving party.\u201d <em>Horton v. Harwich Chem. Corp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 679, 686-687, 653 N.E.2d 1196, citing Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">{\u00b6 33} Furthermore, in <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264, the Ohio Supreme Court held that parties seeking summary judgment must \u201cspecifically point to some evidence of the type listed in Civ.R. 56(C) which affirmatively demonstrates that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support the nonmoving party\u2019s claims.\u201d If the moving party satisfies that burden, the party opposing summary judgment must \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial,\u201d and summary judgment is proper if the party opposing judgment fails to set forth such facts. Id., citing Civ.R. 56(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">{\u00b6 34} It is apparently undisputed that the previously quoted endorsement, which was contained in the policy issued by appellant on September 11, 1996, effectively eliminated coverage for bodily injury \u201csubstantially certain\u201d to occur. Cf. <em>Maffett v. Moyer\u2019s Auto Wrecking, Inc. </em>(June 7, 2000), Crawford App. Nos. 3-99-11 and 3-99-12, 2000 WL 743707, at ** 3-4. In her assignment of error, appellant advances two arguments to persuade us that the insurance binder issued to Fruehauf on August 8, 1996 provided independent coverage for injury \u201csubstantially certain\u201d to occur, even though the actual insurance policy issued to replace that binder did not provide such coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">{\u00b6 35} At the outset, appellant correctly asserts that the binder constituted a temporary contract of insurance effective at the time appellant\u2019s decedent was killed. Cf. e.g., <em>Clements v. Ohio State Life Ins. Co. </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 80, 85, 514 N.E.2d 876, cited in <em>Hastings Mut. Ins. v. Warnimont </em>(Feb. 15, 2001), Hancock App. No. 5-2000-22, 2001 WL 163523, at *5. \u201cA contract for temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>insurance is construed as being <em>subject to the terms of the policy to be issued or of the policy ordinarily used </em>by the company.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 44 Corpus Juris Secundum (1993) 496, Insurance, Section 267(a). Noting the general maxim that \u201c \u2018[wjhere provisions of a contract of insurance are reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation, they will be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured,'\u201d see <em>Csulik v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 17, 20, 723 N.E.2d 90, quoting <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, syllabus, appellant argues that that the binder was ambiguous regarding the extent of coverage in two distinct ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">{\u00b6 36} First, appellant contends that the phrase \u201csubject to the terms, conditions and limitations of the <em>policy(ies) in current use </em>by the Company\u201d is ambiguous. (Emphasis added.) Appellant argues that there is no standard policy to which the phrase can refer, because \u201c}a]ppellee Travelers issues numerous policies of varying nature, many of which are general policies \u2018customized by account}.]\u2019 \u201d Appellee, on the other hand, argues that the provision was clearly intended to integrate the terms of the policy that was ultimately issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">{\u00b6 37} Under <em>Dresher, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 293, 662 N.E.2d 264, it is the appellant\u2019s reciprocal burden to establish that appellee\u2019s \u201cpolicy(ies) in current use\u201d provide coverage for injury substantially certain to occur. However, the only written policy placed into evidence in this case is the Fruehauf policy itself, which specifically excludes liability for harm \u201csubstantially certain\u201d to occur, and appellant has not attempted to show what terms of coverage are contained in other \u201cpolicy(ies) in current use\u201d by appellee. Instead, appellant notes that the language excluding liability for harm that is \u201csubstantially certain\u201d appears in a portion of the policy labeled \u201cendorsement\u201d rather than in the portion labeled \u201cbodily injury and property damage liability,\u201d and argues that this fact alone proves that appellee must have a \u201cpolicy} ] in current use\u201d that does not exclude coverage for harm that is \u201csubstantially certain\u201d to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">{\u00b6 38} Appellant is undoubtedly correct in asserting that both the policy and the endorsement are \u201cin current use\u201d; however, appellant has failed to provide any evidence tending to show that the policy was \u201cin current use\u201d <em>without </em>the endorsement. Similarly, appellant has not provided this court with authority indicating that merely labeling a provision an \u201cendorsement\u201d creates an ambiguity as to the extent of coverage that must be resolved in favor of a claimant, and our own research has failed to uncover any case adopting this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">{\u00b6 39} Moreover, appellant has failed to offer <em>any </em>evidence that the parties to the insurance contract intended bodily injury \u201csubstantially certain\u201d to occur to be covered under the policy. \u201c \u2018[A]ll ordinary provisions and exclusions of policies issued to cover similar risks will be read into the temporary binder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number><em>unless there was an express agreement at the time of the issuance of the binder which would make such provisions and exclusions inconsistent with the intent of the binder </em>agreement.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>N. Am. Specialty Ins. Co. v. Myers </em>(C.A.6, 1997), 111 F.3d 1273, 1278, quoting <em>Harmon v. Am. Interinsurance Exchange Co. </em>(1972) 39 Mich.App. 145, 197 N.W.2d 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">{\u00b6 40} Where there is no fraud alleged or implied and where the only written insurance policy in evidence clearly excludes coverage for the harm alleged, as in this case, we believe that the only reasonable construction of the language is the one advanced by appellee \u2014 the language was intended to provide coverage in accordance with and was intended to incorporate the terms of the policy ultimately issued. \u201cThe relation of the preliminary and final contracts seems rather clearly established and it is not improper to construe them together.\u201d <em>Schaible v. Louisville Title Ins. Co. </em>(1963), 118 Ohio App. 328, 334, 25 O.O.2d 190, 194 N.E.2d 588. See, also, <em>Jaber v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 507, 512, 681 N.E.2d 478, quoting <em>Wilson v. GRE Ins. Co. </em>(Sept. 16, 1994), Lucas App. No. L-93-361, 1994 WL 506154, at * 2 (holding that \u201ca binder incorporates \u2018the terms, conditions and limitations of the policy(ies)\u2019 used by the insurer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">{\u00b6 41} In her second argument, appellant observes that the \u201cschedule of insurance\u201d attached to the binder lists \u201cStop Gap Employers Liability coverage,\u201d and argues that the failure of the binder to define this term creates an ambiguity that must be resolved in her favor. In support of this argument appellant offers the affidavit of Corey Hupp, an insurance agent. Hupp averred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cThe purpose of the inclusion of \u2018Stop Gap Employers Liability\u2019 coverage in such a policy is to provide coverage for the insurance coverage gap that exists in the State of Ohio between those losses covered by general liability coverage and those losses covered by Workers\u2019 Compensation, including employment intentional tort claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">{\u00b6 43} Based on Hupp\u2019s affidavit, appellant argues that the parties intended for the binder to provide coverage for injuries \u201csubstantially certain\u201d to occur. However, it is undisputed that the policy ultimately issued <em>did not </em>contain \u201cStop Gap\u201d coverage as described by Mr. Hupp and expressly excluded coverage for injury substantially certain to occur. Moreover, the \u201cschedule of insurance,\u201d which is the only insurance document in the record that contains a reference to \u201cStop Gap\u201d coverage, also contains the following paragraph, printed in bold type:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\"> {\u00b6 44} \u201cThis schedule of insurance is for information purposes only. It does not alter, amend, or change your coverage. Please refer to specific policies for limits, terms, conditions and exclusions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>{\u00b6 45} It is \u201conly where a contract of insurance is ambiguous and <em>therefore susceptible to more than one meaning </em>[that] the policy language [must] be liberally construed in favor of the claimant who seeks coverage.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Burris v. Grange Mut. Cos. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 84, 89, 545 N.E.2d 83, overruled on other grounds by <em>Savoie v. Grange Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 500, 504, 620 N.E.2d 809. \u201c[w]here the plain and ordinary meaning of the language used in an insurance policy is clear and unambiguous, a court cannot resort to construction of that language.\u201d <em>Holliman v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 414, 418, 715 N.E.2d 532, citing <em>Tomlinson v. Skolnik </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 11, 12, 540 N.E.2d 716. We cannot say that the foregoing provision is ambiguous in any way. Therefore, appellant\u2019s argument that the binder alone extends \u201cStop Gap\u201d insurance must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">{\u00b6 46} For these reasons, the appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled, and the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Allen County is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b568-7\">Walters, P.J., and Hadley, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
