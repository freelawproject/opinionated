Gould &amp; Ratner was sued by David Carmell for defamation and breach of fiduciary duty (the underlying suit). Gould &amp; Ratner notified Vigilant of the suit. Vigilant said it had no duty to defend or indemnify Gould &amp; Ratner in the underlying suit because Carmell\u2019s claims were excluded from coverage. Gould &amp; Ratner defended itself and eventually settled the underlying suit.</p> <p id=\"b420-10\" pgmap=\"420\">Gould &amp; Ratner then sued Vigilant for breach of the insurance contract. Vigilant filed a countercomplaint for a declaratory judgment. Vigilant also filed an answer and affirmative defenses. On Vigilant\u2019s motion, the trial court granted summary judgment in Vigilant\u2019s favor on both Gould &amp; Ratner\u2019s suit and Vigilant\u2019s countersuit.</p> <p id=\"b420-11\" pgmap=\"420\">Gould &amp; Ratner appeals, contending: (1) Vigilant breached its duty to defend by neither defending Gould &amp; Ratner under a reservation of rights nor filing a timely declaratory judgment action; and (2) Vigilant\u2019s countercomplaint was untimely as a matter of law and an improper basis for summary judgment. We affirm.</p> <p id=\"b420-12\" pgmap=\"420\">FACTS</p> <p id=\"b420-13\" pgmap=\"420\">The Insurance Policy</p> <p id=\"b420-14\" pgmap=\"420(33) 421(13)\">Gould &amp; Ratner purchased a commercial insurance policy from Vigilant for the term July 15, 1996, to July 15, 1997. The policy included coverage for \u201cpersonal injury *** if caused by an offense committed during the policy period.\u201d \u201cPersonal injury\u201d was defined in the policy as</p> <blockquote id=\"b421-3\" pgmap=\"421\">\u201cinjury, other than bodily injury, arising out of one or more of the following offenses committed in the course of your business, other than your advertising activities: ^ ^</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b421-6\" pgmap=\"421\">4. oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person\u2019s or organization\u2019s goods, products or services ***.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b421-7\" pgmap=\"421\">The insurance policy contained a \u201cProfessional Exclusion.\u201d This exclusion provided:</p> <blockquote id=\"b421-8\" pgmap=\"421\">\u201cWith respect to bodily injury, property damage, personal injury or advertising injury or any obligations assumed by contract:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b421-9\" pgmap=\"421\">This insurance does not apply to any claim or suit against the Insured for:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b421-10\" pgmap=\"421\">a. rendering or failing to render written or oral professional legal services or advice; or</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b421-11\" pgmap=\"421\">b. rendering or failing to render any other written or oral services or advice that are not ordinary to the practice of law; whether or not the Insured is acting in the capacity of a lawyer.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b421-12\" pgmap=\"421\">The insurance policy also contained an exclusion for:</p> <blockquote id=\"b421-13\" pgmap=\"421\">\u201cPersonal injury or advertising injury:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b421-14\" pgmap=\"421\">1. arising out of oral or written publication of material, if done by or at the direction of the insured with knowledge of its falsity ***.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b421-15\" pgmap=\"421\">The Underlying Suit</p> <p id=\"b421-16\" pgmap=\"421\">On February 13, 1997, Carmell filed a six-count complaint against Gould &amp; Ratner and Jonathan Backman, a partner at Gould &amp; Ratner, for defamation and breach of fiduciary duty.</p> <p id=\"b421-17\" pgmap=\"421\">According to the complaint, Carmell was a client of Gould &amp; Ratner. In 1996, Apex Automotive Warehouse, L.P (Apex), filed bankruptcy. During the bankruptcy proceedings, Gould &amp; Ratner also represented Apex.</p> <p id=\"b421-18\" pgmap=\"421\">In the complaint, Carmell alleged that on August 14, 1996, Back-man faxed to several people a letter containing unfavorable statements about Carmell. Carmell alleged the statements were untrue. On August 27, 1996, Backman called Carmell as an adverse witness in the Apex bankruptcy proceedings and cross-examined Carmell utilizing information that was protected by the attorney-client privilege. On November 5, 1996, Backman faxed to various people another letter containing unfavorable statements about Carmell. Carmell alleged those statements were not true.</p> <p id=\"b422-2\" pgmap=\"422\">Gould &amp; Ratner promptly tendered the complaint to Vigilant requesting confirmation of coverage. On March 18, 1997, Vigilant refused to defend or indemnify Gould &amp; Ratner. Vigilant said the insurance policy did not cover the breach of fiduciary claims. The defamation claims, Vigilant said, fell within the scope of both the professional exclusion and the intentional falsehood exclusion.</p> <p id=\"b422-3\" pgmap=\"422\">Gould &amp; Ratner subsequently settled the suit with Carmell; the Carmell suit was dismissed with prejudice on July 27, 2000.</p> <p id=\"b422-4\" pgmap=\"422\">On January 8, 2001, Gould &amp; Ratner filed suit against Vigilant for breach of contract. On February 26, 2001, Vigilant filed a countercomplaint for declaratory judgment seeking a declaration of noncoverage and no duty to defend.</p> <p id=\"b422-5\" pgmap=\"422\">Gould &amp; Ratner filed a motion to dismiss. Gould &amp; Ratner contended Vigilant\u2019s countercomplaint was untimely as a matter of law, citing Employers Insurance of Wausau v. Ehlco Liquidating Trust, 186 Ill. 2d 127, 708 N.E.2d 1122 (1999), and Clemmons v. Travelers Insurance Co., 88 Ill. 2d 469, 430 N.E.2d 1104 (1981), in support of its contention.</p> <p id=\"b422-6\" pgmap=\"422\">On August 10, 2001, the court granted Gould &amp; Ratner\u2019s motion to dismiss Vigilant\u2019s countercomplaint, holding the countercomplaint was \u201cuntimely as a matter of law.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b422-7\" pgmap=\"422\">On September 7, 2001, Vigilant filed an answer and affirmative defenses. In its affirmative defenses, Vigilant said Carmell\u2019s suit was not covered under the policy because it fell within the scope of both the professional exclusion and the intentional falsehood exclusion.</p> <p id=\"b422-8\" pgmap=\"422\">Gould &amp; Ratner unsuccessfully moved to strike and dismiss Vigilant\u2019s affirmative defenses. Gould &amp; Ratner contended Vigilant was estopped from raising these affirmative defenses because it refused to either defend under a reservation of rights or timely file a suit for declaratory judgment.</p> <p id=\"b422-9\" pgmap=\"422\">On October 24, 2001, Vigilant filed a motion to reconsider the court\u2019s August 10 order dismissing its countercomplaint.</p> <p id=\"b422-10\" pgmap=\"422\">On December 19, 2001, the court, relying on Pekin Insurance Co. v. L.J. Shaw &amp; Co., 291 Ill. App. 3d 888, 684 N.E.2d 853 (1997), said, \u201c[T]he allegations of the Carmell complaint fit squarely and unambiguously within [the professional exclusion] and as a result Vigilant had no duty to defend.\u201d Based on this finding, the court granted Vigilant\u2019s motion to reconsider, vacated its August 10, 2001, order dismissing Vigilant\u2019s countercomplaint, and denied Gould &amp; Ratner\u2019s motion to dismiss the countercomplaint.</p> <p id=\"b422-11\" pgmap=\"422(35) 423(18)\">On February 7, .2002, Vigilant filed a motion for summary judgment, relying primarily on Pekin Insurance Co. and the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion to reconsider. On April 9, 2002, the trial court granted Vigilant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on both Gould &amp; Ratner\u2019s suit and Vigilant\u2019s countersuit. This appeal followed.</p> <p id=\"b423-3\" pgmap=\"423\">DECISION</p> <p id=\"b423-4\" pgmap=\"423\">The Professional Services Exclusion</p> <p id=\"b423-5\" pgmap=\"423\">Gould &amp; Ratner contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Vigilant. Gould &amp; Ratner says Vigilant breached its duty to defend Gould &amp; Ratner because the underlying claim potentially fell within the coverage of the insurance policy. In addition, says Gould &amp; Ratner, since Vigilant failed to either defend under a reservation of rights or file a timely declaratory judgment action, Vigilant is estopped from asserting policy defenses.</p> <p id=\"b423-6\" pgmap=\"423\">Vigilant says the doctrine of estoppel does not apply here because Vigilant had no duty to defend. According to Vigilant, the policy clearly provided no coverage or potential for coverage for the claims raised in the underlying suit. For this reason, Vigilant says, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in its favor.</p> <p id=\"b423-7\" pgmap=\"423\"> Summary judgment is proper where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Outboard Marine Corp. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 154 Ill. 2d 90, 102, 607 N.E.2d 1204 (1992). The interpretation of insurance policy provisions is a question of law suitable for summary judgment. Lexmark International, Inc. v. Transportation Insurance Co., 327 Ill. App. 3d 128, 134-35, 761 N.E.2d 1214 (2001). We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo. Outboard Marine Corp., 154 Ill. 2d at 102.</p> <p id=\"b423-8\" pgmap=\"423\"> If an underlying complaint alleges facts within or potentially within coverage and the policy includes a duty to defend, the insurer is obliged to defend the insured. Ehlco Liquidating Trust, 186 Ill. 2d at 153. But an insurer has no duty to defend where it is \u201c \u2018clear from the face of the underlying complaint[ ] that the allegations fail to state facts which bring the case within, or potentially within, the policy\u2019s coverage. (Emphasis in original.)\u201d Ehlco Liquidating Trust, 186 Ill. 2d at 153, quoting United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Wilkin Insulation Co., 144 Ill. 2d 64, 73, 578 N.E.2d 926 (1991).</p> <p id=\"b423-9\" pgmap=\"423\"> The doctrine of estoppel provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b423-10\" pgmap=\"423(81) 424(18)\">\u201c[A]n insurer which takes the position that a complaint potentially alleging coverage is not covered under a policy that includes a duty to defend may not simply refuse to defend the insured. Rather, the insurer has two options: (1) defend the suit under a reservation of rights or (2) seek a declaratory judgment that there is no coverage. If the insurer fails to take either of these steps and is later found to have wrongfully denied coverage, the insurer is estopped from raising policy defenses to coverage. [Citations.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) Ehlco Liquidating Trust, 186 Ill. 2d at 150-51.</blockquote> <p id=\"Aqc\" pgmap=\"424\">This doctrine does not apply if the insurer has no duty to defend. Ehlco Liquidating Trust, 186 Ill. 2d at 151.</p> <p id=\"b424-3\" pgmap=\"424\"> To determine whether the underlying complaint alleges facts that potentially fall within the policy\u2019s coverage, we must \u201cascertain and give effect to the intentions of the parties as expressed in [the policy].\u201d American States Insurance Co. v. Koloms, 177 Ill. 2d 473, 479, 687 N.E.2d 72 (1997). If the policy terms are clear and unambiguous, \u201cthey must be given their plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d Koloms, 177 Ill. 2d at 479. But if they are subject to more than one meaning, they will be construed against the insurer. Koloms, 177 Ill. 2d at 479. Provisions that limit or exclude coverage also are to be construed against the insurer. Koloms, 177 Ill. 2d at 478. However, we will not search for nonexistent ambiguities. Pekin Insurance Co., 291 Ill. App. 3d at 892.</p> <p id=\"b424-4\" pgmap=\"424\">In Pekin Insurance Co. v. L.J. Shaw &amp; Co., we were faced with a case similar to this one. Pekin Insurance Company provided L.J. Shaw &amp; Company with a business owners policy that also covered its employee, William Hall. Pekin Insurance Co., 291 Ill. App. 3d at 889. The insurance policy provided coverage for personal injury. The policy defined \u201cpersonal injury\u201d as:</p> <blockquote id=\"b424-5\" pgmap=\"424\">\u201c \u2018injury *** arising out of one or more of the following offenses: * * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b424-7\" pgmap=\"424\">d. Oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person\u2019s or organization\u2019s goods, products or services[.]\u2019 \u201d Pekin Insurance Co., 291 Ill. App. 3d at 890-91.</blockquote> <p id=\"b424-8\" pgmap=\"424\">The policy also contained a professional services exclusion, which excluded:</p> <blockquote id=\"b424-9\" pgmap=\"424\">\u201c \u2018j. \u201cBodily injury\u201d, \u201cproperty damage\u201d, \u201cpersonal injury\u201d or \u201cadvertising injury\u201d due to rendering or failure to render any professional service.\u2019 \u201d Pekin Insurance Co., 291 Ill. App. 3d at 890.</blockquote> <p id=\"b424-10\" pgmap=\"424\">Litho Productions, Inc., suffered a loss. Shaw and Hall represented Litho\u2019s insurers in the initial discussions with Litho over the claim. Litho was represented by Joseph P Caufield &amp; Associates, Inc., to negotiate the claim. Pekin Insurance Co., 291 Ill. App. 3d at 889.</p> <p id=\"b424-11\" pgmap=\"424\">Caufield later sued Shaw and Hall for, among other things, intentional interference with contract and civil conspiracy for falsely representing that Caufield overstated the damages. Pekin Insurance Co., 291 Ill. App. 3d at 890. The underlying complaint alleged that the torts occurred during Shaw\u2019s and Hall\u2019s negotiations over Litho\u2019s claim. Pekin Insurance Co., 291 Ill. App. 3d at 890.</p> <p id=\"b425-2\" pgmap=\"425\">Shaw and Hall tendered the complaint to Pekin Insurance Company. Pekin refused coverage and filed an action seeking a declaration it had no duty to defend or indemnify Shaw and Hall. Pekin contended the allegations in the underlying complaint fell within the insurance policy\u2019s professional services exclusion. Shaw and Hall contended the underlying claims were covered because the policy covered personal injury and the claims fell within the definition of personal injury. Pekin Insurance Co., 291 Ill. App. 3d at 890.</p> <p id=\"b425-3\" pgmap=\"425\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Shaw and Hall, holding Pekin had a duty to defend because the professional services exclusion created an ambiguity. Pekin Insurance Co., 291 Ill. App. 3d at 891. The trial court said the exclusion did not apply to the underlying complaint and was not intended to apply to third parties other than Shaw\u2019s and Hall\u2019s clients. Pekin Insurance Co., 291 Ill. App. 3d at 891. We reversed and entered judgment in favor of Pekin.</p> <p id=\"b425-4\" pgmap=\"425\">We found the underlying complaint alleged Shaw and Hall were retained to render professional services, and during the course of rendering those services, Shaw and Hall caused Caufield to suffer damages. Pekin Insurance Co., 291 Ill. App. 3d at 896. We also concluded \u201cthe applicability of a professional services exclusion is not limited to actions brought by the client of the insured.\u201d Pekin Insurance Co., 291 Ill. App. 3d at 896. Whether the underlying plaintiff is the client of the insured does not matter. He may allege injuries falling within the terms of the exclusion. We concluded the clear and unambiguous language of the policy relieved Pekin of any duty to defend Shaw and Hall. Pekin Insurance Co., 291 Ill. App. 3d at 897.</p> <p id=\"b425-5\" pgmap=\"425\">In Pekin Insurance Co., we relied on the analysis and holdings in Hurst-Rosche Engineers, Inc. v. Commercial Union Insurance Co., 51 F.3d 1336 (7th Cir. 1995), and Erie Insurance Group v. Alliance Environmental, Inc., 921 F. Supp. 537 (S.D. Ind. 1996).</p> <p id=\"b425-6\" pgmap=\"425\">In Hurst-Rosche Engineers, the insured, an engineering firm, was sued for libel and tortious interference with contract based on the contents of a letter the firm issued to a party that was not its client concerning a performance bond. The insured sought coverage under the definition of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d in its general liability policy. HurstRosche Engineers, 51 F.3d at 1340. The insurer denied coverage based on the professional services exclusion, which excluded injuries \u201c \u2018arising out of the rendering or failure to render any professional services.\u2019 \u201d Hurst-Rosche Engineers, 51 F.3d at 1340.</p> <p id=\"b425-7\" pgmap=\"425(28) 426(20)\">Applying Illinois law, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals concluded the underlying claims arose from the insured\u2019s rendering of professional services. Hurst-Rosche Engineers, 51 F.3d at 1343. The court also found the underlying claims fell \u201csquarely within the professional services exclusion.\u201d Hurst-Rosche Engineers, 51 F.3d at 1344.</p> <p id=\"b426-3\" pgmap=\"426\">In Erie Insurance Group, a school contracted Sear Corporation to remove asbestos from the building. The school also hired the insureds to investigate the source of the asbestos. The insureds reported Sear failed to remove all the asbestos and was negligent in failing to do so. Sear sued the insureds for tortious interference with a contractual relationship, defamation, and civil rights violations. The insureds submitted the claim to the insurer, and the insurer denied coverage and filed suit. Erie Insurance Group, 921 F. Supp. at 540.</p> <p id=\"b426-4\" pgmap=\"426\">The issue before the District Court for the Southern District of Indiana was whether the policy exclusion for damages \u201c \u2018due to *** any service of a professional nature\u2019 \u201d applied to the underlying suit. Erie Insurance Group, 921 F. Supp. at 541. The court rejected the insureds\u2019 contention that the exclusion was limited to claims brought by the recipient of the insureds\u2019 professional services. Erie Insurance Group, 921 F. Supp. at 542. The court said the exclusion did \u201cnot require privity between the insured and the claimant.\u201d Erie Insurance Group, 921 F. Supp. at 542.</p> <p id=\"b426-5\" pgmap=\"426\">The proper inquiry was \u201cwhether the claimant is seeking to impose liability for acts which were taken in the course of providing professional services and which drew upon (or at least should have drawn upon) the professional\u2019s training, skill, experience, or knowledge.\u201d Erie Insurance Group, 921 F. Supp. at 543. Employing this standard, the court concluded the professional services exclusion applied to the underlying suit. Erie Insurance Group, 921 F. Supp. at 547.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b426-6\" pgmap=\"426(117) 427(17)\">Gould &amp; Ratner contends Pekin Insurance Co. does not apply here because the language of the exclusion in this case differs from the policy language in Pekin Insurance Co. By employing \u201cdue to\u201d in its professional services exclusion, Pekin Insurance Company intended its exclusion to encompass not only actions for \u201c(1) rendering or (2) failing to render\u201d professional services, but also actions \u201cancillary to such actions.\u201d Here, the exclusion precludes coverage for \u201cclaims *** for rendering or failing to render written or oral professional legal services or advice.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Gould &amp; Ratner says Carmell\u2019s complaint did not allege claims for rendering or failing to render professional services. Rather, the complaint alleges claims \u201cas a result of written statements made by Backman in the course of representing a third party, Apex.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p> <p id=\"b427-3\" pgmap=\"427\">Gould &amp; Ratner is arguing about a distinction without a difference. The American Heritage College Dictionary (3d ed. 2000) defines both \u201cfor\u201d and \u201cdue to\u201d as \u201cbecause of.\u201d American Heritage College Dictionary 424, 531 (3d ed. 2000). Although the dictionary provides many other definitions for the word \u201cfor,\u201d none of the ones that may be applicable in this instance support Gould &amp; Ratner\u2019s narrow interpretation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b427-4\" pgmap=\"427\">Gould &amp; Ratner provides no support for its attempt to distinguish the language in Pekin Insurance Co., Hurst-Rosche Engineers, and Erie Insurance Group from the language employed here. We were unable to find a case that analyzed the scope of a professional services exclusion that used the word \u201cfor.\u201d Given the lack of support for Gould &amp; Ratner\u2019s theory, as well as the dictionary definitions of the terms at issue here, we conclude that, in this instance, \u201cfor\u201d should be accorded the same meaning as \u201cdue to.\u201d Dictionary or not, we do not see any difference.</p> <p id=\"b427-5\" pgmap=\"427\">Gould &amp; Ratner contends Vigilant\u2019s subsequent change of the language in the exclusion is evidence that \u201cfor\u201d as used in the policy exclusion is narrower than \u201cdue to\u201d and \u201carising out of.\u201d (After Pekin Insurance Co. was issued, Vigilant changed the language of its exclusion to exclude claims \u201carising out of, or in any way related to: professional legal services or advice.\u201d)</p> <p id=\"b427-6\" pgmap=\"427(31) 428(22)\">Gould &amp; Ratner\u2019s contention has no bearing on this case. Whether Vigilant changed its professional exclusion after Pekin Insurance Co. was decided does not affect our interpretation of the policy language currently before us. The change could have been made for many reasons, none of which has any particular bearing on this dispute.</p> <p id=\"b428-3\" pgmap=\"428\"> Because the professional services exclusion in this case is essentially the same as that in Pekin Insurance Co., the holding in Pekin Insurance Co. governs here.</p> <p id=\"b428-4\" pgmap=\"428\">In Carmell\u2019s complaint, he alleged Backman and Gould &amp; Ratner represented Apex. The alleged defamatory statements were contained in two letters that were attached to the complaint. The letters, printed on firm letterhead, show that Backman was responding to a request for documents and information from another attorney representing Carmell. Carmell\u2019s breach of fiduciary claims arose from Backman\u2019s cross-examination of Carmell during judicial proceedings.</p> <p id=\"b428-5\" pgmap=\"428\">Carmell\u2019s complaint alleges Backman committed the acts of defamation and breach of fiduciary duty while rendering professional services. It has been suggested the exclusion applies only to situations where a client is suing his or her lawyer for malpractice or some other misconduct. But we believe the exclusion is broader than that. The final words of the professional exclusion are: \u201cwhether or not the Insured is acting in the capacity of a lawyer.\u201d That phrase takes the exclusion beyond lawyer-client relationships and to the facts of this case. Backman was not acting as Carmell\u2019s lawyer when the alleged defamatory statements were made. The exclusion clearly embraces Backman\u2019s conduct.</p> <p id=\"b428-6\" pgmap=\"428\">Because there was no coverage for the underlying claims, we conclude Vigilant had no duty to defend Gould &amp; Ratner.</p> <p id=\"b428-7\" pgmap=\"428\">Timeliness of Declaratory Judgment Action</p> <p id=\"b428-8\" pgmap=\"428\"> Gould &amp; Ratner contends Vigilant\u2019s action for declaratory judgment is untimely as a matter of law because Vigilant did not file this action until seven months after the underlying suit was settled and dismissed with prejudice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Gould &amp; Ratner relies on the following passage from Ehlco Liquidating Trust:</p> <blockquote id=\"b428-9\" pgmap=\"428\">\u201cWhere an insurer waits to bring its declaratory judgment action until after the underlying action had been resolved by a judgment or a settlement, the insurer\u2019s declaratory judgment action is untimely as a matter of law.\u201d Ehlco Liquidating Trust, 186 111. 2d at 157.</blockquote> <p id=\"b429-2\" pgmap=\"429\">Vigilant contends the insurer\u2019s duty to file a declaratory judgment action is tied to its duty to defend. Conversely, where the insurer clearly has no duty to defend, he has no obligation to file a declaratory judgment action before the underlying suit is resolved.</p> <p id=\"b429-3\" pgmap=\"429\">We agree with Vigilant. In Ehlco Liquidating Trust, the insured tendered the defense of an underlying suit to the insurer, Wausau. Ehlco Liquidating Trust, 186 Ill. 2d at 134. Wausau did not defend the underlying suit, nor did it promptly file a suit for declaratory judgment. Ehlco Liquidating Trust, 186 Ill. 2d at 134. Wausau eventually filed a declaratory judgment action, four months after the underlying suit was resolved. Ehlco Liquidating Trust, 186 Ill. 2d at 157. One of the issues on appeal was whether the doctrine of estoppel barred Wausau from raising policy defenses. Ehlco Liquidating Trust, 186 Ill. 2d at 157.</p> <p id=\"b429-4\" pgmap=\"429\">The rule Gould &amp; Ratner relies on in support of its contention was part of the court\u2019s analysis of the application of the estoppel doctrine to Wausau. In an attempt to avoid the application of the doctrine, Wausau contended it timely filed its declaratory judgment action. Ehlco Liquidating Trust, 186 Ill. 2d at 157. The court held the declaratory judgment action filed after the underlying suit had been resolved was untimely as a matter of law. Ehlco Liquidating Trust, 186 Ill. 2d at 157. Because Wausau had a duty to defend, and neither defended under a reservation of rights nor timely filed a declaratory judgment action, estoppel applied in that case. Ehlco Liquidating Trust, 186 Ill. 2d at 150-59. The court said:</p> <blockquote id=\"b429-5\" pgmap=\"429\">\u201cThis estoppel doctrine applies only where an insurer has breached its duty to defend. Thus, a court inquires whether the insurer had a duty to defend and whether it breached that duty. [Citation.] Application of the estoppel doctrine is not appropriate if the insurer had no duty to defend, or if the insurer\u2019s duty to defend was not properly triggered. These circumstances include where the insurer was given no opportunity to defend; where there was no insurance policy in existence; and where, when the policy and the complaint are compared, there clearly was no coverage or potential for coverage. [Citations.]\u201d Ehlco Liquidating Trust, 186 Ill. 2d at 151.</blockquote> <p id=\"b429-6\" pgmap=\"429\">Here, we do not have to consider whether Vigilant timely filed its declaratory judgment action as a matter of law because Vigilant had no duty to defend and the doctrine of estoppel does not apply.</p> <p id=\"b429-7\" pgmap=\"429(46) 430(25)\">Absent a clear duty to defend, an insurer would have no reason or obligation to file a declaratory judgment before the underlying suit is resolved. To hold to the contrary would lead to an illogical result: insurers would be required to promptly file actions for declaratory judgments to preserve their rights every time they are informed of a claim from an insured, even where there clearly is no potential for coverage.</p> <p id=\"b430-3\" pgmap=\"430\">CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b430-4\" pgmap=\"430\">We conclude the professional exclusion in this case is analogous to the one we reviewed in Pekin Insurance Co. Following our analysis and holding in Pekin Insurance Co. and comparing the allegations in the underlying complaint to the professional exclusion, Vigilant had no duty to defend Gould &amp; Ratner. Absent a duty to defend, the doctrine of estoppel does not apply here, and Vigilant\u2019s suit for declaratory judgment was not untimely. The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Vigilant.</p> <p id=\"b430-5\" pgmap=\"430\">We affirm.</p> <p id=\"b430-6\" pgmap=\"430\">SOUTH, P.J., concurs.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b426-7\" pgmap=\"426\">The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this decision in Erie Insurance Group v.

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Vigilant based not only on Vigilant\u2019s action, but also on Gould &amp; Ratner\u2019s action. Summary judgment on Gould &amp; Ratner\u2019s action would stand, regardless of whether Vigilant\u2019s action was timely.</p> </footnote> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b430-7\" pgmap=\"430\">JUSTICE HOFFMAN,</author> <p id=\"ATE\" pgmap=\"430\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b430-8\" pgmap=\"430\">Resolution of this appeal requires the construction of the professional services exclusion contained within a general liability policy of insurance issued by Vigilant Insurance Company (Vigilant). The majority has correctly set forth the general standards to be applied in construing an insurance policy. However, I am compelled to dissent because I believe that the majority has misapplied those standards by failing to interpret arguably ambiguous terms in the subject policy in favor of coverage. See Outboard Marine Corp. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 154 Ill. 2d 90, 119, 607 N.E.2d 1204 (1992).</p> <p id=\"b430-9\" pgmap=\"430\">The majority has accurately set forth the facts of this case. Succinctly put, David Carmell filed a six-count complaint against the law firm of Gould &amp; Ratner and one of its partners, Jonathan Backman. Two of the counts in Carmell\u2019s complaint stated claims for defamation against Gould &amp; Ratner by reason of certain letters Backman wrote in the course of the firm\u2019s representation of Apex Automotive Warehouse, L.E, in a bankruptcy proceeding. Gould &amp; Ratner tendered the defense of the Carmell action to its insurer, Vigilant. Vigilant denied coverage under the general liability policy it had issued to Gould &amp; Ratner, claiming, inter alia, that the defamation claims fell within the scope of a policy exclusion for professional services. As a consequence, Vigilant refused to defend Gould &amp; Ratner. After settling the Carmell suit, Gould &amp; Ratner filed the instant action against Vigilant for breach of contract.</p> <p id=\"b430-10\" pgmap=\"430(10) 431(78)\">In affirming the summary judgment entered in favor of Vigilant, the majority relies primarily upon the holding in Pekin Insurance Co. v. L.J. Shaw &amp; Co., 291 Ill. App. 3d 888, 684 N.E.2d 853 (1997) (Pekin), and finds that the defamation actions asserted against Gould &amp; Ratner in the Carmell suit fall within the professional services exclusion at issue. I disagree. Rather, I believe that the wording of the professional services exclusion in the Vigilant policy is readily distinguishable from the exclusion at issue in Pekin.</p> <p id=\"b431-3\" pgmap=\"431\">In Pekin, the policy at issue excluded coverage for certain damages \u201cdue to rendering or failure to render any professional service[s].\u201d 291 Ill. App. 3d at 890. The Pekin court held that the exclusion was applicable to actions brought by one whose damages were caused by the insured\u2019s rendering or failing to render professional services and was not limited to actions brought by a client of the insured. Pekin, 291 Ill. App. 3d at 894-97. In so holding, the court relied upon the holdings in Hurst-Rosche Engineers, Inc. v. Commercial Union Insurance Co., 51 F.3d 1336 (7th Cir. 1995) (Hurst-Rosche), and Erie Insurance Group v. Alliance Environmental, Inc., 921 F. Supp. 537 (S.D. Ind. 1996) (Erie). Pekin, 291 Ill. App. 3d at 892-97. In Hurst-Rosche, the court determined that actions for libel and tortious interference with contract asserted against the insured engineering firm by a non-client and arising out of a letter that a firm employee wrote in the course of performing duties for a client fell within the scope of a policy provision which excluded coverage for damages \u201carising out of the rendering or failure to render any professional services.\u201d Hurst-Rosche, 51 F.3d at 1343-44. In Erie, the policy provision at issue excluded coverage for damages \u201cdue to any service of a professional nature.\u201d Erie, 921 F. Supp. at 542. Citing, inter alia, Hurst-Rosche, the Erie court concluded that claims of defamation and tortious interference with contract asserted against the insured by a nonclient and arising from statements the insured made during the course of performing inspection services for a client fell within the scope of the professional services exclusion. Erie, 921 F. Supp. at 541-47. The majority concludes that the professional services exclusion contained in the policy issued by Vigilant, like the relevant provisions in Pekin, Erie and Hurst-Rosche, is not limited to claims or suits brought by a client of the insured. I disagree.</p> <p id=\"b431-4\" pgmap=\"431(88) 432(214)\">The professional service exclusions at issue in Pekin, Erie and Hurst-Rosche are framed in terms of injury or damage \u201cdue to\u201d (see Pekin, 291 Ill. App. 3d at 890; Erie, 921 F. Supp. at 541) or \u201carising out of\u2019 (see Hurst-Rosche, 51 F.3d at 1340) the rendition or failure to render professional services, not in terms of the legal theory upon which the claim or suit for the damage or injury is based. See Erie, 921 F. Supp. at 542. As a consequence, these exclusions do not require privity between the insured and the underlying claimant and are not limited to injury or damage suffered by a client of the insured professional. See Pekin, 291 Ill. App. 3d at 894-97. In contrast, the professional service exclusion in the Vigilant policy at issue in this case states that the insurance provided does not apply to any \u201cclaim or suit\u201d against the insured \u201cfor rendering or fading to render written or oral professional legal services or advice.\u201d I believe that the exclusion in the Vigilant policy can reasonably be interpreted as being applicable only to claims or suits brought by a client of the insured or a third-party beneficiary of a contract between the insured and its client, since only a client or a third-party beneficiary of an attorney-client relationship has a claim, or can maintain a suit, against an attorney for rendering or failing to render legal services. See Pelham v. Griesheimer, 92 Ill. 2d 13, 440 N.E.2d 96 (1982). There is, to my mind, a clear distinction between the wording of the professional service exclusions at issue in Pekin, Erie and Hurst-Rosche and the one at issue in this case. Further, contrary to the declaration of the majority, I believe that the distinction is one with a difference.</p> <p id=\"b432-3\" pgmap=\"432\">In support of its conclusion that the professional service exclusion in the instant case is no different in scope than the one at issue in Pekin, the majority notes that \u201c[t]he American Heritage College Dictionary (3d ed. 2000) defines both \u2018for\u2019 and \u2018due to\u2019 as \u2018because of.\u2019 \u201d 336 Ill. App. 3d at 409. I believe, however, that reliance upon dictionary definitions in many cases is akin to reliance upon expert testimony: you can always find one to say what you need said.</p> <p id=\"b432-4\" pgmap=\"432\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (Webster\u2019s), which bills itself as \u201cThe Definitive Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language,\u201d defines \u201cfor\u201d as \u201con this ground.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 886 (1981). If one adopts Webster\u2019s definition of the word \u201cfor\u201d and construes the professional service exclusion in Vigilant\u2019s policy to apply to claims or suits asserted against its insured on the grounds of rendering or failing to render professional legal services, Gould &amp; Ratner\u2019s assertion that the exclusion is only applicable to claims or suits brought by a client is no longer easily dismissed. See Pelham, 92 Ill. 2d at 20-25. In any case, I believe that Gould &amp; Ratner\u2019s suggested interpretation is a reasonable one.</p> <p id=\"b432-5\" pgmap=\"432\">As our supreme court stated in Outboard Marine Corp. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 154 Ill. 2d 90, 119, 607 N.E.2d 1204 (1992):</p> <blockquote id=\"b432-6\" pgmap=\"432(45) 433(48)\">\u201c[I]n construing the terms in an insurance policy, the court must ascertain the intent of the parties. [Citation.] If the terms of the policy are clear and unambiguous, the court must give them their plain, ordinary, popular meaning. [Citation.] If a term in the policy is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation within the context in which it appears, it is ambiguous. [Citation.] Ambiguous terms are construed strictly against the drafter of the policy and in favor of coverage. [Citations.] This is especially true with respect to exclusionary clauses. [Citation.]\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b433-4\" pgmap=\"433\">I believe that, at a minimum, the professional services exclusion contained in the Vigilant policy is ambiguous and can reasonably be interpreted as applying only to claims or suits for the rendition of or failure to render legal services brought by a client of the insured attorney or a third-party beneficiary of a contract between the insured attorney and a client. Since it is clear from the underlying complaint that CarmelPs claims for defamation against Gould &amp; Ratner were not based upon his status as a client or a third-party beneficiary or based upon any legal services rendered to him or for his benefit, they do not fall within the scope of the professional services exclusion. I would, therefore, reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand this matter for further proceedings.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
