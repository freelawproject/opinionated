The bill does not aver that the assessment is incorrect, and it is a fair inference from the averments it does contain that the appellant is amply able to pay the amount which the government is seeking to collect. We are of opinion that the appellant has an adequate remedy at law, in that he may, after paying the amount of the assessment, sue the collector for its return. We take judicial notice that April 1, 1923, fell on Sunday. The list containing the assessment against the appellant was in the hands of the collector in Texas on Monday, April 2, 1923, and must therefore have been signed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and mailed from Washington before the 1st day of that month. It thus appears that the assessment was made within the statutory period of five vears from the date of appellant\u2019s return, which was filed April 1, 1918,'</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>The bill is sought to be maintained upon the theory that, under section 250 (d) of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 227 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, \u00a7 6336\u215btt]), any proceeding for the collection of taxes for the year 1917 is barred, because five years had elapsed since the appellant filed his return, and that R. S. \u00a7 3224 (Comp. St. \u00a7 5947), which provides that \u201cno suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court,\u201d is inapplicable. The Supreme Court has ruled directly against this position in Graham v. DuPont, 262 U. S. 234, 43 Sup. Ct. 567, 67 L. Ed. 965. In that case the assessment was-made after the expiration of the statutory period, but it was held nevertheless that injunction would not lie, because of section 3224. It is true in this case, as it was in the cited case, that under the Act of March 4, 1923 (42 Stat. 1504), the complainant has two years after payment of the tax to bring suit to recover it back, in which suit he can raise any question affecting the validity of the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
