Pacific Coast rail shipping point. It was not controverted that the plaintiff was able and willing to perform its part of the contract; that on October 20, it shipped the prunes called for by the contract to the defendant at Watuppa ; and that the defendant refused to accept and pay for the same. While the defendant admitted that it had broken the contract, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>\u25a0claimed that it did so before tire plaintiff shipped the merchandise by an unqualified refusal on its part to proceed with the contract, and that it could be holden for damages only for the difference between the contract price and the market price of the prunes at the time of the refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The evidence upon the question of refusal on the part of the defendant is contained in the following letters and telegram:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">On September 16, 1920, the defendant sent the plaintiff the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">\u201cFall River, Mass., Sept. 16, 1820.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">\u201cMessrs.

The jury found and assessed the damages upon the theory that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>defendant did not intend to repudiate the contract, but to seek cancellation of it and a release from damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\u2022The defendant contends that the court erred in permitting the jury to determine what was meant by the language used in.the letters and telegram.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">If the situation presented was such that it was the duty of the court' to construe the correspondence rather than to leave it to the jury to do, we are of the opinion that the construction placed upon it by the jury was right, and, such being the case, the defendant was in no way harmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed, with costs to the defendant in error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
