Having this in mind, we shall merely determine whether there was substantial evidence before the court upon which to base the finding, we already having determined that a proceeding of this kind is maintainable under the provisions of section 980 of our Code. Bernsdorff v. Bernsdorff, 26 App. D. C. 520; Beall v. Beall, 27,App. D. C. 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>It appears that for several months prior to October 20, 1921, Mrs. Wedderbum had been very unhappy because of conditions in the home, for which her husband was, to .a considerable extent at least, responsible. On that date he surreptitiously took the two eldest children to Virginia, where he kept them for 6 weeks, when they were returned under an order of a Virginia court. On October 24, 1921, Mr. Wedder-bum wrote his wife that he was \u201con the hunt for a suitable home in Virginia,\u201d and that he was ready to have her come to live with him at a hotel. On the same day that this letter was written, and possibly before it even was mailed, he filed \u00e1 petition for divorce against his wife in Virginia. It is apparent, therefore, that this letter was a mere subterfuge. From that time he has contributed nothing toward the support of his wife and children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\">A consideration of all the evidence leads to the conclusion reached by the trial court, namely, that the breaking up of this home was attributable largely to the attitude and conduct of the husband. Under the evidence the amount awarded the wife is reasonable. Indeed, if we accept the testimony of the husband on this point, he was contributing much more prior to October of 1921 than he now is required to pay for the maintenance of his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">It results that the decree must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
