By deed of April 1, 1861, A leased certain coal properly to B until December 31, 1864; and by deed of November 11,1861, endorsed on the first, and declared to be a part of it, he leased other adjoining coal property to B for the same time. By contract of September 4, 1864, A and B agree to renew the lease of April 1, 1861, for five years from the 1st of January, 1865. A question arising whether the lease of the property mentioned in the deed of November 11, 1861, is renewed as being part of the lease of April 1, 1861.

The court below having decided the case on the construction of the deeds, and there having been little enquiry before the commis- \u2022 sioner as to the intention of the parties, upon the reversing of the decree, the cause will be referred to a commissioner, with liberty to both parties to introduce testimony.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-13\">In May, 1866, a decree was made in three causes depending in the Circuit Court of Henrico county, one in the name of Finney and others against Heth\u2019s administrator and others, one in the name of Gwathmey\u2019s executor against the same defendants, and one in the name of Barksdale and others against the same defendants, by which a commissioner of the court was directed to enquire and report to the court the amount due in the present currency from the Midlothian Coal Mining Company and others, under leases by the receivers of the court in said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>causes, to said lessees of the coal land and other property of the Chesterfield Coal and Iron Mining Company embraced in said leases. In pursuance of this decree, Commissioner Evans, in October, 1866, made a report, in . . which he charged the Midlothian Coal Mining Company, among other items, with .$2,250 of principal and $270 of interest, as rent of what is called the Swann pit, from the 20th of November, 1861, to the 20th November, 1866, at $ 450 <em>per annum. </em>He returned with his report the leases under which the rents were held by him to be due; and also the deposition of J. L. Morrisett, the receiver who had made the leases to the Midlothian Company, under which the question in this cause arises. On the 26th of October, 1866, the court made a decree confirming the report, and directing the Midlothian Coal Mining Company to pay into the National Exchange Bank the several sums reported to be due from the Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-6\">On the 2d of November, 1866, the Midlothian Coal Mining Company, with the consent of the parties in these causes, filed their petitions in the causes, and also exceptions to the report of Commissioner Evans. The first exception is\u2014Because they are charged with rent at the rate of $450 <em>per annum </em>for five years for the Swann pit, whereas, as they insisted, the lease of that pit was only from the 20th of November, 1861, until the end of the year 1864.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-7\">It appears that, by a deed of lease bearing date the 1st day of April, 1861, James Morrissett, as receiver of the court, leased to the Midlothian Coal Mining Company certain coal lands of the Chesterfield Coal and Iron Mining Company, described in the <em>lease; </em>and the lease was to continue until the 31st of December, 1864. This lease did not embrace the Swann pit, which was the property of the same Company. At this time the Midlothian Company held other parts of said lands under a previous lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>executed by Farrar, a previous receiver in these causes, which would terminate at the same time. On the 20th November, 1861, Morrisett made another lease to the Midlothian Company, which was endorsed on or added to that of the 1st of April, in which it is said that, in addirion to the privileges granted to the said lessees by the foregoing lease bearing date the 1st of April, A. D. 1861, the said lessees shall have the like privileges of working the pit known as Swann\u2019s pit, and of raising coal from the same, subject to the same conditions and restrictions as are prescribed in the foregoing lease in respect of the workings therein contemplated, and subject also to these conditions; and then sets out certain provisions as to what the Company should not or should do ; and containing a covenant by the lessee that the annual rent of said Swann\u2019s pit shall not be less than four hundred and fifty dollars. The last provision in this deed is: 3. This agreement being in addition and supplement to the foregoing lease, shall be taken and considered as a part thereof; and it shall be in the power of the said receiver, or of his successor in office, to terminate the foregoing lease, and also this agreement as a part thereof, upon giving three months notice to the said lessees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-7\">By another deed bearing date the 1st of September, 1864, Morrisett and the Midlothian Company agree to renew and extend the lease granted by Farrar, and also the lease of Morrisett of the 1st of April, 1861, for five years from the 31st of December, 1864. This deed commences by reciting the existence of the lease by Farrar by its date, and the one from Morrisett as dated the 1st of April, 1861, and then says, that the said parties, Morrisett and the Company, have agreed and do agree to renew and continue the said leases for the term of five years from the said 31st of December, 1864, to the 31st of December, 1869, upon the same terms and conditions-as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>are set forth in the two existing leases, in all respects, except so far as the same are varied by what follows in this deed. The deed then proceeds to provide what rent shall be paid per bushel upon the coal raised.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-4\">Morrisett, in his deposition, which was taken by the commissioner and returned with his report, says: That the Midlothian Coal Mining Company had paid no rent for the Swann pit under the lease of April 1st, 1861. They expended something considerable in cleaning out and drifting the pit, though they raised no coal from it. As he understood the purpose of the Midlothian Company, it was to keep other persons from renting and working the Swann pit. It is just and fair, however, to say, that the Midlothian Company tried their best to raise coal from the Swann pit, and failed, because the coal was not there to raise. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-6\">The petition of the Midlothian Coal Mining Company, after referring to the Commissioner's report and the leases hereinbefore mentioned, says that the report shows that there was no evidence whatever before the Commissioner of any holding over of the Swann pit by the Midlothian Company, after the 81st of December, when the lease of the property expired by its terms; and they aver and are prepared to prove, that no such evidence was in fact before him, and that none such could have been before him, because none such existed. They insist that the lease of April 1st and November 20th, 1861, were distinct leases, and the renewal of the first did not renew the last. That if the terms of the lease are ambiguous, so as to admit parol evidence to show what was the intention of the par* ties in taking the renewed lease of the 1st of September, 1864, the evidence of Morrisett should have led the Commissioner to an inference opposite to that he has drawn. And they aver that they never intended to renew the lease of the Swann pit, and never imagined they had done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>S0, That in fact, long before the first lease had expired, ^jjey ^yithdrew their machinery, abandoned the possession of the pit, and never afterwards interfered with it in any manner whatever; and though they remained lesgees until the first lease expired, and liable, as such, for the rent, yet after the expiration of that lease, they never asserted or claimed any title or interest whatever in the Swann pit, never exercised any control over it, or had any sort of possession of it; nor were they aware, until Commissioner Evans\u2019 report was made, that any person regarded them as tenants of that pit, or responsible for rent in any way or to any extent. And all these allegations they are prepared to establish by proofs, if an opportunity is afforded them to do so. This petition was sworn to by the President of the Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-4\">On the 6th of November, 1866, the court, by consent of the parties, made a decree, that the operation of the decree confirming the report of Commissioner Evans, be suspended so far as it relates to the sum of $2,250, principal money, and $'270 interest, reported as the rent due from the Midlothian Company for the Swann pit; but the cause coming on again to be heard on the 30th of April, 1867, the court was of opinion that, according to the true intent of the contracting parties, the lease of the Swann pit was incorporated with and made part of the original lease of the 1st of April, 1861; and that the whole lease was renewed, including the Swann pit as a part of the demised premises, by the lease of the 1st of September, 1864. The decree of the 6th of November, 1866, was therefore set aside, and the Commissioner\u2019s report was again confirmed. And the Midlothian Coal Mining Company obtained an appeal to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b334-5\">JV.

It recites that there are in existence two leases, which will expire on the 31st day of December, 1864\u2014one dated November 11, 1854, the other dated April 1, 1861\u2014and provides for a renewal of these leases for a term of five years, upon certain specified terms. But when we come to apply this contract to the subject matter, it appears that on the 20th November, 1861, a paper was executed containing a lease of the Swann pit until the 31st day of December, 1864, which paper refers to the lease of April 1, 1861, and describes itself as \u201c an addition and supplement \u201d to the lease of April 1, 1861; and declares that it \u201c shall be taken and considered as a part thereof.\u201d A question then arises, whether the parties intended, by the contract of September 1,1864, to renew the lease of April 1, 1861, as it originally stood, so as to exclude the Swann pit, or to renew that lease along with the \u201caddition and supplement\u201d of November 20, 1861, \u201cas a part thereof,\u201d so as to embrace the Swann pit. This presented a case of latent ambiguity, for the removal of which it was competent to show by parol evidence, what was the actual intention of the parties. The lease of November 20, 1861, was called part of that of April, 1881, so as to subject it, without the necessity of repetition, to the same conditions; but it was still actually distinct from it, inasmuch as it related to different property, was made at a different time, reserved a distinct rent, and was, in some respects, subject to different conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">The only parol evidence in this case was the deposition of Morrissett, the lessor. He testified that the appellants expended a considerable sum in cleaning out and drifting the Swann pit, though they raised no coal from it; that they tried their best to raise coal from that pit, but failed, \u201c because the coal was not there to raise.\u201d He further said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>that he understood that the purpose of the appellants was to keep other persons from renting and working the Swann pit.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-14\">Though not so stated in terms, this witn\u00e9ss seems to have had reference to what was done by the appellants during the original term, and to the motives which induced them <em>to obtain the </em>original lease of the Swann pit. It cannot be supposed that they would allow the whole term of the original lease to expire without ascertaining whether or not coal could be found in that pit; and after ascertaining that no coal was there, they would have had no motive to keep other persons from renting and working it.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-15\">This evidence, given by the lessor himself, affords strong ground to believe that the parties did not intend to embrace the Swann pit in the contract of September 1, 1864. The appellants had no motive to renew the lease of that pit; the former lease had been a dead loss to them of the rent and of the money expended in cleaning out and drifting the pit. A renewal of the lease must have entailed a like loss; and these facts were well known to the lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-16\">The appellants excepted to the report of the Commissioner charging them with rent of the Swann pit under the contract of renewal, and supported the exception by an affidavit. This affidavit stated, among other things set forth by the appellants in a petition, that the appellants \u201c never intended to renew the lease of that pit, and never imagined that they had done so; that in fact, long before the first lease expired, they withdrew their machinery, abandoned the possession of the pit, and never afterwards interfered with it in any manner whatever; and though they remained lessees until the first lease expired, and liable, as such, for the rent, yet after the expiration of that lease, they never asserted or claimed any title or interest in the Swann pit; never exercised any control over it, or had any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>sort of possession of it; neither were they aware, until the report of Commissioner Evans was made, that any person regarded them as tenants of the Swann pit, or responsible for rent in any way or to any extent. And all these allegations they are prepared to sustain by proofs, if the opportunity be afforded them to do so.\u201d The appellants, in their petition, asked that the report of the Commissioner might be corrected by excluding the rent charged for the Swann pit, and that, if necessary, the report might' be recommitted for that purpose, with leave to the petitioners to adduce proof of the allegations made in their petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">The Circuit Court overruled the exception and confirmed the report, being \u201c of opinion that, according to the true intent of the contracting parties, the lease of the Swann pit was incorporated with and made a part of the original lease of April 1, 1861, and that the whole lease was renewed, including the Swann pit, as part of the demised premises, by the lease of September 1, 1864.\u201d It would seem from this, that the court decided the case upon the construction of the several leases, and without reference to the parol evidence. For the reasons already given, I think the case must be decided upon the parol evidence, and that it is at least doubtful, from the evidence in the record, whether the parties' did intend to embrace the Swann pit in the contract of renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">But it is evident that the parties did not go fully into the parol evidence bearing on this question. It is alleged by the appellants, in their petition, that they did not do so themselves, and they cannot complain if an opportunity is given to the other parties to adduce further evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">I am, therefore, of opinion that the Circuit Court, instead of overruling the exception of the appellants, should have recommitted the report, with instructions to the Commissioner to enquire whether it was the actual intention of the parties to embrace or to exclude the Swann <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>pit in the renewed lease, and with leave to all parties to take further evidence on that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">I think the decree should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-15\">The other judges concurred in the opinion of <em>Joynes, J.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-16\">Degree appirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
