The Council, under the charter of the city, . had authority to make the order and the pledge ; and the city of Richmond is responsible for the value of the liquor destroyed under the order of the Council.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-14\">This was an action on the case in assumpsit in the Circuit Court of the city of Richmond, brought by William B. Jones and Richard L. Brown, merchants and partners trading under the name and style of W. B. Jones &amp; Co., against the city of Richmond, to recover the value of a quantity of liquor destroyed by the order of the Council of the city on the morning of the 8d of April, 1865. The declaration contained two special counts, and the common counts in assumpsit. There was a demurrer to the special counts, which was sustained by the court; but as the demurrer was sustained on the ground that the facts did not constitute a cause of action against the city, they need not be further stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-15\">Upon the trial the plaintiffs introduced as evidence the following resolutions of the Council of the city, adopted on the 2d of April, 1865:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-16\">1. <em>Resolved, </em>That it is the imperative duty of this Council, in-the case of the evacuation of this city by the gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>ernment and army, to provide, as far as it can, for the immediate destruction of the stock of liquor in the city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AG\">2. <em>Resolved, </em>That a committee of twenty-five citizens in each ward be appointed by the president to act on 1 r <em>J </em>r behalf of the city, and proceed at once to accomplish this object.

This receipt was introduced in evidence, dated Richmond, April 3d, 1865: Received and destroyed for Mr. W. B. Jones, (specifying the quantity of the different kinds of liquor,) for which the city, through its Council, agrees to pay its full value, this receipt being his voucher. The plaintiffs then introduced evidence as to the value of the liquor; when the attorney of the City moved the court to instruct the jury, that the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover against the defendant any damages for the destruction of said liquor, no matter what was the value thereof. This instruction the court gave; and the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-11\">There Avas a verdict and judgment for the defendant; and the plaintiffs obtained a Avrit of error from a judge of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b544-12\"><em>O.

The constitution of the United States, Article 5 of the amendments, and of Virginia, Article 4, \u00a7 15, provide that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. The restrictions put by these provisions upon legislation by the State may be seen by reference to 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 339; <em>Mayor &amp;c. of New York </em>v. <em>Lord, 17 </em>Wend. R. 289, 18 Id. 126; <em>Stone </em>&amp;c. v. <em>Mayor &amp;c. of New York, </em>25 Wend.

The Council of the city of Richmond had authority to pass the resolutions adopted on the 2d of April, 1865', and to come under the engagement contained in them. The-54th and 56th chapters of the Codeare applicable to the corporation of Richmond and the Council of the city; and the powers of the corporation are still further enlarged by the charter of March 18th, 1861. By section twenty-nine of the charter, the Council has authority to pass all by-laws, rules and ordinances not repugnant to the constitution and huvs of the State, which shall be necessary for the good order and government of such per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>sons as from time to time reside or be within the of the city, &amp;c.; or which they shall deem necessary f\u00b0r Peace? comfort, convenience, good order, good morals, health or safety of said city or of the people or property therein. It was for the Council, under the powers vested in it, to determine what was necessary for the peace, good order and safety of the city; and in the performance of their duty they directed the destruction of the liquor in the city, and undertook to pay for it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-5\">4th. It made no difference that the property destroyed was liquor. <em>Wynehamer </em>v. <em>The People, </em>13 New York R. (3 Kernan) 384: <em>Howell &amp;c. </em>v. <em>City of </em>Buffalo, 15 New York R. (1 Smith) 519.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b546-6\"><em>Daniel, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-7\">The only question in this case is, whether the Council of the city iiad authority to destroy the liquor in the city at the time it was ordered. This authority must be derived, if it existed, from one of two sources. First\u2014 Overruling necessity; or, Second\u2014The right of eminent domain. The distinction between these sources of power is explained in <em>American Print Works </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>3 Zabr. R. 608-608. If the authority was derived from the first source, then the plaintiffs had no right to compensation ; and the promise of the Council was without authority and without consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-8\">There is certainly no inherent tight of eminent domain in the corporation of the city of Richmond. All its powers are derivative, and are only such as are vested in it by statute; and in construing the statutes giving it powers, we are told that they must be construed strictly. <em>City of Richmond </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>14 Gratt. 388 ; <em>City of New London </em>v. <em>Brainard, </em>22 Conn. R. 552; <em>State of New York </em>v. <em>Mayor and Aldermen of New York, </em>3 Duer\u2019s R. 110; <em>City of Lafayette </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>5 Indiana R. 38.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>There is no doubt that the Legislature may grant this power of eminent domain to corporations, and counties which are <em>quasi </em>corporations; and that this has been done in some eases in this State, as to take land for streets, for \u2019 gas and water works, for roads and mills. But the fact that these powers have been granted demonstrates the necessity of the grant to the exercise of such powers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-6\">It is not pretended that there is any express grant to the corporation of Richmond of the power to destroy the property of the citizen; but counsel attempt to derive it from some general words to be found in section twenty-nine of the charter of the city of March 18th, 1861. It is obvious, however that the language must be construed with reference to the other |powers \u201cgranted to the city; otherwise the expression of specific grants of power would have been useless; and it is obvious too, that the powers to be exercised under these general words is to be exercised by fixed and permanent by-laws, rules or ordinances and not by some individual and instantaneous act. All the provisions of the section refer to legislation, not executive action.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b547-7\">Rives, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqjX\">This cause rests upon a bill of exceptions to an instruction of the court denying the right of the plaintiffs to recover upon the evidence. Questions were made by demurrer to the first and second counts of the declaration ; but in the argument here it seemed to be conceded, that the necessity of deciding them would be superseded by an adjudication of the principle defining the liability of the defendant in error. Hence, it will not be necessary to bestow any special notice upon the pleadings, but to restrict our examination to the propriety of this instruction. Its grounds are not expressed in the record; but the full and exhaustive argument we have had at this bar, discloses them with great clearness. It is contended on the part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>City, that the corporation is not liable on two grounds : first, because the destruction of these stores was the result of that urgent necessity which, on common law principles, deprives the sufferer of indemnity; and secondly, if not to be so regarded, it was an exercise of eminent domain, not pertaining to the corporation either by express or implied delegation of powers to that end, in its charter, or the general laws of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The resolutions of the City Council for the destruction of these liquors were taken on the eve of its evacuation, in April, 1865, and were carried into effect just before the entry of the Federal forces. However, opinions may differ as to the extremity of this emergency; and the propriety of the measures thus taken to remove the most common, if not the most certain, cause of riot and military insubordination upon such an iifvent, it must be conceded that this step was not inconsistent with a prudent forecast, a wise discretion, and a reasonable precaution. It may not now be possible to determine how far military discipline might have restrained the soldiery and populace under the ordinary license and excitements of such an occasion, from the plunder of these liquors, and the disorders usually created by it; the natural probability, however, that it might not have been prevented by all the resources of military discipline, should now be accepted as a sufficient justification of that discretion which was reasonably employed in removing such a prolific source of disorder and brutal license on an occasion so threatening to the safety of property and the good order of society. It was not for the Council, in its deliberations on the 2d of April, to foresee the order or events of a military hostile occupation, or to determine whether or not, by design or accident, the city might be exposed to the perils of rapine and disorder under such circumstances. Hence, it must be admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>that these legislative guardians of the city were well justified in the exercise of a discretion as to the destruction of stores so dangerous to the peace and safety of the City ; and that there is nothing in the facts of this cause to \u00b0 &gt; create the belief that their action in the premises was not the result of a sound discretion and a proper precaution.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">But the question is raised whether these resolutions were within the scope of their corporate powers. This court has judicially recognized this corporation as a public municipality, as well as a private one, and clothed with delegated trusts of a governmental kind. The General Assembly has chosen to impart to it some of its own sovereign attributes over the people and property embraced by its charter. It is needless to enumerate these. It is sufficient for the purpose of this enquiry to state, that it possesses all the general corporate \u201cpowers and capacities appertaining to municipal corporations in this commonwealth,\u201d and that by the 29th section of its charter, the Council is specially empowered to \u201c pass all by-laws, rules and regulations, which they shall deem necessary for the peace, comfort, convenience, good order, good morals, health or safety of said city, or of the people or property therein.\u201d It is hard to conceive of larger terms for the grant of sovereign, legislative powers, to the specified end than those thus employed in the charter; and they must be taken by necessary and unavoidable intendment to comprise the powers of eminent domain within these limits of prescribed jurisdiction. There were two modes open to the Council: first, to direct the destruction of these stores, leaving the question of the City\u2019s liability therefor to be afterwards litigated and determined ; or secondly, assuming their liability, to contract for the values destroyed under their orders. Had they pursued the first mode, the corporation would have been liable in an action of trespass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>^01\u2019 the damages; but they thought proper to adopt the latter mode, made it a matter of contract, and approach their citizens, not as trespassers, but with the amicable Pr\u00b0ffer of a formal receipt and the plighted <em>\u2018faith of the cHy </em>\u2019 for the payment. In this, they seem to m\u00e9 to be well justified. They found themselves - inhibited, by the terms of their charter, sect. 49, from \u201c taking or using any private property for public purposes, without making to the owner or owners thereof just compensation for the same.\u201d I am well aware the exception is taken in adjudged cases, that such destruction is not within this language; but coupled with the inherent equity of such a course, this language was persuasive to the actual agreement for payment, and should be accepted as a probable and reasonable motive with the Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">One of the primary and fundamental capacities of a corporation is, \u201c to contract and to be contracted with.\u201d The City, through its Council and committees, approach the liquor dealers and possess themselves of their stores by virtue of a formal contract, set forth in the resolutions of the Council, to receipt and pay for them. The least that could be said, if the City can escape this contract, would be, that the citizen was a sufferer 4&gt;y obedience to the public authority, and betrayed by his acquiescence in the formally proffered terms of the City. I am happy in the confidence, that no such consequence and injustice can result from the doctrines of law applicable to this case. The Council, or its successors, cannot esteem it a hardship to be required to keep their plighted faith to the holders of their receipts; and their failure to do so without suit, which, I confess, excites my surprise, is doubtless due to the doubts that have been raised by the able counsel for the defendant in error. I am, therefore, of opinion that the court below erred in its instruction to the jury, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>sustaining the demurrer to the first and second \"counts, which set out the special undertaking of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The other judges concurred in the opinion of <em>Hives, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
