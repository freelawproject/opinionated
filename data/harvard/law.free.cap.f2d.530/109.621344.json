The Secretary as respondent, and two intervenors, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States and the American Metal Stamping Association, defend the revised standards, as does the Associated Industries of New York State, Inc. as amicus. The National Machine Tool Builders Association as amicus supports the' petitioner\u2019s challenge. At issue is the Secretary\u2019s decision to eliminate the \u201cno hands in dies\u201d standard for mechanical power presses, adopted in 1971 and appearing at 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.217(d)(l)-(2) (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">In \u00a7 6(a) of the Act the Secretary was authorized and directed to promulgate by rule as an occupational safety and health standard any \u201cnational consensus standard\u201d unless he determined that the promulgation of such a standard would not result in improved safety or health for specifically designated employees. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(a). \u201cNational consensus standard\u201d is defined in \u00a7 3(9) of the Act as one adopted and promulgated by a nationally recognized standards-producing organization.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1971 the Secretary, acting pursuant to \u00a7 6(a), adopted a large number of standards which had been promulgated by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), an organization which has served as a clearinghouse for the development of voluntary standards by agreement among maker, seller and user groups.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Among the ANSI standards which the Secretary adopted was its standard B 11.1-1971, Safety Requirements for the Construction, Care and Use of Mechanical Power Presses. This standard was a revision of a safety code for mechanical power presses which had first been promulgated in 1922 and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>been revised several times thereafter. Standard B 11.1-1971, a revision adopted by ANSI on February 17, 1971, however, although it carried forward many features of the earlier mechanical power press safety codes, departed radically from those codes in one very significant respect. The 1971 standard announced its central purpose to be the elimination of \u201cthe necessity of having the operator place his hands or fingers within the point of operation, thus minimizing his exposure to point of operations hazards.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When it promulgated the no hands in dies standard<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the B 11 standards committee did not anticipate that its code would, by virtue of the enactment of OSHA and the Secretary\u2019s action, become a mandatory federal standard rather than a precatory guideline for the affected industries.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">On January 26, 1973 the Secretary announced in the Federal Register the receipt of two petitions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to revoke 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.217(d)(l)-(2). The announcement disclosed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>A major contention of the petitioners is that the point of operation guards or point of operation devices required by 29 CFR 1910.217(c) adequately protect an operator of a mechanical power press from an injury that could result from his hands being placed at the point of operation of the press. Since the guards or devices are designed to prevent either an operator\u2019s hands or fingers from entering the area at the point of operation or the stroking of the press, it is contended that the design and construction requirements for mechanical power presses in 29 CFR 1910.217(d)(1) and (2) would serve the same purpose and provide substantially the same protection. Hence petitioners argue that these provisions require great expenditures without adding significant protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">38 Fed.Reg. 2465(1973). The Secretary invited comments on the proposed action by February 24, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The point made in the petitions for revocation was that ANSI Standard B 11.1-1971 provided for redundant safeguards against the hazard of injury to the operator\u2019s hands during the power stroke of a mechanical press. Section (c)(1), 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.217(c)(l)(i) provided that \u201c[i]t shall be the responsibility of the employer to provide and insure the usage of \u2018point of operation guards\u2019 or properly applied and adjusted point of operation devices on every operation performed on a mechanical power press.\u201d Guards or fixed barriers are intended to prevent the entry of hands or fingers into the point of operation during the power stroke of the press.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Devices are intended to prevent or interrupt the power stroke of the press if the operator\u2019s hands are in the point of operation, or to prevent the operator from placing his hands in the point of operation during the power stroke by requiring that they be elsewhere.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> What the original section (d)(1) required, in addition to mechanical safeguarding, was that the operator\u2019s hands remain outside the die not only during the power stroke cycle of the press but also during the feeding cycle. Thus the effect of section (d)(1) was to prevent hand feeding of any mechanical press. Feeding under standard (d)(1) could be accomplished only by automatic or semiautomatic feeding, or by the use of hand tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">On March 14, 1974 the Secretary gave notice of proposed modifications of the mechanical power press regulations. The notice proposed tightened standards relating to guards and devices,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but also proposed the elimination of the no hands in dies requirement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The notice fixed May 13, 1974 as the date upon which a public hearing on the proposed rulemak-ing would commence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">Thirty-three interested parties appeared and testified at the hearing, including representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, the American Metal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Stamping Association, several large corporate power press users, the UAW and the AFL-CIO. Labor representatives uniformly opposed at this hearing revocation of the no hands in dies standard, as did manufacturers of mechanical power presses. Both groups heavily relied upon statistical evidence to strengthen the case against revocation. Industrial users of power presses uniformly supported the Secretary\u2019s proposed action. In addition to oral testimony the Secretary received over 300 written comments and 90 hearing exhibits. The rulemak-ing proceedings were closed on June 26, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">On December 3, 1974 the Secretary adopted the final power press standard substantially in the form proposed in his March 14, 1974 notice.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Pursuant to \u00a7 6(b)(8) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b)(8), the Secretary published a statement of reasons describing why the rule as adopted would better effectuate the purposes of OSHA than the national consensus standard it supplanted. The significant parts of that statement are quoted in Part II of this opinion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The petitioner seeks review of the December 3, 1974 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">I. SCOPE OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">In <em>Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association v. Brennan, </em>503 F.2d 1155 (3d Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 973, 95 S.Ct. 1396, 43 L.Ed.2d 653 (1975) <em>(Synthetic Organic I), </em>we outlined the five-step process under \u00a7 6(f) that we will follow in reviewing the Secretary\u2019s action in promulgating a permanent safety standard.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The petitioner contends that in this instance the scope of our review is far less circumscribed than under \u00a7 6(f), which provides that \u201cdeterminations of the Secretary shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.\u201d It points to \u00a7 6(b)(8) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b)(8):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-16\">Whenever a rule promulgated by the Secretary differs substantially from an existing national consensus standard, the Secretary shall, at the same time, publish in the Federal Register a statement of the reasons why the rule as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this chapter than the national consensus standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-17\">From this language the petitioner reasons that whenever the Secretary departs from a national consensus standard his rulemaking is deprived of the presumption of validity afforded by \u00a7 6(f), and he must satisfy us, by fact-finding supported by evidence, that the departure from, the consensus will better effectuate the purposes of the Act. Thus we must initially determine whether to review the administrative action by the standards announced in <em>Synthetic Organic I </em>or by a stricter standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-18\">At the outset we note that petitioners\u2019 position with respect to the proper interpretation of \u00a7 6(b)(8) is a two-edged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>sword. In this instance the departure from a national consensus standard involves the elimination of a redundant safety requirement, the retention of which arguably would enhance employee safety. But petitioner\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 6(b)(8) would impose on the Secretary the same burden of proof in those instances where he concluded that it was desirable and feasible to modify an existing national consensus standard by proposing new and more rigorous health and safety requirements. There are literally hundreds of national consensus standards.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Many of these represent only the lowest common denominator of sharply-divided opinion;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> others represent a state of the art which does not take into account emerging developments in the technology of safety, or in the field of health science.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Congress made unmistakably clear its intention that national consensus standards should constantly be upgraded to reflect ad-vanees in science and technology.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Adoption of privately promulgated national consensus standards was viewed as an interim measure, to provide uniform minimum national standards pending plenary action by the Secretary.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">In the context of upgrading national consensus standards \u2014 especially those relating to chemical processing, where we are now only on the frontier of scientific understanding and recognition of the multitude of latent health hazards that exist<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u2014 imposing on the Secretary the burden of proof suggested by petitioners would have major consequences not necessarily consistent with the remedial purpose of OSHA. Experimentation, extrapolation and prognostication may suggest various conclusions, the correctness of which is not likely to be susceptible of easy resolution. Saddling the Secretary with the burden of proving to our satisfaction the scientific superiority of every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>departure from a national consensus standard \u2014 a burden which in many instances he cannot meet \u2014 might well in the long run compromise the cause of safety in the workshop. In <em>Synthetic Organic I </em>we pointed out the difficulty of attempting to measure a legislative policy decision against a merely factual yardstick.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The difficulty remains, as does our lament, whether the standard under review supplants a national consensus standard or is wholly new.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Of course, where Congress has made clear its intention that factual determinations are a condition precedent to rule-making, we have enforced the congressional mandate. For example, \u00a7 6(c)(1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(c)(1), requires that the Secretary, before promulgating an emergency temporary health and safety standard, determine (A) that employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful, and (B) that an emergency standard is necessary to protect them from such danger. In <em>Dry Color Manufacturers\u2019 Association Inc. v. Department of Labor, </em>486 F.2d 98, 102 (3d Cir. 1973) we held that an emergency temporary standard would be set aside unless both findings were made and were supported by substantial evidence. Thus if in \u00a7 6(b)(8) Congress clearly intended to impose on the Secretary a higher burden of proof, or to require of us a more stringent standard of judicial review than would otherwise apply to a safety standard, we would be bound to act accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">But we find no such clear expression of congressional intention. In the first place the language of \u00a7 6(b)(8) speaks in terms of a statement of reasons, not in terms of factual support for those reasons. The language of \u00a7 6(b)(8) is thus more directly related to the generally applicable statement of reasons requirement contained in \u00a7 6(e) than to the generally applicable evidentiary standard requirement of \u00a7 6(f). <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 6(c)(1). We conclude that the purposes of the Act, considered together with the statutory language Congress chose to express that purpose, support the Secretary\u2019s statement of the standard of review applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">We recognize, of course, that ordinary rules of statutory construction may be eclipsed by a clear and unmistakable declaration of intent in the legislative history.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> But we do not believe that petitioner can take great comfort in the legislative history of \u00a7 6(b)(8). In fact, our review of the sparse legislative history of that provision only fortifies our conviction that the Secretary has correctly read the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">S.2193, the bill which ultimately became OSHA, was reported from the Subcommittee on Labor of the Senate Committee on Labor and- Public Welfare without any \u00a7 6(b)(8). This section was added to the bill by way of amendment on November 17, 1970. The sponsor of the amendment was Senator Javits, who had introduced a parallel administration bill, and who had sponsored several other amendments to S.2193. His explanation of the amendment\u2019s purpose is quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Petitioners would have us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>hold that the remarks, and particularly the first paragraph, plainly manifest a congressional intent to require the Secretary to establish that a revised health and safety standard \u201cwill better effectuate the purposes\u201d of OSHA. We believe the key language is contained in the third paragraph: \u201cthis amendment ought to be adopted so that the people will have an explanation of why the Secretary is doing what he is doing.\u201d The purpose of \u00a7 6(b)(8) is to require the Secretary to make particular reference to his reasons for rejecting the consensus standard as well as stating his reasons for adopting his own standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Although \u00a7 6(e) of the Act imposes a general obligation upon the Secretary to state the reasons for any action, he has taken with respect to any health and safety standard,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the scope of \u00a7 6(e) is not necessarily co-extensive with that of \u00a7 6(b)(8). Before he may adopt <em>any </em>standard the Secretary must, under the former provision, state reasons demonstrating that he has given consideration to factors relevant under the statute.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> But if his standard differs substantially from an existing national consensus standard he must go further, and attempt to show as well what reasons there are for the departure. If the reasons for the departure are based in whole or in part on factual matters susceptible of evidentiary development, they must, as in any other case, be supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">We conclude, then, that \u00a7 6(b)(8) is no more than a particularization of the general statement of reasons requirement of \u00a7 6(e), and that whether or not a permanent standard differs substantially from an existing national consensus standard, the Secretary\u2019s promulgation of such a standard is reviewable in the manner outlined in <em>Synthetic Organic I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">II. VALIDITY OF THE REVOCATION OF THE NO HANDS IN DIES STANDARD.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">The Secretary\u2019s statement of reasons for revoking the no hands in dies standard is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>petitioner does not urge that the modification was adopted after inadequate notice, or that the Secretary neglected to consider presently available alternatives.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Petitioner does urge (A) that the reasons set forth by the Secretary are not supported by substantial evidence, (B) that some of the reasons relied on are not relevant under the Act, and (C) that the statement of reasons is generally inadequate to support the action taken. Because <em>Synthetic Organic I </em>establishes this court\u2019s competence to hear objections of this nature to the Secretary\u2019s action, we now turn to the merits of petitioner\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">(A) <em>The substantial evidence contention </em>In addressing this objection we will review the Secretary\u2019s reasons (which we paraphrase) seriatim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">(1) <em>The no hands in dies standard would not prevent employees from actually placing their hands in the point of operation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">According to the record evidence the effectiveness of a no hands in dies standard depends, in large measure, upon the voluntary cooperation of individual employees. Unlike guards or devices, the no hands in dies standard does not actually prevent the press operator from putting his hands in the point of operation. Many power press workers are paid at piece rates, and there is evidence that compliance with the standard will frequently result in a marked decrease in productivity.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The evidence also suggests that the natural human tendency to take short cuts to increase productivity will produce evasion of a no hands in dies regulation. In addition, hands will be placed in the point of operation to clear stuck work or correct a malfunction. This determination by the Secretary is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>(2) <em>Accident statistics are not helpful in determining the effectiveness of \u201cno hands in dies\u201d when compared with appropriate safety devices and guards.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Evidence of the effectiveness of various power press safety plans was of two varieties: (1) written comments and oral testimony, and (2) a 1969 Liberty Mutual Insurance Company Study of 389 power press accidents.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We believe that the record amply supports the Secretary\u2019s position that the written comments and oral testimony were inconclusive on the issue of the relative safety of the no hands in dies standard in comparison with safety devices and guards.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> And although the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company Study does suggest that no hands in dies may provide greater safety than some kinds of safety guards and devices,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> we do not believe this study supports the inference that no hands in dies is likely to provide a greater degree of safety than the Secretary\u2019s revised regulation.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the Secretary\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence. Whether such a comparison is relevant under OSHA is a matter discussed below in Part IIC.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-11\">(3) <em>Safety methods other than no hands in dies provide adequate employee protection at the point of operation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">Comments and testimony of many power press employees suggest that power presses which permit manual feeding \u2014\u201chands in dies\u201d- \u2014 can by guards and safety devices be made virtually accident proof.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The Secretary points out that the proven features of these guards and devices have been incorporated into his final safety standard. Certainly his determination that they are effective is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>supported by substantial evidence. Again, the relevancy of this determination will be discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">(4) <em>\u201cNo hands in dies\u201d will create additional health and safety hazards.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The evidence suggests that the alternatives to hand feeding are automatic or semi-automatic feeding or manual feeding by hand tools. The Secretary found that the use of automated feeding systems would expose operators to another source of injury \u2014 the feeder. There is testimony that some pinch-point accidents at feeding machines could cause amputations (a common result of power press accidents) as well as injuries of a less serious variety. There is evidence, moreover, that manual feeding with hand tools is not highly productive and would often be ignored by piece-rate press operators.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The Secretary\u2019s determination that no hands in dies would expose power press operators to additional safety hazards is supported by substantial evidence. This determination must, of course, be related to finding (3) above that there indeed exists an adequate alternative to such a standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">(5) <em>Universal implementation of the no hands in dies standard is technologically impossible.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">There is evidence that automated feeding is at the present level of technology incompatible with as much as 47% of all power press operations.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Some stock is too large, too small, too bulky or too flimsy for mechanized handling. Other types of stock \u2014 with unusual configurations or special coating and finishing, for example \u2014 simply cannot be accommodated on many power presses now in operation. The use of hand tools appears to be impossible for some very large and very small stock, which may be incompatible with automated feeders as well. Indeed, petitioner does not seriously dispute the substantiality of the evidence supporting this finding. As developed more fully in Part IIB(l) of this opinion, petitioner vigorously disputes that OSHA permits the Secretary in setting standards to take into account considerations of technological feasibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">(6) <em>The economic costs associated with no hands in dies are prohibitive.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">There is abundant evidence that the implementation of the \u201cno hands in dies\u201d standard would be enormously costly in the gigantic metal stamping industry, and would probably result in the elimination of many mechanical power press job shops and a substantial loss of jobs. As with the finding on technological feasibility, petitioner does not seriously dispute the substantiality of this evidence, and principally confines his objection to the finding\u2019s relevance under OSHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">We conclude that each of the Secretary\u2019s reasons for his departure from the no hands in dies standard, whatever its legal merit may be, is supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole. Thus we now address petitioner\u2019s legal challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">\n<em>B. Relevancy of the Secretary\u2019s Reasons</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">Petitioner contends that the Secretary\u2019s reliance on technological and economic infeasibility, even though his findings to that effect are supported by substantial evidence, was impermissible in standard setting proceedings under OSHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">(1) <em>Technological infeasibility</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-16\">Acknowledging that for many applications the no hands in dies standard is technologically infeasible, and that the result of its universal application will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>the elimination of some businesses and some jobs, petitioner urges that this is exactly the result the Congress sought to accomplish. Neither this court nor, so far as our research discloses any other court, has construed OSHA in so Procrustean a fashion. Undoubtedly the most certain way to eliminate industrial hazards is to eliminate industry. But the congressional statement of findings and declaration of purpose and policy in \u00a7 2 of the Act shows that the upgrading of working conditions, not the complete elimination of hazardous occupations, was the dominant intention.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In an enforcement context we have noted that while Congress in enacting OSHA intended to reduce the number of workplace injuries, it did not intend to impose strict liability on employers for unavoidable occupational hazards. <em>Brennan v. OSHRC, </em>502 F.2d 946, 951 (3d Cir. 1974). We do not question that there are industrial activities involving hazards so great and of such little social utility that the Secretary would be justified in concluding that their total prohibition is proper if there is no technologically feasible method of eliminating the operational hazard. But although Congress gave the Secretary license to make such a determination in specific instances, it did not direct him to do so in every instance where total elimination of risk is beyond the reach of present technology. Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, dealing with standards for toxic materials, explicitly confines the Secretary\u2019s rulemaking authority within technologically feasible boundaries.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> <em>See Society of Plastics Industry, Inc. v. OSHA, </em>509 F.2d 1301, 1308 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 992, 95 S.Ct. 1988, 44 L.Ed.2d 482 (1975). If the Secretary may consider technological feasibility with respect to the elimination of hazards from toxic materials, then a fortiori he must be permitted to do so with respect to other hazards under the more general language of \u00a7 6(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\"> Although we hold that the Secretary may, consistent with the statute, consider the technological feasibility of a proposed occupational health and safety standard promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 6(a), we agree with the Second Circuit in <em>Society of Plastics Industry, Inc. v. OSHA, supra, </em>that, at least to a limited extent, OSHA is to be viewed as a technology-forcing piece of legislation.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Thus the Secretary would not be justified in dismissing an alternative to a proposed health and safety standard as infeasible when the necessary technology looms on today\u2019s horizon. Nevertheless, we are satisfied that the Secretary in this case</p>\n<p id=\"ASGe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>has placed this factor in its proper perspective. The Secretary found, and we believe there is substantial evidence to support such a finding, that compliance with no hands in dies is not technologically feasible in the \u201cnear future.\u201d This finding necessarily implies consideration both of existing technological capabilities and imminent advances in the art. We do not believe that the Act imposes any heavier obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">(2) <em>Economic infeasibility</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">This court has not yet considered whether OSHA permits the Secretary, in adopting standards, to take into account the likely economic impact of those standards. The text of the statute does not address the point specifically, and the legislative history is at best cloudy. In <em>Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO v. Hodgson, </em>162 U.S.App.D.C. 331, 499 F.2d 467 (1974), Judge McGowan addresses the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">There can be no question that OSHA represents a decision to require safeguards for the health of employees even if such measures substantially increase production costs. This is not, however, the same thing as saying that Congress intended to require immediate implementation of all protective measures technologically achievable without regard for their economic impact. To the contrary, it would comport with common usage to say that a standard that is prohibitively expensive is not \u201cfeasible\u201d. Senator Javits, author of the amendment that added the phrase in question to the Act, explained it in these terms:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">As a result of this amendment the Secretary, in setting standards, is expressly required to consider feasibility of proposed standards. This is an improvement over the Daniels bill, which might be interpreted to require absolute health and safety in all cases, regardless of feasibility, and the Administration bill, which</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">contains no criteria for standards at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">S.Rep.No.91-1282, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., at 58; Legis.Hist. at 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">The thrust of these remarks would seem to be that practical considerations can temper protective requirements. Congress does not appear to have intended to protect employees by putting their employers out of business \u2014 either by requiring protective devices unavailable under existing technology or by making financial viability generally impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">This qualification is not intended to provide a route by which recalcitrant employers or industries may avoid the reforms contemplated by the Act. Standards may be economically feasible even though, from the standpoint of employers, they are financially burdensome and affect profit margins adversely. Nor does the concept of economic feasibility necessarily guarantee the continued existence of individual employers. It would appear to be consistent with the purposes of the Act to envisage the economic demise of an employer who has lagged behind the rest of the industry in protecting the health and safety of employees and is consequently financially unable to comply with new standards as quickly as other employers. As the effect becomes more widespread within an industry, the problem of economic feasibility becomes more pressing. For example, if the standard requires changes that only a few leading firms could quickly achieve, delay might be necessary to avoid increasing the concentration of that industry. Similarly, if the competitive structure or posture of the industry would be, otherwise adversely affected \u2014 perhaps rendered unable to compete with imports or with substitute products \u2014 the Secretary could properly consider that factor. These tentative examples are offered not to illustrate concrete instances of economic unfeasibility but rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>to suggest the complex elements that may be relevant to such a determination.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 477 \u2014 78 (some footnotes omitted). Judge McGowan has, we believe, arrived at a proper construction of the statute. Congress did contemplate that the Secretary\u2019s rulemaking would put out of business some businesses so marginally efficient or productive as to be unable to follow standards otherwise universally feasible.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> But we will not impute to congressional silence a direction to the Secretary to disregard the possibility of massive economic dislocation caused by an unreasonable standard. An economically impossible standard would in all likelihood prove unenforceable, inducing employers faced with going out of business to evade rather than comply with the regulation. The Act does vest the Secretary with authority to enforce his regulations ,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> but the burden of enforcing a regulation uniformly ignored by a majority of industry members would prove overwhelming. We therefore conclude that the Secretary may in the weighing process consider the economic consequences of his quasi-legislative standard-setting. We reject the petitioner\u2019s contrary contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">\n<em>C. Adequacy of the Statement of Reasons</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">Although the statement of reasons quoted in note 26 <em>supra </em>in most respects satisfies the requirements of <em>Synthetic Organic I, </em>in this instance, because the Secretary\u2019s standard substantially differs from a national consensus standard, we have indicated that \u00a7 6(b)(8) imposes a specific additional requirement. The Secretary must disclose the reasons why his rule will better effectuate the purposes of the Act. We have found that the six reasons listed by him are supported by substantial evidence. We do not, however, find that they adequately disclose why his rule will better effectuate OSHA\u2019s purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">What the Secretary has done in setting forth his reasons is to assume, contrary to the text of ANSI Standard B 11.1 \u2014 1971, that no hands in dies on the one hand and guards and devices on the other are alternative rather than cumulative approaches to the elimination of point of operation injuries. Thus while it may be true that no hands in dies alone will not prevent employees from placing their hands in the point of operation, it is not true that coupled with guards or devices the standard would not eliminate the practice. Simi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>larly, while it may be true that a statistical comparison of no hands in dies operations with operations guarded by approved guards and devices produces inconclusive results, the comparison is hardly relevant to a standard involving redundant safeguards. Certainly the finding that guards and devices provide effective protection is relevant, as is the finding that use of automatic or semi-automatic feeders introduces additional hazards. But what is lacking, since the Secretary seems to have taken an \u201ceither-or\u201d approach, is any comparison of the net safety effect of a redundant requirement. It may well be that the pinch-point hazards of automatic feeders is slight in comparison with the safety gains from no hands in dies operation. There is, however, no finding to this effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The same \u201ceither-or\u201d defect appears with respect to the Secretary\u2019s discussion of technological and economic feasibility. Granted that <em>universal </em>application of the no hands in dies standard is not technologically or economically feasible, it does not follow that a <em>universal </em>departure from the national consensus standard would better effectuate the purposes of OSHA. Certainly the record suggests that there are many mechanical power press applications in which the no hands in dies standard will be both technologically and economically feasible. Nowhere does the Secretary discuss the reason why a partial departure from the national consensus standard would be inappropriate. Nowhere does he discuss the possibility of utilizing the variance procedures of \u00a7 6(b)(6), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b)(6) for relief in specific instances of infeasibility. There may be adequate reasons for rejecting either approach, but we do not know them. Unless they are disclosed we cannot properly perform our reviewing function.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">We conclude that the Secretary\u2019s statement of reasons does not adequately disclose why the rule he adopted will better effectuate the purposes of OSHA than would the national consensus standard which it supplants. The cause will be remanded to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the Department of Labor for the preparation of a more complete statement of reasons in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-10\">. \u00a7 3(9) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 652(9), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">\u201cFor the purpose of this chapter\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-12\">(9) the term \u2018national consensus standard\u2019 means any occupational safety and health standard or modification thereof which (1) has been adopted and promulgated by a nationally recognized standards-producing organization under procedures whereby it can be determined by the Secretary that persons interested and affected by the scope or provisions of the standard have reached substantial agreement on its adoption, (2) was formulated in a manner which afforded an opportunity for diverse views to be considered and (3) has been designated as such a standard by the Secretary, after consultation with other appropriate Federal agencies.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b181-15\">.

It is further estimated that over a 30-year period 1 in every 5 power press operators will suffer a debilitating injury, often amputation of a hand or a portion of a hand. <em>See </em>letter from National Machine Tool Builders Association to OSHA, Pet.App. at 199.

Prior to adoption of the no hands in dies standard, the ANSI had last updated the power press safety code in 1960. Work on a revision began in 1965 and culminated in the near-unanimous approval of the B 11.1 standard in February, 1971. (Pet.App. at 415). Preliminary work on the new standard antedated OSHA, and its approval was nearly contemporaneous with the Act\u2019s passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-16\">In 1973, pursuant to a request from the Secretary of Labor, ANSI\u2019s B 11 committee agreed to reconsider its no hands in dies standard. Several drafts have been prepared but presently the committee is in a position where it can neither obtain consensus on a revision nor reaffirm the no hands in dies standard. As the intervenor observes, \u201c[t]oday the [national consensus] standard is with us; only the con-census [sic] is missing.\u201d Brief of Chamber of Commerce of the United States and American Metal Stamping Association at 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-17\">The intervenors argue that because the no hands in dies standard is no longer supported by a consensus, revocation by the Secretary is appropriate. But the B 11.1 standard remains as the last statement of ANSI, so the procedural formalities outlined in \u00a7 6(b)(8) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b)(8), must be observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-18\">Furthermore, \u00a7 6(f), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(f), requires that a petition to review a new standard be filed within 60 days of promulgation. A petition for review would have been the appropriate vehicle for challenging the claimed consensus for any national standard. Since no timely petition was filed in this case, we are foreclosed from considering the issue on this appeal. <em>See Associated Indus, v.

Initially, it should be noted that the current \u00a7 1910.217(d)(1) would merely require the employer to institute die procurement, construction and modification policies and procedures to eliminate the need for employees to place their hands or fingers in the point of operation. This requirement would not have prohibited or prevented employees from actually placing their hands in the point of operation. Indeed, point of operation injuries occur where \u201cno hands in dies\u201d is in effect (Tr. 513, 669-70, Exhibits 83-85).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-17\">The accident statistics are not helpful in determining the effectiveness of \u201cno hands in dies\u201d when compared with appropriate safety devices or guards. At most, the Liberty Mutual Statistics seem to suggest that appropriate guards or devices were not required by law when those accidents occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-18\">Moreover, many employers have shown that methods other than \u201cno hands in dies\u201d provide adequate safety at the point of operation (see e. g. Tr. 85, 119, 151, 295, Ex. 56). Most of these \u201chands in dies\u201d safety devices have been incorporated into the final rule, and will be discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>In addition to the potential for point of operation injuries which exists even with \u201cno hands in dies,\u201d additional hazards are created in \u201cno hands in dies\u201d operations. Thus, serious additional pinch points are created by feeding apparatus (see e.g. Tr. 201-5, 318, 513). And, for example, where feeding robots are used, employees may be exposed to additional hazards (Tr. 510).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Technologically, \u201cno hands in dies\u201d does not appear to be universally possible in the near future. Several employers indicated that they have tried to implement \u201cno hands in dies\u201d operations in their plants, and while some success has been achieved, they have been unable to attain \u201cno hands in dies\u201d in certain operations (Tr. 171, 489). A manufacturer also indicated that he has conducted surveys at the requests of employers to determine the feasibility of \u201cno hands in dies\u201d in their plants, and in many instances has concluded that technology does not permit this type of operation (Tr. 416, 480). Therefore, it clearly appears that a universal requirement of \u201cno hands in dies\u201d would be infeasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">We also believe that the costs associated with attaining \u201cno hands in dies\u201d are prohibitive. The record evidence contains the following estimated costs: press modification \u2014$1,500-$35,000 per press (Tr. 58, 89, 412, 546); loading and unloading equipment\u2014 10-15 percent of the cost of the press (Tr. 264); modification of existing tools and dies, where feasible \u2014 $180 per die (Tr. 120); new dies \u2014 12-25 percent over the cost of hand fed dies (Tr. 77). Moreover a significant number of presses, tools and dies may become obsolete. And the additional space demands resulting from automated or semi-automated feeding and part removal devices\u2014 in some cases as much as 20 percent (Tr. 273) \u2014 may require employers to reduce the number of operational presses or acquire additional space. Finally, the engineering costs of designing and instituting \u201cno hands in dies\u201d are also substantial (Exh. 63).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">It has further been suggested, and we agree that the costs of instituting \u201cno hands in dies\u201d would make many short production runs economically infeasible (Tr. 56, 61, 130, 503). It appears that some production lines would be discontinued if \u201cno hands in dies\u201d were required because the additional overhead costs would, in some instances, be prohibitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">For the above reasons, we have revoked the requirement of \u201cno hands in dies\u201d. 39 Fed.Reg. 41842-43 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b188-15\">.

Some industrial users of mechanical power presses reported outstanding safety records with machines equipped with safety guards and devices. Honeywell reported that in 12 years it had operated 2 million hand-fed machine hours without a point of operation injury. (Pet.App. at 182). Organization Resources Counselors commented that its members suffered one accident in 20 years and 3.88 million hours of operation. <em>(Id. </em>at 217).

The Liberty Mutual Insurance Company Study involved an examination of the causes of 389 non-random power press accidents.

Because the Secretary\u2019s revised regulation upgrades device and guarding requirements, <em>see </em>note 9, <em>supra, we </em>cannot say that the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company Study is inconsistent with the Secretary\u2019s position. For example, 25 of the 389 injuries examined in the Study occurred on machines equipped with sweep devices. <em>See </em>Hart, \u201cPower Press Accidents \u2014 A Management Problem,\u201d Metal Stamping, July, 1969, at 17.

International Harvester Co. v. Ruckelshaus, 155 U.S. App.D.C. 411, 478 F.2d 615 (1973), illustrates some of these problems in the context of the automobile emissions standards of the Clean Air Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857 et seq. In the highly concentrated automobile industry the court deemed it likely that, by virtue of their size and importance to the economy, any one of the three major companies could obtain a relaxation of the automobile emissions standards if it could not meet them. If this occurred after other manufacturers had prepared to comply with the standard, the technological \u2022 laggard would enjoy a competitive advantage because installation of the control devices renders the vehicles less efficient to operate. This circumstance justified insuring that the standards could be met by all major producers before they became effective.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b193-7\">. Although many employers in all industries have demonstrated an exemplary degree of concern for health and safety in the workplace, their efforts are too often undercut by those who are not so concerned. Moreover, the fact is that many employers \u2014 particularly smaller ones \u2014 simply cannot make the necessary investment in health and safety, and survive competitively, unless all are compelled to do so. The competitive disadvantage of the more conscientious employer is especially evident where there is a long period between exposure to a hazard and manifestation of an illness. In such instances a particular employer has no economic incentive to invest in current precautions, not even in the reduction of workmen\u2019s compensation costs, because he will seldom have to pay for the consequences of his own neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">S.Rep.No.91-1282, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., 1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 5180.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b193-14\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 659.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
