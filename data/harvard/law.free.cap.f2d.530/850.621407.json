Sherman Christensen, Senior United States District Judge, District of Utah, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b921-11\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">This appeal presents the question whether the United States may recover from an insurer of a serviceman, under a medical payments provision of the policy, for medical treatment rendered in a military hospital after an automobile accident. We affirm the district court which granted summary judgment for the government. The order of the district court sets forth the facts, issues and policy provisions and we need not repeat them here. <em>United States v. California State Automobile Ass\u2019n, </em>385 F.Supp. 669, 670-1 (E.D.Cal.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-16\">In considering whether the United States is an \u201cinsured\u201d within the meaning of the policy, we look first to clause (3) of the \u201cPERSONS INSURED\u201d portion of PART I of the policy (quoted 385 F.Supp. at 671).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-17\">The government certainly is an \u201corganization.\u201d Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary 898 (3rd ed. 1969). It incurred \u201cliability\u201d under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1074 and 6203 to provide medical care to its Navy enlisted men, Meyer and Lovato. Had it not been for the \u201cacts and omissions\u201d of Meyer, the named insured, the statutory liability of the government would not have arisen.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-18\">Since the United States is an \u201corganization [which incurred] . . liability because of acts or omissions of an insured [Meyer],\u201d it is without question an \u201cinsured\u201d as that term is defined in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-20\">We agree with the district court, 385 F.Supp. at 671, that the policy draws a sharp distinction between \u201cnamed insured\u201d and \u201cinsured.\u201d While the government is not a \u201cnamed insured,\u201d clearly it is an \u201cinsured.\u201d Since the insurer was obligated to pay for \u201cexpenses incurred by the insured,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment was properly granted, there being no issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-21\">We need not consider whether the district court correctly ruled alternatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>that the United States was entitled to coverage as a third party beneficiary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"azq-dedup-1\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b921-14\">. The insurer argues that the government has incurred no \u201cexpense\u201d since it has not paid money to the injured parties for medical services. However, we are persuaded that \u201cexpense\u201d has been incurred whether it be in the form of cash or, as here, services rendered. See, <em>e.g., United States v. Government Employees Insurance Co., </em>461 F.2d 58 (4th Cir. 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b922-12\">. In <em>United States v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>499 F.2d 1355, 1358-59 (9th Cir. 1974), a divided panel of this court remanded for the purpose of ascertaining whether the United States was an \u201cintended\u201d third party beneficiary under the policy at issue. In the instant case, the plain language of the policy protects the United States as an \u201cinsured.\u201d There is in this case no need to consider whether it was \u201cintended\u201d that the United States be a third party beneficiary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
