East, Senior United States District Judge for the District of Oregon, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b898-15\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b898-17\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b898-18\">We affirm the conviction of petitioner Ronald Lee Harper for possession and dispensing of cocaine, rejecting his sole contention on appeal that the classification of cocaine as a Schedule II narcotic drug under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c) is arbitrary and irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-22\">Numerous district courts have recently dealt with this argument. <em>United States v. Amidzich, </em>396 F.Supp. 1140, 1147 (E. D.Wis.1975); <em>United States v. Hobbs, </em>392 F.Supp. 444, 446 (D.Mass.1975); <em>United States v. DiLaura, </em>394 F.Supp. 770, 773 (D.Mass.1974); <em>United States v. Brookins, </em>383 F.Supp. 1212, 1217 (D.N.J. 1974). In all cases, the courts expressed the opinion that Congress had acted upon a constitutionally \u201crational basis\u201d according to the test of <em>United States v. Carolene Products Co., </em>304 U.S. 144, 153-4, 58 S.Ct. 778, 784, 82 L.Ed. 1234, 1242 (1938), in so classifying cocaine for the purpose of imposing penalties. <em>See also United States v. Smaldone, </em>484 F.2d 311, 319-20 (10th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 915, 94 S.Ct. 1411, 39 L.Ed.2d 469 (1974) and <em>United States v. Miller, </em>387 F.Supp. 1097, 1098 (D.Conn.1975), where slightly different reasoning nonetheless led the courts to the same conclusion that Congress had not acted arbitrarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-23\">Petitioner\u2019s reliance upon the district court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Castro, </em>401 F.Supp. 120 (N.D.Ill.1975), is misplaced. The court found no fundamental right of defendant involved<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and therefore reasoned that the \u201crational basis\u201d test of <em>Carolene, supra, </em>must be applied. The court then cited the language of <em>Brookins, supra, </em>observing that continuing medical debate, potential for societal harm, and general uncertainty as to whether Congress classified cocaine on more of a penal or medical basis, were grounds that could constitute the required rational basis for sustaining the statute. Although sympathetic to the argument that cocaine was misclassified as a narcotic, the court concluded that the consideration of any unresolved questions was better left to Congress and the Attorney General. We agree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-24\">. <em>See Duffy v. Wells, </em>201 F.2d 503 (9th Cir. 1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
